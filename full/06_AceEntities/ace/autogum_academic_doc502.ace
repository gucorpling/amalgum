It is now increasingly consumed in Western countries for its presumed protective effects against diabetes , atherosclerosis , inflammation , and hypertriglyceridemia , as well as its putative role as a galactologue due , in part , to trigonelline , one of its main active ingredients .

True insufficient milk secretion can result from many causes , ranging from inability to lactate due to breast abnormalities or endocrine disorder ( 5 % of women ) to difficulties in breastfeeding management , maternal stress and anxiety , or early food diversification in the infant .
