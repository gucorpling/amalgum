One of the challenges here is that large scale CVD growth of carbon nanotubes from fixed substrates is hampered by the cost of substrate preparation in addition to limitations of single surface batch processing as it comes to scaling up the process .

CVD synthesis of CNTs began with directed growth on substrates but has since evolved to include floating-catalyst growth that is substrate-free , especially as it comes to more commercial-scale production utilizing a larger reaction volume .
