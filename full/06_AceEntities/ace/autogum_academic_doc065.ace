When the pre-adipocyte is induced with a chemical cocktail containing MDI ( 1-Methyl-3-isobutylxanthine , Dexamethasone , and Insulin ) , the cell witnesses morphological and metabolic changes and is finally transformed into mature adipocyte .

In a previous study from our laboratory , we reported the progressive activation of the Foxo1 gene during the course of differentiation , to reach the highest expression in the mature adipocytes .

A recent study suggested that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ( PPARG ) regulates autophagy through NEDD4 E3 ubiquitin protein ligase ( NEDD4 ) gene expression in thiazolidinediones-treated HepG2 cells .

Autophagy contributes to the adipocyte differentiation by reorganizing the intracellular components , forming the fat droplets and/or providing the energy source for the development of the phenotype .

For example , the transcription factor CCAAT enhancer-binding protein beta ( CEBPB ) controls the expression of the autophagy-related 4b cysteine peptidase ( Atg4b ) .

Then , we studied the direct regulatory links between the adipogenic transcription factors and key autophagy genes as well as specific autophagy transcription factors .

We hypothesize that the autophagy process may be regulated by the same adipogenic factors either directly or indirectly through specific autophagy transcription factors .

We were able to quantify the changes in the global expression of autophagy genes as the pre-adipocytes progressed toward the maturation stage .

To investigate this hypothesis , we modeled the gene expression and transcription factors and co-factors binding at different stages of adipocyte maturation (

Therefore , the knockdown of essential autophagy genes prevents the adipocyte differentiation and intervenes in the lipid accumulation within adipogenic cells .
