At the end of the intervention , approximately 55 % of students were exercising at the desired intensity , thereby accumulating 20 min of health-enhancing PA per day in the classroom . This 27 % increase in student MVPA was similar to that found by Althoff et al. , who demonstrated a 26 % increase in daily step counts following the use of the Pokémon Go™ app over a period of 30 days .

In the Beat the Street intervention , Coombes et al. examined the use of gamification on active transport to school in children aged 8 – 10 years by providing rewards such as supplying the school with books . Coombes et al. demonstrated that total MVPA increased during active transport by approximately 3.5 min in children who engaged in the intervention at least 15 out of 63 days .

Another possible reason for the smaller improvements noted in third- and fifth-grade classrooms may relate to the type of rewards provided . Cugelman et al. suggests that the type of rewards offered during an intervention is an important motivating factor for behavior change because the reward may or may not be of value to the community or individual participants .

As such , the rewards offered during InPACT ( i. e. , placing a series of stickers on their class trophy in order to win a field day ) may not have appealed as motivational factors to students in third- and fifth-grade classrooms .

In addition , other factors that may have contributed to a lack of motivation in these classrooms include : potential differences in social connectedness , perceptions of fun , and capacity to overcome challenges , all of which can affect student motivation .

Specifically , goal-setting theory was used to gamify InPACT by setting attainable classroom goals , providing weekly feedback on student progress toward meeting the goal , and establishing an end-of-study reward to motivate behavior change towards increased PA levels .

For example , Verstraete et al. provided game equipment during recess and demonstrated a significant increase in MVPA ( from 48 % to 61 % ) in the intervention group , while activity levels decreased in the control group .

Future research should seek to determine the independent effect of each game design element ( goal setting , feedback , and rewards ) in motivating behavior change toward increased PA participation at the desired intensity among children .

Given the higher baseline participation in these classrooms , students may have benefited from a more challenging goal to motivate an increase in MVPA participation .
