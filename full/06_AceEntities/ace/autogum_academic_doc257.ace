Therefore , to deploy latency-sensitive and resource-intensive mobile services at network edge , one of the vital yet essential issues is to plan the cloudlets , including where to permanently place the cloudlets , what is the service region of each cloudlet , and how many physical resources should be assigned to each cloudlet considering the ISPs ’ cost and performance requirements by mobile users .

It is not a trivial problem to balance the service performance and the infrastructure providers ’ ( ISP ) costs while additionally considering user mobility , cloudlets ’ coverage , and the large scale of Wireless Metropolitan Area Network ( WMAN ) .

By pushing computation tasks and data to small-sized cloudlets near mobile users , MEC reduces the transmission delay , alleviates the congestion in the network core , and saves the communication cost compared with remote cloud data centers .

However , moving from the network edge to remote cloud data centers via wide area networks ( WAN ) results in prohibitively high transmission latency and monetary cost , which is nontrivial especially for latency-sensitive applications .

In particular , with the proliferation of artificial intelligence ( AI ) supported smart applications , mobile and IoT devices face big challenges due to their limited computational capacities , as well as constrained power .

As an essential component in the MEC paradigm , a cloudlet , which consists of trusted computers with rich resources , serves the last mile of the Internet as a complement to centralized remote clouds .

Based on a report from Cisco , it is predicted that around 850 ZB data will be generated at the network edge by 2021 , which significantly exceeds the traffic in global data centers .

However , most existing studies are limited to improving the Quality of Service ( QoS ) of mobile applications or services by properly offloading tasks to physically deployed cloudlets , e. g. , .

In our previous work , we noticed the impact of the cloudlet planning and started with an initial step of carefully partitioning the entire WMAN into disjoint service regions .

Besides handling tremendous data , popular mobile applications and services , e. g. , video surveillance , interactive gaming , and voice assistants , require intensive computational resources .

Furthermore , to cope with user mobility , service migration has to be performed when a mobile user moves from the service region of one cloudlet to another .

To fulfill the requirements of latency-sensitive and resource-intensive applications , the novel paradigm Multi-access Edge Computing ( MEC ) is proposed and promptly ascends to the spotlight .

One of the conventional ways to deal with this issue is to offload the computation-intensive work and service data from mobile devices to remote cloud data centers .

Therefore , in the proposed solution , we only suggested the way to determine the service regions without the planning of cloudlets ’ physical placement and capacities .

Despite the benefits of sinking the data and computation to the network edge , new concerns on the placement and capacity planning of cloudlets have risen .

Obviously , the computational resources that could be assigned to each task or virtual service are bounded by the maximum available physical resources in each cloudlet .
