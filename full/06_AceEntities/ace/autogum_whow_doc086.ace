Many cars will shift on their own rather than go to a too-high RPM and break something or go to a too-low RPM and stall , but unless you have confirmed that yours will , watch ( and when you 're accustomed , listen for ) the RPM and shift accordingly .

Shift down when you are decelerating and get to low RPM , ~1500 or so , by tapping the shifter in the other direction . ( An auto stick transmission normally does not need to be put in neutral , just first , when stopped . )

Step on the gas and reach desired RPM ( ~3500 or so for general use ; higher , toward but not past the red line for high performance in appropriate conditions , not when learning ) before shifting .

since transmission shifts are more noticeable you can usually just listen to the car and when it reaches the peak RPM you 'll be able to hear , that 's the best time to shift .

No two cars drive the same , each car has it 's own optimal RPM get a feel for it before you start stomping the gas .

An auto shift transmission is nice for driving in mountains because it is so easy to downshift for engine braking .

Shift up either hitting the shifter to the right , or hitting it up ( depends on the vehicle ) .

most of the time you 're going to want to shift at 3000 RPM to avoid stress on the cars transmission

for an ideal shift you 're going to want 4000 RPM or even higher if you 're racing
