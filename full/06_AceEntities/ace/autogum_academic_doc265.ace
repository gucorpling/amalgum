In HFSP , several assumptions are usually made as follows : first , once a workpiece starts to be worked , it cannot be interrupted ; second , a machine can only process one workpiece at a time ; third , a workpiece can only be processed on one machine at a time ; fourth , workpieces can be machined on any machine at each stage ; fifth , there is unlimited storage capacity between any two stages ( i. e. , a workpiece can wait for any time between the two processes ) .

The standard mathematical model of HFSP is as follows : ( 1 ) ( 2 ) where if workpiece is worked at stage , machine , else ( 3 ) ( 4 ) ( 5 ) ( 6 ) if workpiece is the first one machined at stage , machine and without interruption . ( 7 ) if workpiece is worked at stage , machine .

Knowing the processing time in each stage of the workpiece on each machine , the purpose of HFSP is to determine the distribution of each workpiece on the machines at each stage to minimize the maximum completion time for the former .
