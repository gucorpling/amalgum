The effects of inflammation on skeletal muscle is also related to the effects of inflammatory mediators on muscle protein metabolism ( muscle protein breakdown and synthesis ) ; however , way in which the inflammatory factors can induce muscle wasting and the extent to which they do so remains a largely unexplored area of research in aging .

The function of immune cells have been investigated in obesity , however some studies suggest that the pro-inflammatory microenvironment of aged murine adipose tissue , characterized by TNF-α , IFN-γ , IL-6 and prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) release , could promote NFκB activation consequently modulate dendritic cell function , also can activate neutrophils .

Taken together , the chronic inflammatory environment promoted by aging can contribute to adipose tissue and skeletal muscle dysfunction and consequently leads to a feedback loop that perpetuates adipose inflammation and redistribution , impairs progenitor cell differentiation and leads to cellular dysfunction and death of adipocytes and neighboring cells such as skeletal muscle cells .

Adipose tissue inflammation results in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α , IL-1b , IL-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein ( MCP-1/CCL2 ) from adipose tissue macrophages , and these factors are also associated to the presence of senescent cells ( p16INK4A ) leading to immunosenescence .

Besides macrophages , dysfunctional adipose tissue can exacerbate immunosenescence by promoting activation and differentiation of immune cells such as B cells ( B lymphocytes ) , nautral killer ( NK ) lymphocytes , regulatory T cells , neutrophils , eosinophils , mast cells , dendritic cells .

The macrophage infiltration is perpetuated by a reduction in the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 5B ( COX5B ) component of complex IV within adipocytes , which inhibits lipolytic signaling and free-fatty acid mobilization and increases intracellular lipid storage .

The stimulus for age-associated macrophage pro-inflammatory polarization can be associated with endoplasmic reticulum stress , which promotes a pro-inflammatory environment due to the release of IL-6 , MCP-1 , and TNF-α cytokines within adipose tissue .
