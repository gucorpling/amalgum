The study was articulated with the aim of analyzing the response of nSMase in samples in which rMnSOD has a protective effect ( non-pretreated samples ) and in samples in which rMnSOD has a preventive effect ( pretreated samples ) .

At this moment we can only speculate why nSMase levels are reduced with pretreatment , a possible explanation being that an extended treatment time could stimulate different metabolic patterns , leading to inhibition of nSMase gene expression .

Merging already published data with our findings , it is possible to suggest that in brain tissues exposed to radiation , significant amounts of ROS are generated , stimulating nSMase production to significantly increase MnSOD levels .

In samples for preventive effect study , nSMase gene and protein expression is reduced in comparison with the samples in which the protective effect of rMnSOD is studied but the enzyme activity is much higher .

Mice were exposed to a set of minor γ radiation and neutrons and a spectrum of neutrons , simulating the radiation levels to which cosmonauts will be exposed during deep-space , long-term missions .

This observation is relevant , as nSMase plays a crucial role in the regulation of ROS generation and in the maintenance of homeostasis between proapoptotic and prosurvival signals .

Although the present results indicate that nSMase may be required for the action of rMnSOD , we cannot prove the direct action of rMnSOD on this enzyme .

Although many studies elucidated the radioprotective role of rMnSOD through antioxidant mechanisms in mitochondria , no data exist about its effect on nSMase .

In line with this , we show that highest radiation levels induce significant nSMase responses only in the presence of rMnSOD .
