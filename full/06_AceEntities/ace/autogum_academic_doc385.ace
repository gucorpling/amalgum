Additional reasons include the following : On the one hand , the state-level upgrade is a strategic arrangement for optimizing the spatial layout of HIDZ , and it will help to speed up the development of cities with weaker growth ( e. g. , some resource-based cities , western cities , and other poor or border cities ) , thus promotes coordinated regional development .

Therefore , evaluating the policy effect of the upgraded state-level HIDZ from the perspective of urban innovation efficiency , the paper not only fills a gap left by previous studies which have focused mostly on the total or originally established state-level HIDZ , but also evaluates the state-level upgrade policy more accurately , thus providing more effective support for policy adjustment or optimization .

Based on the panel data of Chinese prefecture-level cities from 2007 to 2015 , taking the large-scale state-level upgrade of HIDZ in 2010 as a quasi-natural experiment , the paper uses the PSM-DID method to examine the impact of the upgraded state-level HIDZ on urban innovation efficiency and its dynamic effect .

On the other hand , for the province-level HIDZ who intends to apply for state-level upgrade in China , except for the economic performance and development potential , the scientific research level of the local higher education institutions should also be included in the evaluation criterion of the upgrade qualification .

On the one hand , for the existing upgraded state-level HIDZ , in addition to taking better advantage of the state-level identity based on their own characteristics , local governments should also pay attention to the cultivation of scientific research capabilities of higher education institutions in their cities .

Thus , in order to upgrade the province-level HIDZ , the local governments would be motivated to raise the scientific research level of higher education institutions in the cities , and this will help to achieve a virtuous cycle of regional innovation and development .

After the upgrade , the upgraded state-level HIDZ will be spurred to grasp huge opportunities as they ensue , making good use of the latecomer ’s advantages to fulfill the mission of leading innovation and promoting balanced development .

Second , the scientific research level of the higher education institutions in the cities should be considered in the development of the upgraded state-level HIDZ , as well as the qualification assessment of the province-level HIDZ to upgrade .

The conclusions are as follows : First , the upgraded state-level HIDZ has significantly promoted the urban innovation efficiency , the positive effect gradually being strengthened with the implementation of the state-level upgrade policy .

Finally , as elaborated in the report of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China , it is necessary to build a coordinated pattern of regional development based on city clusters .

Although the performance of the upgraded state-level HIDZ is weaker than the born ones due to many developmental challenges , their policy effect on urban innovation efficiency is a significant positive .

First , this paper ’s focus is on the state-level upgrade of HIDZ in 2010 , while there are more than 100 HIDZ that were upgraded in batches since 2009 .

Second , due to the problem of data availability , the paper does not conduct empirical examination on the mechanism of how the upgraded state-level HIDZ affects urban innovation efficiency .

In this way , the innovative factors such as talents and achievements in scientific research will be continuously prepared for the upgraded state-level HIDZ to boost their real upgrade .

Future research can further expand the sample to evaluate the policy effect comprehensively based on the data from all of the upgraded state-level HIDZ in China .

Second , the higher the scientific research level of higher education institutions in the cities , the greater the positive policy effect of upgraded state-level HIDZ .
