The recent surge of next generation sequencing of tumor genomes by large multicenter projects , such as The Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA ) and the International Cancer Genome Consortium ( ICGC ) , have generated comprehensive catalogues of somatic mutations associated with TNBC .

Triple-negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) is a heterogeneous disease , characterized by aggressive clinical behavior , poor prognosis , a significantly increased risk of relapse , and shorter survival rates than patients affected by other molecular subtypes of breast cancer .

However , to date , information on germline , somatic and gene expression variation has not been leveraged and integrated with DNA methylation data to map the interplay between genetic and epigenetic variation in TNBC .

The objective of this investigation is to deconvolute the genomic and epigenomic interaction landscape , and to discover and characterize the molecular networks and signaling pathways perturbed by these interactions in TNBC .

We addressed these hypotheses by integrating information on germline variation from GWAS with information on somatic and epigenomic variation from TCGA using gene expression as the intermediated phenotype .

We further hypothesized that these complex arrays of interacting genomic and epigenomic factors affect entire molecular networks and signaling pathways which , in turn , drive TNBC .

Moreover , because DNA methylation regulates gene expression , aberrant methylated genes could serve as complementary diagnostic tools , prognostic markers and predictors of response to treatment .

This limited progress must be balanced against the recognition that genomic and epigenomic alterations have long been considered as two separate molecular mechanisms participating in TNBC pathogenesis .

However , although genes may play a strong role , molecular epidemiology studies suggest that TNBC risk is largely determined by interactions between genes and environment .
