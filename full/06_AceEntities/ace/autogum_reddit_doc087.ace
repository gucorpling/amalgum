Why does it feel like Hanamaru always end up with the short stick in every set she 's the UR ; ; ; ; ; some unidolized are still good ( but honestly , the school uniform ? ? even YouDia had an alternative version like ... ) , but the idolized , which supposedly are the big ones , are so underwhelming that ... ugh ( with the exception of Halloween v2 in my opinion , but in 5 UR she 's bound to have at least one good lmao ) .

I know this is all very subjective and I am be the only one raging like this , but Maru is my fave and besides Halloween and Xmas , I never wanted to scout for any of her other URs ; ; There are still 4 UR left in their first cycle of sets , so let 's see how it goes . ^(hope this is n't violating any rules . was n't sure if i could make a post on its own or put it in the weekly free talk )

I agree that best girl 's URs are cute , though like others have mentioned , underwhelming . compared to 2nd and 3rd best girls Yohane and Dia , who have consistently beautiful , popular ( ? ) URs , none of Maru 's URs have really impressed me . part of it I think is the 3 generic sets she 's gotten , but Dia got Halloween and Job URs and those were executed well imo so I 'm not sure what else it is .

her Teacher UR is my favorite so far . even though it 's a school uniform card she looks adorable , it 's a set that fits her , and her shorts are fine so it does n't seem fanservice-y to me . I 'm hoping we get that stunning , gorgeous Maru UR soon .

It happened with Animal ( hoo boi do n't let me get started with animal ) , between Job and Angel which honestly to this day I still consider them one of the best sets ~~and often forget about Animal~~ , and it happened again with Teacher .

I 'm not even talking about quality , as the amount of detail in her last idolized UR is astounding but ... it seems like whenever it 's time for one of Maru 's UR , they decide to do an unpopular or seasonal theme .

And ultimately , I feel like even her SRs have been dropping in quality ( do we have an explanation why both Mari and Maru are the only ones in the Valentines v2 set without and alternative hairstyle ?

Animal is sadly my least favorite even though it 's the set with my 2 best girls and my OTP , because of things often complained about : general dislike for animal sets and poor execution .

So with the release of the absolutely gorgeous new set I could n't hold it anymore and I went full salt , because I am a grown up woman \*thumbs up\*

I like her Halloween UR idolized , but the background in the idolized version is too cluttered for me and detracts from Maru herself .
