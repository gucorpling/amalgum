Keeping a log of your astronomical observations can help you distinguish objects , much as Charles Messier 's catalog helped him distinguish nebulae , star clusters , and galaxies from the comets that interested him , and provide a written record you can use to corroborate or refute weather forecasts and to recall memorable observations , such as meteor showers and auroras .

You can record the date in either American format ( month , day , year ) or European/military format ( day , month , year ) , although you may want to write out or use the abbreviation for the month name to avoid confusion on the part of others who may read your observing log .

These observation logs have led to scientific discoveries , such as Edmond Halley 's discovery that comets are solar system objects with their own orbits ; and cultural practices , such as the 12-year cycle of the Chinese zodiac , inspired in part by the orbital period of the planet Jupiter .

Computer-based astronomy record keeping programs offer the options of pre-printed log forms and the ability to generate reports , as well as an astronomical database that can help you identify objects and the ability to search your own records to track the positions of planets and comets over time .
