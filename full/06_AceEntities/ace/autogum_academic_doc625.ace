In a study analyzing the relevance of depression to the working hours of public sector workers in South Korea , those working more than 10 h/day reported 1.63 times higher levels of depression than those working fewer than 10 h. In addition , they reported 2.2 times higher levels of depression when working nights .

Similarly , in our study , the number of nurses working more than 50 h/week was lower in the intensive care unit than in internal medicine or surgery wards , presumably because its ratio of patients to nurses is relatively smaller , and working overtime is usually not necessary .

Furthermore , the perceptions of adverse nurse outcomes by nurses working more than 50 h were significantly higher than those of nurses working less than 40 h. This suggests that working long hours exposes nurses to adverse outcomes , potentially having detrimental effects on PS .

We investigated nurses ’ working hours , PS competencies , and adverse nurse outcomes and aimed to identify the factors correlated with adverse nurse outcomes , ultimately seeking to determine ways to improve PS and boost the quality of nurses ’ work .

Furthermore , if longer working hours are necessary because of the nature of the department or unit , it is desirable to adjust them to appropriate levels through various approaches , such as hiring more personnel or altering the nursing delivery system .

There is substantial evidence to suggest the possibility of the association of fatigue and shorter sleep with long working hours , which can lead to loss of concentration and perceived quality of care and PS .

Bae and Champion found that working hours significantly differed by working environment — a significantly higher number of nurse practitioners working in hospitals and long-term care settings worked for more than 40 h/week .

Further , working overtime has been reported to induce fatigue and stress and facilitate burnout among nurses , while mandatory overtime was found to be related to lower organizational commitment .
