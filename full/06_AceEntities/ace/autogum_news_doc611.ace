InSight was launched May 5 of this year and traveled reportedly 301,223,981 miles ( somewhat over 484,773,000 kilometres ) between planets followed by two suitcase-sized cube satellites called Mars Cube One , individually MarCO-A and MarCO-B , which relayed information to Earth during the landing process .
