But more reasonably , we can hypothesize , by comparison to similar species of skinks , that it is probably living just under the sand surface , [ a ] few centimeters deep , probably no more , or below [ a ] rock , leaf litter , or piece of dead wood .

: As first investigator , I did most of the work ... and the longest part of the work was to examine closely related species in order to do comparisons ... and also to check the complete bibliography related to this topic and to write the paper .

Otherwise , I am currently studying the DNA of this species and closely related species in order to determine its phylogenetic position compared to other species with legs , in order to learn more about the evolutionary phenomena leading to limb loss .

It is actually very similar to the scanner used in human medicine , but this one is specially designed for small specimens .
