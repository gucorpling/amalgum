The occurrence of different MPs subtypes in this study differed considerably in the RA group and was associated with the clinical course of joint inflammation : The amount of endothelial MPs was associated with the disease duration , the amount of granulocyte MPs was associated with the disease activity as assessed by DAS28 , whereas the amount of monocyte-derived MPs was associated with the presence of the rheumatoid factor .

As expected , ESR , CRP , and DAS28 improved as a result of the treatment ; however , contrary to expectations , neither the amount of circulating MPs , nor MPs with the attached C1q component decreased , which suggests the absence of any connection between the activity of inflammation and MPs release and mpIC production .

A considerable increase in the number of platelet , monocyte , and lymphocyte-derived microparticles ( CD3 , CD19 ) has been observed in RA patients with high disease activity . Rodrigez-Cario et al. examined the amount of circulating microparticles and their origin in 114 RA patients .

In a recent paper , Chen demonstrated that inhibition of PMPs formation in an animal model of CIA ( collagen-induced arthritis ) and reduction of circulating PMPs was associated with a clinical decrease in the disease activity assessed as joint swelling and stiffness .

Nine patients were reassessed after an eight-week intensive treatment according to the COBRA ( COmBination therapy in Rheumatoid Arthritis ) regimen , which included a combined treatment with methotrexate , sulfasalazine , and prednisolone .

Reduction of PMPs numbers in other studies with BTK inhibitor in platelet cultures was associated with a decrease in production and the release of inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 .
