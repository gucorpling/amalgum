( left ) the difference of distribution of the four activity classes is easily perceptible , with the most active compounds ( class A , purple ) having close to half of its compounds ( ~47 % ) in the top-right quadrant of the plot , while the least active compounds ( class D , orange ) are mainly concentrated in the bottom-left quadrant ( ~58 % of class D compounds ) , as quantified in

This is probably a result of the practical strategies applied in medicinal chemistry where inactive structures are modified/derivatized to meet or better resemble substructures seen among actives , thus creating this transition from A to D. As concluded from the chemical space observation , this also shows that functionalizing scaffolds from more potent compounds ( class A/B ) might be a feasible initial strategy to find new actives .

Upon applying the Tc to characterize the similarity between Murcko scaffolds within each class , we observed a high diversity in the dataset , not just within each class , but also between the different classes , with most pairs of compounds showing a Tc below 0.5 that represents a considerable dissimilarity (

During the drug design process , to assess the potential druggability of a compound as a new starting point , some initial rules like drug-likeness ( as defined by Lipinski and colleagues in 1997 ) , lead-likeness ( as defined by Oprea ) and known drug space , are usually applied .

Additionally , no particular cluster was formed with a single class , which means there is no particular location in chemical space ( at least one that is defined by the descriptors that we considered ) which is reserved to one single class .

This entailed looking at chemical space distribution , scaffold similarity and the extraction of chemical rules with machine learning , using either direct structural information ( scaffolds and Morgan fingerprints ) or being based on 21 general molecular ( QuaSAR ) descriptors .

However , selected scaffolds should also be sufficiently dissimilar to the lower activity scaffolds , effectively avoiding the right-end tail of the class D ( i. e. , the most similar scaffolds to A , which are still largely inactive ) .

The scaffolds of class B differ negligibly from class A , however , class C shows a two-peak distribution which suggests it contains scaffolds similar to both classes A/B , as well as with lower activity compounds ( class D ) .

This indicates that class D , for example , is fundamentally different to the remaining classes from a structural and physicochemical level , and therefore supports the existence of a SAR in the proteasome inhibitors developed in the last 20 years .

The proximity in a t-SNE plot is relative in nature , and the distance between points simply represents relative proximity ( i. e. , it is not a direct scaling from real distances in the 21 dimensional space ) .

To do so , we performed a comprehensive analysis of the 680 small-molecules proteasome inhibitors dataset spanning a large range of activity ( 0.08 nM < IC50 ≤ 150,000 nM ) .
