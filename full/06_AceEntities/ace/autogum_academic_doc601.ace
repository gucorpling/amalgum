Several aspects of the device have been shown to be acceptable , such as its size , weight , and its ability to be worn on a hip and a wrist , by attaching it to a waist belt , a waist clip , or a wrist band , for several days , among preschoolers and older children .

However , this same level of feasibility cannot be assumed for toddlers , given that their bodies are significantly smaller and their daily life activity patterns are uniquely different ( e. g. , naps and frequent clothes/diaper changes ) from older children .

Although hip- and wrist-worn accelerometers are both feasible for use in older children , wrist placement has shown higher compliance than hip-placement , while hip-worn accelerometer data have shown higher accuracy in estimating PA than wrist-worn accelerometer data .

The placement of the accelerometer ( e. g. , hip or wrist ) is a key methodological issue that has important implications not only for data processing algorithms , but also for adherence to the monitoring protocol .

A paper by Johansson et al. reported the successful completion ( 89 % of the sample ) of a wrist-worn accelerometer assessment among toddlers , although it did not explicitly assess feasibility .

The ActiGraph accelerometers are relatively small and light devices ( e. g. , 4.6 cm × 3.3 cm × 1.5 cm and 19 g for the wGT3X-BT model ) .

Recognizing the emerging need to assess PA behavior among very young children , studies have begun to investigate wearable sensor-measured PA levels among toddlers aged 1 and 2 years .

Recent longitudinal studies have reported that PA behavior tracks at a moderate level from age 1 to 3 years , or age 1 to 5 years .

The aims of this study were to examine the feasibility of using hip vs. wrist-worn ActiGraph accelerometers and to report accelerometer-derived PA metrics among toddlers .

However , to our knowledge , no studies have yet reported on a comparison of the feasibility between hip and wrist placement among toddlers .

Collectively , these findings suggest that PA behaviors could be established at a very young age and sustained over time .

In particular , ActiGraph accelerometers ( Pensacola , FL , USA ) are the most commonly used research-grade accelerometers .
