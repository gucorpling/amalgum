In relation to the relative reliability statistics , our ICCs are similar or superior to shoulder studies and slightly superior to others performed on the wrist . Furthermore , absolute reliability statistics proved to be superior to those studies that used a mobile phone or electrogoniometer as a measurement tool both in healthy subjects and in subjects with wrist limitations .

Consequently , we believe that those instruments that need to be placed on the body segment to measure the ROM decrease their reliability , because of the possible error in their placement and the need for the instrument to remain stable during the movement .

The inter-rater reliability behaved in a similar way to the intra-rater , with higher values in our study for both relative and absolute reliability statistics compared to those studies that used mobile phones or electrogoniometers and similar with video processing tools .

We believe that this is not due to the difference between the examiners ’ experience , since given a basic training to the newly graduated examiner was enough to obtain high reliability values as in previous studies .

In conclusion , Veloflex-IDA is a valid and reliable alternative to measure the ROM of the upper limb joints and it can be used in clinical practice and research after basic training .

Accordingly , that system implies to attach the mobile phone in the body segment doing the movement , while the Veloflex-IDA does not need more than the placement of the markers .

These differences can be explained by the differences between their ROM values , since previous studies found similar results with better reliability for those movements with higher ROMs .

The intra-rater reliability obtained in the ROM measurements proved to be excellent , with minimal differences between movements in both the ICCs and in the SEM variations .

This study provides useful information on Veloflex-IDA validity and reliability to measure the ROM of the upper limb joints , despite being subject to limitations .

In the same way , compared to shoulder and wrist studies where the goniometer was used as a reference , our LoAs results were lower .

Our findings are slightly superior to those of other studies that have examined the validity of other instruments with the goniometer as a gold standard .

The main limitation was that the participants were predominantly young and healthy , limiting the generalization of the measurements to other populations .

In addition , this was observed in all movements performed , showing a high consistency between instruments independently of the test .
