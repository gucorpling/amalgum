This takes place when the person we are communicating with , understands what we want to say , feels what we are feeling and is then motivated to take action on what we have said .

There are many areas to look at in communication : a message is communicated through visual , vocal and verbal means .

Is the person in a rush , or does he or she have other matters on his or her mind ?

Rather , let ’s look at why many people experience a challenge in communicating effectively from the verbal aspect :
1,2 person
4,5 person|8,10 person|11,20 abstract|17,20 abstract

Before making an important presentation , list down the points you want to make in a logical sense .
1,2 person
3,6 event|9,11 abstract|11,12 person|16,19 abstract
