He was a pert , invincible questioner , pushing his inquiries with equal pertinacity and indiscretion ; he had been observed , when he took a letter to the post , to weigh it in his hand , to turn it over and over , and to study the address with care ; and when he found a flaw in the partition between his room and Madame Zéphyrine ’s , instead of filling it up , he enlarged and improved the opening , and made use of it as a spy-hole on his neighbour ’s affairs .

Madame Zéphyrine , probably in the hope of enchanting the young American , used to flaunt by him on the stairs with a civil inclination , a word of course , and a knock-down look out of her black eyes , and disappear in a rustle of silk , and with the revelation of an admirable foot and ankle .

Mr. Scuddamore was moved to a very acute feeling of annoyance ; he condemned Madame Zéphyrine unmercifully ; he even blamed himself ; but when he found , next day , that she had taken no means to baulk him of his favourite pastime , he continued to profit by her carelessness , and gratify his idle curiosity .
