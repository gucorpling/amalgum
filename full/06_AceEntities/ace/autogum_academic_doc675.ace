Then , this study used the CAPM one-factor model and the Fama – French three-factor model to analyze the relationship between institutional ownership and idiosyncratic risks and the binary logic panel model to estimate the relationship between institutional ownership and corporate governance .

For the effect on the idiosyncratic risks of stock , the empirical results of the CAPM one factor and the Fama – French three-factors models show that independent institutions reduce the idiosyncratic risks of stocks in the periods during the crisis .

Both parts of this study have effectively proven that , in independent institutions , the role of stewardship in both the external market environments supports national policies and the internal market environment for financial stability and corporate governance .

For the top 10 shareholders , all institutional ownerships have a significantly positive effect , but for senior shareholders , this effect is reversed , and independent and domestic institutional ownerships have a significantly negative effect .

Although the amount of investment in foreign institutions has increased significantly during the study period ( 2005 – 2016 ) , its proportion among the total institutional investors is still small ( 1.68 % ) .

In order to identify this effect , We employed the panel regression model by using the ordinary least squares ( OLS ) to first explore the relationship between institutional ownership and stock return volatility .

However , foreign institutional investors who are active in both institutions have no obvious effect on the role of housekeepers in China , which is inconsistent with previous scholars ’ research .

Institutional investors are one of the company ’s most important shareholders , suppressing the equity of senior shareholders after the financial crisis , while maintaining the neutrality of supervision .

Independent institutional investors have exercised their supervisory responsibilities as active ownership , and this kind of stewardship behavior of independent institutional investors was more obvious during post-crisis .

On the other hand , in the regression of the CAPM one-factor models , domestic institutional investors effectively reduce the idiosyncratic risks before the financial crisis .
