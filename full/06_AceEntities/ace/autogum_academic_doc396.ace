Two major changes were instituted at the start of the studied programme : ( 1 ) key personnel from all nine organisations were co-located in a newly acquired multistorey office block to form a newly created Asset Delivery Unit ( ADU ) and ( 2 ) project work was organised into five streams containing projects of a similar technical nature , under two higher level “ production units ” .

Contractors B and D are new to working with UC on a programme for this cycle , whereas contractors G and E had collaborative relationships with UC for 15 years through three programme cycles of association .

The collaborative network studied here comprises the utility company ( UC ) and its main eight contractors ( CTs ) , with the UC adopting a programme management approach to working with its CTs .

Because the water programme typically engages with multiple stakeholders and is a long-term endeavour , effective interorganisational relationships between the water company and its major first tier contractors are important for programme performance .

In addition , complexity stems from the involvement of a sizeable network of organisations , such as major contractors , subcontractors , suppliers , consultants , and regulatory institutions .

They change organisational structures frequently , particularly for each AMP cycle , as the regulator rewards companies for introducing managerial innovation as a source of “ efficiency saving ” .

Collaboration between contractors is expected across both production units and all five streams as part of the performance criteria established as a response to incentives from the regulatory body .

, each contractor is anonymised by using a capital letter ( A – H ) , while each stream is represented using a number ( 1 – 5 ) .

The projects vary in technical work content since different types of capital infrastructure are dealt with , e. g. , pumping stations , reservoirs , and pipeline renewal .

A CT is typically formed by a partnership between a design company and a civil construction company , an arrangement with what could be termed tier 2 suppliers .
