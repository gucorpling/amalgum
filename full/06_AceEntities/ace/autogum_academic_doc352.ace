The classification models were validated via two approaches : ( 1 ) pixel-wise classification of the hold-out test data set consisting of manually annotated pixels of new images of separate plots , and ( 2 ) prediction of pixel classes of all images obtained on a respective day and comparing the total % disease class from all plant pixels to the visual assessment done by the expert (

The interpretation of this result has to take into account that a value from the visual assessment might not represent the average plot value because diseases may occur at zoned locations in the plot , and assessment locations may or may not be in these spots .

However , deviations between the predicted disease severity and the visual assessment could have various reasons , e. g. , the section of the plot observed by the sensor did not represent the true status that was evaluated by the visual assessment .

Approach 1 resulted in a confusion matrix allowing the calculation of multiple performance measures such as the overall accuracy , the sensitivity , and the recall , whereas Approach 2 provided the R²value , correlation coefficient , and a regression plot .

Overall , both approaches were sensitive to YR , but the SVM was much more accurate in the very bright image parts as well as the darker background parts , while the class YR was overrepresented in the SAM classification .

The biological heterogeneity can be affected by many factors , e. g. , the leaf color and status , stem elongation ( distance of leaf layers ) , the density of the canopy , and other biological growth processes .

Furthermore , the visibility of the lower leaf levels was low for imaging system from the top , and more accurate if the human rater could go deep into the crop stand for individual leaf disease rating .

One approach used to analyze hyperspectral data on the field scale is the pixel-wise classification into usual pixel ( background , straw , healthy leaf tissue ) and in disease specific symptoms .

The SVM detected many more senescent leaves , e. g. , all leaves from the lower leaf levels , whereas the SAM assigned these to the background or the healthy leaves .

This has to be considered as highly dynamic within one field , one plot , and one location , and even on different leaf layers and single leaves .

Presumably , due to light reflections and transmission or a deviating weighting of the different canopy levels , the SVM prediction overestimated the ratio of diseased pixels .
