I think of people like myself ; people who like the kind of movies I like , the kind of people who read the kind of books I read and listen to my kind of music . contemporary , you know , just like what somebody who maybe is in their thirties might be going to see or something , because it 's got more energy and action and -- that 's the kind of stuff I like .

That system of writing a story -- it 's a pinwheel narrative , which has become very popular in movies these days , where you go from character to character to character ; all the stories are happening at the same time -- that was a great way for me to focus on what I do best , which is to sit with each character , but at the same time have a very clear story .

And in fact , I 'm already a member of the very-hard-to-get-into theater world , so I have a greater edge ; I have a greater sort of built-in advantage when I work in the theater , because I 'm a bona fide theater guy .

I mainly had written theater , and that audience is such a narrow bandwidth of people , as in those who actually go to the theater at this point .
