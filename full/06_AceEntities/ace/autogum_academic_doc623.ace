Dysbiosis is frequently characterized by : ( a ) lower microbial diversity and richness , ( b ) changes in the relative abundance of phyla with an increased Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio ( F/B ) , and ( c ) changes in short chain fatty acids ( SCFA ) producing bacteria with a relative increase in lactate-producing bacteria and a relative decrease in acetate- and butyrate-producing bacteria .

Vitamin D is produced from dermal exposure to sunlight or from the diet and is converted in the liver into 25-OH-cholecaciferol or calcifediol ( 25OHVitD ) , whose measure serves as an indicator of the vitamin D status .

Besides this well-known regulatory role in the calcium-phosphorus and bone homeostasis , vitamin D is also involved in the control of other physiological processes , such as cellular growth , intracellular metabolism and innate and adaptive immunity .

This is further metabolized mainly in the kidney into 1-Î±,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol , the most active form , also named calcitriol , which activates the vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) .
