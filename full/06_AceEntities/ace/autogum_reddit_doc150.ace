My GF was really nervous about telling her mom about being in a relationship ( I 'll get to why later ) and although I tried to encourage her since before Thanksgiving to tell her family , she would n't until mid-December ( after we have been dating since early August . ) Her mom , expectedly , went off on her for not saying anything and guilt-tripped her .

The more our relationship went on , the more frustrating I seemed to notice about her mother such as Her never telling anyone back home/at school about our relationship . This drives me crazy because if our relationship does n't work out , no one in her life other than the mother will even know it happened , like we did n't even exist .

" ( pissed me off more than anything ) Last night , I told my GF about the talk we had , and she did n't apologize for her mother 's actions or anything , all she said was " I do n't know what to say , " after I poured out my heart to her .

Her mom asking questions about me constantly , and not very accepting of my honest answers I tried not to become too bothered about this , but my GF told me her mom wanted to speak to me before they went home for Spring Break ( which is now ) in private .

I never post on forums but I 'm desperate for advice on what to do because I still care for her greatly , but I 'm becoming more on edge every day and I 'm fully aware we are in an unhealthy relationship .

This really hurt me , but I 'm used to it as it is the usual answer when I tell her about something I 'm going through , as I usually go through friends/parents when I have problems instead .

Tell her you never want her to feel pressured by you , and that it 's ok to communicate what she is comfortable with and what she would like to explore .

Also you might try to suggest that therapy might help her navigate all her relationships in a healthy way , since her mom admitted skipping that part .

I knew she did n't like me from the beginning because I 'm 19 and she is 20 even though we are in the same class .

However , the relationship has caused me more stress and guilt than happiness , and the worst part is because it is from her mother .

She told me she never talked about sex/relationships to my GF ( homeschooled of course ) because " parenting is hard .

But remember it is n't your responsibility to hang around and fix her if you are n't enjoying the relationship .
