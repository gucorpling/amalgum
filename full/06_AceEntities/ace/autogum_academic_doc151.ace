A main cause that determines the removal of the conveyor belts is that in the joint area is not obtained an uniform thickness of the conveyor belt and thus the dimensional error of the type “ bell ” appears , meaning that the conveyor belt has in the joint area a much greater thickness in the middle compared to the outer parts .

b ) , and their properties are based on rubber-insertion adhesions and are used for equipping high-capacity conveyors or those working in high demand conditions ( high slope , high speed , reduced length with frequent alternations with straight paths and passes on drums ) where very good breaking resistance , great flexibility and high reliability are required .

In order to increase the service life of the conveyor belts , it is necessary to combine them by vulcanization so that in the joining areas , the mechanical characteristics will be the same or very close to those of the rest of the belt and to obtain a homogeneity of the entire conveyor belt .

The conveyor belts used in different fields of industry can be made in the manufacturing process either at the required dimensions in exploitation or at other smaller dimensions , and this determines the use of vulcanization as a process for combining the conveyor belts so as to obtain the conveyor belts with the desired performances .

The three parameters mentioned above may take different values depending on a certain type of rubber product , and if the adjustment of these parameters is not achieved at optimum values then the results obtained regarding the characteristics of the joint area are not appropriate .

The inadequate results are mainly determined by the presence in the joint area of a high porosity of the joint material but also of an uneven thickness of the conveyor belt , and this causes a decrease of the mechanical characteristics of the joints .

In general , the vulcanization of the various rubber products , but especially of the conveyor belts , generates lower mechanical characteristics in the joint area than the rest of the product and this causes a decrease in the life of the product .

This fact is determined by the fact that the used vulcanization facility has an unoptimized metal structure that deforms very much during the vulcanization in the sense that it has a very large deformation in the middle .
