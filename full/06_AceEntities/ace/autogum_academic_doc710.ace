For example , Batson argues : “ Even if it were possible for a person to be motivated to increase another ’s welfare , such a person would be interested in attaining this desired goal and would experience pleasure in doing so ” ( p. 21 ) . Cialdini et al. counter that “ the conditions that lead to empathic concern also lead to a greater sense of self – other overlap , raising the possibility that helping under these conditions is not selfless but is also directed toward the self ” ( p. 481 ) .

Reflecting this egoistic view in sustainable behavior , when an individual seeks to attain self-gratification through serving his or her self-interests and welfare through purchasing green products ( e. g. , seeking aesthetic uniqueness of Fair Trade products , choosing organic children ’s wear and natural food for health and safety reasons ) , this individual falls into the egoistic category .

As a result , advertising messages about human beneficiaries ( e. g. , “ when you buy our product , you support children ’s education ” ) can facilitate a more positive evaluation and higher reciprocal value positioning than messages about the planet or environmental beneficiaries ( e. g. , keeping the environment clean ) .

In this study , we use two categories of green appeals to explain the complex mechanism of why an individual engages in sustainable purchases and to illustrate the conception of impure altruism : the message orientation ( altercentric versus egocentric ) and the beneficiary type ( earth versus human ) .

In comparison , egocentric appeals focus on how the behavior benefits individuals propelled by receiving recognition or feeling good about themselves , for example , “ our product will make you feel good about yourself . ”

To explain this mixed category of altruistic and egoistic motivations , we borrow Andreoni ’s theory of warm-glow giving and explore impure altruism as a psychological phenomenon that connects altruism to egoistic good feelings .

Research in altruism shows that the norm of reciprocity in which an individual can expect to receive reciprocal benefits from his or her altruistic act can motivate prosocial behavior .

Green advertising is advertising that discourses on the impact of a green product on the biophysical environment , promotes a green lifestyle , or shows corporate social responsibility .

To meet these criteria , firms can uniquely position advertising messages to elicit consumers ’ favorable perceptions of the benefit of a green product and its brand .

Literature in sustainable behavior further suggests that consumers perceive a greater benefit from acts that help people compared to acts that help the environment .

Scholars disagree about the existence of true altruism because others ’ welfare is not easily one ’s ultimate goal without expectations of reciprocity .

Batson defines altruism as “ a motivational state with the ultimate goal of increasing another ’s welfare ” ( p. 20 ) .

Altruism describes “ true ” philanthropic motivation , in which one responds with empathic concern for others without seeking a personal benefit .

We therefore postulate that the types of perceived benefits change according to the altercentric or egocentric orientation of the advertising appeal .

Thus , an individual who purchases green products only to enhance the wellbeing of others falls into the altruistic category .

By contrast , egoism is “ a motivational state with the ultimate goal of increasing one ’s own welfare ” .

Research suggests that egocentric appeals can be viewed as more valuable among individuals with self-oriented motives than altercentric appeals .

As such , egoism is achieved when one pursues actions that benefit oneself or that offer personal rewards .

Thus , we propose that green advertising can be more effective when advertisements emphasize humans over the earth .
