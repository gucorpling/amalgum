This research takes the specific case of EVCARD in China for study and application ; therefore , the evaluation outcomes may provide some useful insights for ECS companies , the government , and other stakeholders in terms of improving the planning of the ECSS and the attractiveness of CS .

Operators may have to consider how to increase the convenience through good planning methods such as increasing the reservation time ( time between requesting and picking up a vehicle ) , adequate parking spaces , longer business hours , or the application of intelligent networking technology .

This demonstrates that the value co-creation between the CS companies and users is essential in the ECSS , in other words , the planning performance improvement of the ECSS must be based on the satisfaction of the consumers ’ travel demand. .

For EVCARD , the construction planning of the JA district is a key direction for improvement ; relocation management and convenience of picking up and returning EVs , however , should be the key improvement direction for the CN district .

For CS companies , station attributes such as the coverage area of each station and the corresponding density and fleet size should be calculated regarding the demand forecast so that use efficiency and construction costs can be balanced .

Through a literature review and expert interviews , four major evaluation criteria were determined : construction of stations , routine inspection , vehicle usability and relocation management , and maintenance and replacement of stations .
