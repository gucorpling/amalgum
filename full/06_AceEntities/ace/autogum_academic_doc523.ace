The effect of the combined amino acid administration was stronger than that of the same glycine dose alone , indicating that a small amount of tryptophan provides an additional benefit to glycine alone in reducing the elevation in the serum uric acid levels after the ingestion of dietary purines .

Herein , although the elevation of urinary pH induced by the ingestion of glycine alone was not significant compared with the effects of placebo , glycine administration enhanced uric acid excretion and urate clearance , raising the possibility of other mechanisms .
