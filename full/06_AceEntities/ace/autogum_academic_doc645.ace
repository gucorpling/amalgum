is unable to withstand low temperatures : when it is stored at 4 °C , the mycelium disintegrates and dies , and the fruit body softens and undergoes autolysis , which complicates the preservation of V. volvacea .

Due to the respiration of the picked V. volvacea , the temperature at the center of each package can be as high as 50 °C , which is extremely unfavorable for the preservation of V. volvacea .
