Now one washing day , they being as glad to get rid of us at home as we were to get out , we went over to the good house and found no one at home except the grown-up daughter , who used to sing for us , and read “ Robinson Crusoe ” of nights , “ out loud ” , and give us more lollies than any of the rest -- and with whom we were passionately in love , notwithstanding the fact that she was engaged to a “ grown-up man” -- (we reckoned he 'd be dead and out of the way by the time we were old enough to marry her ) .

We were only children and did n't know why she was bad , but we were n't allowed to play near or go near the hut she lived in , and we were trained to believe firmly that something awful would happen to us if we stayed to answer a word , and did n't run away as fast as our legs could carry us , if she attempted to speak to us .

They were mostly good men , and we concluded they were listening and watching the bad women 's house to see that they did n't kill anyone , or steal and run away with any bad little boys -- ourselves , for instance -- who ran out after dark ; which , as we were informed , those bad people were always on the lookout for a chance to do .

On the diggings up to twenty odd years ago -- and as far back as I can remember -- on Lambing Flat , the Pipe Clays , Gulgong , Home Rule , and so through the roaring list ; in bark huts , tents , public-houses , sly grog shanties , and -- well , the most glorious voice of all belonged to a bad girl .

We were told in after years that old Peter McKenzie ( a respectable , married , hard-working digger ) would sometimes steal up opposite the bad door in the dark , and throw in money done up in a piece of paper , and listen round until the bad girl had sung the “ Bonnie Hills of Scotland ” two or three times .

Next door to the bad girl 's house there lived a very respectable family -- a family of good girls with whom we were allowed to play , and from whom we got lollies ( those hard old red-and-white “ fish lollies ” that grocers sent home with parcels of groceries and receipted bills ) .

She did n't look bad -- she looked to us like a grand and beautiful lady-girl -- but we got instilled into us the idea that she was an awful bad woman , something more terrible even than a drunken man , and one whose presence was to be feared and fled from .

There were two other girls in the hut with her , also a pretty little girl , who called her “ Auntie ” , and with whom we were not allowed to play -- for they were all bad ; which puzzled us as much as child-minds can be puzzled .
