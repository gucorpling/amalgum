Similarly MyoD — a myogenic regulatory factor which controls skeletal muscle development binds CBP and recruits histone acetyltransferase to activate myogenic program . Cao et al. showed that of MyoD modify the myoblasts chromatin structure and accessibility . ASCL1 ( class II , Table 1 ) was shown to be a pioneer factor which promotes chromatin accessibility and enables chromatin binding by others TFs .
