This applies not only to environmental factors ( e. g. , increased pollution , increased waste material ) , but also to economic ( e. g. , increased costs , increased consumption of raw materials ) and social factors ( e. g. , deterioration of working conditions , threats to employee psychophysical health , unequal treatment , damage to the sense of community ) .

For example : Skarlicki and Folger investigated the impact of relationship quality on employee retaliation ; Brass et al. analyzed the impact of relationship quality on conspiracy ; and Roberts focused on the importance of relationship quality on , among others , work avoidance , the defensive behavior of personnel or the tendency to recognize one ’s own mistakes and to accept criticism .

As a rule , high quality relationships translate beneficially into , among others : commitment , performance , motivation , innovation , error detection , OHS , employee green behaviors ( EGB ) , teamwork , helping others , internal and external organizational communication , absenteeism , conflict and resilience to negative events .

These costs can be divided into economic costs ( quantifiable ) and non-economic costs ( non-quantifiable or difficult-to-quantify , e. g. , hospitalization , earlier retirement benefits , lower professional activity , loss of reputation , lower employee morale , increased environmental pollution , wasting of limited natural resources ) .

It is significant that researchers are more keen to examine the beneficial aspects of the quality of work relationships and the significance of this quality for organizational citizenship behavior ( OCB ) , also in the field of sustainability ( see , e. g. , ) .

Counterproductive behaviors and their effects therefore conflict with the principle of sustainable development in the sense of “ development that meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet theirs ” ( p. 41 ) .

However , the topic is very important , because counterproductive behavior has multiple detrimental consequences and generates significant costs , and not only for the organization itself , but also for its surroundings ( the natural environment , society , etc. ) .

This can be explained by the fact that such relationships are characterized by more frequent interaction and higher trust , which provides more opportunities for abuse .
