After becoming a faculty member in zoology in the University of Texas at Austin , Jeffery published a study in Developmental Biology which suggested that Poly(A)-binding protein is present in oocyte and is responsible for oogenesis in the African clawed frog . [ 2 ]

Here he continued to work on evolutionary changes in development between tailess and tailed ascidian species and began research to develop the cave fish Astyanax mexicanus as a model system to study the evolutionary basis of eye and pigment degeneration in cave animals .
