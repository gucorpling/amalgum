The successful targeting of the Warburg effect by the newly synthesized glucose derivatives is strongly suggested by the following findings : ( a ) correlation of cytotoxicity and selectivity of the synthesized conjugates with higher expression of GLUT-1 in human prostate cancer cells ; ( b ) inhibition of cytotoxicity of the conjugates by addition of glucose to the media ; c ) ability of the compounds to inhibit a glucose uptake by cancer cells .

Successful examples of this treatment strategy are antibody-drug conjugates , which target cancer cells due to increased expression of specific proteins , and folate conjugates , which utilize a commonly high expression of the folate receptor ( FR ) on the surface of different human cancer cells .

It is known that the presence of free unsubstituted glycoside hydroxyl ( at C1 position ) is important for the stabilization of hydrogen bonding interactions with GLUT-1 and therefore is required for the successful cellular uptake of the sugar-conjugated molecules .

Therefore , instead of a conventional glycosylation reaction ( results in C1-substituted glucose ) we applied a new reaction of alkylation of 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinones with 6-deoxy-6-iodo-1,2:3,5-di-O- isopropylidene-α-D-glucofuranose ( results in a C6-substituted glucose ) .

In contrast , the hydroxyl at C6 position of glucose molecule is not relevant for the hydrogen bond interactions and therefore it ’s substitution may be more tolerable .
