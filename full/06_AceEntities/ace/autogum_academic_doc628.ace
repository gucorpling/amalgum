Hence , the study of soil iron has mainly focused on different land uses , different functions and intensity , and different soil properties , but very few studies have analyzed its spatial distribution characteristics in combination with topographic factors in small watersheds , including pollution evaluation .

Information on the spatial distribution of soil total phosphorus and its relationship with land use and topographic factors at watershed scale is therefore of great significance to sustainable regional land use and the estimation of potential environmental pollution , as well as for protecting human health .

Despite the need for more research , the findings of this study suggest that the spatial variability of soil iron is mainly caused by random and systematic variation , indicating that this variability is related not only to natural factors , but also to human activities .

The soil total iron was generally not less than 1 % , but this varies greatly depending on available iron in the soil ; low content was 1 – 5 mg/kg and high content can be up to 1000 mg/kg .

Soil iron content in farmland and irrigated fields is higher than in forested land , and soil pH , organic matter , and clay content have a great influence on the soil iron distribution .
