Particularly , the hemicellulose and lignin removal , the decrease of the degree of polymerization of the cellulose chain and the decrease of the cellulose crystallinity index , which is also accompanied by the decrease of the particle size and thus the increase of the accessible surface area , are considered as major requirements for a hydrolysis process to be efficient .
