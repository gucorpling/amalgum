In developed countries , an AAA rupture represents an important cause of death with a mortality rate of approximatively 80 – 90 % ; several risk factors are associated with the development of AAA including advanced age , male sex , Caucasian race , positive family history , smoking , presence of other large vessel aneurysms , and atherosclerosis .

For asymptomatic patients , repair of the aneurysm is the most effective treatment to prevent rupture but considering the risks associated with surgery , AAA repair is recommended if the risk of rupture exceeds the risks associated with surgery , which typically occurs when the AAA diameter exceeds 5.5 cm .

By analyzing a large set of ‘ small ’ , ‘ large ’ ruptured , and non-ruptured AAAs , they were also able to show that early AAA rupture is not a result of elevated wall stresses but the result of compromised aortic wall strength .
