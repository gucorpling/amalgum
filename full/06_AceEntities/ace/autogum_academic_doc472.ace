In the preparation of the AChBP-anabaseine crystals very high anabaseine concentrations were used so that most of the five sites would be occupied ; therefore the presence of the ammonium-ketone form in the crystal structure does not necessarily indicate that this form of anabaseine would bind to AChBPs and nAChRs at the low concentrations of anabaseine that occur in our in vitro functional and binding studies .

Perhaps a major advantage of possessing an imine bond , besides an enhanced affinity for the nAChR orthosteric site , is its low basicity , which allows the unionized form to reach a relatively high concentration in the neutral pH range of the marine environment and thereby enhance passive diffusion across the integument of the prey or predator .

In the case of anabaseine , our identification of the cyclic iminium form as the most active ( and possibly the only ) form suggests that structural modifications that enhance the basicity of its tetrahydropyridyl nitrogen will enhance potency and possibly selectivity for the intended receptor target .

For PTHP to be equipotent with anabaseine , based on the I+ form being the only active form , its EC50 would need to be ~1/3 of the EC50 of anabaseine , since the anabaseine ( I+ ) is ~1/3 of its total concentration .

One possible explanation for this slightly inferior potency is that the additional N on the tetrahydropyrmidinyl ring must form an H bond with some other atom within the aromatic box of the nAChR orthosteric binding site and this may be energetically unfavorable .
