They go on to suggest that measuring and optimising an asset ’s performance involves economic performance ( to obtain value for money ) , functional performance ( to be fit for purpose such as appropriate in size and form ) , physical performance ( concerns about the efficiency of the asset ’s operation and maintenance ) , and service performance ( to achieve a satisfactory working environment for the occupants and satisfaction regarding quality from the client ’s perspective ) .

Lützkendorf and Lorenz identified several direct and indirect benefits for investors and other stakeholders , of applying value creation assessment for green buildings , such as : ( i ) drastic reduction in the operational cost and an increase in marketability , ( ii ) increase in useful life-spans , ( iii ) more stable cash flows , ( iv ) reduced exposure to increasingly stringent environmental legislation , and ( v ) significantly increased occupant productivity and well-being .
