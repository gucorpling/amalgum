Dendrigraft poly-l-lysines ( DGL ) have emerged as a new kind of synthetic polymer consisting of lysine and have been employed as drug- or gene-delivery carriers , due to their biodegradability and rich external amino groups that can encapsulate drugs by the emulsion crosslinking method or plasmid DNA through electric interactions .

The antitumor mechanism of prodigiosin is still unclear , especially in regard to newly acquired prodigiosin produced by a small number of microorganisms , including Serratia marcescens and other bacteria , such as Streptomyces griseoviridis , Serratia spp. , Zooshikellarubidus , Vibrio sp . , Actinomycetes , and Hahella chejuensis .

In this study , to develop a new type of targeted drug delivery carrier material and investigate the anticancer mechanism of prodigiosin , we first used plCSA-BP as a guide peptide to coat on the DGL vector for cancer-cell-targeted delivery of prodigiosin produced from Serratia marcescens subsp . lawsoniana HDZK-BYSB107 .
