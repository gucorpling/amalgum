While the term maleficus can be employed in a general way to indicate the one who conducts evil , in his Libellus against magicians the Dominican Isidoro Isolani ( d. 1528 ) includes witches ( strigae ) as part of the malefici category.5 The women who practice sorcery ( mulieres incantatrices ) offer the category of superstition an even more precise orientation towards witch-beliefs , leading to the construction of the stereotype of the witch practitioner typically being female .

I aim to show how this process of amalgamation of various cultural traditions gave shape to the creation and the understanding of the witchcraft phenomenon , and to highlight how the at times contradictory views concerning witch-beliefs pointing either to realistic or to skeptical stances , are associated with specific declensions of those different traditions on the part of the friars .

Above all , the vetulae or old women who can make a woman sterile or provide advice on how to get rid of a fetus , as well as those women who enchant people and beasts , fall under the suspicion of showing a diabolic attitude endangering life in all its forms .

In this regard , those friars often dealt with witch-beliefs as part of their concerns over superstition — this latter being the domain opposing official Christian religious practices — as well as in the context of pastoral care , as I have shown in the case of fifteenth-century Milanese Franciscan friars3

In the record of superstitions that is part of the Sermones discipuli de tempore published in 1418 by the German Dominican preacher Johannes Herolt ( d. 1468 ) , known as the Discipulus , the friar gives an interesting account of beliefs seemingly referring to pre-Christian folkloric traditions .

My aim here is to show how two of the main cultural substrata behind the construction of witch-beliefs , the folkloric and the Classical literary motives , were intertwined in the fifteenth century by Mendicant preachers and inquisitors to produce a coherent and multifaceted picture of witchcraft-related beliefs .

As the renowned Dominican preacher Girolamo Savonarola ( d. 1498 ) shows in his Eruditorium confessorum , a handbook for the instruction of confessors , superstition opposes religion , and it includes specific categories of practitioners of witchcraft among those dealing with other classes of magic :

Through their assessment of people ’s level of adherence to Christian faith , according to the rules of Scholastic theological models , the Mendicant friars collected and elaborated on elements that would become a constitutive part of beliefs in witchcraft .

Other elements pertain to superstitious attitudes called vanae observationes that Herolt , as all the other friars , generally consider with leniency , including observing dreams or observing the course of the moon and the sun .
