She told me she was a clergyman ’s daughter , and had been left an orphan from her childhood , but had had the good fortune to obtain a situation in a very pious family ; and then she spoke so gratefully of the kindness she had experienced from its different members , that I reproached myself for my uncharitable thoughts and unfriendly conduct , and relented for a time , but not for long : my causes of dislike were too rational , my suspicions too well founded for that ; and I knew it was my duty to watch and scrutinize till those suspicions were either satisfactorily removed or confirmed .

The day after his arrival , however , he surprised me by the announcement of an intention to procure a governess for little Arthur : I told him it was quite unnecessary , not to say ridiculous , at the present season : I thought I was fully competent to the task of teaching him myself — for some years to come , at least : the child ’s education was the only pleasure and business of my life ; and since he had deprived me of every other occupation , he might surely leave me that .

He said I was not fit to teach children , or to be with them : I had already reduced the boy to little better than an automaton ; I had broken his fine spirit with my rigid severity ; and I should freeze all the sunshine out of his heart , and make him as gloomy an ascetic as myself , if I had the handling of him much longer .

I calmly defended our several qualifications as nurse and governess , and still resisted the proposed addition to our family ; but he cut me short by saying it was no use bothering about the matter , for he had engaged a governess already , and she was coming next week ; so that all I had to do was to get things ready for her reception .

Her fondness for her little pupil was overstrained , and I was obliged to remonstrate with her on the subject of over-indulgence and injudicious praise ; but she could not gain his heart . Her piety consisted in an occasional heaving of sighs , and uplifting of eyes to the ceiling , and the utterance of a few cant phrases .
