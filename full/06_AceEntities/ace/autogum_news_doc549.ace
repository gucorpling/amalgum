One week later , 30 officers in Sydney Passport Office took the short version of Glasgow Face Matching Test ( GFMT ) ; 28 were participants from the person-to-photo test , and two were replacements for officers from the earlier test who were absent from work the day of the second test .

Researchers from Australia ' s University of New South Wales ( UNSW ) and the United Kingdom ' s University of York and University of Aberdeen have measured face matching aptitude of 49 Australian passport -issuing officers and compared it against a control group of 38 students from UNSW .

Another solution Dr David White mentioned is using multiple photographs : " One of the more recent papers we 've released shows that if you have multiple images — not just a single snapshot — there are quite large gains in performance " .

A possible solution of the problem is recruitment of staff with high face-matching accuracy , as Dr David White notes :
