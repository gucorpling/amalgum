Myself , I 've gone in and looked at some of the early Year Books , and some of the Statistician 's Reports at the beginning of each of the Year Books , and one of the things that I found really interesting was the extent to which issues that we might feel are pretty new and that we 've discovered for the first time in recent years , you go back and read history and you find that quite often we 're reinventing , perhaps in a different context , but still reinventing challenges that people dealt with back then as well .

But a great deal of what a national statistical office like the ABS does is to provide a window on different parts of economic and social dimensions of our society that all governments need , and value , and use , and so whilst it 's quite possible that we will see some shifts in areas of interest and priority from the new government that came in late last year , in the main the large part of what the ABS is doing will continue to support the new government in the ways that is has previous governments .

That obviously started before I came back from New Zealand , but a very large effort , but also a wonderful resource now available , free , on the ABS web site , to all of our community and society , both individuals and obviously it will be a very valuable research environment for historians , for economic historians , for statisticians as well , and I think so far it 's been pretty low-key in terms of the way in which the value of that particular initiative is yet to be fully recognised .

: I think one of the really important values of a national statistical organisation is that it has an enduring role in its society , and an important part of that role is to support the information needs of government , and governments change , and their focus can change , some of their priorities obviously change , and our role is to be able to support the information needs .

: I have n't , I think that as I said the large majority of people do n't realise yet that that enormous resource is there , and I think our challenge is to get the knowledge out there that they are there , and then I think we 'll see the use pick up quite substantially .

: Obviously the ABS does n't exist in a vacuum , and it has to work in the wider political world in Australia , and of course last year the November Federal election saw a change of government .

Probably we need to find ways of getting the availability of all those Year Books , now digitally on the web site , out there and understood by a wider range of potential users .

Perhaps forums like the Wiki forum that we 're talking about here is a good way to help do that .
