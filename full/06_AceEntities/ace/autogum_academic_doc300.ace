However , although pop-in phenomenon in the loading segment was cited in the zincblende-structured GaP single-crystal , the features were not as apparent , presumably due to the sensitivity of testing module used in their indentation measurements was force module , which often resulted in serrated loading curve and blurred the feature of pop-in events .

For instance , it was indicated that in many nanoindentation measurements , the materials often exhibits a characteristic feature called the “ pop-in ” event characterized by a sudden displacement burst at a nearly constant indentation load , which acts as a trigger signifying the onset of plastic deformation .

Combining the nanoindentation with microscopic techniques , the nanoindentation-induced shear band formation in bulk metallic glasses , dislocation nucleation in GaN films , and phase transition in single-crystals Si and Ge had been extensively investigated to reveal the underlying mechanisms in great detail .

Herein , in this study , the mechanical properties and indentation-induced deformation behaviors of GaP(100 ) single-crystal were investigated by using continuous stiffness measurements ( CSM ) nanoindentation module to unveil the fundamental aspects of plasticity and mechanisms of local dislocation activities .

In some cases , it has been also interpreted as the manifestations of the dislocation activity depending strongly on the crystal structure of the test materials , temperature , the shape of indenter tip and indenter angle .

From the viewpoint of device applications , it is thus of crucial importance to fully recognize the response of substrates due to mechanical stresses introduced during fabrication processes , which might cause the contact-induced damage and cracking .

Nanoindentation has been proved to be a powerful tool for studying the fundamental mechanical properties ( for instance , the hardness and Young ’s modulus ) of various nanostructured materials , biomaterials , and thin films .

Furthermore , the correlations between pop-in behaviors and dislocation activities of materials have been widely studied by combining microstructural observations with the cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy in recent years .
