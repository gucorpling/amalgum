It was on the moral side , and in my own person , that I learned to recognise the thorough and primitive duality of man ; I saw that , of the two natures that contended in the field of my consciousness , even if I could rightly be said to be either , it was only because I was radically both ; and from an early date , even before the course of my scientific discoveries had begun to suggest the most naked possibility of such a miracle , I had learned to dwell with pleasure , as a beloved daydream , on the thought of the separation of these elements .

If each , I told myself , could be housed in separate identities , life would be relieved of all that was unbearable ; the unjust might go his way , delivered from the aspirations and remorse of his more upright twin ; and the just could walk steadfastly and securely on his upward path , doing the good things in which he found his pleasure , and no longer exposed to disgrace and penitence by the hands of this extraneous evil .

Enough then , that I not only recognised my natural body from the mere aura and effulgence of certain of the powers that made up my spirit , but managed to compound a drug by which these powers should be dethroned from their supremacy , and a second form and countenance substituted , none the less natural to me because they were the expression , and bore the stamp of lower elements in my soul .

Though so profound a double-dealer , I was in no sense a hypocrite ; both sides of me were in dead earnest ; I was no more myself when I laid aside restraint and plunged in shame , than when I laboured , in the eye of day , at the furtherance of knowledge or the relief of sorrow and suffering .

I was born in the year 18 — to a large fortune , endowed besides with excellent parts , inclined by nature to industry , fond of the respect of the wise and good among my fellowmen , and thus , as might have been supposed , with every guarantee of an honourable and distinguished future .

It was thus rather the exacting nature of my aspirations than any particular degradation in my faults , that made me what I was , and , with even a deeper trench than in the majority of men , severed in me those provinces of good and ill which divide and compound man ’s dual nature .

And indeed the worst of my faults was a certain impatient gaiety of disposition , such as has made the happiness of many , but such as I found it hard to reconcile with my imperious desire to carry my head high , and wear a more than commonly grave countenance before the public .

With every day , and from both sides of my intelligence , the moral and the intellectual , I thus drew steadily nearer to that truth , by whose partial discovery I have been doomed to such a dreadful shipwreck : that man is not truly one , but truly two .

Hence it came about that I concealed my pleasures ; and that when I reached years of reflection , and began to look round me and take stock of my progress and position in the world , I stood already committed to a profound duplicity of life .
