When he detected a cerebral centre , a nervous centre , and a centre for aerating the blood -- the first two so perfectly complementary that in the latter years of his life he came to a conviction that the sense of hearing is not absolutely necessary for hearing , nor the sense of sight for seeing , and that the solar plexus could supply their place without any possibility of doubt -- Desplein , thus finding two souls in man , confirmed his atheism by this fact , though it is no evidence against God .

Though it is impossible to deny that this persistent observer of human chemistry possessed that antique science of the Mages , that is to say , knowledge of the elements in fusion , the causes of life , life antecedent to life , and what it must be in its incubation or ever it is , it must be confessed that , unfortunately , everything in him was purely personal .

Desplein had a godlike eye ; he saw into the sufferer and his malady by an intuition , natural or acquired , which enabled him to grasp the diagnostics peculiar to the individual , to determine the very time , the hour , the minute when an operation should be performed , making due allowance for atmospheric conditions and peculiarities of individual temperament .
