Most of the prototypes and systems for on-site antenna measurement using UAVs are intended to operate in the far field ( FF ) region of the antenna-under-test ( AUT ) which , in the case of electrically large antennas ( e. g. , reflector antennas , mobile networks base station antennas ) can be hundreds of meters away from the AUT .

These improvements are ( i ) the use of a dual-channel receiver , that allows placing two receiving antennas ( probe antennas ) at two different distances onboard the UAV , thus collecting NF measurements at two different distances simultaneously ; ( ii ) the introduction of a GNSS dual-band RTK receiver , which increases positioning and geo-referring accuracy and reliability .

These issues can be overcome if the measurements are carried out in the near field ( NF ) region of the AUT , so that the furthest distance from the AUT to the UAV is not greater than 10 â€“ 20 m. The feasibility of NF measurements using UAV-based systems has been proved in .

On the other hand , iterative techniques do not need additional hardware elements , but the NF radiated by the AUT must be measured on two or more acquisition surfaces .
