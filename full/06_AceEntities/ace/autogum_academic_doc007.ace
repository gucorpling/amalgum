The analysis was carried out both during exponential phase of growth through monitoring how the specific growth rate and the concentration of the viable cell concentration evolved over time , and during the phase where the cell population reached a very high density , through monitoring of the final monoclonal antibody product concentration and the specific productivity of the cell population .

Although statistics were employed in these studies , it would be very difficult to extract learning as to the nature of the potential benefits of employing different design approaches since these investigations focused on the empirical aspects of the study rather than providing an in-depth evaluation of the statistical tools employed .

An amino acid other than glutamine ( analytically uncharacterized ) was identified as the limiting component in a study that employed response surface methodology to evaluate medium-associated effects on viable cell density ( as a proxy for mAb concentration ) during coupled production and growth .

In line with this observation for statistical methodologies , search heuristics such as genetic algorithms commonly employed in medium development and optimization in various organisms have not been utilized for improving CHO cell medium compositions , even the chemically defined cell-free formulations .
