This approach makes use of different kinds of data that are available almost in real-time , from the very first moments when the disaster unfolds and the emergency phase ( e. g. , data from social media , GPS and sensors data , meteorological data , etc. ) Our work instead is developed long after the occurrence of the disaster , using mostly data collected ex-post .

This research follows the case study concept of disaster forensics methodology , i. e. , a combination of methods and findings from different disciplines with the aim of describing and reconstructing disasters and their relevant drivers as comprehensively as possible .

In the case of floods , this means that the data under consideration are collected after the flood event , through damage assessments done at the end of the emergency , and/or in the recovery period .

Specifically , the approach consists of a detailed study of repeated hazard events in the same location , while the PERC report was followed as guidance for determining the different aspects and factors that required investigation .

These data were collected through computer-aided interviews ( CATI ) among households in the flooded area in the aftermaths of both the 2002 and the 2013 floods as explained by Thieken et al. .
