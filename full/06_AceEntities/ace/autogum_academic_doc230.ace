Lambiase and Ko investigated the feasibility of mechanical clinching for CFRP – aluminum joining and found that a high jointing strength of 2.5 kN can be achieved . Zhang et al. showed that the pre-treatment of aluminum with the laser Surfi-Sculpt process could improve the shear strength of dissimilar joints to a large extent and discussed the bonding and the failure mechanisms of the dissimilar joints .

The materials are chosen since PEEK is considered as one of the most promising candidates for replacing PA6 or PA66 for a thermoplastic polymer matrix for carbon fiber composites due to its high thermal resistance , mechanical strength , and moisture resistance , and zinc-coated steel has been increasingly adopted in the automotive industry for improved corrosion resistance .

The results showed that the shear strength of the joint could be enhanced up to 600 % using optimized UV grafting parameters , and new bonds including Al – C and Al – O – C could be the reason for such high joining strength improvement .

Many prior studies have investigated the application of laser fusion welding between CFRP and metals . Katayama et al. showed that tight bonding between the polymer matrix and the metal surface could be achieved by generating bubbles in the molten zone of the CFRP matrix .
