We think that , because of this size difference , females have a lower storage capacity , ca n't dive as deep , and ca n't take as wide a range of prey as males — all disadvantages when faced with limited and unpredictable food resources .

Counts of carcasses in the species ' migration range support starvation as the main cause of female-biased mortality ; while oiled carcasses have a sex ratio of 1:1 , females outnumber males in carcasses of starved birds .

Do you have any theories on why more female juveniles die at sea ? You mention starvation ; what might be the causes of that , and are there other possible explanations you can think of ?

They are also most vocal in the morning and evening , making their characteristic braying sound — the related African penguin earned the name " jackass penguin " because they sound a bit like donkeys .

The only other possibility is that females are moving to other colonies at higher rates than are males , but this species is known to almost always return to its natal colony to breed .

Although the project has evolved over time , Dr. Boersma had the foresight to start banding chicks in 1983 and to set up a standard protocol that we follow each year .

Magellanic penguins nest in burrows or bushes , and some areas of the colony are so dense with burrows that you feel like you 're on a different planet .

These disadvantages hit juvenile females even harder , as juveniles are still learning how to forage and often travel further than adults do in the non-breeding season .

Because the mortality is most uneven in juveniles , higher mortality does n’t seem to be related to greater costs of breeding for females than for males .
