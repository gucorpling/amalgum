It is important to note that , according to the analysis using the equations of cumulative interception ( Equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) ) and CRIR ( Equation ( 3 ) ) , the spatiotemporal variation of the LAI and rainfall will have a similar influence on the annual and regional variation of vegetation canopy rainfall interception at the basin scale of Guangdong .

It is worth noting that the rainfall interception model applied in our study only considered the parameters of the LAI and rainfall , while rainfall interception was also closely related to many other factors such as atmospheric drivers of evaporation ( e. g. , wind speed , vapor pressure deficit , etc. ) , canopy characteristics , rainfall intensity , and rainfall duration .

By analyzing the CRIRs of the basin-pairs in the four climatic zones with a similar forest coverage , we found that there was no significant difference in the canopy rainfall interception among the four climatic zones , while there was a significant correlation between forest coverage and the canopy rainfall interception within the basin .

Researchers have found that the leaf surface area contributes to differences in the interception capacities between broad-leaved forests , coniferous forests , and coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forests , and the total annual interception was greater for the species with a denser canopy ( e. g. , broad-leaved forest ) .

Combining the effects of the saturation of canopy rainfall interception and rainfall , the spatial homogeneity of annual rainfall magnifies the effects on the spatial pattern of CRIRs , while the spatial heterogeneity of annual mean LAI further diminishes the effects on spatial patterns of CRIR .

This spatial pattern was closely related to the LAI of vegetation , which mainly presents a spatial pattern extending from the Pearl River Delta to the periphery , and has little correlation with the spatial pattern characteristics of rainfall that gradually decrease from south to north .

From this study , we found that the CRIR at the basin scale in Guangdong ranged from 0.33 % and 11.67 % , which is similar to results in other studies in China that ranged from 0 % and 12 % .

Guangdong has many heavy rainfall events , and the leaves tend to reach their maximum saturation of rainfall interception , resulting in vegetation canopy rainfall interception depending mainly on the LAI , but not being restricted by the amount of rainfall .

As an interface for atmospheric rainfall in the vegetation ecosystem , vegetation canopy influences the redistribution of rainwater as well as the damping and retention of the water that reaches the soil , affecting runoff dynamics through interception .

In this study , we applied a canopy rainfall interception model coupled with MODIS_LAI remote sensing data to understand the spatial and temporal variation patterns of canopy rainfall interception at the basin scale in Guangdong Province , China .

In addition , the proportion of broad-leaved forest to the whole area of forest in the basin plays a critical role in the CRIR in Guangdong , which is similar to other results from previous research .

This is mainly because our study estimated the mean value of the CRIR for all vegetation ecosystems in the basin , which resulted in a lower estimated value when compared with that of a forest ecosystem .

We also found that the CRIR showed a significant spatial difference pattern that was high in the mountain areas of the eastern and western flanks , but low in the central mountainous region and coastal areas .

However , previous studies on canopy rainfall interception have mainly focused on individual plants or groups of plants through in situ observation and are limited by spatiotemporal estimation in larger areas .

However , many studies conducted in various forests have reached the opposite conclusion , demonstrating that the canopy interception capacity in coniferous forests was higher than that in broad-leaved forests .

However , since the canopy interception capacity is also determined by other meteorological and canopy parameters , further research is needed on these other factors .

This is because , as the annual mean LAI and annual rainfall increase , the spatial heterogeneity of LAI also increases (
