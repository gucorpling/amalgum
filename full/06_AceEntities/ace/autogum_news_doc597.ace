We also had close links with our collaborators Dr Chris Connelly and Dr Mary Palmer at Dundee University , who have recently published a study on actual bee brains , supplying data about what the same pesticides do to the neurons when actually applied directly to the brain areas of the bee involved in learning and memory .

A rather surprising finding on the memory test results was , that the bees could not tell the training odour , and a novel odour , apart- they responded to both equally , not preferring the odour associated with the sugar reward over the other odour which should have no rewarding associations .

: We had a control group of bees fed sugar solution alone , then we had a group fed sugar solution containing low levels of imidacloprid , a group fed sugar solution containing coumaphos , and a group of bees fed sugar solution containing both imidacloprid and coumaphos .

In the lab , we can blow a floral scent at the bee at the same time as delivering the sugar solution- soon , the bee learns to extend its proboscis in response to the scent , having learned that this particular scent indicates a sugar reward .

The pesticides were present at very low levels , similar to those which might be present in the nectar of flowers treated with imidacloprid , or to the levels of coumaphos which might be in the pollen and honey stores of a coumaphos-treated hive .

The learning experiment relies on a phenomenon called the Proboscis Extension Reflex ( PER ) whereby the bee extends its proboscis ( sticks out its tongue ) to receive a meal when the antennae are touched with sugar solution .

Another difficulty of bee work is , it is very weather dependant- if it rains or is cold , the bees are n't out foraging and the experiment has to be postponed until the weather improves .
