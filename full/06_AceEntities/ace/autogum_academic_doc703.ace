Examples of such laws include Cameroon ’s 2004 decentralization law that formalized the role of subdivisional councils in supporting local communities , Cameroon ’s 1996 decentralization law on freedom of association that permits NGOs to have a hand in environmental protection , and the 1994 state forestry law for the inclusion of indigenous people in forestry .

The case of MCNP , however , suggests that such practitioner roles in the hands of institutions , as well as the political rights that local people need in participation , could be amended through accountable and transparent forms of communication .

Such knowledge , being a conflation of ideas , should culturally and ecologically link to real-life practices recognizable by differences between the needs of locals who live in remote villages and those living closer to urban areas .

Second , regarding the paradox of co-management and the concerns of local people , the results revealed that many respondents in the focus groups had little awareness of forestry laws and the regulations for biodiversity conservation .

Furthermore , in elaborating on the fieldwork results , we identified observations , stressing on the one hand the concerns of local people , and on the other hand the role of small institutions .

This type of knowledge would include the convictions by which local people have lived ; as partners with the environment , they have been using it traditionally for much longer than MCNP has existed .

In previous studies , critiques of participation examined the undesirable outcomes of state-led participatory systems without much analysis of how institutional knowledge could better acknowledge the development needs of local people in co-management .

In these systems , institutions cooperate with locals to come to decisions about community projects and provide locals with first-hand information about how they intend to promote local knowledge of the environment .

Nevertheless , our inquiry on the subdivisional level of governance revealed the willingness of institutions to engage in dialogue about the local use of forests in making decisions for preserving biodiversity .

The pragmatism of these laws indicates that placing local knowledge that arises from the human‒environment relationship at the core of participation will avoid politicizing or imposing development on locals .

Third , in acknowledging the development needs of local people , MCNP showed that smaller institutions aiming to promote biodiversity conservation have difficulties with providing alternative livelihoods for locals .

That is , participation should be based on a two-way , open system of information exchange wherein locals can question institutional assistance , and institutions must justify their actions .

First , as to the legal basis for participation between institutions and local people , there are opportunities we can exploit for improving co-management despite its paradoxes .

While we agree with these assertions , our study suggests that legislation for participation should have pragmatic provisions that can be customized to enhance community involvement .

What we recommend , therefore , is that such eagerness for dialogue between locals and smaller institutions be utilized to create what call adaptive social‒ecological systems .
