The application of ZrPc/GO-based composite ( ZrPc with lysine ligand , LYS ; GO , graphite oxide ) for antibacterial PDT has already been shown by us , where the action against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 , Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 , and Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) ATCC 11229 was proven .

However , the influence of irradiation on enhanced antimicrobial activity of bis(LYS)ZrPc/GO materials was observed , particularly in the case of P. aeruginosa ( a multidrug resistant pathogen ) , where minimal inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) was equal to 0.32 mg/mL in comparison to 40 mg/mL needed for the nonirradiated sample .

The aim of this paper was to characterize two synthesized zirconium(IV ) phthalocyanines , axially substituted with different ligands ( hydrocarbon chains terminated with amino groups ) , which were used to obtain two hybrid materials with graphite oxide flakes .

In our study , we wanted to combine antimicrobial effects caused by two different factors — graphite oxide flakes and phthalocyanines activated by light — and use them against bacteria causing infection of the root canals of teeth .

The interaction with bacterial cell and the cell ’s response strongly depends on the physicochemical properties of the materials ( such as size , shape , structure , charge , etc. ) , as we have previously described .

However , it is difficult to explain this phenomenon in detail without deeper understanding of the interactions , and it is impossible to generalize the antibacterial mechanism of the compounds .

De Silva et al. indicated that conjugation of phthalocyanines with antibiotics also enhances the antibacterial activity of phthalocyanine – sulfonamides conjugate against Gram-negative bacteria .

For example , Nyamu et al. reviewed antibacterial efficacy of phthalocyanines and noticed that Gram-positive bacteria are more sensitive to phthalocyanines than Gram-negative bacteria .

One of the possible antibacterial mechanisms is interaction of the compounds with bacterial membrane , while the other is reactive oxygen species production .
