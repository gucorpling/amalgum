Wind energy systems and PV panels are actively used for zero energy buildings and the energy savings achieved using active elements have been compared and analyzed . Aldegheri et al. demonstrated that it is possible to achieve energy production equivalent to 43 % of the annual energy consumption of demonstration houses with building-integrated concentrating photovoltaics ( BICPVs ) .

In particular , they classified and examined time-series-type structures and construction methods and then proposed a relief housing system suitable for open system modular housing . Moon et al. mentioned that temporary housing is affected by climate , structure , material , and duration of use , with structure being the most important factor .

In South Korea , studies on disaster relief housing are mostly related to architectural planning , such as planning requirements for temporary housing facilities , construction methodology , and functional demands . Kim et al. examined different types and plans for temporary housing relief as architectural countermeasures for disaster refugees .

It is important for modular housing to be suitable for various climates . Zubair et al. showed that the cooling load could be reduced by 12.3 % by installing a PV panel on net present cost(NPC)-based roof , even in hot climates .

Later , on-site methods , where components are assembled at the construction site , and out-site methods , where the components are assembled in a factory before transportation , were developed ; this is called the modularization method .

In situations where the structures are not secured to make them stable , horizontal expansion is common ; in contrast , modular and container-type buildings have a steel structure that facilitates vertical expansion .
