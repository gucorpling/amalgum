Newman , in fact , had declined an invitation personally given by the Princess Borealska , an inquiring Polish lady to whom he had been presented , on the ground that on that particular day he always dined at Mrs. Tristram ’s ; and it was only a tenderly perverse theory of his hostess of the Avenue d’Iéna that he was faithless to his early friendships .

She is a charming woman , and she has five hundred merits ; but you had better keep that in mind . ” Was Mrs. Tristram simply finding out that she was jealous of her dear friend on the other side of the Seine , and that in undertaking to provide Newman with an ideal wife she had counted too much on her own disinterestedness ?

She now seemed inclined to take a purely critical view of Madame de Cintré , and wished to have it understood that she did not in the least answer for her being a compendium of all the virtues . “ No woman was ever so good as that woman seems , ” she said .

Newman continued to see his friends the Tristrams with a good deal of frequency , though if you had listened to Mrs. Tristram ’s account of the matter you would have supposed that they had been cynically repudiated for the sake of grander acquaintance .
