Although new regulations that force ICE technology to be more environmentally friendly must always be welcome , prohibitions motivated by a poor diagnosis of the situation will not help at all , neither to improve air quality nor to mitigate global warming .

In some countries like the USA , China , Russia , Poland , South Korea , or Germany , fossil fuels , including a good percentage of coal , remain the largest source of energy as a raw material for electricity production .

Therefore , with the current energy mix and with an analysis of the complete life cycle , the so-called analysis from the cradle to the grave , the alternative to electric motors will not eliminate global CO2 emissions .

The arguments supporting this position consider the growing demand for transport , the strong development of cleaner and more efficient ICEs , the availability of fossil fuels , and the high energy density of said conventional fuels .

The problem is that electricity must be produced , most usually from non-renewable energy sources , which equals around 60 % in energy losses , and then transported , which adds 20 % of additional losses .
