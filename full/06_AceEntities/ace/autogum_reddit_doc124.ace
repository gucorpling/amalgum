Its far better to accept it is how it is and just tune out to what you do n't like ( or even ' thats not for me ' like with player housing ) .

I do n't mind having a store at all it is actually nice for quite a few things but there should be some methods to earn things in game as well .

We do purchase the game and expansions so this is not a f2p game there is no reason we should be treated like it s a f2p game .

I consider SWTOR to be one of the worst F2P models in the history of gaming yet somehow ESO is much worse in some ways .

I was wondering are there any other mounts you can earn in game or are the 4 horses all you can get ?

Out of 74 mounts only 4 can be earned in game ? 95 % of mounts you must pay for ?

Since 2014 the only mounts you can purchase in game are the same 4 from when the game was released .

When crown crates first came out you could easily get 400 Gems with 15 or so crates maybe 20 .

At least with SWTOR you can purchase the items from crates on the auction house from other people .

Also with recent rulings in other countries I imagine crown crates would be deemed gambling in those countries .
