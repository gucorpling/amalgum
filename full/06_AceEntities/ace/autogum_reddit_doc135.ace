I 'm old school , like Rising Sun/Toonami old school , and I do n't know what 's been going on lately but my friends are saying super is awesome and I 've been seeing these anime figures where Goku and Vegeta have blue hair and then Goku has pink hair and I 'm like what the fuck ?

I assumed you were more interested in the anime than the manga but just in case you want to read it all , the leanest route for the manga ( IMO it is best to read in the order they were released and not in chronological order ) :

If I was to start it from the very beginning , to get the most out of super , should I read the Dragon Ball Manga and DBZ manga this time or should I re-watch Dragon Ball and DBZ , but not GT and then Super ?

The movies : Battle of The Gods and Resurrection F can be watched as standalone before Super in the timeline if you want ( bearing in mind that early arcs of Super cover the same stories ) .

Since Kai is just a remastered and limited filler version DBZ so you can substitute it if you have a high nostalgia for DBZ otherwise Kai is about half as long .

Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z were not separate in manga so <Dragon Ball> covers the entire story up to the end of DBZ and can be found in color .

There is also prequel manga <Jaco the Galactic Patrolman> which comes before Dragon Ball chronologically but only serves to introduce a few characters for Super .

Also I heard there were colored comics in Japanese ? I 'm learning Japanese and I can probably read them so what 's that about ?

None of the other movies were based on the manga Toriyama 's stories so it is doubtful that they are canon .

The series will probably continue once enough chapters gets released so that the series can run without catching up too quickly .
