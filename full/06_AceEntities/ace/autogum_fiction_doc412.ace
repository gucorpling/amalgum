It was the ticking of the clock upon the mantelpiece ; and I thought how this sound must have been familiar to Abel Slattin , how it must have formed part and parcel of his life , as it were , and how it went on now -- tick-tick-tick-tick -- whilst he , for whom it had ticked , lay unheeding -- would never heed it more .

Vague creakings from within the house , sounds as though of stealthy footsteps upon the stair , set my nerves tingling ; but Nayland Smith gave no sign , and I knew that my imagination was magnifying these ordinary night sounds out of all proportion to their actual significance .

Tick-tick-tick-tick went the clock , and , with my heart still thumping noisily in my breast , I began to count the tickings ; one , two , three , four , five , and so on to a hundred , and from one hundred to many hundreds .

There was a little China Buddha upon the bureau in one corner , with a gilded cap upon its head , and as some reflection of the moonlight sought out this little cap , my thoughts grotesquely turned upon the murdered man ’s gold tooth .

So wore on the night ; and , when the ticking clock hollowly boomed the hour of one , I almost leaped out of my chair , so highly strung were my nerves , and so appallingly did the sudden clangor beat upon them .

Of all the sounds which , one by one , now began to detach themselves from the silence , there was a particular sound , homely enough at another time , which spoke to me more dreadfully than the rest .

Nayland Smith waved to me to take a stand on the other side of the opened door -- behind it , in fact , where I should be concealed from the view of any one descending the stair .

Lighting the topmost landing of the house was a sort of glazed trap , evidently set in the floor of a loft-like place extending over the entire building .
