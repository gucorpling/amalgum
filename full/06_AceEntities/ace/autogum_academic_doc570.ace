The heterogeneous nature of the samples , in terms of diverse materials used ( i. e. , metals , glass , ceramics ) , the irregular shape of the particles due to the different physical properties of the materials ( e. g. , round ball-like shaped , elongated rod-like shapes , cubic-like ) and associated software developed for mineral analysis are some of the issues that could face by automated analysis .

The study of the degree of liberation was initially introduced in the mineral processing field , where the main objective was to achieve selective liberation of the valuable minerals of interest aiming for the coarsest particle size possible , saving energy on the grinding process and reducing the amount of non-desirable fine fractions produced .
