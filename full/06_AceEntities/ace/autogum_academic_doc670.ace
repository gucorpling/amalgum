Firstly , even when matched for co-morbidities , duration of symptoms , sex , smoking status and severity of functional impairment , younger adults report significantly worse effects on their baseline physical and mental quality of life scores compared to the older aged cohort .

Suggested mechanisms for this discrepancy include the fact that elderly patients often present with increased duration of symptoms at diagnosis , often have difficulty accessing specialist assessment and imaging , and also have less neurological plasticity or reserve compared to younger adults .

However , age-related effects on health perception have been found to influence the SF-36 score , and the contribution from the perception of physical effects often misses a number of important determinants of overall quality of life in older persons .

Careful evaluation has discovered a number of predictors of clinical outcomes from surgery for DCM , including baseline severity of impairment , duration of symptoms , presence of systemic or psychological co-morbidities , obesity , and of course age .

The traditional doctrine of the use of surgery to ‘ arrest clinical progression ’ has been replaced with a more modern approach with decompressive surgery used as a means to provide both functional and quality of life improvement .

Both PCS and MCS metrics echoed the functional improvement in that the younger cohort had a significantly greater degree of improvement from baseline compared to the older cohort ( p < 0.001 , p = 0.007 ) .

DCM is a disease that can cause a significant amount of potentially reversible or preventable neurological disability in the elderly population , and therefore concerted efforts should be made to improve decision-making strategies for this patient group .

The assessment of quality of life metrics has become particularly important in the examination of patients with mild functional impairment ( or asymptomatic cord compression ) , and is the focus of a number of studies .

This study is the first to report this difference in quality of life measures between younger and older aged cohorts and has potentially large implications on pre-surgical assessment and counselling in older patients with DCM .

When the change from baseline scores at 2 years is calculated , it becomes evident that the functional improvement seen after surgery is of a greater magnitude in younger patients compared to the older cohort .

It appears that older patients ’ mental perception of quality of life remains stable throughout the treatment period , despite having a worse functional improvement , and less magnitude of quality of life improvement overall .

Renewed focus on functional and quality of life outcomes after surgery for DCM in adults has come from rigorous scrutiny of the results of several large-scale studies in the last decade .

For these reasons , it has been suggested that the focus of quality of life determinants in the elderly should be weighted toward mental components rather than the physical .

Firstly , as the younger cohort were of working age , the psychological impact of DCM may be greater if employment security is perceived to be threatened .

Secondly , the elderly patients demonstrate psychological resilience or adaptations/support that mean the symptoms of DCM have a less pronounced effect on their quality of life .

Taking the older cohort in isolation , this is good evidence that surgery is an effective modality to produce functional improvements in elderly DCM patients .

Many elderly patients also present a high , sometimes unacceptable , surgical risk profile that makes decisions regarding surgical management less appropriate .
