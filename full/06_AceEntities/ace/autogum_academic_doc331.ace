Healthy cork oak trees showed higher NDVI and CI temporal mean values and lower temporal standard deviation values than unhealthy trees , which is easily explained by the fact that being an evergreen tree , its spectral response in the near infrared region is relatively stable along the year .

NDVI and CI were the vegetation indices that maximised the discrimination between healthy and unhealthy cork oak trees when using data corresponding to the driest period of 2018 , which occurred from the beginning of September until the beginning of October .

During the rainy season , the increase in the spectral response of both types of trees in the near infrared region results from the spectral contribution of the understory to cork oak reflectance , particularly for trees with small crowns .

Both approaches enabled the establishment of three simultaneous conditions for site HMG , which applied to the other test area ( site CL ) were able to detect around 68 % of the unhealthy trees identified on the field .

For this purpose , the temporal variability of two samples of healthy and unhealthy trees identified within the two in situ data collection sites considered in this study was analysed using different vegetation indices .

The algorithm relies first on the binary segmentation and filtering of a SAVI image , followed by an iterative method based on the Euclidean distance of the binary image to detect each tree centre .

This might be explained by the higher degree of defoliation exhibited by trees with loss of vitality , implying a reduced photosynthetic activity and consequently a lower spectral response in the near infrared region .

The ratio between the temporal mean and the temporal standard deviation calculated with data acquired during the dry season seems to be useful for the identification of cork oak trees with less vitality .

A dense Sentinel-2 time series , covering a time period of around 18 months , was used to evaluate the potential of this free and open data for monitoring cork oak vitality .

Alternatively , the NDVI-derived VCI and CI-derived VCI also improved the discrimination between healthy and unhealthy cork oak trees when using a cumulative distribution function ( CDF ) .
