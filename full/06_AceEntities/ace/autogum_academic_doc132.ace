In accommodation of this request Illwerke vkw installed a fast charging infrastructure that is owned by them and can be used by customers that own a vkw membership card , but it is also connected to the company ’s premises and therefore easily accessible by its employees .

Because of this , and contrary to most other use scenarios that include solar power , ASKO has a demand curve that follows the production curve of the PV system quite well as the demand for keeping goods cold correlates with the supply of solar energy .

This was a decision based on a measure of comparability , as the cases — the Austrian VLOTTE and the Norwegian ASKO — both were smart grid experiments with certain similar features which made them interesting for comparison .

However , at the same time , both activities can be characterized as mission-oriented innovation , as they aimed to contribute to a decarbonized transport sector in general .
