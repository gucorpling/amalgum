However , these methods do not yield standardized measures that can be consistently compared in space and time , and are also affected by the limited length of the records , as they rely on satellite-derived data , and as such , are not suitable for evaluating long-term droughts to capture natural climatic and hydrologic variability that manifest over multi-decadal scales due to limited data availability .

However , soil moisture has not been extensively monitored in most parts of the world ( Ethiopia included ) , as doing so has proven to be challenging due to the high level of spatio-temporal variability of this parameter and lack of reliable methods for upscaling point level measurements to larger spatial scales .

In areas where soil moisture data are unavailable to validate model- or remote-sensed-based soil moisture products , drought indices that utilize temperature-based potential evapotranspiration , in addition to rainfall , to indirectly capture the effects of soil moisture deficits have been proposed , and are often used to characterize agricultural droughts .

In this regard , Vicente-Serrano et al. indicated that the method used to estimate PET has little bearing on the computation of SPEI , and recommended using the Thornthwaite model which allows the use of the SPEI drought index with minimal data requirements .

Binary time series can also be compared to determine the level of agreement between various drought indices , and can be used to construct contingency tables and perform a wide array of statistical analyses to compare meteorological- and agriculture-related droughts .

While SPEI is a meteorological drought indicator , and does not explicitly model soil moisture dynamics , it is known to correlate well with agricultural droughts , as the atmospheric water budget ( P-PET ) affects surface soil dryness .
