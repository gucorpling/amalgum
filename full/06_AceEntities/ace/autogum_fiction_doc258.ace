The evening before he went he wrote a note to the archdeacon , explaining that he should start on the morrow on his journey ; that it was his intention to see the attorney-general if possible , and to decide on his future plans in accordance with what he heard from that gentleman ; he excused himself for giving Dr Grantly no earlier notice , by stating that his resolve was very sudden ; and having entrusted this note to Eleanor , with the perfect , though not expressed , understanding that it was to be sent over to Plumstead Episcopi without haste , he took his departure .

But a solitary dinner in an old , respectable , sombre , solid London inn , where nothing makes any noise but the old waiter 's creaking shoes ; where one plate slowly goes and another slowly comes without a sound ; where the two or three guests would as soon think of knocking each other down as of speaking ; where the servants whisper , and the whole household is disturbed if an order be given above the voice , -- what can be more melancholy than a mutton chop and a pint of port in such a place ?

He would go direct from Court to the House ; all appointments were , as a rule , made at the chambers ; the clerk could by no means promise an interview for the next day ; was able , on the other hand , to say that such interview was , he thought , impossible ; but that Sir Abraham would certainly be at the House in the course of the night , where an answer from himself might possibly be elicited .

Mr Harding calculated that for that one day he was safe ; his son-in-law , he had no doubt , would arrive in town by an early train , but not early enough to reach the truant till he should have escaped from his hotel after breakfast ; and could he thus manage to see the lawyer on that very day , the deed might be done before the archdeacon could interfere .

His visits to London of late had not been frequent ; but in those happy days when " Harding 's Church Music " was going through the press , he had been often there ; and as the publisher 's house was in Paternoster Row , and the printer 's press in Fleet Street , the Chapter Hotel and Coffee House had been convenient .

No schoolboy ever ran away from school with more precaution and more dread of detection ; no convict , slipping down from a prison wall , ever feared to see the gaoler more entirely than Mr Harding did to see his son-in-law as he drove up in the pony carriage to the railway station , on the morning of his escape to London .

A dinner , though eaten alone , in a country hotel may be worthy of some energy ; the waiter , if you are known , will make much of you ; the landlord will make you a bow and perhaps put the fish on the table ; if you ring you are attended to , and there is some life about it .

Had he dared , he would on this occasion have gone elsewhere to throw the archdeacon further off the scent ; but he did not know what violent steps his son-in-law might take for his recovery if he were not found at his usual haunt , and he deemed it not prudent to make himself the object of a hunt through London .
