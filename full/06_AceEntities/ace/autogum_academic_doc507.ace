Four phase III studies were identified : coBRIM , a phase III trial of cobimetinib plus vemurafenib versus vemurafenib monotherapy in previously untreated patients with advanced BRAF -mutant melanoma ; COMBI-d , a phase III trial of dabrafenib and trametinib versus dabrafenib monotherapy in previously untreated patients with unresectable stage IIIC or stage IV melanoma with a BRAF V600E or V600K mutation ; COMBI-v , a phase III trial of dabrafenib plus trametinib versus vemurafenib monotherapy in previously untreated patients with unresectable stage IIIC or IV melanoma with BRAF mutation ; and COLUMBUS Part 1 , a phase III trial of encorafenib plus binimetinib versus vemurafenib or encorafenib monotherapy in patients with BRAF -mutant melanoma .

The data sources for the coBRIM and COMBI-v trials included primary and secondary publications of data , European public assessment reports ( EPAR ) , U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) medical review documents , and the current U.S. prescribing information ( see Table S5 , which illustrates the data sources and cutoff dates for COMBI-v , coBRIM , and COLUMBUS trials ) .

The adverse event data included the overall summaries ( comprising all-grade , serious , and grade 3/4 AEs , and AEs leading to death , dose interruption/modification , and discontinuation ) and the incidence of specific all-grade and grade 3/4 AEs by individual preferred terms per the MedDRA dictionary .

Three of the identified studies ( coBRIM , COMBI-v , and COLUMBUS Part 1 ) , had vemurafenib 960 mg twice daily ( BID ) as a control arm , and were the chief sources of data for the comparisons presented here .

Although the COMBI-d was identified as part of the initial literature search , it was not included in the efficacy comparison of the cross-trial comparison due to the lack of a vemurafenib control arm .
