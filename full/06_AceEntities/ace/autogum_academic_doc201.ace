Despite there are many classical methods but artificial intelligence-based methods are extensively used during the last couple of decades that attempt to uncover weak signals and pattern more reliable and accurate . As Kourou et al. noted these methods can discover and identify patterns and relationships between them , from complex datasets , while they are able to effectively predict future outcomes .
