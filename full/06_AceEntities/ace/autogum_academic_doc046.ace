Here , we determine a structural model for the full-length human DHDDS homodimer using an integrative approach that combines multiple sources of information , including a radioligand-based enzyme kinetics assay , size-exclusion chromatography multi-angle light scattering ( SEC-MALS ) , small-angle X-ray scattering ( SAXS ) , and hydrogen – deuterium exchange mass-spectrometry ( HDX-MS ) .

Conserved domains search analysis reveals that the cis -prenyltransferase catalytic domain of DHDDS ( residues 24 – 248 ) is homologous to undecaprenyl pyrophosphate synthase ( UPPS ) , a well characterized bacterial cis -prenyltransferase .

In line with the important role of DHDDS in protein glycosylation , mutations in DHDDS were recently shown to cause autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa , a fatal glycosylation disorder , and developmental epileptic encephalopathies .

Accordingly , even slight variations in protein glycosylation can markedly affect proteins structure and function and , thus , glycosylation disorders result in a wide range of clinical syndromes affecting practically every organ system .

Importantly , while previous studies revealed that DHDDS is required and sufficient for this catalytic activity , NgBR induces an increase in the expression and activity of the complex but exhibits no catalytic activity .

N-glycosylation is a critical post-translational modification , in which an oligosaccharide moiety is transferred from the glycosyl carrier dolichol-phosphate ( Dol-P ) and covalently attaches to a polypeptide chain via an asparagine residue .

Consisting of seven α-helices and six β-strands , this domain forms dimers , with a hydrophobic catalytic tunnel surrounded by two α-helices and four β−strands within each monomer .

Intriguingly , despite the low level of conservation , a C-terminal domain is common to long-chain cis -prenyltransferases and is absent in short- and medium-chain cis -prenyltransferases (

In contrast with the N-terminal cis -prenyltransferase homology domain , the C-terminus of human DHDDS does not converge with any known conserved domains .
