During the deletion discussion , Jimmy Wales commented " I encourage people to go to commons and work to explain to the community there some of the concepts behind Hostile environment sexual harrassment . I encourage everyone to seriously consider whether it is appropriate behavior to upload a clearly non-notable film of someone using his penis to paint a picture of a Wikipedia volunteer . It is harassment , it is trolling , and I am deeply disappointed to have to point this out to some people . " What do you think of his response to your artwork ?

I had a request to paint a portrait , to do [ this ] portrait of Jimmy Wales with a video of me painting , by Russavia ( who is an editor at Wikipedia ) , something I do all the time and I have great feedback as to how funny the videos are ; I had no idea who Jimmy Wales was at the time of the request , but painted him only once so it ca n't be called Harassment .

: Harassment is when one continually annoys someone , over and over again ; I only painted the one painting of him and it to my mind was not offensive , I consider my work as satire just like late night TV , something that gives light relief to a serious subject .
