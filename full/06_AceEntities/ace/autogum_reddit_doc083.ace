I think it 's very possible Shep makes the 53 as a special teams ace since there are enough receivers ahead of him that his value on special teams is higher than a #6 receiver ( so really a #8 passing target because of Greg CMC ) who does n't strengthen our ST as much .

Byrd and Smith would be likely to play the same role in the offense , so I think there 's a chance Wright makes the team as basically Funch 's backup and it comes down to whether Smith is enough better than Byrd to make up for the age difference

I mean the ideal situation is CMC is Brian Westbrook , Funch is like Moose Alshon Jeffery Dez Bryant Brandon Marshall , Samuel is like Tyreek Hill Percy Harvin , and Moore is like Steve Smith Antonio Brown .

He and Shep did n't really click ( which would matter way less if Shep is the #6 receiver instead of , at times last year , the #2 ) .

That 's what the offensive coaches will be daydreaming about , and while it 's unlikely everyone reaches that level , each of them has the potential to do so .

If they all maximize their potential and we have anything resembling an O-Line and a healthy Cam we 'll have a top 5 offense year-in year-out for several years .

We know he has good chemistry with Funchess , Olsen & CMC , so to break into that tier of targets , Cam will have to trust the player .
