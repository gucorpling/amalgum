We are largely desensitized to the marvels of modern chemistry ; however , when we take a step back we notice that chemistry has led to the creation of powders and liquids which sooth pain , allow us to become hyper focused and awake , allow us to build muscle faster , the list goes on .

Sure , these could also be considered feats of physics or engineering but the line between particle physics and chemistry has always been fuzzy and engineering is a matter of application . tl ; dr chemistry is magic

However , both could be considered mysterious to those not in-the-know and I would argue that modern chemistry is more complex and difficult to grasp than alchemy which had relatively simple explanations for natural phenomena .

When we look at modern dictionary definitions of magic it is described as something along the lines of having " the power of apparently influencing the course of events by using mysterious or supernatural forces .
