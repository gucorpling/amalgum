Reports from the last decade point out that physical contact with the wound is a less important effect of the larval presence within the wound , and is probably a negative effect for the patient , who may feel a physical presence and wiggling in the wound .

Once necrosis is effectively removed , the consecutive stages of healing are facilitated by the increased phagocytic activity of leukocytes and higher oxygen pressure , resulting in optimum conditions for the regeneration of damaged tissues .
