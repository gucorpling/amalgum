He did this from time to time with such effect that he seemed to wander through the old years with his hand in the arm of a companion who was , in the most extraordinary manner , his other , his younger self ; and to wander , which was more extraordinary yet , round and round a third presence -- not wandering she , but stationary , still , whose eyes , turning with his revolution , never ceased to follow him , and whose seat was his point , so to speak , of orientation .

He had settled to his safety and accepted perforce his extinction ; figuring to himself , with some colour , in the likeness of certain little old men he remembered to have seen , of whom , all meagre and wizened as they might look , it was related that they had in their time fought twenty duels or been loved by ten princesses .

He stayed away , after this , for a year ; he visited the depths of Asia , spending himself on scenes of romantic interest , of superlative sanctity ; but what was present to him everywhere was that for a man who had known what he had known the world was vulgar and vain .
