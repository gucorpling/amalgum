To improve the hydrothermal stability of silica membranes , various silicon compounds with different functional groups were studied such as silanes containing organic functional groups ( methyl , propyl , hexyl , phenyl , and vinyl ) attached directly to a single silicon atom , and alkoxy siloxanes bridged with ≡Si – R – Si≡ structures ( e. g. , bis(triethoxysilyl)ethane ) .

Nomura et al. studied methyl groups in silicon compounds and developed silica membranes deposited with five kinds of silica precursors including tetramethyl orthosilicate ( TMOS ) , methyltrimethoxysilane ( MTMOS ) , dimethyldimethoxysilane ( DMDMOS ) , and trimethylmethoxy-silane ( TMMOS ) using the chemical vapor deposition ( CVD ) method , in which oxygen was added to the synthesis mixture .

The work here builds upon the previous research of Nomura et al. by conducting CVD under different conditions than those used previously , and uses additional characterization techniques , such as Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy ( FTIR ) , to probe deeper into the microstructure of these silica membranes .

Furthermore , the gas permeation properties were investigated for various gas species not tested by Nomura et al. , and all results were fitted to known gas diffusion mechanisms in an effort to gain insight into the mechanism of transport across a wide array of gas species .

One functional group that was studied is the addition of phenyl groups , such as dimethoxydiphenylsilane . Ohta et al. and Zhang et al. , for example , developed silica membranes deposited with silicon compounds containing zero , one , two , or three phenyl groups .

In that work , with increasing number of methyl groups in the silica precursor , the H2 permeance reached a maximum of 9.0 × 10−7 mol∙m−2∙s−1∙Pa−1 at 600 °C using DMDMOS , but then declined for TMMOS .

This increase in pore size has the potential to increase H2 permeance while maintaining high selectivity toward larger organic species such as methylcyclohexane ( kinetic diameter : 0.60 nm ) and toluene ( 0.59 nm ) .

Finally , they concluded that the TMOS-derived membrane was the best among the five membranes because of the smooth membrane surface , the dense silica , and the lowest activation energy for H2 permeation .
