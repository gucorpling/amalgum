Thanks to the locally factorized structure of the joint likelihood function , the cooperative localization problem can be addressed under the framework of factor graph . Inference and estimation tasks are typically carried out on a factor graph by message passing between variable nodes and factor nodes .

If the outlier distance and position are regarded as key information of a virtual anchor , this will cause a large derivation in the subsequent iteration , leading , finally , to disruption of the whole network and localization failure .
