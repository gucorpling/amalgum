Billy swung his right for his foe 's jaw -- a terrible blow that would have ended the fight had it landed -- but the man side-stepped it , and Billy 's momentum carried him sprawling upon his face . When he regained his feet the “ white hope ” was waiting for him , and Billy went down again to lie there , quite still , while the hand of the referee marked the seconds : One . Two .

Professor Cassidy , shrewd and experienced , saw it even as soon as Billy realized it -- he saw the fading of his high hopes -- he saw his castles in Spain tumbling in ruins about his ears -- he saw his huge giant lying prone within that squared circle as the hand of the referee rose and fell in cadence to the ticking of seconds that would count his man out .

These men he cleaned up as handily as he had the others , so that it was apparent to fight fandom that the big , quiet “ unknown ” was a comer ; and pretty soon Professor Cassidy received an offer from another trainer-manager to match Billy against a real “ hope ” who stood in the forefront of hopedom .

It was the first time he ever had stepped into a ring with a first-rate fighter , and as he saw the huge muscles of his antagonist and recalled the stories he had heard of his prowess and science , Billy , for the first time in his life , felt a tremor of nervousness .
