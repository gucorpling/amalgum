Both vehicles should be taken out in response to special circumstances IMO and only then . - Sixth = I do n't know if penta was joking but apparently his DOC character got fired for hitting Iceman with a baton while actively assaulting wrangler > he perma'ed . - Seventh = wtf is up with if you kill an AI in 1st or 2nd degree you 're going to court ? that shits dumb and not fun to watch .

Shit like this may be why you 're only seeing 10-15 people on and half of those being cops . ~~ edit : think this was more of a reaction , my bad , but it really does seem like less people are interested in civ/crim rp lately as cops are typically always full but the other side has been bare outside of the usual .

That 's not to mention dazzler shot gambino in the back multiple times even though he did n't have a gun ( but announced on the radio he did ) < never any ramifications for this stuff . edit : for my first point , comments have kind of changed my mind .

This court stuff should be 99 % a result of PvP interaction . ~~While this is about " realistic RP " I think were inching to a point where some cops are only focused on winning rather than RPing with their " family " .

In story Dazzler is a corrupt cop and I think he lied about Gambino having a gun so he could shot him , so its all part of the story(just a theory ) .
