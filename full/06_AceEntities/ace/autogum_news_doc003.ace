The study itself outlined the tight correlation between the absence of white sharks and the presence of sevengills : " [ S]evengill sharks [ ... ] were only detected during the prolonged periods of complete white shark absence , disappearing from our surveys during the intermittent short periods when white sharks temporarily returned to Seal Island , albeit in very low numbers , only to reappear when the white sharks were again absent from surveys[ . ]

The researchers noted the sevengill sharks might not have the same effect on the ecosystems involved as the great whites have had , citing the ecological disruption apparently caused off Alaska when a change in orca behavior had a knock-on effect , disrupting sea otters ' predation of sea urchins , whose population then exploded , plowing through the area 's kelp forests .

The scientists behind the present study only noted various hypotheses about the cause of the disappearance of great white sharks from this area , though Dr. Alison Kock of the University of Cape Town has reported a correlation with the entry of orcas into False Bay , possibly because human activity has rendered prey hard to find elsewhere .

On Wednesday , scientists from the University of Miami and Apex Shark Expeditions published a study in Scientific Reports , an on-line journal , documenting the disappearance of the great white shark ( Carcharodon carcharias ) from a specific area off the coast of South Africa .

The sevengill and great white are both ordinarily apex predators and seek some of the same food , such as cape fur seals , but great whites can also prey directly on sevengills .

The great white shark population remained relatively stable until 2015 , at which point their numbers went into sharp decline , sometimes reaching zero during 2017 â€“ 2018 .

The sevengill has seven gills , whereas most species of shark have only five gills on each side of their bodies .
