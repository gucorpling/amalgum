Once spotlight is open type in quicktimeplayer this will bring up the application ( it comes with the computer so every one has it ) now this is the confusing part . go up to the bar with the apple symbol and the battery percentage and what time it is and what not and click the button that says ' file ' . from there you want to click ' new screen recording ' it will bring up a gray bar on your sceen . then just click on the red button on the gray bar and select the area of the screen you would like to record ( or just click the screen to record the whole screen ) .
