These findings indicate three themes : ( 1 ) desiccation similarly affects gene regulation in prominent representative vectors from both the Culicinae and Anophelinae subfamilies , ( 2 ) the outcome of realized infection with arthropod-borne disease is partially dependent upon the metrics by which infectivity is determined , and ( 3 ) ecological consequences of the underdeveloped and sometimes confounding interactions between dehydration , disease infection , and heat exposure dynamics must be addressed .

These genes include an ionotropic glutamate receptor , which is similar to some D. melanogaster ionotropic receptors that have been implicated in hygro- or thermo-sensation ( such as IR25a , IR40a , or IR93a ) ; and , a heat shock protein ( Hsp90 ) that has also been implicated in increased desiccation tolerance in C. pipiens .

It is becoming apparent that the net difference in vectorial capacity must be determined by understanding both the ecological effects and altered biological components of the vector . An improved understanding of how environmental effects , heat , cold , and dehydration directly affect mosquito physiology should be emphasized in future research .

Recent publications have explicitly noted a lapse in knowledge on several facets of vector ecology , such as the relationships between environmental factors and disease ecology , vector-host interactions and virus ecology , and a disparity in findings that precipitation positively or negatively correlates to human infection with WNV .
