On the contrary , no pattern distortion and high diffraction intensity were observed in the on-axis TKD because the angle α was close to 90 °. Consequently , in the off-axis TKD , the probe current and/or exposure time have to be increased to produce an equivalent pattern quality .

Therefore , at their optimal parameters , the beam current used in the off-axis TKD method should be higher than that in the on-axis TKD method , which leads to a larger spatial resolution .

As the electron beam is scanned close to a grain boundary , the interaction volumes of both sides overlap , which leads to overlapping Kikuchi patterns , and thus to a decreased correlation coefficient .

In the off-axis TKD , the intersection angle had a magnitude of only a few degrees , which led to a high gnomonic distortion and low diffraction intensity .

Similarly , if we set equal parameters for both TKD methods , the pattern quality in the off-axis TKD method would be worse owing to its lower intensity .

Thus , if the whole pattern ( 640 × 480 pixels ) is considered , the correlation coefficient would deviate and the results would be inaccurate .
