He thought the Moreens looked at him as if he were almost too smart , as if they ought to take care not to spoil him . If Mr. Moreen had n’t been such a man of the world he would perhaps have spoken of the freedom of such neckties on the part of a subordinate .

These apartments , the rooms they wanted , were generally very splendid ; but fortunately they never could get them — fortunately , I mean , for Pemberton , who reflected always that if they had got them there would have been a still scantier educational fund .

He cornered Mr. and Mrs. Moreen again and let them know that if on the spot they did n’t pay him all they owed him he would n’t only leave their house but would tell Morgan exactly what had brought him to it .

They went to an hotel , where they stayed three months , and then moved to another establishment , explaining that they had left the first because , after waiting and waiting , they could n’t get the rooms they wanted .

But it was during the ensuing time that the real problem came up — the problem of how far it was excusable to discuss the turpitude of parents with a child of twelve , of thirteen , of fourteen .

On the other hand Morgan had quite lighted on the truth — he really should n’t be able to keep it up much longer ; therefore why not let him know one ’s real motive for forsaking him ?
