While it provides relevant explanation of the radiosensitivity of syndromes caused by mutations of cytoplasmic proteins , the RIANS model appears to be compatible with all the alternative models , as ATM is upstream of all the cascades of radiation-induced phosphorylations involved in the individual response to IR .

Group III ( <1 % whole population ) represents the ATM -mutated patients with no functional ATM kinase or those who show strong DSB repair defects ( like the LIG4 -mutated patient described above ) , hyper-radiosensitivity , and either high cancer proneness or severe accelerated aging .

Recently , the delay in the radiation-induced nucleo-shuttling of ATM protein ( RIANS ) was shown to be a reliable parameter for predicting radiosensitivity and to provide a biologically relevant interpretation of the linear-quadratic model , the mathematical basis of the cellular radiation response .

In addition , some genetic syndromes , associated or not with cancer proneness , different from the precited ones , also show a moderate radiosensitivity : this is notably the case of neurofibromatosis , Huntington ’s chorea , and tuberous sclerosis syndromes .

Surprisingly , ATM has not been integrated in all the DSB repair models discussed above while mutations of RAD51 and RAD52 ( for HR ) and Ku and DNA-PKcs ( for NHEJ ) do not cause any viable syndromes in humans (

Group II ( about 5 – 20 % of whole population ) represents the patients who elicit a moderate radiosensitivity with a delay in the RIANS due to the sequestration of ATM by mutated and over-expressed substrates .

The question of how to build a unified model that would describe both hyper-radiosensitivity observed in LIG4 - and ATM -mutated cells and moderate radiosensitivity caused by impairment of alternative signaling and DSB repair pathways remains .

It must be stressed that these syndromes are caused by mutations of cytoplasmic proteins , which may contradict the historical hypothesis that nucleus is the most radiosensitive part of the cell ( see the Introduction ) .

In the context of the RIANS model , the following mechanistic hypothesis has been proposed : after irradiation , cytoplasmic trans-auto-phosphorylated dimeric forms of ATM become monomeric and diffuse to the nucleus .

By contrast , in cells with moderate radiosensitivity , over-expressed ATM substrates may delay the RIANS , thereby favoring cancer proneness and aging .
