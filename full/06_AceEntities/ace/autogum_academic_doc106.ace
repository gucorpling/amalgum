The new-generation migrants who are motivated by the superior urban lifestyle and prosperous career development in the big cities are generally better educated and skilled , and are more likely to work in the advanced manufacturing industries and the well-paid service industries than in the traditional construction industry , based on Richard Florida ’s study and an empirical observation on China ’s industrial upgrading .

The great variance between cohorts has attracted much attention , too , as the old rural workers ( nongmingong , known as migrant labors from rural areas ) and the new-generation migrant workers ( those born in the 1980s and afterwards ) coexist together in the huge labor market in the Chinese metropolises .
