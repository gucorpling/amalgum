One pilot study showed that acetylcholinesterase ( AChE ) inhibitor promoted functional recovery in elderly patients with cognitive impairment who had suffered stroke . In a rat model of chronic ischemic , AChE activity was slightly decreased in the frontal cortex , but muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1 was gradually depleted in cerebral cortex , striatum and hippocampus that are involved in cognitive function .

To date , only a few blood biomarkers for predicting PSD have been examined ( e. g. , D-amino acid oxidase , β-secretase , and inflammation markers ) , and few studies have focused on changes in blood cholinesterase ( ChE ) levels and activity in patients with PSD .

Specifically , Ach levels in the cerebrospinal fluid are up to 49 % lower in patients with small-vessel vascular dementia than in control patients , suggesting that cholinergic agents or cholinesterase inhibitors , both of which increase the Ach level , could be used to treat such patients .

Since plasma Ach is metabolized by AChE and butylcholinesterase ( BChE ) , the present study examined the functional activities of these two enzymes in a population of patients with chronic ischemic stroke ( IS ) .

In particular , the efferent vagus nerve may release acetylcholine ( Ach ) , which subsequently binds with macrophage receptors and therefore may inhibit the release of inflammatory factors after stroke .

Furthermore , cholinergic neurotransmission regulates the immune response during inflammation , in a pathway that involves nicotinic acetylcholine receptors ( nAChRs ) and inhibits peripheral cytokine release .
