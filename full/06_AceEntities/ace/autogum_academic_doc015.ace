In line with the suggestion that softer floor types alleviate some of the pain associated with lameness , cows with more severe signs of lameness showed the greatest increase in stride length when walking on rubber instead of concrete , and cows ’ mobility score is improved when walking on rubber .

For instance , mildly and moderately lame cows have been shown to walk slower than sound ones ( 5 % and 11 % slower , respectively ) , and moderately lame cows use shorter strides than sound and mildly lame ones ( 10 % and 8 % shorter , respectively ) .

For instance , studies comparing solid rubber to solid concrete reported that stride length was greater on rubber , but speed was higher on concrete , or that stride length increased significantly , whereas only a numerical increase occurred for walking speed .

As the relationship between gait characteristics and how a cow experiences a walking surface is complex , assessing cows ’ preferences for different floor types can provide important additional information , allowing a more correct interpretation of changes in gait .

This may have been due to competition between sound cows and lame ones , during which the sound cows would be more successful in claiming a space on the preferred floor type , as lameness reduces dominance rank .

Cows have been estimated to walk 4 – 6 % faster on rubber than on concrete ( although in one study , a higher walking speed was only noted when both floor types were slatted ) .

Floor type also affects walking speed and stride length , which is at least partially due to alleviation of discomfort by softer ( i. e. , more compressible ) , less abrasive floor types .

In some cases , discrepancies between walking speed and stride length may occur because the tested floor types differ not only in softness and abrasiveness , but also in other characteristics .

This may indicate that although cows will adapt their walking pattern to such floors , they can do so in a satisfactory way and therefore feel no need to avoid these .

Softer floors that claws can sink into have been suggested to be the most effective in reducing slipperiness , and also reduce discomfort due to pressure on the claws .

Claw problems cause lameness , which is one of the most important dairy cow welfare issues and is associated with a decrease in walking speed and stride length .

It has been suggested that cows reduce their speed when walking on concrete floors to reduce the impact on the hooves when these hit the floor .

Dairy cows are likely to avoid less comfortable surfaces , and are known to prefer rubber over concrete flooring , both when standing and walking .

However , slipperiness can also be reduced by making a floor more abrasive , which may make claw – surface contact more aversive .

Slipperiness also affects gait characteristics , which is likely because cows adjust their gait to reduce the chance of slipping and falling .
