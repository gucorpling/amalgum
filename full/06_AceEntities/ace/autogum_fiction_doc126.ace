The expression on the face of the man who , with his hands in his pockets , stands by the stern , smoking a cigar , is sufficient to excuse a breach of the peace by itself ; and the lordly whistle for you to get out of the way would , I am confident , ensure a verdict of “ justifiable homicide ” from any jury of river men .

At about a hundred yards off , she would start whistling like mad , and the people would come and lean over the side , and roar at us ; but we never heard them ! Harris would be telling us an anecdote about his mother , and George and I would not have missed a word of it for worlds .

Another good way we discovered of irritating the aristocratic type of steam launch , was to mistake them for a beanfeast , and ask them if they were Messrs. Cubit ’s lot or the Bermondsey Good Templars , and could they lend us a saucepan .
