This O'Donnell was the full moon of the hospitality and nobility of the North , the most jovial and valiant , the most prudent in war and peace , and of , the best jurisdiction , law , and rule , of all the Gaels in Ireland in his time ; for there was no defence made of the houses in Tirconnell during his time , except to close the door against the wind only ; the best protector of the Church and the learned ; a man who had given great alms in honour of the Lord of the Elements ; the man by whom a castle was first raised and erected at Donegal , that it might serve as a sustaining bulwark for his descendants ; and a monastery for Friars de Observantiâ in Tirconnell , namely , the monastery of Donegal ; a man who had made many predatory excursions around through Ireland ; and a man who may be justly styled the Augustus of the North-west of Europe .
