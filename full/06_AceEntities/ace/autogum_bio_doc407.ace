Some of his work at this time is dedicated to Carlo , as well as the other members of the aristocratic household : Cesare d'Avalos , father of Carlo 's murdered wife , as well as Fabrizio , Carlo 's father . Later in 1590 , however , he became organist at Santa Casa dell'Annunziata in Naples , and in 1594 organist to the Spanish viceroy ( Naples was a Spanish possession at the time ) ; in 1599 he became maestro di cappella at the Chapel Royal of Naples .

When his voice broke in late 1563 — the only evidence for his birthdate — he was moved out of the choir and into a Jesuit college , and sometime before 1574 he moved to Rome , where he worked as a composer and as an organist ; he published his first book of madrigals in 1576 ( in Venice , which had a much more active publishing industry ) .

His early and late madrigals include both light and serious music and often require virtuoso singing skill ; likely some of these pieces were intended for performance by the concerto di donne , the three virtuoso female singers at the ducal Este court at Ferrara , which had a strong musical connection with Naples throughout the 1590s .

Macque was a prolific madrigalist , who published 12 separate books of madrigals , although the numbering is confusing : for example the Primo libro de madrigali , for six voices , dates from 1576 in Venice , while another Primo libro de madrigali , for four voices , dates from 1587 .

Most likely the nobleman influenced Macque , but it is possible that some of the influence went the other way , since dating of Gesualdo 's individual compositions is difficult , due to his publication of his work in large blocks , many years apart .

Some of the madrigals Macque wrote after 1599 include " forbidden " melodic intervals ( such as sevenths ) , chords entirely outside of the Renaissance modal universe ( such as F# major ) and melodic passages in consecutive chromatic semitones .

Macque also wrote sacred music , including a book of motets for five to eight voices , litanies , laudi spirituali , and contrafactum motets ( motets originally in another language , fitted with new texts known as contrafacta ) .

Some of his music is extraordinarily progressive harmonically , and can be compared with the vocal music of Gesualdo : the Consonanze stravaganti ( exact date unknown , probably early 17th century ) is a particularly good example .

Macque was born in Valenciennes , but moved to Vienna at an early age , where he sang as a choirboy , and where he studied with Philippe de Monte , the renowned composer of madrigals .

After 1585 , when he moved to Naples , his music shifted from the conservative Roman style to the more progressive Neapolitan one ; perhaps he began renumbering his publications based on his stylistic change .

He was one of the most famous Neapolitan composers of the late 16th century ; some of his experimentation with chromaticism was likely influenced by Carlo Gesualdo , who was an associate of his .
