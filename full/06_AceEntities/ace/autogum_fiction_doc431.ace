Had it not been for the stop the car had previously made , for the possibility that he might have obtained a glimpse outside when the door had been opened , the scarf over his eyes would have been superfluous ; for now , with it removed , he could scarcely distinguish the forms of the three men around him , since the window curtains of the car were tightly drawn .
