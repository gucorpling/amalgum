Beside the chemical imaging technique visualizing the pH distribution on the sensor surface , there are a variety of further LAPS sensing techniques such as the scanned light-pulse technique ( SLPT ) in studies of interface properties ( e. g . , flat-band voltage ) , or scanning photo-induced impedance microscopy ( SPIM ) analyzing impedance changes e. g . , in PAH/PSS polyelectrolyte microcapsules labeled with Au nanoparticles .
