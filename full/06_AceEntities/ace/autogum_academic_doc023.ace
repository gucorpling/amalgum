The lead member BCL-2 and its homologue BCL-XL ( BCL2L1 ) are featured by the presence of four conserved BH domains , three of which , BH1 , BH2 , and BH3 domains , are responsible for their antiapoptotic role mainly by interactions with other proapoptotic members of the BCL-2 family .

Autophagy-related genes ( ATGs ) , including ULK1 ( ATG1 ) , ATG3 , and ATG12 etc. , are involved in the distinct stages of autophagy : initiation , autophagosome nucleation , autophagosome membrane expansion , fusion with lysosome and the intravesicular components degradation .

Autophagy is an evolutionarily-conserved catabolic process , during which “ useless ” proteins and damaged organelles are sequestrated into autophagosomes and fused with lysosomes to form autolysosomes for bulk degradation of embedded components .
