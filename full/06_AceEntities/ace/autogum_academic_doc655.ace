The dietary patterns associated with reduced bone health are characterised by the high intakes of refined cereals , processed meats , fried foods and sweet foods , while patterns high in fruit , vegetables , and a prudent diet pattern are positively associated with bone health .

Therefore , the purpose of this prospective study was to investigate the association between nutrient intake and dietary patterns ( exposures ) with changes in bone turnover and BMD ( bone health outcomes ) in postmenopausal urban black South African women over two years .

In the Northwest Province of South Africa , an accelerated nutrition transition among black Africans resulted in a shift from a plant-based diet to an animal food-based diet which is energy-dense but nutrient poor and therefore , may negatively impact bone health .

Earlier studies identified that the migration of black South Africans into urban areas significantly affects their health status with an increase in the incidence of obesity and non-communicable diseases related to urbanisation , the nutrition transition , and decreased physical activity .

More recently , a holistic approach acknowledging the interaction between foods , nutrients , and food components on health outcomes , including bone health , was proposed to investigate the association of dietary patterns with the markers of bone health .

A high body mass index ( BMI ) has been suggested to protect against low BMD by some , while others have found excessive fat mass to be associated with low BMD and not protecting against osteoporosis .

Diet is a known modifiable risk factor for optimal bone health , with the value of specific nutrients such as dietary calcium and vitamin D well established .

The ethnic differences in bone mineral density ( BMD ) and fracture risk have been described in both high-income , and low- and middle-income countries .

However , evidence point towards a lower than expected BMD in black South African women and an increased risk for poor bone health and fractures .

Therefore , the high prevalence of obesity among black South African women may be a contributing factor to a lower BMD in this group .

In South Africa , black populations have been reported to have a higher overall BMD and a lower fracture risk compared to white populations .

In addition to high fat mass levels , increased circulating inflammatory cytokines in obese individuals have also been linked to a low BMD .

Reduced BMD among black South African women may be associated with the predominance of environmental exposures over genetic factors .

Similarly , lean mass and not fat mass strongly correlated with bone health in black South African women .
