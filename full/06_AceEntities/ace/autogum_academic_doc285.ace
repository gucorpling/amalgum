The stability of these compounds is also critically important : potentially fatal malfunctions of air bags in cars using primary explosives has caused harm , where the chemical stability has been compromised by temperature and humidity .

This combination is important as it is safer than solely using a primary explosive , as these are generally sensitive to stimuli and thus dangerous in large quantities .

Energetic materials typically fall into three categories : explosives that are designed to detonate , propellants that generally deflagrate , or pyrolants that can deflagrate or detonate .
