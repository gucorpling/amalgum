To reduce the computational cost , the connection between the optimization target ( objective function ) and the initial database samples was established through some approximation model that replaced numerical simulations before the optimization cycle .

Before starting the optimization cycle , the fillets of the vane and the blade were removed , as this study was dedicated to understanding the effect of a non-axisymmetrical endwall on secondary flows .

The number of initial samples was more than 10 times the number of control points of the stator hub and the rotor hub , and these were fed into the approximation model .

The parametric geometry was screened for performance evaluation with respect to the original geometry and considered appropriate for the optimization cycle because it was a perfect replica of the original geometry .

In this study , the initial database was comprised of a combination of the samples generated through the Latin Hypercube Sampling ( LHS ) method and random sampling method .

BPNN was used as an approximation model because of the excellent capability of non-linear mappings which led to the best reproduction of initial samples contained in the database .

BPNN consists of two hidden layers in between the first layer containing the information of perturbed endwall geometry and the last layer containing the information of performance parameters .

Using small random values , the weight and bias factors are initialized , and the information is passed to the next layer through a sigmoidal transfer function .

The solutions that were not dominated by other solutions form the “ Pareto front set ” , and the best solution was selected from among these .

The optimum solutions were found based on this relationship by using the optimization technique formed in NSGA-II , which was developed by Deb et al. .

The error between the real and desired value is back-propagated to the network input to adjust connecting weights and minimize the error .
