As far most proud of , there are multiple to choose from in respect to the total City perspective however , the May 2004 Implementation of pesticide bylaw in which Council decided on an implementation schedule for phasing in full enforcement of the bylaw is a decision that our incumbent councilor voted on behalf of the ward 13 constituents behalf in support of the pesticide ban and one that is of great importance on our ward level as citizen engagement in respect to environmental issues is strong within and listening to and supporting the opinions of the local citizenry is , in my belief , one of the key aspects to promoting further and increased citizen engagement in respect to all issues brought forth for discussion to City Council .

In July , Council approved a pay increase for members of the Council who will be elected in November , taking effect January 1 , 2007 thereby increasing Councillors ' current salary of about $ 87,000 annually to $ 95,000 , a decision that while deemed to be reflective of bring the salaries in line with the average of large Ontario municipalities is not one that I see as being a desirable decision .

I will not be willing to sit in unproductive community partnerships with groups seeking to develop the ward but instead would ask groups to each develop one solid idea for which I would work with them to lobby for full council implementation of such within ward 13 .
