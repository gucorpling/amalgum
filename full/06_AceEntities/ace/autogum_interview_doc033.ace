: I have done fieldwork in Belize and Peru , and my coauthor did field work in Brazil , Ecuador , and Peru , where we collected several specimens of Sturnira ( including the third species that has not been described yet ) .

Phyllostomid bats exploit an unusually diverse array of feeding habits including sanguivory , insectivory , carnivory , omnivory , nectarivory , pollennivory , and frugivory .

The molecular phylogeny gave us the separation between species , from there our job was to focus on finding morphological differences between these groups .
