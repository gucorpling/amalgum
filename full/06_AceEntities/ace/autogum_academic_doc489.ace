The shape of the normalized diurnal profiles of glucose , insulin , glucagon , lipids , leptin , and slepR are fairly comparable in T1DM patients and healthy controls , but differ with respect to slope and inter-individual variability , i. e. , changes over time are faster in controls while inter-individual variability is much greater in T1DM patients .

On the one hand , poor glycemic control is likely to result in elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels , on the other hand , peripheral hyperinsulinemia secondary to subcutaneous insulin administration contribute to qualitative abnormalities of lipid metabolism as well and this has recently been shown in young T1DM patients .

Standardization with respect to physical activity , the interval between meals , the type and amount of nutrients , and the restriction to alveolar breath sampling allows the generation of highly comparable diurnal profiles of breath and blood born parameters relative to the metabolic state .

Under physiological conditions , insulin is secreted in response to increasing blood glucose levels and by inducing cellular glucose uptake and inhibition of pancreatic glucagon secretion at the same time it contributes to maintenance of glucose homeostasis .

While the carbohydrate intake at lunch was quite similar in both groups , postprandial hyperglycemia was not and even subtle differences with respect to the intestinal microbiota between T1DM patients and controls have to be considered .

Endogenous ethanol is supposed to originate from intestinal bacterial activity via fermentation of carbohydrates , i. e. , breath ethanol increase is due to the intake with subsequent digestion of carbohydrates and the intestinal microbiota .

In the morning , when ketogenesis is high due to overnight fasting , correlations were low , most probably due to an additive effect of lipolysis and glycolysis on the formation of acetone .
