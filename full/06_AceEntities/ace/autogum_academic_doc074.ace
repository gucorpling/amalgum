For instance , Mattila and Seeley found that greater genetic diversity increases the likelihood that the rare scout-like genotypes are present in a colony , thus increasing a colony ’s ability to discover new resource patches .

This trade-off can be resolved by allocating the task of scouting only to a sufficient number of individuals to allow locating new resources without losing too many foragers to the costs of exploration .

Variation in learning among individuals in the colony is important for this division of labor because learning influences which of the foraging tasks individuals are most likely to perform , as detailed above .

For example , theoretical models have established that when resources are concentrated into a small number of highly rewarding patches , colonies perform best with few scouts and many recruits .

The collective decisions that result from differences in behavior at the individual level have an important impact on a colony ’s foraging success , and therefore on its fitness .

Empirical tests have provided support for the prediction that high investment in recruitment is most beneficial when resources are distributed in few large patches and are variable in quality .

Because pollen is often variable in nutritional quality , having fewer pollen scouts and more recruits allows colonies to focus efforts on the highest quality pollen resources .

A wider range of behavioral types can increase the likelihood that complementary behavioral types , such as scouts and recruits , will be represented in the colony .

For instance , genetic differences in the sucrose response thresholds of individual foragers scale up to influence the total amount of pollen that the colony collects .

In contrast , when resource patches are small , evenly distributed , and easy to locate , successful colonies invest more in scouting than in recruitment .

Foragers specialize in the type of food they collect , as well as whether they scout for new resources or are recruited to known resources .

The behavioral composition of the colony has consequences for collective pollen foraging , which can have major impacts on worker health and larval development .

Furthermore , having many recruits is beneficial when patches are highly variable in quality , because recruitment drives foragers to the highest quality patches .
