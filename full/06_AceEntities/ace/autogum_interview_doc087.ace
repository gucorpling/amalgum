Is it fair to say that your district is not socially conservative , that your stand on HJR-3 might not been aligned with your constituents , and that the Democrats see your seat as an opportunity .

I try to listen to everybody , anybody in my district who has an issue or concern or wants to talk to me or tell me what they think about anything , always gets my ear .

And you ca n't do this job and be effective doing this job without being shaped by the views of your constituents , some of whom may disagree with your position on a given issue .

Again I did n't ask which way they were going to vote — whether they were going to vote yes or no — but rather did they wanted the chance to vote .

I sent that survey to all registered voters in Senate District 29 and over 60 percent of the respondents said they wanted a chance to vote in November 2014 .

My position primarily was driven by that piece of information and my desire to try to advocate on behalf of my constituents to bring this whole issue to resolution .

And to me whether you were for the amendment or against the amendment , there was pretty strong support to being done with it once and for all .

And so I was hoping we could deal with this whole issue in 2014 but others felt differently that were in the leadership .

So I think my history has shown an ability to have people who are n't necessarily conservative Republican voters vote for me .

So I do consider myself a full-spectrum conservative , fiscal and social , but more importantly I consider myself a Constitutional conservative .

I asked them if they wanted a chance to vote on this through the constitutional amendment process via referendum in November 2014 .
