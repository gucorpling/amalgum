In this context , make sustainable what has already been built , that is to say , what actually exists is one of the great challenges of the large Latin American megalopolis such as Mexico City , Lima or Santiago de Chile .

Secondly , the three cities , but particularly Santiago de Chile and Mexico , have become key points in the network of global cities that act as nodes of human resources , information , and capital .

In this context , poor neighborhoods , which often arise from the dynamics of settlement-parceling-building-urbanization , still have a wide margin for changing their physiognomy and improving their provision of services .

Many of these transformations can be framed within the framework of sustainable transition , especially concerning improvements in water and electricity supplies , the provision of green areas or transport systems .

Finally , in all three cases , there is a predominance of neoliberal forms of urban governance , which is associated with the predominance of approaches of ecological modernization .

As a result , there are many common priorities in their urban agendas , to the point that there is a pattern of pursuing sustainability in Latin American megalopolises .

In recent years , urban sprawl has completely transformed the physiognomy of cities in Latin America , generating and consolidating a model of an extensive and polycentric city .

Thirdly , the three cities have experienced strong pressure from popular groups , which results in specific forms of urban sprawl with a strong component of informality .

By contrast , the neighborhoods in which the highest income social groups live tend to have not only a different physiognomy but also distinct environmental conditions .

Also , the logic of ecological modernization and the megaproject tends to allocate greater financial resources to those with higher capacity to pay .

Firstly , the three cities are not only the capitals of their respective countries but also have a clear position of urban primacy .

In this context , any transition to sustainability in them is conditioned by the high existing levels of social inequality and residential segregation .

In these areas , they can be observed some sustainability policies similar to those of developed countries albeit necessarily to a limited extent .

These transition dynamics could be applied to other aspects such as the use of new energy sources , waste management , etc.

In all these fields , some of these experiences may be considered as niches of sustainability at a neighborhood level .

On the other hand , population growth is still a relevant phenomenon in many of the largest Latin American cities .

Thus , progress is being made towards the consolidation of a socially segregated and ecologically differentiated urban polycentrism .

The analysis of those three cities shows that their urban agendas have several confluent features .

On the one hand , the own dynamics of capital accumulation promote expansive urban dynamics .
