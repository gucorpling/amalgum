Their manuscript specifically discussed Toll-like receptors ( TLRs ) , RIG-I-like receptors ( RLRs ) , and the cGAS-STING pathway , placing their evolution into perspective in diverse organisms and the dynamic co-evolution and diversification of these pathways with respect to viral infections . Liu et al. discussed the mechanisms underlying how herpesviruses can be detected by pattern recognition receptors ( PRRs ) to induce the expression of interferons ( IFNs ) and inflammatory cytokines .

Rhabdoviruses-induced interferon production and the activation of interferon signaling pathways , as well as the expression and functions of viral restriction factors , are discussed . Ashley et al. reported that by using cells engineered to block either the response to , or production of , type-I IFN , the regulation of IFN-independent ISGs was examined in the context of human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV ) infection .

They also described the ability of herpesviruses to establish persistent infection in the presence of active immune responses involving VSGs . Asmi et al. reviewed Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier ( SUMO ) protein conjugation as a component of intrinsic and innate immunity , specifically with respect to rhabdoviruses infection and in relation to the production and secretion of interferon .

Furthermore , by using IRF3 knockdown CRISPR/Cas-9 clones , they were able to demonstrate IFN-independent control of ISG expression during HCMV infection of human fibroblasts that is absolutely dependent on IRF3 activation .

Over the last few decades , accumulating evidence has demonstrated that numerous Interferon ( IFN ) stimulate genes ( ISGs ) can be directly upregulated following virus infection independent of IFN signaling .

Several ISGs , including IFIT1 , IFIT2 , IFIT3 , Mx1 , Mx2 , CXCL10 , and ISG15 were found to be upregulated transcriptionally following HCMV infection independently of type-I IFN .

Finally , He et al. revealed that the THO complex subunit 7 homolog ( THOC7 ) negatively regulates type-I IFN production by promoting TBK1 proteasomal degradation that subsequently decreases IRF3 activation .

Clearly , IFN is a major component of host defense responses , but there are many ISGs whose antiviral activities remain to be clarified that can be regulated independently of IFN .
