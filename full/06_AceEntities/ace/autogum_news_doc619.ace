Because TESS 's cameras can cover a wide range of radiant energy , including infrared , scientists believe it may be able to detect planets orbiting red dwarf stars , which scientists consider likely to host rocky , Earth-like planets with the right mass for an atmosphere and the right temperature to host liquid water , a range called the habitable zone .

If all goes according to plan , TESS will circle the Earth for 60 days to establish its 13.7-day orbit and test its machinery before beginning its mission : using its four cameras to analyze stars for decreases in brightness that may be caused by a planet passing between us and them , a technique called the transit method .
