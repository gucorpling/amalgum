Among the most important actions are : firstly , efforts made to achieve the distinction of a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1996 ; secondly , the construction of new cultural equipment and the improvements of the infrastructure , carried out through the European Capital of Culture initiative in 2001 ; and thirdly , using tourism , culture and leisure as development vectors for the revitalization of Porto ’s city centre .

In the case of Amsterdam , the control of tourist activity has gone further , and it has recently been announced by the municipal authorities that a campaign will be launched to dissuade people from visiting certain parts of the city , having already removed one of the tourist icons of the city , the “ Iamsterdam ” .

To these warnings , we add all the collected data which show that the transformations experienced by the city of Porto are similar to those verified in many other cities that have a stake in urban recovery based on tourism and culture , and are oriented towards international markets and short-term returns .

In fact , according to the SRU-Porto Vivo Masterplan , Porto ’s culture , based on the “ city ’s traditions , history and festivals , represented in their traditional form or with a greater contemporary influence ” , has been essential for the renovation project of the city .

Furthermore , the evolution of the functions of the city centre , namely , the opening of short-term rentals , the changes in street trade and the expansion of the franchised retailing , seem to indicate that this place is being transformed into a place of visitor consumption .

Local residents and traders are expropriated , and the buildings are replaced by hotels , car parks , shops and luxury apartments , while the World Heritage Committee recommended to deal with the issue of depopulation as soon as the city integrated the World Heritage List .

These transformations seem to be in line with what Sequera and Nofre ( p. 6 ) described as being the “ new Disneyficated commercial tourist areas ” , which today characterize the most central areas of the “ tourist city ” .

Another of the measures most used in several cities , recently adopted in Porto is the application of a tourist tax per person and per night , whose revenue should in principle be used to minimize the consequences of tourism growth .

The most notorious have been made in the regulation of the economic activity of tourist accommodation platforms , which currently in cities such as Amsterdam and Barcelona have limitations on the time and space in which they operate .

In fact , Porto ’s trajectory is similar to that of Lisbon or Barcelona , for example , although the scale of what happened and the time that it took to happen are especially difficult to absorb .

The analysis of the recovery strategies of the city centre of Porto and the evolution of its socio-economic dynamics evidence some conflicts that may jeopardize the sustainability of the relation between culture and tourism .

The equilibrium between tourism , culture and urbanism in the city centre of Porto may be in danger because of the overuse of its touristic function and the loss of its residential function .

Nevertheless , the municipality of Porto is being accused by some social movements and political parties of having a passive attitude regarding the problems generated by tourism — especially those which affect housing .

As a consequence , its residential function is becoming marginal , thus constituting , in the face of processes of speculation , gentrification and touristification , a space of conflict and claim .

Likewise , in Porto , this process is highly concentrated in the centre of the city , which is the place where the major part of the tourist attractions are located .

As a result , together with other already mentioned measures and the strong growth of low-cost travel at the global scale , Porto is now an important urban tourist destination .
