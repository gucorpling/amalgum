He soon recovered consciousness , and by the light of an old-fashioned Argand lamp he could make out the most charming girl ’s face he had ever seen , one of those heads which are often supposed to be a freak of the brush , but which to him suddenly realized the theories of the ideal beauty which every artist creates for himself and whence his art proceeds .

“ Monsieur , ” said the younger woman in reply to one of the questions put by the painter during the few minutes when he was still under the influence of the vagueness that the shock had produced in his ideas , “ my mother and I heard the noise of your fall on the floor , and we fancied we heard a groan .

The silence which generally prevails at that time makes it particularly dear to artists , who grow contemplative , stand a few paces back from the pictures on which they can no longer work , and pass judgement on them , rapt by the subject whose most recondite meaning then flashes on the inner eye of genius .
