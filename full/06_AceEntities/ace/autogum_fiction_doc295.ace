Under these circumstances , Lord Canterville , I feel sure that you will recognise how impossible it would be for me to allow them to remain in the possession of any member of my family ; and , indeed , all such vain gauds and toys , however suitable or necessary to the dignity of the British aristocracy , would be completely out of place among those who have been brought up on the severe , and I believe immortal , principles of republican simplicity .

Lord Canterville listened very gravely to the worthy Minister ’s speech , pulling his grey moustache now and then to hide an involuntary smile , and when Mr. Otis had ended , he shook him cordially by the hand , and said , ‘ My dear sir , your charming little daughter rendered my unlucky ancestor , Sir Simon , a very important service , and I and my family are much indebted to her for her marvellous courage and pluck .

Besides , you forget , Mr. Otis , that you took the furniture and the ghost at a valuation , and anything that belonged to the ghost passed at once into your possession , as , whatever activity Sir Simon may have shown in the corridor at night , in point of law he was really dead , and you acquired his property by purchase . ’

For my own part , I confess I am a good deal surprised to find a child of mine expressing sympathy with mediævalism in any form , and can only account for it by the fact that Virginia was born in one of your London suburbs shortly after Mrs. Otis had returned from a trip to Athens . ’

I am also informed by Mrs. Otis , who , I may say , is no mean authority upon Art — having had the privilege of spending several winters in Boston when she was a girl — that these gems are of great monetary worth , and if offered for sale would fetch a tall price .

When the ceremony was over , the servants , according to an old custom observed in the Canterville family , extinguished their torches , and , as the coffin was being lowered into the grave , Virginia stepped forward and laid on it a large cross made of white and pink almond-blossoms .

The hearse was drawn by eight black horses , each of which carried on its head a great tuft of nodding ostrich-plumes , and the leaden coffin was covered by a rich purple pall , on which was embroidered in gold the Canterville coat-of-arms .
