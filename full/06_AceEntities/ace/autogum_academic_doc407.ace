Third , although our method was implemented to assess the travellers ’ satisfaction in green hotels , the proposed method can also be implemented for other types of hotels ( e. g. , non-green hotels with spa services ) and then comparisons are made for the travellers ’ satisfaction levels in different hotels ( i. e. , comparisons for travellers ’ satisfaction levels in green hotels with spa services and non-green hotels with spa services ) .

Besides the TOPSIS method , we can also consider group decision-making ( GDM ) and other multiple criteria decision-making methods such as the double normalization-based multiple aggregation ( DNMA ) method and the gained and lost dominance score ( GLDS ) method , to solve such problems .

The use of deep learning approaches , Random Forest ( RF ) and incremental learning or the development of our method with incremental updates , especially in LDA and neuro-fuzzy learning techniques , can be effective in online reviews analysis .

The neuro-fuzzy system was then used to reveal the relative importance of the hotel features on the customers ’ satisfaction and find the importance role of spa services and its impact on the customers ’ satisfaction .

In our experimental analysis , we observed that travellers are relatively more satisfied in green spa hotels and accordingly provide a higher degree of overall ratings to the hotels with spa services .

The results showed that , in general , the travellers ’ satisfaction was relatively higher than in green spa hotels in relation to the green non-spa hotels .
