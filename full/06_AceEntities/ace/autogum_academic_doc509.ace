To determine the distribution of survival of glioblastoma patients , we composed prognosis prediction formulae for the following components : epithelium ( EPI ) , mesenchyme ( MES ) , glioma ( GLI ) , GSC , molecular target therapy ( MTT ) genes , and potential glioma biomarkers ( PGBs ) .

Stem cells , including cancer stem cells ( CSCs ) , are pluripotent and capable of self-renewal , like induced pluripotent stem ( iPS ) cells induced by the transcription factors Oct3/4 , Sox2 , c-Myc , and Klf4 or OCT4 , SOX2 , NANOG , and LIN28 .

During invasion in cancer , phenotypes also change as EMT is mainly induced by hypoxia and the transforming growth factor ( TGF)-β released from glioma stem cells ( GSCs ) , mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) , and myeloid cells recruited by hypoxia .

The most common GSC marker CD133 , also known as prominin-1 ( PROM1 ) , is used to isolate GSCs by fluorescence-activated cell sorting ( FACS ) in primary glioma tissues and the cell lines U87 and T98G .

Exposure to temozolomide ( TMZ ) increases the expression of KLF4 and reduces the expression of Nanog and OCT4 in glioma cells , indicating that stem cell factors , especially KLF4 , play pivotal roles in GSCs .
