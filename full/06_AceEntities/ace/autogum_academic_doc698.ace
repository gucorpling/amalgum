This seems to be a common situation in many countries , as it was reported in the latest Teaching and Learning International Survey ( TALYS ) that 22 % of teachers across the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) asked for more training in teaching students with special needs .

In 2015 , the United Nations established Sustainable Development Goal Four ( SDG-4 ) , which focuses on quality education , aiming to ensure that qualified , professionally trained , motivated , and well-supported teachers are available to all students and highlighting the role that teachers play in the complex education process .

It seems clear that investing in teacher training is crucial for the effective delivery of the UNESCO Education Agenda , as teachers who present adequate subject and pedagogic content knowledge and are well-trained in the necessary skills can make a huge difference in educating students , especially those with special needs .

However , physical education teachers ( PET ) are often frustrated with their inability to accommodate inclusion in mixed-ability PE classrooms for reasons related to students ’ safety or the difficulty in designing tasks that do not negatively impact the type and severity of the disability .

The hypotheses of this study were i ) good PET training can significantly improve PET self-efficacy towards students with disabilities , and ii ) the self-efficacy improvement ratio is constrained by the region where the teaching takes place .

However , when talking about students with disabilities , studies in inclusive education have demonstrated that PETs present negative attitudes towards their inclusion , driven by their poor self-efficacy ( SE ) in meeting students ’ needs .

Educational differences between peninsular and insular areas have already been reported in several studies , but , to the authors ’ best knowledge , there is no previous research on this topic applied to a PE context .

Education for sustainable development has encompassed a wide range of objectives to ensure that teachers help students understand the rapidly changing world in which they live , as well as the need to participate in that world .

A clear case occurs in Spain , a country that has 17 autonomous regions , two of them belonging to insular areas ( i. e. , the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands ) .

Although since 2013 , there has been a national education law with clear inclusion policies , each Spanish region has the authority to design its own educational curricula , including policies about inclusive education .

When this happens , PETs apply strategies in practice , design learning experiences for students of all abilities , and support participation by students with disabilities , resulting in increased student learning .

Education is very dynamic , and there is no universal design for educational programs , which are heavily influenced by national education curricula and , thus , differ across countries .

To improve professional standards in inclusive physical education ( IPE ) , it is necessary that education/training curricula present those contents as a contribution to achieving proper PET training .

Because of this , investigating teacher-training programs is necessary for the understanding of evidence-based inclusive practices and to address common concerns and misconceptions about inclusion .
