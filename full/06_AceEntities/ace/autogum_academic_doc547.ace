The considered events usually involve several types of component failures or human errors , mainly adopting the forward sequence method ( such as failure mode and impact analysis ) or the backward sequence method ( Such as the fault tree directly describes the linear relationship between the failure and the influencing factors and is suitable for analyzing the hazard caused by the failure of a physical component or a simple system . )

Meanwhile , due to the constraint property of hierarchical structure , the accidents will happen if the higher layers cannot provide enough constraints or the lower layers violate the safety constraints when the high-level constraints control the behavior of the lower layers .

Three hazard analysis techniques are suggested in the functional safety standard ( ISO26262 ) : fault tree analysis ( FTA ) , failure modes and effects analysis ( FMEA ) , and hazard and operability ( HAZOP ) analysis .

However , due to the particularity understanding of safety in STAMP , the connotation of safety has been substantially improved from the introduction of concepts such as hierarchical models , process models , and safety constraints .

When the controller sends a command to controlled process , the corresponding feedback which is generated by controlled process will be sent to controller to form a complete controlled process .
