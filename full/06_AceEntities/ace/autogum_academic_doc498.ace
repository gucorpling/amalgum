Arterial pressure , although significantly reduced , was still higher than normal pressure which may explain the lack of benefit on cardiac parameters in our experimental conditions ( hypertension already established , 3 months of supplementation ) .

The enhanced effect of L-NAME on PE-induced contraction suggested that the decrease in the vasodilator capacity of aorta in SHR is due to both the alteration of vascular smooth muscle function and NO bioavailability .

Higher level of elastin fiber density and mRNA level were associated to a decrease in MMP-9 expression , suggesting that both enhanced elastin biosynthesis and reduced extracellular matrix contributed to media thinning .
