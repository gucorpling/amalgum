Studies in the USA , Ireland and Australia detected ERAV in post-race urine samples at frequencies of 17 % , 29 % and 23 % , respectively , which led to a suggestion that the persistent presence of ERAV in urine may contribute to its maintenance in training yards .

In a seven-year serological study of racehorses in Japan , 69 % of horses that seroconverted to ERAV were two years of age and Black et al. reported that 43 % of horses seroconverted to ERAV within 7 months of entering a training stable in Australia .

The serology tests used in this study are sensitive and specific , but it is possible that other less common viruses , such as adenovirus and coronavirus , or even as-yet unidentified equine viruses , may have played a role .

In an experimental study , ERAV-inoculated ponies developed respiratory tract disease characterized by pyrexia , nasal discharge , adventitious lung sounds , and enlarged mandibular lymph nodes , which corresponded with an increase in antibody titres against the virus .

Unfortunately , the possible role of bacterial infection as a cofactor was not investigated in this study and the statistically significant association of ERAV with failure to race during the study period does not conclusively demonstrate causation .

ERAV may have been the primary cause of the respiratory disease and subsequent training loss , but it is more likely that the virus was a contributory factor in a multifactorial disorder .
