The son confirmed his father ’s account , but when Daniel Nugent was called he swore positively that just before the fall of his companion , he saw a boat , with a single man in it , at a short distance from the shore ; and as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars , it was the same boat in which I had just landed .

A woman deposed that she lived near the beach and was standing at the door of her cottage , waiting for the return of the fishermen , about an hour before she heard of the discovery of the body , when she saw a boat with only one man in it push off from that part of the shore where the corpse was afterwards found .

About half a dozen men came forward ; and , one being selected by the magistrate , he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with his son and brother-in-law , Daniel Nugent , when , about ten o’clock , they observed a strong northerly blast rising , and they accordingly put in for port .

The first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me , but when the mark of the fingers was mentioned I remembered the murder of my brother and felt myself extremely agitated ; my limbs trembled , and a mist came over my eyes , which obliged me to lean on a chair for support .

Besides , they observed that it appeared that I had brought the body from another place , and it was likely that as I did not appear to know the shore , I might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance of the town of — — from the place where I had deposited the corpse .
