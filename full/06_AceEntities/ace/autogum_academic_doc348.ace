On the Premantura Promontory , where the origin of the boulders has been ascribed to storm events , totally excluding those of tsunami origin , and where boulders analysis began only recently ( end of 2016 ) , a proper monitoring network including orthophotograph comparison , both aerial and submarine , geomorphological observation , instrumental monitoring techniques , and numerical modeling , is most definitely needed as severe storms are forecast to increase in the near future .

Isolated boulders , such as boulder #1 ( K8 in ) , are those that have been subject to the largest movements , while the boulders gathered in clusters were only rotated or toppled , but remained in position , trapped by other boulders or the abovementioned scarps , fractures , and faults .

In recent years , after an initial decade when the analyses were mostly dedicated to explaining boulder detachment and transport mechanisms and distinguishing between those of tsunamigenic and those of storm origin , boulder studies are now more oriented towards the observation of boulder movements and reassemblage after exceptional storm events .
