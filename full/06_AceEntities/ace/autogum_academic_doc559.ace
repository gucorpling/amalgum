In this context , we have decided to study the thermodynamical properties of an energetic converting biological process , using for this purpose a simple model for an enzymatic reaction that couples one exothermic and one endothermic reaction in the same fashion described by Diaz-Hernandez et al. , but now using the Linear Irreversible Thermodynamics ( LIT ) for three different operating regimes , ; namely , Maximum Power Output ( MPO ) , Maximum Ecological Function ( MEF ) and Maximum Efficient Power Function ( MEPF ) , respectively .

Odun and Pinkerton who analyzed the maximum power output regime for various biological systems , Stucki who introduced some optimal criteria to study the optimum oxidative phosphorylation regime , among others who have studied many biological energy conversion processes by means of the LIT where some optimum performance regimes have been analyzed .

It is well known that all intracellular processes can be studied as chemical reactions of some kind , and that many of the biochemical reactions in living organisms have been seen to be catalyzed by enzymes ; there are some good examples where the energetic properties studied are really relevant .

They found an expression for the efficiency at maximum power output given by , a result that in principle is independent of the model parameters and only depends on the temperatures of the heat reservoirs ; analogously this is what happens with the efficiency for a reversible Carnot cycle .

One of the relevant questions tackled by Kedem et al. at that time was to answer which was the maximal efficiency of the oxidative phosphorylation in an isolated mitochondrion . Kandem et al. obtained some qualitative predictions confirmed by experimental data .

An additional step to analyze the energetic properties of a simple energy converter was given by Curzon and Ahlborn in 1975 , who proposed a model which operates between two heat sources with high and low temperatures , and , respectively .

On the other hand , Kedem et al. published in 1965 the first step of a non-equilibrium theory towards a description of linear converters of energy ( which would be called Linear Irreversible Thermodynamics , LIT ) .

Moreover , it was reported that thermal engines show some universality regarding the behavior of the efficiency when it works at the maximum power regime , although the analyzed models are different in nature and scale .

The importance of these models is that the energy production processes seen in the molecular biological level obey similar principles as those observed in the classical thermal engines .
