In Radi et al. , data spectral fusion is shown as coming from a Visible and Near Infrared VIS/NIR spectroscopic system and from a VIS/NIR hyperspectral imaging systems used respectively in interactance mode and in reflection mode with the aim of acquiring the spectral information of whole tubers for predicting the primordial leaf count of potatoes .

The paper shows the possibility of evaluating minute spectral variations due to ageing times well before the eyes can detect changes : The classification techniques based on principal component analysis ( PCA ) and k-nearest neighbor ( KNN ) of hyperspectral data are effectively capable of monitoring the changes occurring in the painting layers .

In particular , the HSI unit uses an optical fiber to illuminate a large portion of the sampled potato with the imaging spectrograph directly attached to a CCD camera , acquiring spectral information along a line of the potato that is held by a scanner system , therefore in push broom modality .
