So much of it as is here given to the public , she was far from considering as finished , and , in a letter to a friend directly written on this subject , she says , “ I am perfectly aware that some of the incidents ought to be transposed , and heightened by more harmonious shading ; and I wished in some degree to avail myself of criticism , before I began to adjust my events into a story , the outline of which I had sketched in my mind . ” *

For my part , I cannot suppose any situation more distressing , than for a woman of sensibility , with an improving mind , to be bound to such a man as I have described for life ; obliged to renounce all the humanizing affections , and to avoid cultivating her taste , lest her perception of grace and refinement of sentiment , should sharpen to agony the pangs of disappointment .

THE WRONGS OF WOMAN , like the wrongs of the oppressed part of mankind , may be deemed necessary by their oppressors : but surely there are a few , who will dare to advance before the improvement of the age , and grant that my sketches are not the abortion of a distempered fancy , or the strong delineations of a wounded heart .

What are termed great misfortunes , may more forcibly impress the mind of common readers ; they have more of what may justly be termed stage-effect ; but it is the delineation of finer sensations , which , in my opinion , constitutes the merit of our best novels .
