Balandin and coworkers were among the pioneers of the field of phonon engineering . [ 2 ] In 1998 , he published an influential paper on the effects of phonon spatial confinement on thermal conductivity of nanostructures [ 3 ] ( where the term “ phonon engineering ” likely appeared for the first time in a journal publication ) .
