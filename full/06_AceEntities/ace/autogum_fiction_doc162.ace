Wherefore , O my trusty Diabolonians , I command that yet more and more ye distress this town of Mansoul , and vex it with your wiles , ravish their women , deflower their virgins , slay their children , brain their ancients , fire their town , and what other mischief you can ; and let this be the reward of the Mansoulians from me , for their desperate rebellions against me . ’

Then said Diabolus , ‘ O ye stout Diabolonians , be it known unto you , that there is treachery hatched against us in the rebellious town of Mansoul ; for albeit the town is in our possession , as you see , yet these miserable Mansoulians have attempted to dare , and have been so hardy as yet to send to the court to Emmanuel for help .

But Mr. Godly-Fear made him this replication , ‘ How long will Mansoul be kept out of the dungeon , when she hath given up her faith to Diabolus ! As good lose the town , as lose Captain Credence ; for if one be gone the other must follow . ’

Moreover , when Diabolus had done thus , he went the next way up to the castle gates , and demanded that , upon pain of death , the gates should be opened to him , and that entrance should be given him and his men that followed after .
