The result that healthy ants die sooner when ingesting ROS [ Reactive Oxygen Species , the group of chemicals that includes hydrogen peroxide ] but infected ants die less was obtained in another way ( as you have to ' force feed ' the ROS , as healthy ants , when given the choice , ignore that food-source . )

This species of fungus does appear in Finland , but we chose to use a different strain from Denmark ( with thanks to Prof. J. Eilenberg and the laboratory technician Louise Lee Munch Larsen from the University of Copenhagen ) .

Animals can adapt to local strains ( ' local adaptation ' ) , and just to make sure we thought it would be good to use a strain of fungus that the ants definitely did not evolve specific resistances against .

After exposing the ants to the fungus , we took pictures of each foraging arena three times per day , and counted how many ants were present on each food-source .

This means that the reaction of the ants ( to self-medicate ) is very likely to be a general response , and not just against their local fungal enemies .

This means the experimenter does n't know which ants belong to which treatment , so it 's impossible to influence the results with ' observer bias ' .

Afterwards , each ant was dipped in the solution for a couple of seconds , dried on a cloth and put in the nest .

We mixed different concentrations of ROS with the spores , plated them out on petridishes with an agar-solution where fungus can grow on .

And afterwards either infected them or not . Then for about two weeks we count every day how many ants died .

We measured the ROS-concentration in the bodies of ants after they ingested the food with the medicine using a spectrophotometer .

We had a lot of colonies containing a lot of ants , and wherever possible we conducted the experiment blind .

By adding certain chemicals , the ROS can be measured using the emission of light of a certain wave-length .

For this we basically put colonies on a diet of either food with medicine or without for a while .

It is hard to extrapolate to other ants , as different species lead very different lives .

This gave us the data that ants choose more medicine after they have been infected .

We infected the ants by preparing a solution of the fungus Beauveria bassiana .
