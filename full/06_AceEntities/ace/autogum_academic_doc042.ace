The production of such linear α-pyrones has been reported in Al . solani and related fungi , but the difference in solanapyrone biosynthesis from other linear α-pyrones is the involvement of a Diels – Alder reaction catalyzed by sol5 to form a decalin ring from the unsaturated alkyl chain of prosolanapyrone .
