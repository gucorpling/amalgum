Well , I 'd say to them that , for my part , I think most people agree that Man is not an accident , and that evolution is something that 's taught in science class by state standards , they 're not set by the Federal government , really should n't be something that would enter into their mind , not a Federal issue , it 's one that 's set by the states .

I think most people that are concerned about evolution from a faith side want to see more taught about the science of how we got here , both at the very start -- how did we get the initial cells , the initial biological entities , how did we get this incredible physics set up of this planet , universe that could have a carbon-based system here , all based on science .

I think there 's some rationality , too , when you look at the consistency of the genetic code between species , the different lengths , the different pieces that are in it , but there 's a lot of the same genetic language that 's there .

A number of people would in what you 're describing a kind of , I do n't know what you 'd term it , a faith-based evolution or -- that 's not the term that some would call it .

And I think we 'd be so much richer , and in societies in the past in Western civilization they did this a lot more , if you had the interaction of the two , of faith and science .

Most people , they do n't see conflicts in this , and we would be so much richer if we had the discussion , rather than really trying to pit one against the other .
