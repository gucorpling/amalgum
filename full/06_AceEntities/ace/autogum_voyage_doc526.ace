By far the most popular sight of Pleven is the Pleven Panorama , which depicts the events of the Russian-Turkish War of 1877 – 78 , specifically the five-month Siege of Plevna ( Pleven Epopee ) which made the city internationally famous and which contributed to the Liberation of Bulgaria after five centuries of Ottoman rule .
