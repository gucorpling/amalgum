This is so because even for cases in which microscale details of phase distribution are accessible , computational limitations of even the world ’s fastest computers precludes the detailed simulations of systems at the scale of applications of concern , say the unsaturated zone above an aquifer .

The phenomenological approach can lead to solvable systems that enable solutions , but the general procedure is fraught with problems , many of which are not well understood because the general approach is deeply ingrained in text books and practice , and generally accepted .

The macroscale is a scale where phase distributions are resolved only in an averaged sense ; a point is the centroid of an averaging region which extends over all phases , interfaces , common curves , and common points that exist in a system .

The third scale of interest is termed the megascale , and it is the overall length scale of the system of concern , which might vary greatly in size between a model laboratory system , an engineered system , and a natural system .

Fifth , phenomenological models are typically evaluated and validated by comparing to the overall system of concern , and when they fail to provide an adequate description a new model must be formulated without a rigorous , well-defined procedure to do so .

The typical situation is that macroscale models are phenomenological in nature — meaning conservation equations are written following an assumed form usually based upon a presumed extension of microscale principles , which are better understood .

Fourth , macroscale closure relations are often constructs of convenience intended to produce solvable systems but not deduced from fundamentals or constrained to obey thermodynamic principles , such as the second law of thermodynamics .

Third , quantities that appear in macroscale models may not be precisely defined in terms of microscale quantities , precluding a rigorous connection between microscale systems and macroscale systems .

Another characteristic of the microscale is that a point exists entirely within an individual phase , even in a system that includes multiphase phases ( fluids , solids ) .
