‘ If you ask me , ’ his companion pursued , ‘ whether I came back here better satisfied with a state of things which broadly divides society into two classes -- whereof one , the great mass , asserts a spurious independence , most miserably dependent for its mean existence on the disregard of humanizing conventionalities of manner and social custom , so that the coarser a man is , the more distinctly it shall appeal to his taste ; while the other , disgusted with the low standard thus set up and made adaptable to everything , takes refuge among the graces and refinements it can bring to bear on private life , and leaves the public weal to such fortune as may betide it in the press and uproar of a general scramble -- then again I answer , No. ’

‘ Well , ’ returned his new friend , ‘ if you ask me whether I came back here with a greater relish for my country ’s faults ; with a greater fondness for those who claim ( at the rate of so many dollars a day ) to be her friends ; with a cooler indifference to the growth of principles among us in respect of public matters and of private dealings between man and man , the advocacy of which , beyond the foul atmosphere of a criminal trial , would disgrace your own old Bailey lawyers ; why , then I answer plainly , No. ’

‘ In a word , ’ resumed the other , ‘ I do not find and cannot believe and therefore will not allow , that we are a model of wisdom , and an example to the world , and the perfection of human reason , and a great deal more to the same purpose , which you may hear any hour in the day ; simply because we began our political life with two inestimable advantages . ’

But , being now in the streets again , it occurred to him as just coming within the bare limits of possibility that Mr Tapley might , in course of time , grow tired of waiting on the threshold of the Rowdy Journal Office , so he intimated to his new friend , that if they could conveniently walk in that direction , he would be glad to get this piece of business off his mind .

It was characteristic of Martin , that all this while he had either forgotten Mark Tapley as completely as if there had been no such person in existence , or , if for a moment the figure of that gentleman rose before his mental vision , had dismissed it as something by no means of a pressing nature , which might be attended to by-and-bye , and could wait his perfect leisure .

‘ Pretty well on that head , ’ said the other , shrugging his shoulders , ‘ still no mighty matter to boast of ; for old countries , and despotic countries too , have done as much , if not more , and made less noise about it .

And again Martin said ‘ Oh ! ’ in the same odd way as before , being anxious and disconcerted ; not so much , to say the truth , on public grounds , as with reference to the fading prospects of domestic architecture .
