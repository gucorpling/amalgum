Researchers are also in agreement that when psychological and behavioral control are distinguished , family relations based on manipulation or inducing guilt ( predominant psychological control ) are not beneficial to fostering adolescent self-esteem , and are in favor of distinguishing these two dimensions instead of considering them together as one general dimension related to control , as has classically been done in the study of parenting practices and adolescent adjustment .

The results of the regression analysis revealed that life satisfaction in adolescence increased when parenting was characterized by strong practices of affect and communication , high self-disclosure in their relations , low psychological control , and strong sense of humor , where affect and communication , which predominates in authoritative and indulgent parenting styles , was the parenting practices variable with the most predictive power for life satisfaction .

Nevertheless , these findings must be interpreted within a methodological limitation of this study , which is that the information on parenting practices comes exclusively from the adolescents themselves , and there could , therefore , be some bias in the results contributing to a higher correlation between variables .

Moreover , although the use of standardized tests , such as questionnaires , have frequently been used in similar studies , e. g. , , it is suggested that future research also uses observational records of parent-child interaction or interviews , which enable parenting practices to be explored .

These findings coincide with our research hypothesis that , a priori , it was expected to find significant differences in the level of life satisfaction between adolescents with high and low self-esteem , in favor of those with high self-esteem compared to those with low self-esteem .

In this respect , future studies could explore the role of positive communication in adolescent wellbeing in greater depth , considering the combined effect of dimensions , such as humor , affect/communication , and self-disclosure in their development , taking sex differences into account .

In this case , our data show that it is relevant and advisable to develop positive self-esteem in the adolescent , among other reasons , because it improves fluid , spontaneous parent-child communication , generating more life satisfaction in adolescents .

First , our data showed that different dimensions of parenting practices , in particular , those of affect and communication , promotion of autonomy , self-disclosure , humor , psychological control , and self-esteem are related to each other .

According to our results , adolescents who scored high in self-esteem were those who perceived the most affect and communication from their parents , as well as the most promotion of their autonomy and humor in the parent-child relationship .

Other studies have agreed that the above dimensions , except for psychological control , contribute to improving the quality of the parent-adolescent child relationship , as they respect and accept their individuality , which facilitates adolescents evaluating themselves positively .

It should , therefore , be mentioned that interpersonal relations are two-way , so both parents and children have an active role in the relationship , in which the psychological characteristics of both intervene .

Thus , some authors emphasize the importance of parental support based on acceptance , open communication , and affect as one of the most important predictors of life satisfaction .

Even so , some authors believe that the adolescent is one of the most reliable sources for evaluating parenting practices because they are less conditioned by social desirability .

Specifically , the higher the score on the affect and communication , promotion of autonomy , humor , and self-disclosure variables , the higher life satisfaction was .
