Benzophenone ( Ph2CO ) is activated by UV light in the range 350 – 360 nm , and its reaction mechanism is as follows : The carbonyl oxygen forms a ketyl radical when exposed to UV light and then abstracts the hydrogen from a C – H bond in a nearby molecule , followed by C – C bond formation between Ph2CO and the attacked molecule .

The characterization of metal binding to metalloproteins is vital for our understanding of the relationship between structure and function . Fundamental for metal binding activity is the intrinsic binding constant , which is a parameter that describes the affinity with which metal ions are bound to specific protein sites .
