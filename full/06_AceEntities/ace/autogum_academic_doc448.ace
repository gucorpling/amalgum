Due to its low molecular weight ( 75 Da ) and soluble non ionizable nature , with minimal protein-bound fraction , we consider TMAO to be entirely filtered through the glomerular basement membrane , which is the main known elimination route for TMAO .

However , the IQR of TMAO FE showed that some patients exhibited higher or lower clearances of TMAO compared to mGFR ; especially in the control group where the median FE of TMAO was 103 % [ IQR 55 â€“ 144 ] .

Thus , TMAO levels could result from variations in production levels ( including dietary precursor intake , TMA endogenous production from gut microbiota , TMA and TMAO intestinal absorption , and FMO3 enzymatic activity ) or from its renal excretion .

TMAO clearance was similar to that of mGFR , higher than that of urea , and lower than that of creatinine , suggesting that TMAO is neither secreted as creatinine nor reabsorbed as urea by renal tubules .

These results are in line with another recent study reporting that urinary TMAO/creatinine ratios ( used as a surrogate of TMAO excretion rate ) were not significantly different between control and CKD subjects .

In the present study , we confirmed that TMAO is increased in CKD based on an inverse , although weak , correlation ( r2 = 0.388 ) between plasma TMAO and mGFR .

This study was therefore designed to assess the exact changes in TMAO values according to CKD stages as determined by gold standard measurements of GFR and its potential modifications during renal metabolism .

Identified mechanisms for target molecule elevation in CKD patients are either a decrease in renal excretion , an increase in endogenous production or both .
