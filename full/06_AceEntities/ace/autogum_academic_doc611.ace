These include ; ( a ) hazard control through training in safe lifting , ( b ) control of employee exposure through pre-employment strength testing , and ( c ) control of job demands through the adoption of workloads acceptable for the industrial worker . Snook et al. studied 191 cases of lower back ( LB ) injuries to define the effectiveness of prophylactic methods utilized in industrial establishments .

A recent study by Shojaei et al. illustrated that work-related musculoskeletal disorder impacts the quality of the industrial workers , and affects the overall production capacity of the company , globally . Vos et al. concluded that lower back pain has accounted for worker ’s disability across 139 countries from a total of 188 countries .

It was found in the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board ( WSIB ) statistical report that a total of 7.7 days of work are lost in a month due to a workplace injury , which accounted for an average of 14.1 working days within three months .

Such as , an earlier study of Ciriello and Snook assessed the influence of frequency , distance , height , and size of the box on the worker concerning his lifting , pulling , and pushing tasks by measuring oxygen consumption and heart rate(HR ) .

Similar results are indicated by the recent research of Abadi et al. on Iranian workers , which reported that variables such as lifting frequency and the box size affected worker ’s maximum acceptable weight of lift ( MAWL ) and heart rate .

Generally , manual task handling and lifting occur frequently in both occupation and non-occupational jobs , as per its specific requirement , significantly contributing to the increased lower back pain .
