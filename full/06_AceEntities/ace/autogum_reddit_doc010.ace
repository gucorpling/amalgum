Innovative next mainly due the off-innovative policy which gives me 1 leader siege pip + 10 % siege ability . also , tech cost reduction , advisor cost reduction paired with estates advisors , +1 leader and war exhaustion reduction are phenomenal imo . after innovative I 'd go aristocratic mainly for the extra +1 leader siege pip . reduced army tradition decay is good aswell since im constantly at war and the +33 % national manpower is much needed as of now .

I want to put it in Europe , preferably Constantinople , to finally get these juicy Trade Companies ( works only if your capital is in continental Europe , right ? ) , but this wont happen anytime soon .

Also , I feel like i 'd be wasting too much time micro managing my troops conquering Ming this early ( no free forced march , low on manpower , weak economy atm ) .

Since I only recently learned how to trigger C&C , i do nt quite know whether i should stop declaring wars until it finishes or just keep on declaring .

Everything east of me is either Ming or a tributary of theirs , except Japan , Malacca and the indie-Nations , which are out of reach .

They are at 0 Mandate already and i think I can manage conquering Ming quite fast due to the amount of Tributaries they have .
