Practical applications at the scale of an actual building will necessitate that some parts of the formed molds , such as edges that connect with other building elements , maintain high levels of geometrical precision , while the middle zones of the geometry can be treated in a less strict and more explorative manner .

Another advantage of our method pertains to a novel mode of operation that it offers , in which the material is allowed to shape and compose itself partially on its own , with the human designer and the fabrication machine only to a certain extent guiding the process instead of controlling it entirely .

Therefore , considering SPIF research in a broader context of the engineering disciplines can provide , to a certain extent , a background for discussing the significance of our study and its role in the development of the current approaches to handling the errors in fabrication .

This can be considered beneficial from an esthetic standpoint , as the material accumulations caused by the intentionally tweaked mold errors emphasize the intricate esthetic attributes of the material cast into the mold , offering an opportunity for unusual , bottom-up design feature generation .

Although the framework is supported by digital and computational means , which by definition are precise , an advantage is that it also offers several entry points for ambiguous explorations that may be preferred by some designers , especially those with an artistic orientation .

The conventional mode of material crafting and processing , in which the material is merely formed , transformed , and reshaped , either by the designer ’s hand or by the machine tool , is therefore expanded in our framework .

We hope that our research can play a part in the emergence of an alternative strand of architectural design methods , featuring material agency as an enriching design medium , existing side-by-side with the conventional design means .

In addition , in the manufacturing engineering methods , the geometry alteration is a straightforward and deterministic one and is often preceded by computational analyses of material stresses and precise digital simulation of the forming conditions .

Our framework therefore mediates a novel approach to design , in which designers can work very closely with material behaviors and react to these behaviors in an artistic , intuitive , and ambiguous way .

For instance , they advocate the creation of addendum surfaces and extracurricular support structures , input geometry splitting and varying toolpath designs to enable multi-pass forming , as well as input geometry alteration .

The key discipline researching SPIF is manufacturing engineering , in which a number of methods have been developed to deal with the geometrical inaccuracies introduced by this forming method .

Influencing these behaviors in an indirect manner creates a possibility to shape the expressive attributes of the design through the medium of the material , instead of mere drawing .

Today , the scarce number of research publications on architectural SPIF indicates that knowledge of this promising fabrication method is still limited and should be expanded further .

In contrast to the engineering approaches described above , the framework resulting from this study embodies an alternative , bottom-up approach to erroneous feature handling .

The benefit of this is that each iteration opens up several potential avenues for further explorations , all originating from one initial design .

Importantly , we also believe that an advantage of our method is its capacity to be combined with conventional , precision-oriented fabrication .

The framework ’s construction and implementation workflow also ensure that geometric feature explorations take place in a gradual , iterative manner .

Such a process is , in our case , based on approximate , qualitative ocular examinations and not computational calculations .
