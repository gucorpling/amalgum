Scientists debate whether its environmental degradation , in the form of the loss of its palm forests and soil to erosion , was caused by human activity , natural climate change , or by rats and other introduced species that stowed away on the colonists ' boats , but there is consensus that the island 's environment changed considerably over time .

The exceptions to the rule about being at the coast where water comes out actually are met by the fact there is also water there – it is found through cave locations , " referring to caves with fresh water , and that some historical evidence suggests there may have been wells dug near the ahu that are not near caves .

What is important about it is that it demonstrates the statue locations themselves are not a weird ritual place – [ the ahu and moai ] represent ritual in a sense of there is symbolic meaning to them , but they are integrated into the lives of the community , " said study co-author Professor Carl Lipo of Binghamton University .

They compared the sites of the statues to sites associated with the specific resources : the kind of rock the statues are made of , the kind of rock used for tools , fishing , vegetable and potato cultivation , and water sources .

The study , published on Thursday in PLOS One , employed quantitative spatial analysis to establish that the platforms , or ahu , built to support the Easter Island statues , or moai , are usually located near sources of drinkable water .

The archaeologists say that this study is the first attempt to formally examine the idea that the locations of the moai are correlated to locations of resources important to the people who built them , such as fresh water .
