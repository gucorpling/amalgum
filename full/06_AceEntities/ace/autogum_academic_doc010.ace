In contrast to other enzymes in the carotenoid metabolic pathway , PTOX did not directly accelerate the conversion of intermediate products but accepted the electrons from PDS and ZDS and then delivered them as soon as possible (

Green and white stripes on the leaves of immutans confused researchers because they were not caused by the loss of enzymes in the chlorophyll synthesis pathway ; the white sectors contained few carotenoids but accumulated phytoene .
