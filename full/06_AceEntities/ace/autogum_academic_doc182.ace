As mentioned above , the most common problems of stents are due to their clogging due to the formation of biofilm and adhesion of biological substances that pass through the stent .

Existence in biofilms is for them more advantageous because biofilm provides protection for their cells , maintains a homeostasis , and creates a barrier that isolates bacteria from the surroundings .

In addition , other options based on physical surface properties such as surface roughening , or vice versa smooth surface , super hydrophobic , etc. should be considered .

The surface of the material is very quickly occupied by bacteria because the host products create a biofilm on the material that helps to bind the bacteria .

Biomaterials at risk of attaching bacteria together with corresponding body fluids and major components of the host products for bacterial growth are classified in Table 1 .

The biofilm ’s high resistance to antibacterial agents results in a great risk of infection and therefore creates a very hazardous situation for patient health .

Thus , bacteria cells in biofilm are more resistant to toxic substances , UV radiation , mechanical damage , bacteriophages , or predators .

There is extensive communication between bacteria and the effective horizontal transfer of resistance and virulence genes that make bacteria very resistant .
