Regarding the comparison of the effects of flipped learning according to the educational stage in which it is put into practice , in preschool education , critical thinking is boosted more profusely , while self-regulation , autonomy , and interactions with peers stand out in their application more strongly during the primary stage than during the preschool stage .

The results obtained in the descriptive analysis allow us to verify that the results of its application vary , according to the educational stage in which the teacher performs their function , with a directly proportional trend observed between the effectiveness of the approach and the stage of student education .

The results obtained are similar to those found in the scientific literature , such as high motivation rates when participating in the teaching and learning process as well as during high levels of self-regulation and flexibility of the training process and notable improvements in interaction and collaboration with colleagues .
