The payback period should always be used in conjunction with other decision-making metrics , such as return on investment ( ROI ) and internal rate of return ( IRR ) .

After 11 years , $ 10,400 has been recovered ; this amount exceeds the initial investment , so the payback period must be between 10 and 11 years .

Learning how to work out the payback period for a particular investment or project is a matter of estimating a few cash flows and performing a simple calculation .

The payback period is 10 years , because after 10 years the original cash outflow has been recovered ( $ 10,000 * 10 = $ 100,000 ) .
