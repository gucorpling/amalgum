Under the pressure of reducing the energy consumption of residential sector , several country governments have proposed various policies or strategies to promote the use of smart technology in home energy saving , such as the European Commission ’s “ Create technologies and services for smart homes that provide smart solutions to energy consumers ” and the Smart Hong Kong plan “ Promote and support households to utilize smart home mobile apps to monitor household energy consumption and set targets ” .

SHET achieves its energy management goals in two ways : ( 1 ) providing residents with their energy consumption information , to help residents cultivate energy saving behaviors ; and ( 2 ) providing residents the ability to control the domestic appliances which can be scheduled or optimized via smart devices , so that they can utilize some electricity tariff policies to cut their energy bills .
