The easiest way to get around Bridgeport by public transport is on the two main east-west bus routes #35 and #39 , which run along 35th St and Pershing Rd , as well as the aforementioned #8 running north-south on Halsted St. Bus routes are not terribly convenient between the two neighborhoods , but #62 Archer does run along the north of Bridgeport from the Chinatown L stop , from which you can hop on the Halsted route .
