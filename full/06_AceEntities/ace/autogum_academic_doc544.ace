It should be emphasized that the interior of a microdroplet is unlikely to be of the same uniform molar composition as bulk liquid , because the effects of interaction with the encasing layer will propagate into the interior , with the result that composition will have a dynamical gradient along a radius from the center to the exterior .

It has been argued recently that G is computable from observations in a scale invariant medium , and shown to work : ( 1 ) where K ( q )/ q is a scaling quantity related to partition function f , Boltzmann constant k and temperature T by : ( 2 ) ( 3 )

This scaling range will be defined by the three orders of magnitude between the inner scale of a few mean free paths and the outer scale defined by the microdroplet ’s circumference , much as a great circle defines the outer scale for the atmosphere .
