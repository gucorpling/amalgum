In the scope of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for sustainable development goals ( SDGs ) , health promotion — SDG 3 — is a multidimensional target directly related to other goals , such as inequality reduction — SDG 10 — which emphasizes its complexity .

Recent international studies have highlighted that the human right to health must consider , among other factors , that the universal health “ coverage should be on the basis of need , with extra weight given to the needs of the underprivileged ” .
