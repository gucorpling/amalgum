Chief Inspector Kerry , of the Criminal Investigation Department , stood before the empty grate of his cheerless office in New Scotland Yard , one hand thrust into the pocket of his blue reefer jacket and the other twirling a malacca cane , which was heavily silver-mounted and which must have excited the envy of every sergeant-major beholding it .

He never smoked in public , as his taste inclined towards Irish twist and a short clay pipe ; but he was addicted to the use of chewing-gum , and as he chewed -- and he chewed incessantly -- he revealed a perfect row of large , white , and positively savage-looking teeth .

His reefer jacket fitted him faultlessly , but his trousers were cut so unfashionably narrow that the protuberant thigh muscles and the line of a highly developed calf could quite easily be discerned .
