Since it 's now on my mind , I wanna share some of my favorite and/or most memorable dungeons in JRPGs : Shinra Building ( Final Fantasy VII ) : still one of my favorite dungeons ever and it just felt ... organic and not a place that just exists because the plot demands it .

Sword Valley , Mechonis Field , and Agniratha ( Xenoblade ) : Sword Valley just sounds metal af , Mechonis Field is metal af ( down to the battle theme ) , and Agniratha is one of the most depressing parts of the game in context .

Club Zodiac ( Persona 2 Eternal Punishment ) : the most shining example of the rumor system in action ; you can literally make this dungeon easy or difficult solely on whether or not you wanna spread a rumor about it .

It rented space in my head immediately . Artorius ' Throne ( Tales of Zestiria ) : I think this is the best looking final dungeon of the modern Tales games and it 's not even close .

Its layout is pretty fun , and the best part is that you get to visit it several times throughout the main story , each time discovering new places and entrances .
