Ultraviolet radiation from sunlight exposure is required for cutaneous production of vitamin D. It was proposed that obese individuals , overall , have suboptimal levels of vitamin D because they tend to participate in fewer outdoor activities and , accordingly , have less exposure to sunlight .

An interventional study demonstrated that one month of vitamin-D intake ( 1,5000 IU/day ) reduced tissue sensitivity to the stimulation of the renin – angiotensin system manifested by improved renal blood flow and reduced mean arterial pressure during an infusion of angiotensin II .

The purpose of the current study is to investigate the effects of vitamin D on the microvasculature isolated from both subcutaneous ( SAT ) and visceral adipose tissue ( VAT ) in morbidly obese adults before and after bariatric surgery-induced weight loss .

Lastly , vitamin-D deficiency may also be due to inadequate dietary intake or malabsorption of vitamin D. Obesity is a well-established risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , and several mechanisms may contribute to this link .

Despite this accumulating evidence of the role of vitamin D in vascular function , direct mechanistic evidence of this role in the microvasculature of morbidly obese population and how it might be modified following massive weight loss are largely unexplored .

Vitamin D is a lipid-soluble vitamin , and it is thought that the lower bioavailability of vitamin D in obese individuals , compared to lean individuals , is due to vitamin-D sequestration within the adipose tissues .

VDR is a transcription factor that enters the nucleus upon binding to vitamin D , where it attaches to specific DNA regions and activates the transcription of a myriad of genes that coordinate several biological responses .

The central hypothesis is that vitamin D would improve microvascular function in obese adults via improving flow-mediated NO production , and this effect would be of a greater magnitude before compared to after weight loss .
