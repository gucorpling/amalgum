Having been allowed to wander over the edge of an exceedingly steep crag , while still a child , by the aged and untrustworthy person who had the care of him , and yet suffering little hurt , he was carried back to the city in triumph , by the one in question , who , to cover her neglect , declared amid many chants of exultation that as he slept a majestic winged form had snatched him from her arms and traced magical figures with his body on the ground in token of the distinguished sacred existence for which he was undoubtedly set apart .

“ Upon a certain evening , when Quen sat in his inner chamber deliberating upon the really beneficent yet somewhat inexplicable arrangement of the all-seeing ones to whom he was very amiably disposed in consequence of the unwonted tranquillity which he now enjoyed , yet who , it appeared to him , could have set out the entire matter in a much more satisfactory way from the beginning , he was made aware by the unexpected beating of many gongs , and by other signs of refined and deferential welcome , that a person of exalted rank was approaching his residence .

While he was still hesitating in his uncertainty regarding the most courteous and delicate form of self-abasement with which to honour so important a visitor -- whether to rush forth and allow the chair-carriers to pass over his prostrate form , to make a pretence of being a low-caste slave , and in that guise doing menial service , or to conceal himself beneath a massive and overhanging table until his guest should have availed himself of the opportunity to examine at his leisure whatever the room contained -- the person in question stood before him .

This residence is certainly unprepossessing in the extreme , yet it contains many objects of some value and of great rarity ; illiterate as this person is , he would not be so presumptuous as to offer any for your acceptance , but if you will confer upon him the favour of selecting that which appears to be the most priceless and unreplaceable , he will immediately , and with every manifestation of extreme delight , break it irredeemably in your honour , to prove the unaffected depth of his gratified emotions . ’

“ In this manner it came about that when a very wealthy but unnaturally avaricious and evil-tempered person who was connected with Quen ’s father in matters of commerce expressed his fixed determination that the most deserving and enlightened of his friend ’s sons should enter into a marriage agreement with his daughter , there was no manner of hesitation among those concerned , who admitted without any questioning between themselves that Quen was undeniably the one referred to .

“ Though naturally not possessing an insignificant intellect , a continuous habit , together with a most irreproachable sense of filial duty , subdued within Quen ’s internal organs whatever reluctance he might have otherwise displayed in the matter , so that as courteously as was necessary he presented to the undoubtedly very ordinary and slow-witted maiden in question the gifts of irretrievable intention , and honourably carried out his spoken and written words towards her .
