Seven years before , he had seriously answered , “ Next month , I think , ” to the chaffing attempt to secure his custom made by that distinguished local wit , the Colebrook barber , who happened to be sitting insolently in the tap-room of the New Inn near the harbour , where the captain had entered to buy an ounce of tobacco .
