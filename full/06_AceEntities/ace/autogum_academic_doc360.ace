Since the management plan is not legally binding for either state sector authorities or municipalities , compliance is supposed to be ensured through participation in the entire process of formulating the plan ( from identifying and characterizing water bodies , through identifying crucial matters and defining environmental goals , to the formulation of the plan and program ) and through agreement on the content of the plan and program .

An informant representing the regional agricultural authority ( the county governor ’s office ) claimed that there were limits to the environmental demands they can impose on the farmers and still expect increased food production ( p. 170 ) .

The listed measures were efforts to optimize fertilization , to avoid plowing in the autumn , to lay out vegetation belts along rivers and streams , and to construct hydro-technical installations and coffer dams .

In the two RBDs of Vest-Viken and Glomma , discharge of nutrient from agriculture land ( particularly grain fields and vegetable fields ) causing eutrophication was the main problem related to agriculture .

The planning process makes the different actors ’ interests and objectives visible but does not resolve conflicts of interest among the actors ( p. 87 ) .
