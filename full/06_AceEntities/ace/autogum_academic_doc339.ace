Some well-known LUC datasets include the global land cover map ( GlobCover 2009 ) , the coordination of information on the environment ( CORINE ) land cover data of the European Union , the International Geosphere Biosphere Program ( IGBP ) land classification data , the 30-m-resolution global land cover dataset ( GlobeLand30 ) , and the national-scale LUC datasets developed by various governmental agencies and institutions , such as the National Land Cover Database ( NLCD ) in the United States ( US ) and the National Land Survey ( NLS ) database in China .

Löw , Knöfel , and Conrad investigated the classification uncertainty of remotely sensed data using alpha-quadratic entropy based on per-object class membership estimations obtained via a support vector machine algorithm , whereas the researchers in Reference detailed good practice recommendations for sampling , response , and analysis to facilitate the accurate assessment of land change maps .

However , despite the wide availability of LUC information , both data producers and users continue to be hampered by data interoperability and exchange problems between heterogeneous datasets due to differences in the classification schemas and class definitions , and such incompatibilities limit the scope of available applications that employ LUC data .

Land inventory projects require an LUC classification system ( CS ) that defines the standards used for data acquisition , interchange , and sharing along with descriptions of the systematic frameworks , class names , criteria used to discriminate them , and relationships between classes .
