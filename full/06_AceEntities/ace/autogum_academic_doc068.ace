These bacteria can stimulate plant growth via a series of mechanisms , including the production of phytohormones , such as indole-3-acetic acid ( IAA ) , gibberellins , cytokinins , and salicylic acid , as well as biological nitrogen fixation ( BNF ) , and an increase in nutrient availability and nitric oxide production .
