However , it is computationally intensive when the images of a database are described with high-dimensional features , limiting its scope of applications . Azzi et al. use a global feature-based system to reduce the search space and find candidate images in the database , then the local feature scale-invariant feature transform ( SIFT ) is adopted for points matching in pose estimation .

These methods perform a first step to retrieve candidate images from the database according to a similarity search , and the coarse position information of the query image is then obtained based on the geospatial information of these candidate images .
