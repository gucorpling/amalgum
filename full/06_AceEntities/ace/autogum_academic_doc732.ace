Thus , the novelty of this work consisted in the integration of the technical , environmental and social aspects to obtain a device , which not only met the engineering required features but also takes into account the user opinions and needs in the whole process .

The introduced methodology included several stages grouped in a process that consists of two parts : ( a ) Identification of energy consumption or natural resources , and ( b ) development of appropriate technology .

Due to the aim of this study was to compare our proposed solar wood-dryer with the traditional dryer it was immediately displacing , we omitted comparisons with other devices in the market .

It is well known that the way to check the impact of the appropriate technology is through monitoring that evaluates the transfer and adoption of it .

Therefore , it should be noted that accompaniment is a key factor since we believe that technology should always suits the user and not vice versa .
