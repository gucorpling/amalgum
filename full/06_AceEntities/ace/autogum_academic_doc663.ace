In this Special Issue , we focused on cytobiology of human PCa cells and its clinical applications to develop a major step towards personalized medicine matched to the individual needs of patients with early-stage and advanced PCa and CRPC .

Several major topic areas were discussed , e. g. , the pathophysiology of BPH , the tumor microenvironment of PCa , AR signaling in PCa progression , and the development of PCa detection and diagnosis .

In the last few years , however , several new options for the treatment of CRPC have been approved , e. g. , the CYP17 inhibitor , the AR antagonist , and the taxane .

ADT induces temporary remission , but the majority of patients ( approximately 60 % ) eventually progress to castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) , which is associated with a high mortality rate .

This symposium was started in 2002 and was held every four years in 2006 , 2010 , 2014 , and 2018 without any financial support from pharmaceutical companies and chemical industries .

The goal of this symposium was to discuss the biological mechanism of the development and progression of prostatic proliferative diseases such as benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) and PCa .

Despite this progress in the development of new drugs , there is a high medical need for optimizing the sequence and combination of approved drugs .

Generally , well-differentiated PCa cells are androgen-dependent , i. e. , androgen receptor ( AR ) signaling regulates cell cycle and differentiation .

On the other hand , androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) is the standard systemic therapy given to patients with advanced PCa .

Most patients with early-stage PCa can be treated by the appropriate therapy , such as radical prostatectomy or irradiation .

Loss of AR signaling after ADT triggers androgen-independent outgrowth , generating poorly differentiated , uncontrollable PCa cells .

Once PCa cells lose their sensitivity to ADT , effective therapies are limited .
