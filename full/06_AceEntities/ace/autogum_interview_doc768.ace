( This is a kind of " wind " of interstellar dust , caused by the fact that our solar system is moving with respect to the local interstellar medium . ) Markus Landgraf has estimated the number of interstellar dust particles that should have been captured by Stardust during two periods of the " cruise " phase of the interplanetary orbit in which the spacecraft was moving with this wind .

The tracks in the demo are from submicron carbonyl iron particles that were shot into aerogel using a particle accelerator modified to accelerate dust particles to very high speeds , to simulate the interstellar dust impacts that we 're looking for .

The bottleneck , we expect ( but do n't really know yet ) is in the scanning — we can only scan about one tile per day and there are 130 tiles in the collector … .

When people are searching using the virtual microscope , they will be looking not for the particles , but for the tracks that the particles make , which are much larger — several microns in diameter .

The Galileo and Ulysses spacecraft carried dust detectors onboard that Eberhard Gruen and his colleagues used to first detect and them measure the flux of interstellar dust particles streaming into the solar system .

He estimated that there should be around 45 particles , but this number is very uncertain — I would n't be surprised if it is quite different from that .

There is a wonderful quote attributed to Einstein — " If we knew what we were doing , it would n't be called " research " , would it ?

These particles will be quite diverse , so we 're hoping that we 'll continue to have lots of volunteers collaborating with us on this after the initial discoveries .

It may be that the 50th particle that we find will be the real Rosetta stone that turns out to be critical to our understanding of interstellar dust .
