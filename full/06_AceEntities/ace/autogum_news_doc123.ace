That helped us to calibrate how quickly the virus evolved and make some really robust inferences about when it crossed into humans , how the epidemic grew from that time , and what factors allowed the virus to enter and become a successful human pathogen , " Dr. Worobey said .

Study of both the samples and estimate of the rate at which the virus mutates over time has led the researchers to conclude that the human strain could have been around for 100 years .

The present study pushes the date of the infection back to sometime between 1884 and 1924 , with a more focused estimate at 1908 .
