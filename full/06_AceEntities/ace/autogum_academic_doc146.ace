Measures on relative income can be largely classified into two major categories : ( 1 ) an objective measure , such as absolute income level relative to the median or average income of an individual ’s community , city , state/province , or country of residence , or of an individual ’s gender , age , or education group , and ( 2 ) a subjective measure , such as self-perceived relative income level in comparison to a reference group .

Conventional measures for subjective well-being primarily focused on the tangible aspects of living conditions , such as housing and employment , whereas more recent research starts to explore the less tangible parts of subjective well-being , namely what people think and feel about their lives , such as the quality of their relationships , their emotions and resilience , and their overall life satisfaction .

These contradicting observations led to the Easterlin Paradox — an increase in personal income can significantly increase happiness and life satisfaction ; when income level is low , happiness or life satisfaction is initially positively influenced by income both across and within nations , whereas life satisfaction is simply less dependent income as one ’s wealth increases .

This hypothesis might hold the potential to explain , at least in part , the Easterlin Paradox — as people ’s living condition continues to improve , relative income could play a more essential role in determining life satisfaction relative to absolute income .

Conventional economic theory predicts an increase in life satisfaction ( also known as “ utility ” in economics terminology ) attributable to people ’s ability to purchase and consume more goods given a higher disposable income .

Indeed , empirical evidence from less developed nations documented higher life satisfaction in response to economic growth , but such a positive relationship between income and life satisfaction was not replicated in the wealthy nations .

Early studies on life satisfaction were conducted within the domains of psychology and philosophy and focused on the individual-level determinants of life satisfaction , such as genes , personalities , and value systems .

As a key component of subjective well-being , life satisfaction is one ’s evaluation of life as a whole , rather than the feelings and emotions that are experienced in the moment .

The relative income hypothesis posits that the satisfaction or utility a person derives from a given income depends on its relative magnitude in the society rather than its absolute amount .
