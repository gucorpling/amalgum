However , the continuous exposure of lettuce plants to very high irradiation causes a loss of vitamin C , whereas continuous low irradiation improves the content of this metabolite . Shen et al. found that in lettuce , continuous illumination with red-blue light emitting diodes ( LEDs ) increases the vitamin C content in relation to the exposure time .

In cabbages stored for 15 days at low temperatures , the content of vitamin C was higher in the presence of blue light , unlike what was observed in asparagus stored at 4 °C , in which the vitamin C content after six days of blue light did not differ from the control in the dark .

Moreover , photosynthesis increases the amount of soluble carbohydrates , which are biosynthetic precursors of vitamin C. Three genes involved in carbohydrate accumulation and translocation have been related to a quantitative trait locus ( QTL ) associated with a 1.4-fold vitamin C increase in tomato .

The regulatory effects of monochromatic lights of the UV-Vis spectrum on the modulation of vitamin C content have been studied in different species , but the obtained results are often contradictory , suggesting that different species can respond differently to specific wavelengths .

However , the enhancement of vitamin C in plants seems to be dependent on the total amount of incident global radiation , which can be regulated by modulating light intensity or the duration of plant ’s exposure to light .

Furthermore , continuous irradiation with blue LEDs is more effective than pulsed irradiation and is related to increased expression of genes involved in the modulation of the vitamin C pool , suggesting a control at the transcriptional level .
