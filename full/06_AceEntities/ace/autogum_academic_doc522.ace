Acrylamide has been classified by the Agency for Research on Cancer as “ probably carcinogenic to humans ” ( Group 2A ) and , in the latest report from the European Food Safety Authority Expert Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain ( CONTAM , 2015 ) , the margins of exposure for acrylamide lead to concerns regarding their neoplastic effects , based on animal evidence .

In response to this , the food industry has been forced to apply different strategies to reduce acrylamide formation , applying processing modifications according to recommendations published by the European Food and Drink Federation in the document “ Acrylamide Toolbox ” , which includes the following variables : temperature and time during frying , blanching treatment , and thickness of potato slices .

Several studies consider Maillard reactions to be the main pathway for acrylamide , 5 hydroxymethylfurfural , methylglyoxal – lysine dimers , Nε – carboxymethyl – lysine and pyrraline formation in processed foods , particularly reactions between the carbonyl group of reducing sugars and amino acids .

Acrylamide , a thermal processing contaminant with a low molecular weight , which is soluble in water , is formed when carbohydrate-rich foods are subjected to temperatures above 120 °C in low-moisture conditions , such as frying , roasting or baking .

Among the techniques mentioned before , in vitro models are more commonly used than in vivo models , because of their simplicity , lower cost , lack of ethical issues and good reproducibility under controlled conditions .

Potato chips are an important part of the snack food market in many countries , and few studies have been published about the bioavailability of acrylamide after crisps have been through the digestion process .

In general , potato products present higher acrylamide contents ( 250 – 4000 µg kg−1 ) compared to other food products , because of the higher concentration of asparagine in potato tubers .

There are chemical changes in the food when it enters the digestive tract , because of pH variations , and the action of several enzymes in every stage of the digestion process .

Although it is important to evaluate the effect of pre-treatments on the frying process on acrylamide mitigation , it is also necessary to determine their influence on its bioavailability .
