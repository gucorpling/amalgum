The production of acid by lactic acid bacteria ( LAB ) under controlled acidification conditions is a preservation form very important in food production ; the pH of the food , the characteristics of the targeted microorganism , the fermented carbohydrate that is going to be used by the biopreservatives , the LAB growth kinetics , the temperature ( refrigeration or abuse ) , and the targeted pathogens are factors to be taken into account .

The use of LAB for biopreservation comes back to the 1950s for preventing the production of botulinum toxin ; Clostridium botulinum is unable to grow at pH < 4.6 , so LAB is added to the food for acid production after the use of a fermentable carbohydrate also added to it and , consequently , the pH decreases .

Some lactic acid bacteria produce ribosomally synthesized peptides , called bacteriocins , with antimicrobial capacity that are not lethal to the host ; these proteins inhibit both pathogenic and spoilage bacteria without changing the physicochemical characteristics of the food , that is , the inhibition is not exerted by acidification , protein denaturation , or other processes .

These authors also found a similar effect with the combination of Pediococcus acidilactici plus dextrose in chicken salad ; it was interesting to report that conditions of abuse temperature were the most effective for the production of acid by P. acidilactici after the use of dextrose .

Natamycin is produced by fermentation using Streptomyces spp. acting against foodborne moulds and yeasts ; however , it is inactive against bacteria and viruses . ( iii ) A third way is to use bacteriocin-producing bacteria as starter cultures to direct the fermentation .

Gram-negative bacteria can be increasingly sensitive to bacteriocins after the use of chelating agents or hydrostatic pressure ; these techniques can also be synergic enhancing the action of bacteriocins against Gram-positive bacteria , or even with the use of nanoparticles or nanovesicles .
