She longed for work which would be directly beneficent like the sunshine and the rain , and now it appeared that she was to live more and more in a virtual tomb , where there was the apparatus of a ghastly labor producing what would never see the light .

This proposal was only one more sign added to many since his memorable interview with Lydgate , that Mr. Casaubon 's original reluctance to let Dorothea work with him had given place to the contrary disposition , namely , to demand much interest and labor from her .
