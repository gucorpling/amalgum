Furthermore , due to the location of the target tree , it is difficult to use data from more than one location of LiDAR surrounding the target tree to prevent effect of leaf occlusion on reconstruction of 3D model for LAD estimation .

It seems likely that depending on the range of the leaf classification region , the level of effect of leaf curvature on the leaf angle estimation is different , but there was not enough evidence to prove this here .

Fortunately , even if such a problem presents itself , our approach can flexibly change the extent of the size of the classification region based on an automatic adjustment of the k -value to achieve more accurate results .

In addition , the issue of possible segmentation errors , which has been omitted in the majority of previous studies but which potentially affects the estimation of leaf angle distribution , was discussed .

Besides , the LiDAR-derived leaf angle method may also be useful in retrieving another leaf structural parameter , such as the leaf area index ( LAI ) .

Thus , in future work , we would like to collect data from sampling trees with different curvatures to discuss them for achieving higher leaf angle estimation .

In combination with our proposed method , we expect that more accurate leaf inclination angle estimation can be accomplished for leaf edges , even in small plants .

Aside from the remote sensing field , this method may also prove to be effective in the measurement of the leaf angle distribution in agriculture-relevant fields .

Looking at our study , automatic classification was achieved by specifying a different initial parameter ( L ) to find the k -value .
