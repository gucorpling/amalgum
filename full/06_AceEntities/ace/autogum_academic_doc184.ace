Furthermore , by establishing different boundary conditions and using Fick ’s second law to fit the apparent diffusion coefficient ( the apparent diffusion coefficients are all marked as “ diffusion coefficient ” in the manuscript hereafter for simplicity ) , three kinds of diffusion processes were studied .

The porous structure make the aerogels have many special properties , such as low density ( 1000 kg/m3 to about 1 kg/m3 ) , high porosity ( ~99 % ) and inner surface area ( 1000 m2/g ) , which is necessary for efficient drug loading .

In recent years , the use of porous silica materials in drug delivery has attracted a lot of interest due to its potential for the development of systems that are site-specific and that offer time-dependent controlled delivery .

The alcogel was brought into contactwith an aging solution which contains the RSV , and then the drug diffused into the alcogel pores from the aging solution .

This is may be due to the RSV dissolving into small molecules in an ethanol solution , which can diffuse into the pores of silica alcogel .

The reason we used freeze drying instead of supercritical drying is that the RSV will lose ethanol during the slow replacement process in supercritical drying .

However , diffusion also play an important role in the drug-loading process , and we should consider both the effects of diffusion and adsorption/desorption .

It must be emphasized that the role of ethanol was simply to dissolve the drug and allow it to diffuse into the alcogel .
