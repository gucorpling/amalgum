The trading model for emission rights futures proposed in this paper can not only effectively stimulate cooperation among regions in pollution control and decrease pollution control costs , but also represents a financial instrument that can be traded in financial markets , thereby increasing the variety of financial instruments available , and improving the flexibility of financial markets to deal with risks .

To accomplish these goals , we developed an emission rights futures trading model for joint air pollution control that accounts for employment , and then examined SO2 control in our study area in 2017 as a case study of the model .

The model also accounts for differences in the cost of pollution control among the cooperating regions , and uses futures-based trading methods to achieve a “ win-win ” effect , thereby increasing the ability to achieve sustainable development .

For example , the Chicago ’s Climate Futures Exchange started the SO2 futures trading in 2003 , and the European Climate Exchange began the emission rights futures and options trading for major atmospheric pollutants in 2005 .

The JCM in the present study can help polluted regions balance environmental control with economic development to ensure that residents of the affected areas can earn a living whilst also having a healthier environment .

However , because the financial markets of developing countries such as China are immature and the associated financial regulations are strict , these countries have not yet adopted emission rights futures and options trading .

Although we focused on pollution control within a single region of a country , it should be possible to extend the method to encourage countries to cooperate in regional air pollution control .

Against the background of severe air pollution and rigorous government policies to mitigate the problem , it has become necessary to reduce pollutant control costs without adversely affecting employment .

However , the emission rights futures trading model proposed in this paper is effective enough to encourage developing countries to test their ability to promote joint air pollution control .

When we accounted for employment , the JCM both increased employment and reduced pollution control costs compared with the JCM results without accounting for employment .

The results show that under the JCM , whether or not we accounted for employment affected both the cost of pollution control and employment .
