Its high activity originates from its zinc ( Zn(II ) ) containing active site , in which three histidine imidazole moieties coordinate a Zn(II)-ion leaving a vacant space for the association of a water molecule . Zn(II ) lowers the pKa of the bound water and forms a highly nucleophilic hydroxide species which reacts with CO2 , bound in close proximity , to yield HCO3− .

Peptides are available at low cost by solid-phase peptide synthesis , and their modular design paired with the available repertoire of natural and non-natural amino acids allows for facile diversification of functional groups , and thus the resulting catalytic activities and substrate specificities of the peptide shell .

Considering the fact that zinc metalloenzymes perform numerous other types of reactions in nature , including phosphodiester and amide hydrolysis as well as the ( de)hydrogenation of alcohols , it is of great interest to reconstitute such transformations in vitro by developing appropriate robust synthetic systems .
