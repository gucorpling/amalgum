In early 1502 , Thomé Lopes was hired as a escrivão ( captain 's clerk ) aboard an unnamed ship owned and outfitted by Ruy Mendes de Brito [ 1 ] ( a gentleman of the royal chamber of King Manuel I of Portugal [ 2 ] ) and captained by an Italian , Giovanni Buonagratia ( João de Buonagracia ) of Florence . [ 3 ]

But the most probable explanation is simply that the name ( and maybe even the locational information ) was reported to Thomé Lopes precisely by the two 5th Armada ships that , as already mentioned , Lopes just encountered near the Cape of Good Hope ( the two would have been coming precisely from Albuquerque 's ( re-)discovery of Ascension island ) .

Among the most memorable passages in Lopes 's account , is a detailed description of the notorious massacre of the Muslim pilgrim ships ( 3 October 1502 a day " that I remember every day of my life " [ 5 ] ) on the orders of Vasco da Gama .

Another famous episode reported by Lopes is the execution by impaling of three Muslims in Cochin , on the orders of the Trimumpara Raja , the Hindu prince of Cochin , for the sacrilege of selling a cow for beef to the crew of a Portuguese ship in harbor .

It is notable that it was admiral Vasco da Gama himself ( not usually known for his cultural sensitivity ) who arrested the three men and handed them over to the Cochinese authorities for justice , and forbade any further purchases of cows by Portuguese sailors . [ 6 ]

The only quibble remains with Lopes 's use of the name " Ascension " island , as it is commonly thought Nova originally named it Conceição ( Conception island ) , and it was only renamed " Ascension " later ( May 1503 ) by Afonso de Albuquerque .

It is commonly accepted that Ascension island was first discovered in May 1501 on the outward journey of João da Nova , and some writers [ 11 ] have questioned how Lopes could have known about that island as he left Lisbon before Nova 's fleet returned .

One possible explanation is that Lopes 's account might not have been written immediately in 1502 , but a little later after his arrival in Portugal , after the name of Ascension island had already been settled upon . [ 13 ]

A clue is given in Lopes 's own account , where he describes how , in August 1502 , they picked up letters in Malindi left by the returning João da Nova . [ 12 ]
