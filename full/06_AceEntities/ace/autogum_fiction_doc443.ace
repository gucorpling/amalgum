Anybody may blame me who likes , when I add further , that , now and then , when I took a walk by myself in the grounds ; when I went down to the gates and looked through them along the road ; or when , while Adele played with her nurse , and Mrs. Fairfax made jellies in the storeroom , I climbed the three staircases , raised the trap-door of the attic , and having reached the leads , looked out afar over sequestered field and hill , and along dim sky-line -- that then I longed for a power of vision which might overpass that limit ; which might reach the busy world , towns , regions full of life I had heard of but never seen -- that then I desired more of practical experience than I possessed ; more of intercourse with my kind , of acquaintance with variety of character , than was here within my reach .

Then my sole relief was to walk along the corridor of the third storey , backwards and forwards , safe in the silence and solitude of the spot , and allow my mind 's eye to dwell on whatever bright visions rose before it -- and , certainly , they were many and glowing ; to let my heart be heaved by the exultant movement , which , while it swelled it in trouble , expanded it with life ; and , best of all , to open my inward ear to a tale that was never ended -- a tale my imagination created , and narrated continuously ; quickened with all of incident , life , fire , feeling , that I desired and had not in my actual existence .

Women are supposed to be very calm generally : but women feel just as men feel ; they need exercise for their faculties , and a field for their efforts , as much as their brothers do ; they suffer from too rigid a restraint , too absolute a stagnation , precisely as men would suffer ; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings , to playing on the piano and embroidering bags .

This , par parenthese , will be thought cool language by persons who entertain solemn doctrines about the angelic nature of children , and the duty of those charged with their education to conceive for them an idolatrous devotion : but I am not writing to flatter parental egotism , to echo cant , or prop up humbug ; I am merely telling the truth .

I felt a conscientious solicitude for Adele 's welfare and progress , and a quiet liking for her little self : just as I cherished towards Mrs. Fairfax a thankfulness for her kindness , and a pleasure in her society proportionate to the tranquil regard she had for me , and the moderation of her mind and character .

My pupil was a lively child , who had been spoilt and indulged , and therefore was sometimes wayward ; but as she was committed entirely to my care , and no injudicious interference from any quarter ever thwarted my plans for her improvement , she soon forgot her little freaks , and became obedient and teachable .

Sometimes I saw her : she would come out of her room with a basin , or a plate , or a tray in her hand , go down to the kitchen and shortly return , generally ( oh , romantic reader , forgive me for telling the plain truth ! ) bearing a pot of porter .

She made reasonable progress , entertained for me a vivacious , though perhaps not very profound , affection ; and by her simplicity , gay prattle , and efforts to please , inspired me , in return , with a degree of attachment sufficient to make us both content in each other 's society .

She had no great talents , no marked traits of character , no peculiar development of feeling or taste which raised her one inch above the ordinary level of childhood ; but neither had she any deficiency or vice which sunk her below it .
