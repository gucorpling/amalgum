Thorpe , as he stood up in the trap , got an uncertain , general idea of a low , pale-coloured mansion in the background , with lights showing behind curtains in several widely separated windows ; what he had taken to be a conservatory revealed itself now to be a glass gallery , built along the front of the central portion of this house .

All at once there were a number of young men -- at the horse 's head , at the back and sides of the trap , at the first doorway , and the second , and beyond -- each presenting such a smooth-faced , pallid , brown-clad replica of all the others that Thorpe knew he should never be able to tell them apart .

The irregularity of every thing outside -- the great table in the centre of the hall strewn with an incongruous litter of caps , books , flasks , newspapers , gloves , tobacco-pouches ; the shoes , slippers , and leggings scattered under the benches at the sides -- all this self-renewing disorder of a careless household struck Thorpe with a profound surprise .

There were many other suggestions of the chase about the room : riding boots , whips , spurs , and some stands of archaic weapons caught the eye at various points ; the heads of foxes and deer peeped out on the blackened panels of the walls , from among clusters of hooks crowded with coats , hats , and mackintoshes .

He kept up a continual murmuring monologue to the animal -- “So -- so -- quiet , my pet , -- sosoeasy , my beauty -- -so -- so” -- and his wrists and gloved hands were visibly under a tremendous tension of strain , as they held their own against the rigid arched neck and mouth of steel .

One of these was holding a spirited horse outside the station , and when Lord Plowden had taken the reins , and Thorpe had gathered the rugs about his knees and feet , this menial silently associated himself with the young man who had accompanied them from town , on the back seat of the trap .

Indeed , talk of any sort was not invited ; the big horse burst forth with high , sprawling strides upon a career through the twilight , once the main road was reached , which it taxed all Plowden 's energies to regulate .

It seemed but a very few minutes before they turned off , with but the most fleeting diminution of pace , upon a private road , which speedily developed into an avenue of trees , quite dark and apparently narrower than ever .

Down this they raced precipitately , and then , coming out all at once upon an open space , swung smartly round the crescent of a gravel road , and halted before what seemed to be the door of a greenhouse .
