In findings published Tuesday in Astronomy and Astrophysics , a team of scientists led by Ian Boutle at the University of Exeter have created successful simulations of two possible atmospheres of Proxima B , an exoplanet orbiting Proxima Centauri , one a simple atmosphere of nitrogen tinged with carbon dioxide and another an Earth-like mix of gases .

The University of Exeter 's lead exoplanet modeller , Dr. Nathan Mayne , in remarks to Wired , said , " If , and it is a huge if , the composition of the atmosphere was Earth-like then we showed the planet could indeed support temperatures which would allow liquid water on the surface " .

" Considering the host star 's age and the planet 's proximity to its host star , the scientists expect that Proxima B is subjected to torrents of X-ray and extreme ultraviolet radiation from superflares occurring roughly every two hours .

It might rotate around its axis quickly the way Earth does or it might be tidally locked to its sun , with one side of the planet always lit and the other always dark .

Co-author Dr. James Manners said , " One of the main features that distinguishes this planet from Earth is that the light from its star is mostly in the near infra-red [ ... ]

This new model allowed scientists to evaluate the effects of Proxima B 's possible orbits and likely exposure to radiation and solar flares from its red dwarf sun on two types of atmospheres .

Proxima B is believed roughly Earth-sized and in its solar system 's habitable zone , meaning it would have similar gravity to Earth and at least the possibility of liquid water .

The models described in this paper review two possible orbits : one tidally locked and one modeled after Mercury 's , with a slow-rotating three days per year .

In another statement , he emphasized researchers could also " exploit this to hopefully improve our understanding of how our own climate has and will evolve " .

These frequencies of light interact much more strongly with water vapour and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere which affects the climate that emerges in our model .

They found it possible that liquid water , a prerequisite for life as we know it , might exist on parts of the planet .
