Sure , you can spend a million Euro on trove if you 're Bill Gates and basically get full gear in no time , but the key point to it is - if you choose not to , you are not going to be ahead of someone who farmed it with time , and are not going to benefit from it in any way , except for feeling good about yourself and I guess 6v6 , which well I agree is an argument towards BNS being P2W , but c'mon now people , there is so much more to do in the game than 6v6 , which quite honestly does n't give that good of rewards if you compare it to the time spend in it , which you could use to farm Naksun or SSP for those precious moonstones .

You do not get anything extra for being the best in your party , you cannot get any sort of stat boost that a free to play player could not get by grind and if we really get into it , people who spend these giant amounts of money are the ones enabling us to play the game for free , instead of paying subscription money like in the Korean servers .

Thats just a bit of a rant from me I guess , Im no whale and my mediocre equipment vouches for that , but Im just tired of these BNS is P2W posts when I honestly do n't see any game in the market at the moment which comes as close to being equalized between free to play players and P2W players .

Also , make sure you 're the first one to get that +15 item that gives much , much greater stats than let 's say a +12 weapon , because if you are the one doing the most boss damage , you get extra drop !

This is evident in Vindictus - RNG upgrades from +8 and further with max being +15 , item gets destroyed on failure , but hey , you can buy an item shop rune to avoid destruction for only 9.99$ !

Okay look here is the big difference between p2w and pay to progress using Vindictus as an example , a game that had and honestly still probably has the best action gameplay on the market .

P2W means you spend money and you win , its in the name lul , it basically suggests that you can get an advantage that a free to play player could not .

Basically what I am trying to say , quit complaining so much about the game being P2W when clearly only 1 small end-game aspect of it is P2W .

Do n't forget to also buy item shop only costumes which give extra stats to your character while you 're at it !
