Well , Hubble has observed the collision between two galaxies and determined with a lot of evidence , that in the future , our galaxy , the Milky Way , and another close galaxy named Andromeda galaxy will collide in around 4 billion years , when we might not be alive .

But that wo n't be the end- a new telescope , named the James Webb Space Telescope , is Hubble telescope 's successor and will use Infrared vision , instead of Hubble 's usual visible vision to convey the secrets of the universe to us .

But however , some predict that this mighty sight will not cause an effect on Earth and its fellow planets- only the Sun will change its orbit direction and we will become a much larger , wider galaxy .
