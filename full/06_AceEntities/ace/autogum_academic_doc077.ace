Several studies have shown that NK cell-depleted mice and rats fail to control initial Lm infection , resulting in a higher bacterial burden , whereas in normal animals infected with Lm , NK cells are recruited from the blood to the spleen , liver , and/or lymph nodes , and increased NK cell activity is observed during the first days of Lm infection .

Further investigation revealed that NK cells and NK T cells ( NKT ) from FIV-infected cats display heightened constitutive levels of proliferation and apoptosis , and a defective response to Lm compared to the NK/NKT cell response in specific-pathogen-free ( SPF ) control cats .

The early control mechanism of Lm does not rely on T cells ; however , a T cell response is required for bacterial clearance , as demonstrated by T cell-deficient mice that are able to control but not clear Lm infection .

We also showed that locally delivered interleukin 15 ( IL-15 ) , a cytokine known to activate and stimulate natural killer ( NK ) cells , significantly restored innate immune function as measured by Lm clearance .

During chronic human , simian , or feline immunodeficiency virus infection ( HIV-1 , SIV , and FIV , respectively ) , Treg cells are capable of suppressing antiviral responses in vitro .

We hypothesized that in vivo Treg cell depletion using anti-feline CD25 monoclonal antibody prior to innate immune challenge with Lm would improve the innate immune response and the clearance of bacteria .

Our lab has shown that Treg suppression of antiviral responses is also exerted in vivo during chronic FIV infection and that transient depletion of CD25+ Treg cells improved the antiviral response .

Using this immune challenge model , we found that FIV-infected cats have an impaired innate response that fails to gain initial control of bacterial replication prior to the adaptive immune response .

Regulatory T cells ( Treg ) are thought to contribute to the control of excessive immune activation on one hand and suppression of the anti-viral response on the other hand .

Three key immunological features of lentiviral infection are the lack of an effective immune response against the virus , susceptibility to opportunistic pathogens , and generalized immune activation .

Our objective in the present study was to determine whether Treg contribute to the impaired NK cell function in FIV-infected cats , and reduced capacity to clear Lm .

The role of Treg in the suppression of the innate immune system and susceptibility to opportunistic infections has been much less studied .

It seems that NK cell production of interferon gamma after stimulation with IL-12 and IL-18 plays an important role in Lm control .

We have employed the intracellular opportunistic pathogen Listeria monocytogenes ( Lm ) to probe the immune defects associated with FIV .

Treg cells thus contribute to viral persistence in lentiviral infection by suppressing adaptive immune responses .

Such Treg-mediated suppression can render the host immune system unable to clear chronic infections .

The underlying mechanisms that lead to these immunologic alterations are complex and interrelated .
