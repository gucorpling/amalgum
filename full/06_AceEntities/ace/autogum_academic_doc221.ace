So , it follows that lessons available from BE theory might make a substantial contribution to the development of the government policy instruments that are being deployed to accelerate the transition to an energy efficient , low-carbon residential building stock ( see Table 4 below for examples ) .

More revealingly , each category of policy implementation is shown to suffer from significant flaws — deficiencies that might reasonably be attributed , at least prima facie , to a failure by policy makers to appreciate the implications of the behavioral changes expected from targeted stakeholder groups .

Although BE theory is being applied to policy implementation in areas such as consumer protection , finance , and public health , its principles have yet to be applied to the key building sector in the core area of building performance ( as energy efficiency ) .

This paper seeks to break new ground by examining residential building energy policy interventions using a BE approach , wherein the behavior of key stakeholders such as consumers , designers , and builders , is addressed from a socio-psychological perspective .

According to a definitive study by the Australian Government , residential space conditioning and water heating accounts for over 60 % of the total residential energy consumption , with the balance taken up by electrical appliances and cooking .

A recent OECD study into the potential application of BE principles to energy policy development concluded that areas for exploring the application of behavioral insights should specifically focus on regulatory implementation and decision making by regulatory agencies .

So , policy interventions focused on improved building design and construction are particularly important for reducing residential energy consumption , as downstream interventions directed towards reducing demand during building operation will inevitably be constrained by structural factors .
