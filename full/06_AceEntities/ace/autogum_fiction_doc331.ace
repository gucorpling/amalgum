TO recount with what trouble I have brought you up — with what an anxious eye I have regarded your progress , — how late and how often I have sat up at night working for you , — and how many thousand letters I have received from , and written to your various relations and friends , many of whom have been of a querulous and irritable turn , — to dwell on the anxiety and tenderness with which I have ( as far as I possessed the power ) inspected and chosen your food ; rejecting the indigestible and heavy matter which some injudicious but well-meaning old ladies would have had you swallow , and retaining only those light and pleasant articles which I deemed calculated to keep you free from all gross humours , and to render you an agreeable child , and one who might be popular with society in general , — to dilate on the steadiness with which I have prevented your annoying any company by talking politics — always assuring you that you would thank me for it yourself some day when you grew older , — to expatiate , in short , upon my own assiduity as a parent , is beside my present purpose , though I cannot but contemplate your fair appearance — your robust health , and unimpeded circulation ( which I take to be the great secret of your good looks ) without the liveliest satisfaction and delight .

We were stopping at some station where they take in water , when he dismounted slowly from the little box in which he sits in ghastly mockery of his old condition with pistol and blunderbuss beside him , ready to shoot the first highwayman ( or railwayman ) who shall attempt to stop the horses , which now travel ( when they travel at all ) inside and in a portable stable invented for the purpose , — he dismounted , I say , slowly and sadly , from his post , and looking mournfully about him as if in dismal recollection of the old roadside public-house the blazing fire — the glass of foaming ale — the buxom handmaid and admiring hangers-on of tap-room and stable , all honoured by his notice ; and , retiring a little apart , stood leaning against a signal-post , surveying the engine with a look of combined affliction and disgust which no words can describe .

And if I might compare you , my child , to an engine ; ( not a Tory engine , nor a Whig engine , but a brisk and rapid locomotive ; ) your friends and patrons to passengers ; and he who now stands towards you in loco parentis as the skilful engineer and supervisor of the whole , I would humbly crave leave to postpone the departure of the train on its new and auspicious course for one brief instant , while , with hat in hand , I approach side by side with the friend who travelled with me on the old road , and presume to solicit favour and kindness in behalf of him and his new charge , both for their sakes and that of the old coachman ,

As we whirled away , I was led insensibly into an anticipation of those days to come , when mail-coach guards shall no longer be judges of horse-flesh — when a mail-coach guard shall never even have seen a horse — when stations shall have superseded stables , and corn shall have given place to coke . ‘ In those dawning times , ’ thought I , ‘ exhibition-rooms shall teem with portraits of Her Majesty ’s favourite engine , with boilers after Nature by future Landseers .

His eye betokened that he was thinking of the coachman ; and as it wandered to his own seat and his own fast-fading garb , it was plain to see that he felt his office and himself had alike no business there , and were nothing but an elaborate practical joke .

His scarlet coat and golden lace were tarnished with ignoble smoke ; flakes of soot had fallen on his bright green shawl — his pride in days of yore — the steam condensed in the tunnel from which we had just emerged , shone upon his hat like rain .
