In a recent communication , the European Parliament warned that the inaccurate assessment or misleading presentation of climate and other environmental risks associated to financial products provided by banks can constitute a risk to market stability and asked the European Commission to design and adopt a new regulatory strategy aimed at measuring sustainability risks and to promote the inclusion of sustainability risks in the Basel IV framework to ensure that banks highly exposed to sustainability risks hold sufficient capital reserves for withstanding sudden losses .

This dynamic picture shows that one bank ( Credit Cooperatif ) is the only fully efficient ethical bank , as it always reached a score of 1 which placed it on the best-practices , efficiency frontier in each of the four years considered .

The study relied upon the most representative European ethical banks and aimed at investigating whether this special segment of the European banking sector performs its banking intermediation function efficiently , given the increased role it is going to play in the near future .

The robustness of the risk mitigation framework has to be assessed for both the ethical and traditional banks as in the future they will have to turn towards a more responsible financial conduct , from a societal and environmental viewpoint .

This new orientation of policies and strategies also incorporates ethical banks , as reliable pillars and tools for implementing this ambitious mission by channeling financing to small and medium-sized enterprises â€” SMEs , start-ups and entrepreneurs .

Interestingly , we obtained evidence of another ethical bank ( Alternative Bank from Switzerland ) which constantly improved its efficiency scores , from 71 % in 2014 to a level of 95.4 % in 2017 .

As argues , the different time horizons of risk exposure have to be appropriately managed and screened : Most financial risks exhibit a short-to medium-term horizon , as opposed to long-term environmental risks .

Their efficiency scores were computed successively for a time window of four years , in order to get a comparative view both across banks in the sample and across different time frames .

Consequently , two business models emerge as being successful in terms of achieved efficiency , namely the ones of Credit Cooperatif and Alternative Bank .

At the opposite end are two ethical banks from Norway and Denmark which persistently exhibited the lowest efficiency levels .
