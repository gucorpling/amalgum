It found that traditional taxis with experienced and professional drivers tended to operate more efficiently during peak hours and in more congested locations than the often-amateur drivers of ride-hailing services , many of whom rely heavily on GPS rather than personal knowledge .

This line of research posits that the emergence of ride-hailing is unlikely to eliminate the demand for traditional taxis , and both services are ultimately required ( and desired ) in large metropolitan areas .
