One must know whether one wants victory or tourism ... and I think it 's a lack of respect to all those who count on us , and all those who spend a lot [ of time ] ( production , television , etc ... ) to not take every chance to rank better or not put every chance of winning on our side .

Mocedades was a pure moment of happiness and of a formidable effectiveness ; Cliff Richard benefited from an exceptional notoriety and a mastery of the scene that I was far from having ; so I needed to play everything I had ... but I told you that I 'd chosen victory , not tourism !

I think it would be ridiculous and useless to go to Eurovision without wanting to win ! I never participate in a contest , or anywhere for that matter , when it consists of singing with a tourist view of it .

I got it twice ! What I mean to say is that Eurovision remains for me a musical contest before all else , although of course a good song is worth nothing without a good [ singer ] .

You ended up in a three-way dead heat between Mocedades from Spain and Cliff Richard from the United Kingdom , who both performed songs some fans also consider worthy of the grand prize .

If , hypothetically , your song did n't win , do you think either of them were strong enough to be winner material ?
