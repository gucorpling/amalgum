In our era , those wearing the appellation " conservative " have , by their actions , if not their rhetoric , defined conservative as … large deficit spending : " monopoly money " policies ; corporate welfare alliances ; first amendment restrictions ; greatly diminished civil liberties in the face of a boogey-man threat ; an unconstitutional , unified executive theory ; the leap into unconstitutional , pre-emptive wars , also based on boogey-man threats ; and an empire .

And in the future , we 'll call for government to follow it 's [ sic ] own accounting and reporting rules for the private sector , ala Sarbanes-Oxley , and a sunset provision requiring all taxes and programs to come up for a vote for re-authorization , with the requirement that they too be read , in full .

Nearly everyone I meet thinks Congress should be required to read their bills and post them online for seven days , pass bills one subject at a time , and be required to conduct periodic review so that some government programs that do n't work get shut down .
