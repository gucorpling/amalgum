I prefer to convert back to watts , because you can usually figure out the amplifier 's maximum wattage output into a given load more easily than you can figure out its maximum voltage output ( which may or may not vary with load , depending on the amplifier ) , and because if you are interested in power handling then you want to know the wattage going into the speaker .

Hi , I recently purchased a new pair of loudspeakers and an amp to replace my old amp - I saw no reason to not hook up my old pair of loudspeakers to my amp with the new ones too , but upon doing so I 've noticed that the volume levels of each pair are very different - the old pair only add a little to the overall sound .

My amplifier is a Pioneer A-10K , one pair of speakers are B&O Beovox S60s , and the other ( old ) pair are pioneer S-P510s ( they 're not very good , and were sold originally as a whole package with a different amplifier ) .

I do n't really understand the electrical theory stuff , but as far as I 've found on the internet ( both pairs bought second hand , I do n't have a user 's manual ) they have the same impedance .

Some manufacturers use a non-anechoic measurement ( including room contribution ) , and some use a peak somewhere in the response curve instead of using a broadband average - so comparing two manufacturer 's numbers may not really be apples-to-apples .

>Now , here is how the two are related : 2.83 volts into 8 ohms is one watt ; 2.83 volts into 4 ohms is 2 watts ; and 2.83 volts into 16 ohms is one-half watt .

The same opportunities for optimistic specs enter the picture - namely , using non-anechoic conditions and or taking the measurement at a peak rather than using a broadband average .

If you have a 16-ohm , 85 dB 2.83 volt speaker , it is also an 88 dB 1 watt efficient speaker .

TL ; DR why are two pairs of loudspeakers hooked up the same amp with the same impedance producing different volumes .
