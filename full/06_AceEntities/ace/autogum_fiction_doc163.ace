When a subject was accused of a crime of sufficient importance to interest the king , public notice was given that on an appointed day the fate of the accused person would be decided in the king 's arena , a structure which well deserved its name , for , although its form and plan were borrowed from afar , its purpose emanated solely from the brain of this man , who , every barleycorn a king , knew no tradition to which he owed more allegiance than pleased his fancy , and who ingrafted on every adopted form of human thought and action the rich growth of his barbaric idealism .

The moment that the case of the criminal was thus decided , doleful iron bells were clanged , great wails went up from the hired mourners posted on the outer rim of the arena , and the vast audience , with bowed heads and downcast hearts , wended slowly their homeward way , mourning greatly that one so young and fair , or so old and respected , should have merited so dire a fate .

When every member of his domestic and political systems moved smoothly in its appointed course , his nature was bland and genial ; but , whenever there was a little hitch , and some of his orbs got out of their orbits , he was blander and more genial still , for nothing pleased him so much as to make the crooked straight and crush down uneven places .

The arena of the king was built , not to give the people an opportunity of hearing the rhapsodies of dying gladiators , nor to enable them to view the inevitable conclusion of a conflict between religious opinions and hungry jaws , but for purposes far better adapted to widen and develop the mental energies of the people .

When all the people had assembled in the galleries , and the king , surrounded by his court , sat high up on his throne of royal state on one side of the arena , he gave a signal , a door beneath him opened , and the accused subject stepped out into the amphitheater .

Another door opened beneath the king , and a priest , followed by a band of choristers , and dancing maidens blowing joyous airs on golden horns and treading an epithalamic measure , advanced to where the pair stood , side by side , and the wedding was promptly and cheerily solemnized .

In the very olden time there lived a semi-barbaric king , whose ideas , though somewhat polished and sharpened by the progressiveness of distant Latin neighbors , were still large , florid , and untrammeled , as became the half of him which was barbaric .
