Dorothy was a little Kansas girl who had come to the Land of Oz to live and had been given a delightful suite of rooms in Ozma 's royal palace just because Ozma loved Dorothy and wanted her to live as near her as possible so the two girls might be much together .

There was another named Betsy Bobbin , whose adventures had led her to seek refuge with Ozma , and still another named Trot , who had been invited , together with her faithful companion Cap'n Bill , to make her home in this wonderful fairyland .

She went into the music room , the library , the laboratory , the bath , the wardrobe , and even into the great throne room , which adjoined the royal suite , but in none of these places could she find Ozma .

She walked into another room , which was Ozma 's boudoir , and then , pushing back a heavy drapery richly broidered with threads of pure gold , the girl entered the sleeping-room of the fairy Ruler of Oz .

Betsy was a year older than Dorothy and Trot was a year younger , yet the three were near enough of an age to become great playmates and to have nice times together .
