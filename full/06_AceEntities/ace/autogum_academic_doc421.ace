Some of these distributions nowadays appear very disjunct , but dispersal might have happened during Ice Age temperature depressions and associated widening of areas with temperate forests over large parts of Africa in connection with the quaternary glaciations .

Twenty-six ( 26 ) crustose calicioids reported here occur in Tanzania , most of them in mountain cloud forests , but some lowland species have also been included to make the list of crustose calicioids of Tanzania complete .

Calicioids have been shown to occur mainly in undisturbed forests with a long forest continuity , and they have frequently been used as bioindicators of habitats with high species diversity and as indicators of “ key habitats ” .

In Tanzania this pattern is also clearly discernable and calicioids mainly occur in mountain cloud forests ( middle and upper forest zones ) and their niches are found on the bark of old trees and on lignum .

In Africa occurrences of this “ cool temperate element ” are found from the Atlas , at high altitudes of the African volcanoes and the East Arch Mountains down to lower altitudes in Southern Africa .
