To simplify the interpretation of the results , we distinguished two classes of aberrantly methylated CpGs : Those in promoters , i. e. , located in the 5 ’ promoter gene region , which includes regions from 1500 bp upstream of the TSS up to the first exon of the gene , and those in gene bodies , including exons , introns , and 3’UTR sequences . For 81 % of the CpGs located in promoters for which methylation and expression were correlated , the correlation was negative , in concordance with the overall model .

These CpG sites are located in or near genes for which methylation and expression were previously reported to be correlated in pituitary adenomas , including STAT5A , RHOD , GALNT9 , and RASSF1 , as well as genes with previously described aberrant methylation in pituitary tumors , including CDKN1A , TP73 , and STAT3 .

When we compared the list of genes with methylation/expression correlation and the list of DEGs , most genes were hypermethylated with a fold change in expression corresponding to the sign of the correlation , e. g. , a gene with negative methylation/expression correlation that was hypermethylated and downregulated in tumors .

In a subset of genes , however , the fold change in expression was inconsistent with the difference in DNA methylation and the sign of the correlation , e. g. , a hypermethylated gene with negative methylation/expression correlation that was upregulated in tumors .

We believe that the differential the expression of these genes in NFPAs and pituitary tissue was due to a mechanism distinct from aberrant DNA methylation , despite the fact that the expression levels of these genes were methylation-related .

Gene body methylation has been observed in active genes , implying that it may have the opposite effect on gene expression to promoter methylation , i. e. , increased DNA methylation in gene bodies may promote transcription .

Our correlation-based analysis revealed that methylation of a major fraction of CpGs that are differentially methylated in gonadotroph adenomas and pituitary sections did not correlate with the expression of the annotated genes .
