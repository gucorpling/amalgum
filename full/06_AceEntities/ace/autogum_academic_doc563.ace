However , the MCSA technique presents a great difficulty in an accurate diagnosis of localized roller bearing faults due to issues such as : the low energy of the fault related spectral components and the close presence of high energy spectral components related to the power supply or to other mechanical sources .

Those frequencies depend on the bearing geometrical characteristics , and can present an error from external factors such as : geometric variations imposed by the failure itself , incorrect bearing installation , cage locking , improper lubrication and ball slip , for instance .

In MCSA , this is a more critical concern , since it is not uncommon to have high energy supply frequency harmonics near the bearing fault frequencies , which can demand a very high-resolution spectrum to distinguish spectral components of diverse nature .

The second kind , the localized one , is the one addressed in this work and its produced vibration is associated with certain frequencies that depend on the affected bearing element ( outter race , inner race , ball and cage ) .

In the first kind , the deterioration occurs in a generalized way , producing a vibration that , in the frequency domain , does not present a spectral component at a certain frequency but an increase in a broad frequency band .

In this technique , the vibration signal is bandpass filtered in a frequency range corresponding to the mechanical resonance of the system , which tends to amplify the impacts produced by a localized fault in any element of the roller bearing .

In order to correctly identify , in the current spectrum , the correct localized fault frequencies of roller bearings , this paper proposes the use of the envelope analysis of vibration signal as a first step .

Recently , stator current-based bearing failure detection has been shown to have relevant results with the advantage of being non-invasive and without the need for special sensors , significantly reducing maintenance costs .

So , periodic variations in the motor torque due to specific faults will cause periodic variations in RMS current and , consequently , amplitude modulation of the instantaneous current in specific frequencies .

Thus , still at an early stage , a maintenance action should be taken to avoid fault evolution and catastrophic failure , avoiding also unnecessary costs from unscheduled repairs and shutdowns .

Therefore , according to Salomon , the energy is even lower in the stator current , because the effects of this impact are obtained indirectly as a variation of torque .

When the localized fault is in the early stage , the energy associated to the generated impacts is not strong enough to be detected directly in the acquired vibration signal .
