I understand something like " Birth of a Nation " is still talked about because of its historical significance from a filmmaking perspective , but people still seem to regard Gone with the Wind as one of the all-time great stories/movies all together .

She looks like a hero : she 's beautiful , rich , part of this veneer of respectability and culture , but like everything else that the South was built on , it runs only skin deep .
