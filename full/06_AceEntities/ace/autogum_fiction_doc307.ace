On the brow of Dombey , Time and his brother Care had set some marks , as on a tree that was to come down in good time -- remorseless twins they are for striding through their human forests , notching as they go -- while the countenance of Son was crossed with a thousand little creases , which the same deceitful Time would take delight in smoothing out and wearing away with the flat part of his scythe , as a preparation of the surface for his deeper operations .

‘ The House will once again , Mrs Dombey , ’ said Mr Dombey , ‘ be not only in name but in fact Dombey and Son ; ’ and he added , in a tone of luxurious satisfaction , with his eyes half-closed as if he were reading the name in a device of flowers , and inhaling their fragrance at the same time ; ‘ Dom-bey and Son ! ’

Dombey sat in the corner of the darkened room in the great arm-chair by the bedside , and Son lay tucked up warm in a little basket bedstead , carefully disposed on a low settee immediately in front of the fire and close to it , as if his constitution were analogous to that of a muffin , and it was essential to toast him brown while he was very new .

The earth was made for Dombey and Son to trade in , and the sun and moon were made to give them light . Rivers and seas were formed to float their ships ; rainbows gave them promise of fair weather ; winds blew for or against their enterprises ; stars and planets circled in their orbits , to preserve inviolate a system of which they were the centre .

Such idle talk was little likely to reach the ears of Mr Dombey , whom it nearly concerned ; and probably no one in the world would have received it with such utter incredulity as he , if it had reached him . Dombey and Son had often dealt in hides , but never in hearts .
