No , I said you could argue that , but in this society it has been a function of the Judeo-Christian religion , although it is supported similarly by other religions , and by diverse numbers of ethnic groups .

I think that it devalues it by rendering it less than what it was , by making it something that is not a function of the Judeo-Christian tradition , which most of our laws are built on .

But my point is that when I said I 'm for states rights , I 'm also for recognizing the fact that there are some issues in which the nation has an interest .

That does n't mean it is restricted of one religious group , but that it has been a function of Judeo-Christian religion and has become thereby a part of our laws .

Since it exists in all societies , just because it is practiced by a Judeo-Christian society does that make it a Judeo-Christian institution or a human institution ?

I think central to the American family , which is the most central institution in the country , is the marriage between a man and a wife .

1,2 person|5,8 abstract|16,18 place|20,28 event|23,25 person|23,28 person|26,28 person

As you start to devalue the traditional marriage , people would ask why ca n't it simply be a contract between a number of people ?
1,2 person
2,3 person|6,9 abstract|10,11 person|22,26 person

On the other hand , that 's not a reason to not support it , to not elevate it , and not to honor it .
1,2 person
9,11 abstract|14,15 abstract|19,20 abstract|25,26 abstract

Well , I 'm saying that was the basis of the traditional marriage in our society that made it an important institution in this society .

I think there is something special about a man and a wife , and in a way the traditional marriage is different than many institutions .

1,2 person|8,13 person|11,13 person|18,21 abstract|24,26 abstract

I think that 's a center piece , the most important institution in our country , is the marriage .

The argument against that is should government be involved in it at all then .

Why do you think gay marriage is one of those issues ?

It is an institution that has a religious element to it .

Well , I think you can argue that , but --

Its most important role is as the protector of children .
1,2 person
1,5 abstract|10,11 person

But it is recognized , and protected , by government .

It 's a part of a our Judeo-Christian tradition .

How does gay marriage devalue marriage ?

Well , that 's your argument .

What 's special about two people ?
1,2 person

Because that 's not Judeo-Christian .
