Mandritto , Riverso , Fendente , Stoccata , et al. ) , curiously though , Ghisliero used a combination of guard names from various 16th-century Italian schools including some associated with Bolognese Swordsmanship and some of its close relatives ( e. g. Guardia di Testa , Guardia di Faccia , and Guardia di Falcone ) and the four rotational hand positions from Camillo Agrippa ' s manual .

The geometrical concepts in Ghisliero 's treatise are explained by the use of a series of concentric circles , with the center being the duelist 's back foot ( which was usually the foot on which the majority of one 's weight rested in most of the systems of the time ) .

Also , Jeronimo de Carranza , the father of the Spanish school , was heavily influenced by Camillo Agrippa ' s application of geometry to combat in his book , entitled Trattato di Scientia d'Arme , which also incorporated the idea of a circle that encircled both duelists .

He also wrote on the use of the dagger , and the cloak in combination with the sword , which were mainstays of civilian dress , and were often discussed in manuals of the time , especially those related to the Italian school .

However , this seemingly arbitrary selection of terminology is not particularly unusual for Italian systems of swordsmanship from the 16th century ( for an illustration of this , compare the terminology used by Achille Marozzo with that used by Francesco Altoni ) .

Like the other systems of swordsmanship prevalent in Europe at the time , Ghisliero 's system emphasized the use of the thrust over the cut .

However , though the use of geometry is common to both systems , The Spanish School conceived of a single circle between both fencers .

Some fencing historians have hypothesized that Ghisliero 's use of geometry evidences the influence of the Spanish school ( La Verdadera Destreza ) .

The terminology Ghisliero uses in his treatise is the fencing terminology used by his Italian contemporaries ( e. g.
