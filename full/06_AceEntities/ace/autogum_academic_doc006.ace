MicroRNAs ( miRNAs ) are an extensive class of small ( ~21 nt ) noncoding endogenous RNA molecules . miRNA-mediated gene silencing is a fundamental regulatory mechanism of gene expression . miRNAs inhibit gene expression by binding to specific sites located at the 3′ untranslated region ( UTR ) of the target mRNAs and degrade or inhibit its translation .

Thus , miRNAs play a significant role in the regulation of almost all critical biological processes in plant and animals ; they act as regulatory switches , controlling reproduction and developmental timing , signal transduction , cell fate , apoptosis , and response to environmental stressors .

The infective second-stage juvenile ( J2 ) enters plant roots and migrates to the vascular tissues , where it transforms certain vascular cells into multinucleate and hypertrophied so-termed “ giant cells ” , which become the nematodes ’ feeding and reproduction sites .
