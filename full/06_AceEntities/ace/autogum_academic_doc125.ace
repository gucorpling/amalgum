According to Sobral and Freitas ( 2010 ) , it is important to highlight that the DPSEEA model of indicators should be used as an auxiliary tool of the social determination model of health , because although it allows an integrated view of the indicators , by itself it cannot contemplate all the complexity of interrelations of the dimensions that determine the process of social production of health-disease and its inequalities between social groups .

This model allows the integrated analysis of environmental health within an economic and social context and can be applied to subsidize the monitoring of sustainability conditions at the regional and municipal levels . Stauber et al. 2018 points out that applying the DPSEEA matrix structure can allow to make more focused decisions around key socioenvironmental issues by identifying areas for intervention .

The framework for selection and arrangement of the indicators was based on the matrix of environmental health indicators developed in partnership with the United Nations Environment Program ( UNEP ) , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , and the USA Environment Program ( USEPA ) , known as the DPSEEA framework .

The DPSEEA approach , adopted by World Health Organization , has been applied in Brazil by the General Coordination of Environmental Health Surveillance of the Health Surveillance Secretariat of the Ministry of Health ( CGVAM / SVS / MS ) since the late 1990s .

Indicators were selected from governmental open-access databases such as the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics ( IBGE ) , the Department of the Brazilian Unified Health System ( DATASUS ) , and the SÃ£o Paulo State Foundation of Data Analysis ( SEADE ) .

The construction of indicators that point to the interrelationships of environmental changes and health situation are at the origin of the process of institutionalization of environmental health surveillance within the Health Sector , from the 20th to the 21st century , initially by Decree No.

According to the environmental indicators , the manual of the Brazilian Ministry of Health , the model proposed by the WHO , appeared to be suitable for the rational basis exhibited in an integrated matrix of indicators conjoining socioenvironmental and health issues (
