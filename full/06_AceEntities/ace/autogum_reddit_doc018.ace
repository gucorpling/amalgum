Any tips are appreciated and I thank you VERY much for reading all of that if you did . TL ; DR : I might be overdoing it with exercise after an unemployed and alcoholic sedentary lifestyle for 2 years , and I want to know if I am doing too much despite my body not feeling any true negative affects ( I do n't have any extreme pain , some soreness but nothing debilitating ) .

My plan once I start working is to still hopefully get in 10k steps a day by going to the gym , but I 've never had a FT job that involved sitting most of the time and I 've also never had any job during a time that I had a daily work out goal .

Just something to note really quick is that I have led a completely sedentary lifestyle for over a year now , and even before that , any exercise was really just an incidental result of me doing things that I enjoyed ( fishing and hiking ) .
