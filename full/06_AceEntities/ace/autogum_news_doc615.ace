Sheppard said , " Jupiter just happened to be in the sky near the search fields where we were looking for extremely distant Solar System objects , so we were serendipitously able to look for new moons around Jupiter while at the same time looking for planets at the fringes of our Solar System " .

The team led by Scott Sheppard had discovered twelve of the 79 Jovian satellites , including Tuesday 's ten , mostly using a Blanco 4-meter telescope of Chile ' s Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory .

One of the prograde satellites , newly announced on Tuesday , took about one-and-half years to complete one revolution around Jupiter , and its orbit intersected with the outer retrograde satellites .
