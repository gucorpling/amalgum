From this , the following two sub-questions emerge : ( 1 ) What is the extent of the relationship and interplay between the identified factors ? ( 2 ) Is there an agreement between affordable housing applicants ’ opinion and the overall opinion of all the groups , affordable housing estate residents ’ opinion , and overall opinion of all the groups and residents of shanty towns ’ opinion and the overall opinion of all the groups ?
