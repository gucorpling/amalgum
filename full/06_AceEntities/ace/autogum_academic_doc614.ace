In accordance with this hypothesis , we identified the following three major types of EBU motifs : ( 1 ) motifs common for all tissues ; ( 2 ) motifs specific for organs with functionally related tissues and similar correlated patterns of co-expressed genes ; and ( 3 ) motifs unique to single tissues with unique functions , which may be related to tissue-specific gene expression profiles within the tissues or to specific physical features of the local microenvironment .

In this study , we considered the following two major factors that could influence the evolution of the f8/9 landscape phage library in mice : ( 1 ) its multidisperse characteristics as revealed in soft agar electrophoresis and ( 2 ) organ- and tumor-specific targets for phage binding interactions that can arise from organ- or tissue-specific gene expression .

As reflected in our in vitro migration study , the presence of random fusion peptides with charged amino acids in landscape phages results in significant changes in the ionization state of the phage particle leading to differences in surface charge and their subsequent ability to migrate through an agarose gel , demonstrated previously with isolated clones .

Given that landscape phage libraries display peptide fusions that can dramatically alter the surface profile of the phage , we hypothesized that libraries of phage particles represent ideal nanoparticle systems to test the effects of a displayed peptide on tissue-selective accumulation within the local microenvironment while maintaining other critical parameters like particle size and shape .

It can be envisioned that local changes in pH within a tissue microenvironment may modify the surface charge of landscape phage particles , exposing a previously hidden binding epitope or also hiding a previously accessible binding epitope allowing enhanced penetration or retention within a particular microenvironment .

Following an extensive meta-analysis study of nanoparticle biocompatibility in vivo , it was concluded that functional nanocarriers had a slightly negative surface charge , moderate to high solubility , and particle sizes in the range of ~100 – 200 nm in diameter .

This unique , emergent feature of landscape phages cannot be translated to p3-type libraries as the occurrence of p3 in only five copies limits the ability of a displayed fusion peptide to significantly change the physicochemical properties of the entire particle .

It was suggested that components of these protein-domain networks could be identified through in vitro or in vivo targeted evolution of EBU/SLiM-harboring phage displayed peptide libraries such as the multivalent landscape phage library used in this project .

We showed that modified p8 proteins displaying a fusion peptide along the length of the filamentous phage particle would create vastly different particles , each containing unique physicochemical features and supporting complex interactions within a defined microenvironment .

Finally , we demonstrated motif enrichment within single tissues , including the tumor xenograft , which suggests there are tissue-specific genes that are overexpressed or structures in the microenvironment that allow for tissue-selective accumulation of phages .

Analysis of 3-mer frequency in each tissue revealed that a significant portion of motifs were shared across all tissues , leading to nonspecific uptake and clearance or had very low occurrences .
