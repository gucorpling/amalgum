While polytechnic institutions tend to provide a more practical and professionally oriented training — hence , theoretically , more prone to the establishment of internships , the university system tends to be associated with a stronger theoretical basis and tends to be more research oriented .

The first stage ( quantitative approach ) included the inventory of nearly 200 FCD and sought to understand the impact of internships on graduates′ employment ( access to work ) while controlling for other institutional and contextual variables .
