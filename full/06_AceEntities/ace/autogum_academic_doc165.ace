However , they could be strongly dependent on soil chemistry Exploitation of legumes is an essential approach for sustainable agriculture as it can increase nutrient cycling and promote soil fertility This approach can also potentially improve P and K availability in the soil , which is beneficial for plant uptake and soil microorganisms .

Phosphorus ( P ) and potassium ( K ) are the most significant macronutrients in the soil ecosystem after nitrogen ( N ) , which involves various processes , i. e. , energy formation , nucleic acid synthesis , photosynthesis , glycolysis , respiration , enzymes activation and redox reactions .

Several green manure crops such as white lupin ( Lupines albas L. ) , chickpea ( Cicer arietinum L. ) , field pea ( Pisum sativum L ) , and faba bean ( Vicia faba ) , are able to mobilize soil P through a variety of root mechanisms .

Some hydrolytic enzymes ( e. g. , Î²-glucosidase , N-acetyl-glucosaminidase , Leucine-aminopeptidase , and phosphatase ) , which are related to C , N , and P cycles , are more responsible for the soil properties ( pH and soil organic matter ) than other variables .
