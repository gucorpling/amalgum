The difficulty was in the Giant Slalom , it was raining , and being used to ski racing , I had never experienced skiing in the rain , and as soon as I came out of the start hut I lost all my sight , which is something that I had never experienced before .

I asked the standing guys upstairs : who is the craziest amongst all you skiers : the ones who ca n't see , the ones on the mono skis , or the one-legged or no-armed guys .

Going down it was about getting to the bottom in one piece , not racing to win a medal , which was pretty difficult I guess or frustrating , given that it was the Paralympics .

One of the things that was mentioned earlier , most delightful about you guys is you were racing and " we were halfway down the course and we lost communication !

And then when I could n't hear Eric talking I realised that our headsets had malfunctioned because they 'd actually got rain into them .
