Three days after the Internet release of the free content 3D short Elephants Dream ( see Wikinews coverage ) , we exchanged e-mails with Ton Roosendaal about the reaction to the film , open source filmmaking , and the changes to Blender that resulted from the production .

We get a lot of complaints by non-artists that they ca n't get into the software easily , whilst the complexity of commercial products like Maya or Houdini is perceived as a confirmation of its " quality " .

I really cherish such an approach , it has resulted in a very motivated team working crazy hours the last months to get it all realized .

It is quite abstract , but definitely has many layers of information , inspiring many of the viewers to see relevant real life messages hidden here .

The artists had a lot of freedom from the start ; they were responsible for the concept , story and creative development of the entire movie .

It has been executed in co-production with the Netherlands Media Art Institute , and we each had our own internal budgeting for the project .

When you exclude expenses of pre-production and producer personnel , the total budget was about 120,000 â‚¬ , of which we covered half .

Our contribution was roughly covered half by the DVD sales , and half by European Union support ( http://www.uni-verse.org consortium ) .

For instance , Final Fantasy : The Spirits Within flopped with audiences , in spite of being an undisputed technical milestone .

So for Elephants Dream , we 've had the luxury to challenge ourselves to create real independent artistic content as well .

Ton Roosendaal is the lead developer of the Blender 3D rendering and modelling software that was used for the movie .

This has resulted in a lot of quite personal choices , based on what the artists liked to do themselves .

I 've seen many reviews that criticized the plot of " Elephants Dream " as too bizarre or confusing .

One of the most common criticisms of CGI films is focus on technology over content .

First of all ; the criticism resembles how people witness Blender itself , too .
