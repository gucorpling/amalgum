As can be seen from this review , over the last 20 years , considerable progress has been made in the research on the applicability and improvement of SIT/IS for the control of lepidopteran pests , including the successful implementation of SIT programs against several major agricultural pests .

On the contrary , the results of field-cage experiments with several lepidopteran pests , such as the cactus moth , suggest that sterile females might have a positive impact on population suppression , thus casting doubts on the need for genetic sexing strains .

Although these methods have not yet been used for genetic sexing in Lepidoptera , particularly the CRISPR/Cas9 ( clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 ) technique has already been successfully established in several species and used to study gene functions .

In the silkworm , sex determination depends on the presence or absence of the W chromosome , which carries a dominant female-determining factor ( Fem ) that promotes femaleness , irrespective of the number of Z chromosomes present in the genome .

Based on this success , it has been proposed to construct genetic sexing strains using a transgenic approach so that the females carry a transgene with a dominant conditional lethal mutation in their W chromosome that would be expressed in embryogenesis .

This has been well demonstrated in the SIT programs against the Mediterranean fruit fly ( medfly ) , Ceratitis capitata ( Wiedemann ) , using a genetic sexing strain that allowed the mass production and release of males only .

In these strains , conditional female lethality is controlled by the tetracycline-repressible transactivator ( tTAV ) protein , which is expressed only in females due to the female-specific spliced region of the pink bollworm doublesex gene , Pgdsx .

Current programs using SIT/IS against lepidopteran pests rely on bisexual releases , but there are reasons to believe that male-only releases would bring significant economic benefits by decreasing operational costs and increasing the efficiency of the sterile males .

The Fem piRNA downregulates the expression of a Z-linked gene , Masculinizer ( Masc ) , which promotes male development through male-specific splicing of the Bmdsx gene in the absence of the W chromosome .
