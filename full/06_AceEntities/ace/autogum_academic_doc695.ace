In this way , the European Union ( EU ) Framework supplies useful information on air quality assessment techniques , establishes limit values of the pollutants , and urges to develop Air Quality Plans , in particular through Directive 2008/50/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe ( amended by 2015/1480/EC ) .

In this context , a spatio-temporal modelling of PM10 ( particles < 10 m ) concentration is applied to understand the trend , to know the influence of the variables to exposure risk , to find the missing data to evaluate air quality , and to estimate data for those sites where they are not available .

The EU normative ( Directive 2008/50/EC , amended by 2015/1480/EC ) suggests that 90 % of the data per year are necessary , and where possible , modelling techniques should be applied to enable point data to be interpreted in terms of geographical distribution of concentration .
