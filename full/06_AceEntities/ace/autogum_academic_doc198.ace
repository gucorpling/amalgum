Neurotropic flaviviruses , such as West Nile virus ( WNV ) , Japanese encephalitis virus ( JEV ) , and tick-borne encephalitis virus ( TBEV ) , are maintained in nature in transmission cycles involving mosquito ( mainly Culex spp. ) or tick ( mainly Ixodes spp. ) vectors and mammalian or bird amplification hosts , with humans serving as dead-end incidental hosts .

Breakthroughs on cell reprogramming and generation of human induced pluripotent stem cells ( hiPSCs ) have revolutionized approaches to the study of human diseases . iPSCs are generated directly from adult differentiated cells that are reprogrammed back into an embryonic-like pluripotent state by introducing genes important for maintaining the essential properties of embryonic stem cells .

In addition , the ability of viruses to infect and replicate was found to be dependent on cell differentiation status , since stem cells appear to be refractory to viral infection probably due to constitutive high-level expression of interferon-stimulated genes ( ISGs ) , while cell susceptibility to viral infection increases in differentiated cells .

Initial studies with hiPSCs studies were crucial to provide evidence of the tropism of ZIKV for human cortical neural progenitor cells and to demonstrate that ZIKV infection impairs cell differentiation and induces apoptosis , supporting the causative role of ZIKV in fetal microcephaly .

One of the central questions in the search for therapeutic targets for the treatment of flaviviral neurological syndromes is whether these diseases are induced by virus-mediated cytolysis , immune-pathological responses to infection , or a combination of both .
