With the intention of bringing the ideas of these authors into the contemporary context , we also draw on short essays like La ciudad en Movimiento and Metrópolis Visionarias , which help us to understand the current reality of urban planning and sociology , as well as publications in scientific journals and doctoral theses , of which Pinchart-Saavedra ’s study titled Rascacielos de Tokio a Babilonia la arquitectura como propaganda stands out for its role as an anchor for our analysis .
