The issues that create challenges and limitations to these assessments can be categorized into : ( a ) LULC data sets characteristics and temporal availability ; ( b ) availability of ancillary land management information ; ( c ) ability to construct accurate forage suitability indices based on knowledge of the phenology and abundance of plant species used by monarchs during their migration ( e. g. , https://www.usanpn.org/news/spring ) ; and ( d ) level of knowledge of the ecological and behavioral patterns of the monarch during their journey .

Due to the characteristics of the currently available and emerging LULC data sets as well as the state of the knowledge of the monarchs ’ migratory habitat , the geographic extent of this habitat and the LULC changes within it that might be affecting the monarchs ’ population can only be measured and modeled at a coarse resolution and more appropriately at a regional level .

Efforts to create supplemented foraging , such as the Interstate-35 milkweed corridor and the US National Park Service efforts to improve migratory pollinator corridors , need to be easily accessible in formats that can be input into geographic information systems ( GIS ) to better support the study and modeling of migratory habitat .
