So emailed the Dr with what happened and she emailed me back in like 10 min with an acknowledgement that the follicle we saw could have been a cyst and an offer to come in tomorrow to get an ultrasound and come up with a plan for no charge ( I 'll believe that when I see it , hah ) .

Woo for no provera ! ( I asked if my lining would be all old and crusty , and she said no and that there 's some evidence that this way has higher success than doing a provera withdrawal bleed - yay for learning something new ! )

New cd 9 I started bleeding bright red ( more than spotting ) , which lasted til cd12 , but cd11 scan showed a big follicle and I was having a ton of eggwhite , so I thought we were set .
