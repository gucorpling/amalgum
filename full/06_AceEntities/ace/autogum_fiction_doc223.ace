Upon this I lowered the top of my sail and lay by , and two of them ran up into the country , and in less than half-an-hour came back , and brought with them two pieces of dried flesh and some corn , such as is the produce of their country ; but we neither knew what the one or the other was ; however , we were willing to accept it , but how to come at it was our next dispute , for I would not venture on shore to them , and they were as much afraid of us ; but they took a safe way for us all , for they brought it to the shore and laid it down , and went and stood a great way off till we fetched it on board , and then came close to us again .

We made signs of thanks to them , for we had nothing to make them amends ; but an opportunity offered that very instant to oblige them wonderfully ; for while we were lying by the shore came two mighty creatures , one pursuing the other ( as we took it ) with great fury from the mountains towards the sea ; whether it was the male pursuing the female , or whether they were in sport or in rage , we could not tell , any more than we could tell whether it was usual or strange , but I believe it was the latter ; because , in the first place , those ravenous creatures seldom appear but in the night ; and , in the second place , we found the people terribly frighted , especially the women .

The man that had the lance or dart did not fly from them , but the rest did ; however , as the two creatures ran directly into the water , they did not offer to fall upon any of the negroes , but plunged themselves into the sea , and swam about , as if they had come for their diversion ; at last one of them began to come nearer our boat than at first I expected ; but I lay ready for him , for I had loaded my gun with all possible expedition , and bade Xury load both the others .

As soon as he came fairly within my reach , I fired , and shot him directly in the head ; immediately he sank down into the water , but rose instantly , and plunged up and down , as if he were struggling for life , and so indeed he was ; he immediately made to the shore ; but between the wound , which was his mortal hurt , and the strangling of the water , he died just before he reached the shore .

I observed they had no weapons in their hand , except one , who had a long slender stick , which Xury said was a lance , and that they could throw them a great way with good aim ; so I kept at a distance , but talked with them by signs as well as I could ; and particularly made signs for something to eat : they beckoned to me to stop my boat , and they would fetch me some meat .

It is impossible to express the astonishment of these poor creatures at the noise and fire of my gun : some of them were even ready to die for fear , and fell down as dead with the very terror ; but when they saw the creature dead , and sunk in the water , and that I made signs to them to come to the shore , they took heart and came , and began to search for the creature .

I found him by his blood staining the water ; and by the help of a rope , which I slung round him , and gave the negroes to haul , they dragged him on shore , and found that it was a most curious leopard , spotted , and fine to an admirable degree ; and the negroes held up their hands with admiration , to think what it was I had killed him with .

My design in this was to make the river Gambia or Senegal , that is to say anywhere about the Cape de Verde , where I was in hopes to meet with some European ship ; and if I did not , I knew not what course I had to take , but to seek for the islands , or perish there among the negroes .

I knew that all the ships from Europe , which sailed either to the coast of Guinea or to Brazil , or to the East Indies , made this cape , or those islands ; and , in a word , I put the whole of my fortune upon this single point , either that I must meet with some ship or must perish .

When I had pursued this resolution about ten days longer , as I have said , I began to see that the land was inhabited ; and in two or three places , as we sailed by , we saw people stand upon the shore to look at us ; we could also perceive they were quite black and naked .

After this stop , we made on to the southward continually for ten or twelve days , living very sparingly on our provisions , which began to abate very much , and going no oftener to the shore than we were obliged to for fresh water .
