Researchers have analyzed the workability , mechanical , fatigue , and rheological property characterization of bitumen mixtures modified with various WMAs , and found that the viscosity of rubberized bitumen reduced significantly , however , WMAs had adverse effects on the fatigue property and rutting resistance , with the exception of Sasobit additive . Xiao et al. indicated that the binder type played a key role in determining the rheological properties of WMA binders by using Fourier transform infrared ( FTIR ) analysis .
