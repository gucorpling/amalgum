After another ceremonial pause , broken by polite enquiries and shy ejaculations , they were shown into the kitchen , where the table was already spread with strange-looking spice-cakes and stewed fruits , and where they presently found themselves seated between Mrs. Hochmuller and Mr. Ramy , while the staring Linda bumped back and forth from the stove with steaming dishes .
