The inspiration comes from the biological theory foundation , where the number of offsprings needs to be larger than the number of parents so as to prevent species extinction and maintain species diversity in the process of biological evolution .

However , when a USV performs multi-objective tasks in a complex marine environment , the number of possible paths increases exponentially with the increase of target points ’ number , resulting in the so-called “ exponential explosion ” .
