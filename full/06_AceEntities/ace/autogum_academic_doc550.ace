Table 3 shows a t-student analysis ( paired series ) of the variable “ time ” for each task , in order to identify whether there was a significant difference in the execution time of each chord by learning method .

It should be remembered that participants were complete beginners and this was their first contact with the instrument ; as such , a chord was recorded as successful if it was performed correctly in under two minutes .

In this case , we can see that all tasks ( except Task 7 “ Play B major chord ” ) showed no difference in the time of execution ( one method or another of learning ) .

Once the experimental study was completed , participants filled out the usability scale ( SUS ) questionnaire to establish the usability of the ad-hoc app that had been developed to teach guitar chords using AR technology .

In-app feedback messages ( red cross — “ try again ” , green tick — “ well done ! ” ) proved motivation and encouraged participants to follow the instructions explaining how to play chords .

Upon completing a task they were often heard to exclaim , “ How easy ” , “ Excellent ” , “ Awesome ” , or “ Bring it on ! ” ( next task ) .

As seen in Table 2 , the p -values obtained for each factor were >0.05 ; thus , the two null hypotheses proposed in Section 3 could not be rejected :

Although the number of successful tasks was not an explicit variable in this study , it has been included to support the acceptance or rejection of the null hypotheses .

However , some did state they would have preferred to receive feedback and reassurances from a human instructor to confirm whether they had played a chord correctly or not .

However , participants in both groups encountered greater difficulty performing the tasks G major , A major , and B major , as finger placement was more complex .

Users did not understand that the same color superimposed across multiple strings on the same fret was an instruction to bar the fret with a single finger .

Having completed all tasks , the participants declared their interest in learning to play guitar using AR assistance and that they wished to continue using this methodology .

Based on these findings , it is possible to state that there was no significant difference between the two methodologies with regard to learning times .

The majority of participants took a while to understand that they needed to use the entire length of the index finger to bar the fret .

The combination of both factors was also analyzed to observe whether interference between them produced any effects on the time taken to perform tasks .

As this was greater than 0.05 , it indicated that there was no significant difference in the success rates for either methodology .

It can also be stated that there were no differences in learning by gender within the group itself or between different methodologies .
