Detection of hypoxic areas is a common trait at any stage of chronic liver disease , expanding progressively from early injury to the development of cirrhosis . , Through the action of hypoxia-inducible factors ( HIF ) , hepatic hypoxia up-regulates the expression of a wide array of growth factors and mediators of liver repair and angiogenesis .

Although a direct relationship was not established between the two phenomena , there are evidence pointing out that APJ activation by apelin stimulates the expression of a well-known pro-angiogenic factor , angiopoietin-1 ( from the angiopoietin family involved in pathological angiogenesis in chronic liver disease ) in LX-2 cells .

According to these data , hypoxia , inflammation and pro-fibrogenic factors up-regulate APJ in HSC and hepatocytes , which can release different pro-angiogenic and pro-fibrogenic factors such as apelin ( from activated HSC ) together to perpetuate fibrosis while injury and these stimuli remain .

A contemporary clinical investigation revealed that circulating apelin levels are associated with histological and hemodynamic features of chronic liver disease , but more clinical studies are needed to confirm the major relevance of apelin system in human liver fibrosis .

However , pathological angiogenesis can be inefficient due to the immaturity and permeability of vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF)-induced new vessels and , consequently , the liver may be unable to reduce hypoxia .

There is a growing belief that local hypoxia is the link interconnecting both pathological angiogenesis and liver fibrogenesis , orchestrating the harmonic and coordinated activation of HSC , hepatocytes and other hepatic cells .
