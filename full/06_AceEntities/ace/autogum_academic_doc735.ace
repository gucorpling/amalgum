One of the most problematic issues with dual-duct systems is that a volume of air much larger than that required by the building , must be cooled , heated , and circulated .

DFDD systems tend to be noisier since the noise and vibration associated with the air passing over the mixing dampers are directly above the conditioned space .

The site electric EUI was found to be 133.4 kBtu/ft2 , while the US average with similar office occupancy and conditions is 44.4 kBtu/ft2 .

In addition , the dampers in dual-duct mixing boxes frequently leak , even when they are supposed to be fully closed .

Because health professionals are present around the clock , the building is set to be always occupied in all design considerations .

Thus , the energy consumption of the building was very high , indicating a need to lower the energy consumption .

During cooling operation , the leakage of the warm duct increases the required energy for conditioning the space .

Dual-duct systems , in general , require more ductwork and dampers , and therefore occupy more space .

Leakage ratios vary between roughly 3 percent and 20 percent , which is higher than single-duct systems .
