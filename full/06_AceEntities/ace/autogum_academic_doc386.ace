These findings are in line with Billger , Thuvander , and Wästberg who argue that visualization is an effective tool for communication among stakeholders in planning processes , but also involves a risk of “ potential misuse , misinterpretation and misempowerment ” ( p. 12 ) .

The result of the collective actions of the actor-network of transition was the identification of plant factories as immutable mobiles ; in other words , they were introduced as the promising solution for the challenges of the agricultural sector in China .

These findings are in line with Miller , who concluded that the rise of HTUA practices is a result of the adaptation of technologies by “ dominant political and economic interests ” for providing food security ( p. 11 ) .

The development of agricultural technology and the application in urban food production practices in Shanghai were led by the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Science ( CAAS ) and the Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Program ( ASTIP ) .

Large-scale plant factories with a focus on high yields were supported and subsidized , driven by the central government ’s aims of increasing the local production capacity and becoming less dependent on the import of agricultural products .

The niche developers in this transition pathway ( i. e. , SOCs ) collaborated with agricultural technology firms to adopt agricultural technologies in new urban food production practices , such as the Sunqiao modern agriculture zone .

Hallock describes HTUA as a capitalist form of urban agriculture with the “ ability to standardize the food cultivation process , and to incorporate it into factory like production systems ” ( p. 7 ) .

However , this dominant role also made it such that private enterprises involved in niche developments could not compete with the SOCs , and therefore , many of these private companies went bankrupt .

To ensure that the interested actors became involved in the transition process and part of the actor network of transition , CAAS developed the key laboratories and demonstration zone for urban agriculture .

Although the visualizations were highly effective in attracting investors and public attention , they also raised concerns about the feasibility of HTUA practices among agricultural experts and decision-makers .
