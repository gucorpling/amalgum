The launch of the Landsat series , despite its low spatial resolution , opened new horizons for coastal area mapping due to the existence of multispectral bands , the repeatability of the scenes captured , and the large area coverage . Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper images from different years , covering a period of 25 years , were processed in order to map the shoreline changes in Egypt .

These advantages include the best spatial resolution among all the other remote sensing surveys , a lower cost compared to all other ground or remote sensing surveys , potential to transmit the acquired photos to the remote controller , the ability to repeat acquisition in case something goes wrong , and very low security risks as the drones are unmanned .
