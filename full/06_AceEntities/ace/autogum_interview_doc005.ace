Having a high level of access to firearms , which is the most lethal means for suicide , apparently has a far greater impact on suicide rates and can negate the fact that a state has a low rate of youth suicide attempts ( and vice versa ) .

Our hypothesis is that the most important predictor of the youth suicide rate in a state is the extent to which youth in that state have access to the most lethal means ( i. e. , firearms ) .

We did not actually have a pre-conceived idea of whether or not we would find an association after controlling for the proportion of youth who were depressed , had made a suicide plan , or had attempted suicide .

We do n't hypothesize that there would be any substantial difference because when we used the proxy data on gun ownership from 2005 – 2015 , we did not find any major difference in the results .

Although we used gun ownership data from 2004 for the primary analysis , we repeated the analysis using a household gun ownership proxy averaged over the years 2005 – 2015 , and the results were similar .

We were surprised , however , to find that the percentage of households with a gun was a stronger predictor of the youth suicide rate than the percentage of youth who made a suicide attempt .

Did you notice any significant trends in the data year-by-year , and , if so , what were they and what do you think might account for them ?

If you had access to more recent data than that from 2004 , what would you hypothesize the difference might be , if any ?

You noted suicide attempts by youth were not as accurate a prediction method for youth suicide rates as the household gun ownership rates were .

Thus , our findings support efforts to encourage gun owners to store their guns in a manner that prevents youth from accessing them .

Given that some key data is from 2004 , how well do you think your results can be applied to the situation today ?

Thus , we are not able in this study to examine trends in suicide rates over time .

The results suggest that decreasing the access of youth to firearms may lower youth suicide rates .
