Now , I 'm not saying that Erina was surely not as skilled as the lower half of the E10 , just that she probably was n't good enough to be in the upper half of the E10 at the very least .

A lot of the characters in Food Wars are giving hype by defeating fodder or built up by the author through reputation rather than direct explicit rankings in case the series wants to be flexible over who 's stronger than who .

From the very beginning of the manga and the anime they establish that food is so good it has people explode out of their clothes and the blessing is really just an exaggeration of an exaggeration .

It 's ridiculous for Azami to have others explode out of their clothes and it 's cheap fan -service but it 's a defining aspect of the series ( for better or worse ) .

So I had taken a break from SnS about a year back , and I was excited to read all the new chapters(I got spoiled about Souma becoming First seat !

She 's basically gonna be busy with administration work and wo n't be able to focus much on cooking if she 's to do her job as the headmaster right .

Another thing I feel is that Erina could 've been a lot more dynamic in the future chapters as part of the student body rather than being in the administration .

While it 's established that Rindou and Tsukasa are both stronger than Soma and Erina in general the ranking of the other Elite 10 is a lot more inconsistent .

" Okay , delicious food making people have internal orgasms was fine , but physical clothes being torn just because some guy found it to be delicious ?

Souma 's mild arrogance and confidence that he can beat anyone are a massive part of his character , imo and I loved that about him .

Him accepting that he ca n't beat someone for the first time took a lot of the feels of the victory away for me .

So by that rate , he almost surely had to be above her if he was beating a fourth seat in the Elite 10 .

Another thing was that Souma saying " I ca n't beat Erina yet and I have n't beaten Rindou , Tsukasa " .
