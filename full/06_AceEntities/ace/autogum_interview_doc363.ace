Whilst DS4SEQ is aiming to win seats in the Queensland Parliament , we believe that gaining a sizeable percentage of the primary vote will send the key message to the major parties that they can no longer ignore : When it comes to the issue of Daylight Saving , the people of South East Queensland have been ignored for too long , and a dual time zone arrangement must be implemented .

By moving the time of the clock against the natural occurring solar movement , Daylight Saving provides allowance for an hour less sunlight in the very early morning , when about 80 % of people are sleeping , and provide an hour more sunlight in the evening , which can the be utilised .

As Daylight Saving is not favoured outside of the South East Queensland region , DS4SEQ believe that a dual time zone is a compromise that respects the needs of regional and rural Queenslanders , while also giving fair consideration to the view of the majority of residents in South East Queensland .
