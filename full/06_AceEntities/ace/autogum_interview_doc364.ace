As we are a single issue party , voting for us will send a clear message to the major parties and that is : when it comes to the issue of daylight saving , the people of South East Queensland have ben [ sic ] ignored for too long , and a dual time zone arrangement must be implemented .

Voting DS4SEQ number 1 , will not be a wasted vote , because if the Party gains a sizeable percentage of the primary vote , winning a few seats along the way , this will allow us to convince the major parties to change their thinking on the issue of daylight saving .

The dual time zone boundary is formed by the inclusion of 15 local council areas and provides a respectful view towards regional and rural Queenslanders , whilst also giving consideration to the view of the majority of residents in South East Queensland .

However , what we would like to see , is for both major parties to change their thinking about Daylight Saving in Queensland , and seriously consider a dual time zone arrangement for 6 months of the year .
