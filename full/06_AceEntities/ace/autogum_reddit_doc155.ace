Most importantly black Lightning is a liberal social justice worrier which is what Green Arrow supposed be on arrow but instead the showrunners would rather have him be a discount Batman because they do n’t know how to write anything political even if their life depended on it .

Uncle guggie and co completely destroyed this show beyond repair , and it really breaks my heart that arrow out of all the shows has dropped this low in quality when it was the one that gave us the rest of these CW shows .

I remember during the early days of arrow back in 2012 when I was still in high school , and used to get home and be so hyped for arrow to come on .

Meanwhile literally in a different department , Legends is killing it every week while Arrow is still stuck with a slow moving plot and conflicts that killed the side characters I actually liked .

I feel like the writers are aimless on what they want to do with Season 6 , and it 's gonna take a huge turnaround with Richard Dragon to redeem this season .

I used to be the same way about Arrow when it had its resurgence season last year , but this year it has just regressed to the max .

Hell , the characters on riverdale act more mature than the arrow characters , and the show itself is better which is sad .
