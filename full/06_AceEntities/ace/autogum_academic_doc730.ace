The results of the empirical analysis show that the quality of a logistics service has a statistically significant impact on customer satisfaction and that quality of delivery is the main factor of influence .

These determinants of logistics service quality were found to yield similar results to the factors related to online shopping mall success as well as the factors previously related to service quality .
