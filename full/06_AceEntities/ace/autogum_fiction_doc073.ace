That Mr. and Mrs. Weston did think of it , she was very strongly persuaded ; and though not meaning to be induced by him , or by any body else , to give up a situation which she believed more replete with good than any she could change it for , she had a great curiosity to see him , a decided intention of finding him pleasant , of being liked by him to a certain degree , and a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in their friends ' imaginations .

Mr. Woodhouse had been safely seated long enough to give the history of it , besides all the history of his own and Isabella 's coming , and of Emma 's being to follow , and had indeed just got to the end of his satisfaction that James should come and see his daughter , when the others appeared , and Mrs. Weston , who had been almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him , was able to turn away and welcome her dear Emma .

She heard enough to know that Mr. Weston was giving some information about his son ; she heard the words “ my son , ” and “ Frank , ” and “ my son , ” repeated several times over ; and , from a few other half-syllables very much suspected that he was announcing an early visit from his son ; but before she could quiet Mr. Elton , the subject was so completely past that any reviving question from her would have been awkward .

This was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day 's visit might not afford , which certainly did not belong to the present half-hour ; but the very sight of Mrs. Weston , her smile , her touch , her voice was grateful to Emma , and she determined to think as little as possible of Mr. Elton 's oddities , or of any thing else unpleasant , and enjoy all that was enjoyable to the utmost .

-- Absurd and insufferable ! ” -- Yet he would be so anxious for her being perfectly warm , would be so interested about her father , and so delighted with Mrs. Weston ; and at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a would-be lover , and made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners .

Mr. Weston was a great favourite , and there was not a creature in the world to whom she spoke with such unreserve , as to his wife ; not any one , to whom she related with such conviction of being listened to and understood , of being always interesting and always intelligible , the little affairs , arrangements , perplexities , and pleasures of her father and herself .

For her own sake she could not be rude ; and for Harriet 's , in the hope that all would yet turn out right , she was even positively civil ; but it was an effort ; especially as something was going on amongst the others , in the most overpowering period of Mr. Elton 's nonsense , which she particularly wished to listen to .

With such sensations , Mr. Elton 's civilities were dreadfully ill-timed ; but she had the comfort of appearing very polite , while feeling very cross -- and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly pass without bringing forward the same information again , or the substance of it , from the open-hearted Mr. Weston .

She could tell nothing of Hartfield , in which Mrs. Weston had not a lively concern ; and half an hour 's uninterrupted communication of all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private life depends , was one of the first gratifications of each .

Instead of forgetting him , his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal suggestion of “ Can it really be as my brother imagined ? can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from Harriet to me ?
