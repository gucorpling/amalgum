Natural History Museum Curator and study co-author Mark Norell cites advances in imaging technology as the reason why this study is being published today : " We know very little about dinosaur embryology , yet it relates to so many aspects of development , life history , and evolution , [ b]ut with the help of advanced tools like CT scanners and high-resolution microscopy , we 're making discoveries that we could n't have imagined 20 years ago .

A joint research team from the University of Calgary , American Museum of Natural History , and Florida State University announced on Monday that the eggs of non- avian dinosaurs such as the duck-billed dinosaur took as long as six months to hatch , far longer than had previously been believed .

The scientists reached this conclusion by comparing CT scans of the teeth of dinosaur embryos of two different species , the Protoceratops andrewsi , which had eggs weighing under 200 gram s , and Hypacrosaurus stebingeri , a type of duck-billed dinosaur that had eggs twenty times that size .

Scientists had thought dinosaur eggs were more like those of modern birds than modern reptiles , but this long hatch time is far more reminiscent of monitor lizard than magpie .

They observed the von Ebner lines , patterns that form in vertebrate teeth as they grow , to determine how long the overall developmental process was taking .

According to the research team , this may be one reason why dinosaurs did not recover after the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event 65 million years ago .

Both the eggs and any parents guarding them would have drawn the attention of predators and been unable to flee floods or other problems .

This , researchers say , would have put dinosaurs at a disadvantage over animals with quicker-hatching eggs and their mammalian competitors .

Bird eggs incubate for 11 to 85 days , about half the time of most other egg-laying vertebrates .
