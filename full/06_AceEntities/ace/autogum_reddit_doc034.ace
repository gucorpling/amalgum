So no , I would not protest if boomkins , enh shamans , ret paladins became adequate enough that you would bring 1 to your raid not to provide their own crazy dps , but to provide support to the caster group , melee group , or what have you as was their intended role .

I 'm not advocating " bring the player , not the class " levels of change but it 's also well known that there were many talents that flat out did n't work or gave too little of a bonus to be remotely useful .

They obviously should not come close to a pure dps class , but you can tell by their specs ( moonkin aura , etc. . ) that they were intended to fill a niche role in end game content .

Granted , some specs would benefit more from staying a support one that you only dip in to improve your main spec ( Demo/Arcane/Disc ) instead of being buffed to the point of insanity .

I would not protest if boomkins , enhancement and elemental shamans , and ret paladins filled their intended role of being a dps support spec that you bring one of in your raid .

So would you be opposed to Blizzard looking at the talent trees only and within the confines of Classic deciding to readjust the numbers when it comes to the less desirable specs/talents ?

Or perhaps consider what the Vanilla 2.4.3 PS did and give a TBC-like talent tree ( Maybe even the same one released with the TBC pre-patch before the portal opened ) ?

Maybe not immediately , but perhaps during a beta test or putting it on the PTR for a month or so to see how it affects the actual game .

If you told blizzard circa 2004 that the ideal 40 man raid comp would contain 12-14 warriors they would probably see that as a failure on their part .

Prot Warriors are a joke , Ele shaman are great for a whole 30 seconds before they go oom , and Prot Pallies are ... yeah. .

It 's common knowledge that for most classes there is 1 viable spec with others having either 2 or benefiting more from hybridizing between 2 .

While I do n't agree with some of the stances here , it is nice that there is n't a hivemind on either side .

The spirit of WoW until Cata was choice and bringing up these would , theoretically , provide a multitude of more options than before .

5 of each class , give or take , would probably be the answer that they would give you .
