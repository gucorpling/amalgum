For my part , I know not to this hour whether there are any such things as real apparitions , spectres , or walking of people after they are dead ; or whether there is anything in the stories they tell us of that kind more than the product of vapours , sick minds , and wandering fancies : but this I know , that my imagination worked up to such a height , and brought me into such excess of vapours , or what else I may call it , that I actually supposed myself often upon the spot , at my old castle , behind the trees ; saw my old Spaniard , Friday 's father , and the reprobate sailors I left upon the island ; nay , I fancied I talked with them , and looked at them steadily , though I was broad awake , as at persons just before me ; and this I did till I often frightened myself with the images my fancy represented to me .

One time , in my sleep , I had the villainy of the three pirate sailors so lively related to me by the first Spaniard , and Friday 's father , that it was surprising : they told me how they barbarously attempted to murder all the Spaniards , and that they set fire to the provisions they had laid up , on purpose to distress and starve them ; things that I had never heard of , and that , indeed , were never all of them true in fact : but it was so warm in my imagination , and so realised to me , that , to the hour I saw them , I could not be persuaded but that it was or would be true ; also how I resented it , when the Spaniard complained to me ; and how I brought them to justice , tried them , and ordered them all three to be hanged .

Any one would think that after thirty-five years ' affliction , and a variety of unhappy circumstances , which few men , if any , ever went through before , and after near seven years of peace and enjoyment in the fulness of all things ; grown old , and when , if ever , it might be allowed me to have had experience of every state of middle life , and to know which was most adapted to make a man completely happy ; I say , after all this , any one would have thought that the native propensity to rambling which I gave an account of in my first setting out in the world to have been so predominant in my thoughts , should be worn out , and I might , at sixty one years of age , have been a little inclined to stay at home , and have done venturing life and fortune any more .

Nay , farther , the common motive of foreign adventures was taken away in me , for I had no fortune to make ; I had nothing to seek : if I had gained ten thousand pounds I had been no richer ; for I had already sufficient for me , and for those I had to leave it to ; and what I had was visibly increasing ; for , having no great family , I could not spend the income of what I had unless I would set up for an expensive way of living , such as a great family , servants , equipage , gaiety , and the like , which were things I had no notion of , or inclination to ; so that I had nothing , indeed , to do but to sit still , and fully enjoy what I had got , and see it increase daily upon my hands .

I have often heard persons of good judgment say that all the stir that people make in the world about ghosts and apparitions is owing to the strength of imagination , and the powerful operation of fancy in their minds ; that there is no such thing as a spirit appearing , or a ghost walking ; that people 's poring affectionately upon the past conversation of their deceased friends so realises it to them that they are capable of fancying , upon some extraordinary circumstances , that they see them , talk to them , and are answered by them , when , in truth , there is nothing but shadow and vapour in the thing , and they really know nothing of the matter .

I own that this dream had nothing in it literally and specifically true ; but the general part was so true -- the base ; villainous behaviour of these three hardened rogues was such , and had been so much worse than all I can describe , that the dream had too much similitude of the fact ; and as I would afterwards have punished them severely , so , if I had hanged them all , I had been much in the right , and even should have been justified both by the laws of God and man .

I dreamed of it all night , and my imagination ran upon it all day : it was uppermost in all my thoughts , and my fancy worked so steadily and strongly upon it that I talked of it in my sleep ; in short , nothing could remove it out of my mind : it even broke so violently into all my discourses that it made my conversation tiresome , for I could talk of nothing else ; all my discourse ran into it , even to impertinence ; and I saw it myself .
