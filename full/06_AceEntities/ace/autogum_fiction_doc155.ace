It was at Colchester , in Essex , that those people left me ; and I have a notion in my head that I left them there ( that is , that I hid myself and would not go any farther with them ) , but I am not able to be particular in that account ; only this I remember , that being taken up by some of the parish officers of Colchester , I gave an account that I came into the town with the gypsies , but that I would not go any farther with them , and that so they had left me , but whither they were gone that I knew not , nor could they expect it of me ; for though they send round the country to inquire after them , it seems they could not be found .

I have been told that in one of neighbour nations , whether it be in France or where else I know not , they have an order from the king , that when any criminal is condemned , either to die , or to the galleys , or to be transported , if they leave any children , as such are generally unprovided for , by the poverty or forfeiture of their parents , so they are immediately taken into the care of the Government , and put into a hospital called the House of Orphans , where they are bred up , clothed , fed , taught , and when fit to go out , are placed out to trades or to services , so as to be well able to provide for themselves by an honest , industrious behaviour .

This is too near the first hours of my life for me to relate anything of myself but by hearsay ; it is enough to mention , that as I was born in such an unhappy place , I had no parish to have recourse to for my nourishment in my infancy ; nor can I give the least account how I was kept alive , other than that , as I have been told , some relation of my mother â€™s took me away for a while as a nurse , but at whose expense , or by whose direction , I know nothing at all of it .

My true name is so well known in the records or registers at Newgate , and in the Old Bailey , and there are some things of such consequence still depending there , relating to my particular conduct , that it is not be expected I should set my name or the account of my family to this work ; perhaps , after my death , it may be better known ; at present it would not be proper , nor not though a general pardon should be issued , even without exceptions and reserve of persons or crimes .

Had this been the custom in our country , I had not been left a poor desolate girl without friends , without clothes , without help or helper in the world , as was my fate ; and by which I was not only exposed to very great distresses , even before I was capable either of understanding my case or how to amend it , but brought into a course of life which was not only scandalous in itself , but which in its ordinary course tended to the swift destruction both of soul and body .

The first account that I can recollect , or could ever learn of myself , was that I had wandered among a crew of those people they call gypsies , or Egyptians ; but I believe it was but a very little while that I had been among them , for I had not had my skin discoloured or blackened , as they do very young to all the children they carry about with them ; nor can I tell how I came among them , or how I got from them .

I was now in a way to be provided for ; for though I was not a parish charge upon this or that part of the town by law , yet as my case came to be known , and that I was too young to do any work , being not above three years old , compassion moved the magistrates of the town to order some care to be taken of me , and I became one of their own as much as if I had been born in the place .

However it was , this they all agree in , that my mother pleaded her belly , and being found quick with child , she was respited for about seven months ; in which time having brought me into the world , and being about again , she was called down , as they term it , to her former judgment , but obtained the favour of being transported to the plantations , and left me about half a year old ; and in bad hands , you may be sure .

It is enough to tell you , that as some of my worst comrades , who are out of the way of doing me harm ( having gone out of the world by the steps and the string , as I often expected to go ) , knew me by the name of Moll Flanders , so you may give me leave to speak of myself under that name till I dare own who I have been , as well as who I am .
