Recently , various technological approaches have been proposed for the analysis of movement in PD , including wearable sensor networks based on the use of inertial measurement units ( IMUs ) , smartphones and active vision systems based on new low-cost RGB-Depth optical devices such as Microsoft Kinect® ( Microsoft Corporation , Redmond , WA , USA ) and Intel RealSense® SR300 ( Intel Corporation , Santa Clara , CA , USA)[26 ] .

On the basis of these considerations , we propose the integration of two different sensor-based subsystems as a single solution for the objective , accurate and automated assessment of some standard tasks for the upper and lower limbs , as defined in the motor examination section ( Section 3 ) of UPDRS .

The chance of monitoring any change of the impairment in PD subjects over time , possibly daily and in a domestic environment , could have a strong impact on the clinical management of the patients and , consequently , on the long-term costs for the healthcare system .

Another difficulty to overcome , shared by all clinical assessment scales , is the mandatory presence of the specialist : this strongly influences the clinical management of the patient , as all the therapeutic decisions are restricted at the time of the single medical examination .

The integrated system here presented is aimed at a more comprehensive evaluation of the neuro-motor status of PD subjects by a decentralized approach , and could represent a new example of an accurate , feasible and cost-effective strategy for the clinical management of PD .

Since 1967 , when the motor effects of Levodopa ( LD ) on bradykinesia have been shown for the first time in a video , the way has been traced towards the quantification of movement disorders and their therapeutic response .

Among the tougher hurdles to overcome , there is the accurate , low-cost and objective quantification of the typical motor symptoms , which is a key issue for obtaining a complete indication of the patient ’s state of impairment .

This pathway passes through semi-quantitative rating scales , such as the Hoehn and Yahr stage and unified Parkinson ’s disease rating scale ( UPDRS ) , which is still the gold standard scale for assessing symptoms in PD .

In an attempt to address these challenges and quantify motor symptoms , motion analysis studies have played a growing role in managing subjects with PD , exploring kinematic variables on gait ; tremor ; bradykinesia and rigidity .

Motion capture systems are the reference standard for motion analysis , but they are expensive and non-portable , so their use is limited to laboratory environments and scientific research rather than to a routine clinical use .
