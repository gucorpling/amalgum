Indeed , the internal dimensions of the flow chamber are 120 cm × 180 cm × 4 cm ( L × W × D ) , which corresponds to a viewing area 90 times larger than for the validation experiment .

Nevertheless , the trend of the infiltration front , even during typical 2D flow related to rain infiltration , and the values of the water content in the main zones of the domain show great similitudes .

With these two experiments , we can say that this objective has been achieved , since we have a wide range of water content and pressure measurements , as well as complete water content maps .

As for the experimental conditions , in addition to the drainage and imbibition steps , a rain simulation was carried out on the central upper part of the tank , introducing true 2D flows .

The monitoring of the cumulative mass of water leaving ( or entering the interior of ) the flow chamber also shows a good match between measurements and results from the photometric method .

The purpose of the present study was to test the methodology proposed by Belfort et al. ( 2017 ) in a more complex flow situation and a much larger experimental tank .

In the second experiment carried out , which included a step of constant rainfall simulation , the cumulative mass was depicted to validate the numerical simulation compared to the measurement .

For the vertical line located in the middle of the tank , the representation of simulated water content profiles and those obtained from the photos are very close together .

Again , we underline the interest of applying the methodology directly during the experiment because of the specific structure of the porous medium and environmental conditions .

Now , all this data could serve to develop and test parameter estimation methodologies directly in 2D without having to limit themselves to spot measurements .

Finally , the photometric method gave satisfactory results even in more complex conditions , and this article confirmed the potential of our previously published methodology .

It appears that the photometric method did not lead to regular maps compared to those resulting from simulations , and that instabilities were present .

For the first experiment , the absolute and relative cumulative errors are very good , with global amplitude that does not exceed 8 % .
