As
a
kid
,
me
and
friends
used
to
freqent
an
old
disused
hospital
on
an
airfield
base
from
World
War
2
.
</s>
<s>
There
was
a
corridor
we
named
mile
long
because
it
went
on
forever
and
at
the
end
was
the
surgical
room
with
all
the
metal
tables
and
instruments
still
out
.

<p>
<s>
We
used
to
skateboard
in
the
old
gym
there
because
the
floor
was
wooden
,
but
then
one
day
someone
had
smashed
all
the
windows
and
there
was
glass
everywhere
which
put
a
stop
to
it
.

If
anyone
wants
to
research
about
it
,
it
's
called
Nocton
Hospital

A
while
back
,
a
friend
took
me
back
to
the
small
country
town
he
grew
up
in
.

<s>
We
spent
the
day
wandering
around
and
exploring
,
mostly
for
lack
of
anything
better
to
do
,
and
ended
up
finding
some
weird
shit
.

<p>
<s>
We
went
into
this
abandoned
house
,
and
I
think
we
may
or
may
not
have
accidentally
stumbled
across
the
local
devil
worshippers
’
lair

There
were
weird
drawings
on
the
walls
,
of
supernatural
creatures
like
topless
mermaids
with
angry
faces
,
and
sort
of
hybrid
creatures
,
and
death
threats
scrawled
with
black
paint
.

<s>
In
a
hallway
,
surrounded
by
four
doors
there
was
a
massive
hole
in
the
floor
,
like
a
giant
had
take
a
big
bite
out
of
the
floorboards
.

We
could
n’t
see
what
was
down
there
;
it
was
too
dark

On
the
walls
above
the
hole
,
things
like
“
THERE
IS
NO
ESCAPE
”
and
“
WE’RE
GOING
TO
KILL
YOU
HERE
”
were
painted
.

<s>
In
the
overgrown
garden
outside
,
there
was
a
pentagram
drawn
on
the
concrete
,
half
hidden
by
a
rusted
old
car
which
was
parked
over
it
.

Me

Looked

the
70s

80s

The
door
was
opened

When

checked
out
the

there
were
all

were
together

they
never
