What
's
new
and
exciting
about
Adam
is
[
it
is
]
the
first
time
we
've
managed
to
show
that
a
computer
can
not
only
think
up
new
scientific
ideas
,
but
experimentally
test
them
and
decide
whether
they
're
true

&quot;

Ross
King
,
a
computer
science
professor
and
lead
researcher

up
its
own
mind
what
to
do

He
says
that
for
other
lab
experiments
the
hardware
is
already
in
place
,
the
only
step
needed
is
to
change
the
software
.

The
artificial
intelligence
alone
spans
three
computers
which
holds
the
databases
and
analytical
software
to
enable
Adam
to
think

For
the
yeast
experiment
,
Adam
was
loaded
with
databases
which
hold
known
information
relating
to
yeasts
and
organisms

Adam
compared
all
fields
in
the
database
to
find
the
areas

missing
information
from

he
devised
20
hypotheses

A
part
of
the
process
is
that

cycle

analyze

well
doing
routine
repetitious
lab
work

Following
Adam
's
testing
,
King
's
team
manually
tested
three
of
Adam
's
hypotheses

found
that
the
robot
's
conclusions
were
correct

each
was

breakthrough

William
Melek
,

assistant
professor
of
mechanical
engineering
at
Ontario

University
of
Waterloo
,
has
noted
that
to
set
up
the
AI
needed
for
subsequent
experiments
involving
new
biological
variables
and
criteria
,
the
human
expertise
would
be
time
consuming

it

The
usefulness
would

David
Waltz

say
that
&quot;
For
the
foreseeable
future
,
the
prospect
of
using
automated
systems
as
assistants
holds
vast
promise
as
these
assistants
are
becoming
not
only
faster

much
broader
in
their
capabilities
--
more
knowledgeable

more
creative

It
was
