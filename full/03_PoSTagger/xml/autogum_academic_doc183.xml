Cancer
is
one
of
the
most
important
and
deadly
diseases
worldwide
.
</s>
<s>
Reports
from
the
World
Health
Organization
show
that
almost
1
in
6
deaths
worldwide
in
2018
were
due
to
cancer
.
</s>
<s>
Chemotherapy
is
a
common
approach
for
cancer
treatment
;
it
uses
drugs
to
kill
cancer
cells
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
various
limitations
affect
the
efficiency
of
chemotherapy
.
</s>
<s>
For
example
,
most
chemotherapeutics
possess
poor
aqueous
solubility
,
harm
normal
cell
toxicity
due
to
the
lack
of
selectivity
,
and
cause
multidrug
resistance
.
</s>
<s>
To
handle
these
shortcomings
,
researchers
have
proposed
nano-particles
as
novel
drug
carriers
to
help
patients
cope
with
cancer
.
</s>
<s>
Nanoparticles
,
like
vesicles
,
nanotubes
,
micelles
,
nanofibers
,
and
nanosheet
are
typically
commonly
formed
by
amphiphilic
copolymers
via
self-assembly
.
</s>
<s>
Nanoparticles
can
encapsulate
drugs
via
physical
entrapment
or
solubilization
to
achieve
various
advantages
,
including
controlled
drug
release
,
decreased
cytotoxicity
,
increased
aqueous
solubility
,
and
targeted
action
site
.
</s>
<s>
Thus
,
nanoparticles
have
opened
the
door
for
developing
effective
drug
delivery
schemes
and
have
shown
substantial
potential
for
applications
in
life-threatening
disease
treatments
,
such
as
cancer
therapy
.

<s>
Chemotherapy
usually
causes
a
decline
in
immunity
,
causing
cancer
patients
to
suffer
from
bacterial
infection
or
threatening
their
lives
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
avoiding
bacterial
infection
is
essential
during
cancer
therapy
.
</s>
<s>
As
a
kind
of
novel
antibacterial
agent
,
antimicrobial
peptides
(
AMPs
)
have
gained
increasing
attention
over
the
past
few
decades
.
</s>
<s>
AMPs
exhibit
excellent
antibacterial
capability
and
a
unique
antibacterial
mechanism
.
</s>
<s>
AMPs
achieve
their
bactericidal
effect
by
physical
disruption
of
bacterial
membranes
;
however
,
inducing
bacterial
drug
resistance
presents
difficulty
.
</s>
<s>
Research
illustrates
that
such
a
unique
antibacterial
mechanism
is
relevant
to
specific
AMP
structures
,
including
cationic
moieties
such
as
lysine
and
hydrophobic
moieties
such
as
phenylalanine
.
</s>
<s>
Lots
of
AMPs
are
amphiphilic
peptides
,
namely
,
they
are
composed
of
hydrophobic
and
hydrophilic
residues
.
</s>
<s>
AMP-nanoparticles
can
be
prepared
in
an
aqueous
solution
through
self-assembly
of
these
AMPs
.
</s>
<s>
AMP
assemblies
are
ideal
drug
delivery
systems
exhibiting
both
drug
release
and
antibacterial
capabilities
during
cancer
treatment

<s>
Our
group
has
reported
several
amphiphilic
block
AMPs
containing
lysine

phenylalanine

<s>
These
AMPs
exhibit
high
bactericidal
efficiency

low
cytotoxicity

Vesicles
formed
by
these
AMPs

good
performance
when
carrying
drugs

Motivated
by
the
excellent
properties

promising
applications
