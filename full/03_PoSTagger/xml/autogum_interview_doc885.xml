If
one
gets
in
trouble
while
on
the
RPF
program
,
they
can
be
sent
to
the
RPF
’s
RPF
,
which
is
a
mandatory
two
week
sentence
and
could
take
longer
.
</s>
<s>
One
is
segregated
from
the
rest
of
the
RPF
and
suffers
twice
the
penalties
of
a
regular
RPF
member
,
works
longer
hours
,
gets
no
pay
and
experiences
other
such
restrictions
.
</s>
<s>
Men
and
women
are
not
treated
differently
–
as
a
Scientologist
,
they
think
they
are
not
their
body
but
spiritual
beings
,
able
to
endure
anything
.
</s>
<s>
You
are
expected
to
be
able
to
perform
any
duty
,
no
matter
the
excuse
.
</s>
<s>
I
did
all
sorts
of
degrading
jobs
as
a
member
of
the
RPF
's
RPF
,
including
hand
shoveling
a
literal
mountain
of
fermented
and
maggot-infested
garbage
for
days
.
</s>
<s>
Several
of
these
stories
are
included
in
my
book

one
can
get
the
details
of
what
really
goes
on
to
&quot;
handle
&quot;
staff
members
in
Scientology

During
chapter
7
,
&quot;
Scientology
Celebrities
&quot;
,
you
recount
how
you
were
ordered
to
eat
&quot;
rations
of
beans
and
rice
for
breakfast
,
lunch
and
dinner
&quot;
,
until
you
had
filled
a
vacant
WDC
post
.

<s>
You
write
that
you
worked
for
two
months
in
this
capacity
,
attempting
to
fill
the
position
and
submitting
46
different
recommendations

How
did
such
a
diet
and
living
conditions
affect
you
during
this
time
?

How
was
your

health
,
well-being

AS
</hi>
:
There
is
some
writing
from
L.
Ron
Hubbard
that
rice
and
beans
,
eaten
together
,
form
a
complete
protein
.

<s>
So
that
was
the
justification
of
why
it
was
okay
to
put
people
on
such
a
meager
diet
as
a
form
of
punishment
–
they
ca
n't
starve
to
death
eating
that
.

I
learned
to
add
things
like
mayonnaise
to
make
it
taste
different
and
slide
down
easier

Looking
back
,
I
ca
n't
believe
I
went
through
with
it
–
or
99
%
of
everything
else
I
endured
,
but
you
're
in
the
frame
of
mind
that
any
trouble
can
be
overcome
because
one
has
to
keep
their
eye
on
the
overall
big
picture
of
helping
to
salvage
the
planet
