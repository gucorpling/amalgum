the
previous
interview
missed
nuances

the
perceived
gap
between

not
so
great

it

With

Facilitator

He
emphasized
the
familial
bond

Means

noting
that
Means

adopted
him
as
a
nephew

&quot;
It

On

Lakota
Oyate

first
freedom
celebration

information
meeting
on
Saturday

5
January

has
since
made
comments
attacking
the
legitimacy

I
have
nothing

He
also
noted
that
Lakota
Oyate
had
respected
Bone
Shirt
's
call
to
take
down
invitations
for
donations
,
but
expressed
a
wish
that
Mr
Bone
Shirt
would
make
the
same
call
to
any
other
website
inviting
donations
to
Lakotah
.

<p>

The
traditional
decision
making
process
within
the
Lakota
,
he
said
,
was
informal
discussions
among
the
women
of
the
Lakota
rather
than
pronouncements
and
declarations
.

<s>
Ideas
like
western
forms
of
government
—
referencing
the
&quot;
Republic
&quot;
—
and
the
use
of
the
English
language
were
part
of
the
reason
for
both
the
misunderstanding
of
the
dispute
between
Russell
Means
and
Canupa
Gluha
Mani

the
Lakota
's
problems

&quot;
It

hard

white
teaching

US

decline

argues
.
</s>
<s>
Canupa
Gluha
Mani
noted
that
the
life
expectancy
for
Lakota
men
is
only
44
,
and
that
alcohol
and
drug
use
are
epidemic
,
as
are
infectious
diseases
such
as
tuberculosis
.

But
revival
of
the
Lakota
has
to
be
not
just
economic
to
improve
the
circumstances
of
the
people
,
but
cultural
too
:
&quot;
Our
language
is
at
stake
right
now

but
the
US
government-backed
institutions
like
the
Tribal
Police
are
just

the
second

cavalry
