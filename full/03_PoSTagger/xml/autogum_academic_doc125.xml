The

the
DPSEEA

The

establishes
a

Its

Thus

this
systemic

focuses

According

the

The

Stauber

points
out
that

Inserted

<s>
According
to
Sobral
and
Freitas
(
2010
)
,
it
is
important
to
highlight
that
the
DPSEEA
model
of
indicators
should
be
used
as
an
auxiliary
tool
of
the
social
determination
model
of
health
,
because
although
it
allows
an
integrated
view
of
the
indicators
,
by
itself
it
cannot
contemplate
all
the
complexity
of
interrelations
of
the
dimensions
that
determine
the
process
of
social
production
of
health-disease
and
its
inequalities
between
social
groups
