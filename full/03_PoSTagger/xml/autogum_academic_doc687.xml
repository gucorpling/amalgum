<p>
<s>
In
this
study
,
the
effect
of
electricity
production
on
sustainable
economic
growth
and
industrial
production
is
analyzed
.
</s>
<s>
In
this
context
,
BRICS
countries
are
included
in
the
scope
of
the
review
.
</s>
<s>
They
are
the
countries
with
the
highest
increase
in
electricity
production
in
the
period
of
2000
–
2018
.
</s>
<s>
In
the
analysis
process
of
this
study
,
three
different
models
were
established
by
using
the
VAR
method
.
</s>
<s>
For
this
purpose
,
annual
data
of
these
variables
in
the
period
of
1991
–
2018
are
taken
into
consideration
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
According
to
the
results
of
the
analysis
,
the
increase
in
electricity
production
will
contribute
to
the
sustainable
economic
growth
in
the
following
period
.
</s>
<s>
On
the
other
hand
,
it
is
also
identified
that
higher
electricity
production
will
have
a
positive
effect
on
industrial
production
in
the
following
period
.
</s>
<s>
In
summary
,
it
is
concluded
that
electricity
production
has
a
significant
impact
on
both
sustainable
economic
growth
and
industrial
production
for
BRICS
countries
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
As
can
be
seen
from
the
results
of
this
study
,
electricity
generation
is
vital
for
both
industrial
production
and
sustainable
economic
growth
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
electricity
production
needs
to
be
increased
especially
for
BRICS
countries
.
</s>
<s>
The
main
reason
for
this
is
that
they
have
the
status
of
developing
countries
.
</s>
<s>
The
most
important
objective
for
them
is
to
reach
the
level
of
developed
countries
,
since
economic
development
,
among
other
factors
,
can
improve
population
health
status
.
</s>
<s>
Hence
,
electricity
generation
is
thought
to
serve
this
purpose
seriously
.
</s>
<s>
Within
this
framework
,
it
is
thought
that
the
most
significant
duty
belongs
to
the
governments
in
these
countries
.
</s>
<s>
For
example
,
it
would
be
appropriate
to
give
the
necessary
incentives
for
the
construction
of
the
dam
.
</s>
<s>
For
this
purpose
,
it
is
important
to
encourage
investors
with
tax
advantages
,
location
orientation
and
financing
.
</s>
<s>
By
increasing
the
number
of
the
dams
,
it
can
be
possible
to
increase
electricity
production
,
which
has
a
positive
contribution
to
sustainable
growth
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
In
addition
to
these
issues
,
it
is
also
important
that
these
countries
turn
to
alternative
energy
sources
in
order
to
increase
electricity
production
.
</s>
<s>
For
instance
,
renewable
energy
sources
such
as
solar
,
wind
and
geothermal
energy
have
gained
importance
especially
in
recent
years
.
</s>
<s>
These
energy
alternatives
have
an
inexhaustible
structure
because
they
take
their
resources
from
nature
.
</s>
<s>
On
the
other
hand
,
these
alternative
energy
sources
have
no
negative
impact
on
the
environment
.
</s>
<s>
Because
of
these
issues
,
BRICS
countries
should
turn
to
renewable
energy
investments
.
</s>
<s>
For
this
purpose
,
it
is
important
to
provide
financial
support
to
investors
,
such
as
tax
advantage
and
providing
loans
.
</s>
<s>
Thus
,
it
will
be
possible
to
achieve
sustainable
electricity
production
and
sustainable
economic
growth
by
using
renewable
energy
sources
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
It
is
also
recommended
that
countries
should
give
importance
to
electricity
production
.
</s>
<s>
Another
important
point
is
that
a
detailed
plan
should
be
designed
by
the
authorities
with
the
aim
of
using
this
electricity
effectively
.
</s>
<s>
This
situation
is
essential
especially
for
developing
countries
.
</s>
<s>
Because
they
aim
to
improve
their
economies
in
order
to
reach
the
status
of
a
developed
economy
,
they
should
mainly
focus
on
electricity
production
and
use
it
effectively
.
</s>
<s>
In
this
study
,
BRICS
countries
are
selected
because
they
have
the
highest
ratio
in
electricity
production
.
</s>
<s>
The
most
important
limitation
of
this
study
is
the
scope
because
of
the
data
availability
problem
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
in
future
studies
,
if
all
necessary
data
can
be
provided
,
different
countries
or
country
groups
can
be
considered
,
such
as
G7
,
E7
or
European
Union
.
