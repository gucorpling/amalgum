This
paper
proposes
a
precast
,
panel-segmented
arch
bridge
with
outriggers
that
form
the
cross-section
and
shape
of
the
arch
,
in
which
the
precast
panel
members
and
outriggers
resist
the
bending
moment
generated
during
construction
and
the
compressive
force
generated
during
use
.
</s>

In
this
study
,
the
stability
of
the
arch
bridge
was
evaluated
with
respect
to
the
construction
step
and
rise
ratio
during
construction
;
the
performances
of
the
target
arch

were
determined

The
proposed
precast
,
panel-segmented
arch
bridge
with
outriggers
consists
of
precast
panel
members
subject
to
compressive
force
and
continuous
rib-type
outriggers
connected
to
the
precast
panels
that
resist
the
tensile
force
.

In
this
bridge
type
,
the
compressive
and
tensile
forces
applied
to
the
arch
bridge
,
with
respect
to
the
construction
step
,
were
efficiently
transmitted
through
the
concrete
panels
and
continuous
rib-type
outriggers

Based
on
3D
structural
analysis
results
of
the
proposed
arch
bridge
,
the
stresses
in
the
precast
panels
and
outriggers
were
in
accordance
with
the
thrust
line
and
deformation
characteristics
based
on
the
behavior
of
the
arch
bridge
.
</s>
<s>
The
outriggers
â€™
tensile
and
compressive
stresses
were
caused
by
the
horizontal
displacement
of
the
arch
support
and
the
vertical
displacement
of
the
crown
in
the
self-weight
state
.

Furthermore
,
the
compressive
stress
of
the
precast
panel
and
the
tensile
and
compressive
stress
of
the
outrigger
at
the
final
construction
step
exhibited
structurally
stable
stress
distributions
,
because
of
the
decreased
difference
in
all
of
the
members

Based
on
the
results
,
in
the
self-weight
state
,
there
was
a
relatively
large
displacement
near
the
support
of
the
bridge
and
arch
crown
,
causing
the
thrust
line
to
be
located
outside
the
precast
panels
in
the
arch
crown
and
the
support

With
an
increase
in
load
with

the

the
thrust

found

precast

There
was
a
relatively
large
horizontal
displacement
in
the
precast
panels
near
the
lower

self-weight

there

</s>
<s>
However
,
the
horizontal
displacement
in
the
arch
bridge
was
reduced
because
of
the
backfill
soil

soil
mass

construction

The

<s>
However
,
given
that
the
deformation

member
forces
were
very
small

the
proposed
arch

was
considered
to
have
a
stable
structural

after
increasing

applying
the
upper

In
the
proposed

the

structural

varied

In
future
work

the
efficiency

applicability

should
be
examined
through
a
detailed
review

the

the

Moreover

various
