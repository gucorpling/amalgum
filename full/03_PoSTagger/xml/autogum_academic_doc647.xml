<s>
Geriatric
syndrome
refers
to
a
series
of
symptoms
and
observations
caused
by
a
variety
of
factors
associated
with
aging
,
where
the
older
adults
show
the
treatment
consciously
or
otherwise
,
and
long-term
care
becomes
important
at
the
same
time
.
</s>
<s>
With
respect
to
geriatric
syndrome
,
often
the
viewpoint
involves
the
purpose
of
sustaining
the
capability
for
activities
of
daily
living
(
ADL
)
and
improving
the
quality
of
life
(
QOL
)
,
rather
than
just
considering
the
disease
condition
according
to
the
diagnostic
name
.

</p>
<p>
<s>
Notably
,
there
are
geriatric
syndrome
symptoms
that
are
more
frequent
and
are
largely
affected
by
long-term
care
,
such
as
,
disorders
associated
with
mobility
(
remain
secluded
,
or
bedridden
)
,
falls
,
incontinence
,
and
cognitive
impairment
.
</s>
<s>
These
are
considered
issues
for
which
early
measures
should
be
incorporated
into
geriatric
treatment
.
</s>
<s>
In
recent
years
,
measures
against
frailty
and
sarcopenia
,
which
elevate
the
risk
of
increasing
the
need
for
long-term
care
,
are
being
considered
important
.

</p>
<p>
<s>
Frailty
progresses
as
vulnerability
to
stress
increases
due
to
declining
physiological
reserves
with
aging
,
making
one
prone
to
unhealthy
conditions
.

It

a
factor

Frailty
as
a
concept
includes
not
only
physical
problems

as
the

decline

muscle
strength

also
mental
and
physical
problems

cognitive
impairment

depression

also
includes
social
problems

solitary

economic
distress

Accordingly

it
needs
to
be
considered
comprehensively

Frailty
is
said
to
be
reversible

</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
it
is
expected
that
appropriate
intervention
for
frail
older
adults
will
lead
to
improvements
in
physical
function

daily
living
capabilities

help
reverse
frailty

and
prevent
the
onset
of
functional
disorders

</s>
<s>
For
prevention

improvement

frailty

the
key
points

be
active
promotion

identification

desirable
interventions

“
Sarcopenia
”
is
a
coined
word

“
sarx
(
sarco
)
”
means
muscle
and
“
penia
”
means
“
loss
and
reduction
”
in
Greek
,
and
it
was
first
proposed
by
Rosenberg
in
1989
.

Originally
,
it
had
a
strong
physiological
nuance

atrophy

muscle
mass

</s>
<s>
However
,
in
addition
to
primary
(
aging
)
sarcopenia

a
broader
definition
is
taking
hold
,
which
includes
as
secondary
sarcopenia
the
reduction
in
muscle
mass

muscle
strength
and
further
muscle
function
loss
,
due
to
factors
associated
with
activity

disease

In

sarcopenia
was
registered
in
the
International
Classification
of

It

It

the
physical

behind
frailty
(
weight
loss

muscle
weakness

exhaustion
,
slowness
,
low
physical
activity

Resistance
training

In

<s>
When
setting
a
low

long-term

high

Moreover
,
nutritional
interventions

promoting
muscle
protein
synthesis
