<s>
Research
that
analyzes
the
subjective
immediate
experience
at
large-scale
cultural
events
and
its
relation
with
physical
urban
environment
is
still
limited
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
one
of
the
contribution
of
this
study
was
that
its
attempt
to
capture
and
measure
subjective
immediate
experiences
at
a
large-scale
cultural
event
while
taking
into
account
the
relation
with
physical
urban
environment
(
objective
variables
)
.
</s>
<s>
Moreover
,
existing
empirical
studies
on
the
subjective
immediate
experiences
took
place
in
restricted
and
small
environments
for
a
limited
time
frame
of
several
hours
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
another
contribution
of
this
study
was
that
it
demonstrates
a
large-scale
data
collection
from
234
respondents
by
means
of
GPS
devices
and
surveys
.
</s>
<s>
In
addition
to
this
,
this
study
combined
the
collected
data
with
secondary
data
sources
for
physical
urban
environment
characteristics
and
weather
.
</s>
<s>
Since
,
with
the
approach
used
in
this
current
study
,
it
was
possible
to
capture
where
the
subjective
immediate
experiences
took
place
.
</s>
<s>
This
enabled
us
to
extract
more
data
about
the
surroundings
that
could
help
to
improve
the
organization
of
events
and
to
develop
policy
on
urban
environments
.
</s>
<s>
In
addition
,
as
the
subjective
momentary
experiences
at
cultural
events
are
a
relatively
new
subject
,
this
study
provided
experiences
that
might
support
data
collection
in
future
research
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
We
concluded
that
geotagging
with
GPS
devices
was
useful
to
collect
immediate
experiences
,
especially
in
outdoor
environments
.
</s>
<s>
For
indoor
environments
,
other
devices
(
i.
e.
,
Wi-Fi
and
Bluetooth
)
might
be
more
accurate
.
</s>
<s>
Although
using
GPS
loggers
and
paper
surveys
was
proved
to
be
useful
,
it
is
also
demanding
both
for
researchers
and
the
respondents
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
a
practical
tool
such
as
a
smartphone
app
that
will
enable
respondents
to
geotag
their
experiences
and
to
respond
prompt
surveys
about
the
characteristics
of
experiences
and
underlying
reasons
can
be
more
useful
for
the
implementation
of
this
study
.
</s>

<p>
<s>
The
idea
of
collecting
geotagged
data
and
combining
this
with
other
databases
(
i.
e.
,
weather
,
land
use
and
surveys
)
appears
to
be
successful
,
especially
in
the
context
of
the
Dutch
Design
Week
in
Eindhoven
as
this
event
provides
a
nice
test
case
because
the
locational
attributes
of
the
exhibitions
differ
considerably
.
</s>
<s>
In
a
future
study
,
more
secondary
data
on
the
physical
environment
such
as
bike
facilities
,
public
restrooms
,
parking
lots
,
etc.
could
be
added
to
the
analysis
to
see
their
influence
on
immediate
experiences
.
</s>
<s>
Integrating
more
other
data
sources
to
analysis
such
as
geotagged
social
network
data
would
enable
further
investigations
of
affective
states
of
experiences
,
and
improve
this
study
further
.
</s>
<s>
Finally
,
in
the
future
,
the
routes
that
are
taken
by
visitors
should
be
derived
from
the
GPS
logs
and
integrated
into
the
study
for
more
insights
.
</s>
<s>
Especially
,
temporal
mapping
can
reveal
the
experience
hotspots
in
time
and
space
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
According
to
the
findings
of
this
empirical
study
,
visitors
give
more
value
to
the
positive
immediate
experiences
than
negative
ones
but
the
values
attached
to
an
experience
increase
or
decrease
depending
on
the
temporality
,
physical
environment
and
the
weather
of
the
experience
.
</s>
<s>
Especially
visitors
appear
to
be
sensitive
to
number
of
exhibitions
,
distance
to
caf√©/bars
and
distance
to
railways
.
</s>
<s>
These
findings
make
it
clear
that
physical
environment
characteristics
should
be
investigated
further
in
future
studies
.
</s>
<s>
Moreover
,
the
findings
can
help
to
shape
the
experiences
at
different
locations
.
</s>
<s>
At
large-scale
events
,
usually
prominent
public
spaces
are
chosen
for
exhibitions
.
</s>
<s>
The
infrastructure
and
nearby
facilities
support
the
suitability
of
the
public
spaces
to
accommodate
such
exhibitions
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
the
prominent
public
spaces
will
be
known
by
a
large
public
and
after
a
few
years
these
public
spaces
will
not
become
better
known
.
</s>
<s>
The
prominent
public
spaces
might
even
face
problems
of
congestion
,
dirt
and
noise
during
events
,
which
is
not
desired
for
the
city
,
its
residents
and
visitors
.
</s>
<s>
By
using
different
locations
in
the
city
,
cities
would
benefit
from
a
more
equal
distribution
of
exhibitions
in
the
city
.
</s>
<s>
Less
prominent
public
spaces
that
have
potentially
suitable
location
attributes
might
be
improved
or
prepared
to
host
events
.
</s>
<s>
This
will
attract
visitors
to
different
parts
of
the
city
,
which
will
become
better
known
and
reduce
the
spatial
inequality
in
cities
.
</s>
<s>
To
select
such
potentially
suitable
locations
,
based
on
findings
,
we
advise
to
look
for
locations
located
at
some
distance
from
railways
and
close
to
cafes
and
restaurants
or
otherwise
by
adding
temporary
drink
and
food
facilities
.
</s>
<s>
Thus
large
events
can
promote
and
encourage
future
visitation
of
less
prominent
public
spaces
.
</s>
<s>
Providing
memorable
experiences
in
different
locations
will
optimize
the
placemaking
opportunities
for
cities
and
also
reduce
the
negative
impacts
of
events
on
cities
and
citizens
.
</s>
<s>
Besides
,
with
this
approach
,
negatively
experienced
places
can
be
observed
and
turned
into
positively
experienced
places
by
implementing
necessary
interventions
.
