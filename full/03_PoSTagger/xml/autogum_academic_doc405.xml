Similar

for

three

full
random
sampling
and
,
hence

we
only
show
results
for
the

shows
feature

considered

given

commonly

sensor
VIs
(

for
MODIS-PRI
and
OLI-TCTG
are

)
.
</s>
<s>
It
is
shown
that
for
most
cases
,
MODIS-derived
VIs
show
similar
sensitivities
to
those
of
VIs
derived
from
OLI
,
while
VIs
derived
from
the
Sentinel
family
exhibit
consistent
sensitivities
.
</s>
<s>
This
is
because
compared
to
MODIS
and
OLI
,
MSI
and
OLCI
are
narrow-band
sensors
and
have
relatively
similar
band
settings
.
</s>
<s>
For
almost
all
VIs
,
LAI
is
the
most
influential
predictor
.
</s>
<s>
LAI
is
one
of
the
key
parameters
describing
canopy
structure
.
</s>
<s>
In
general
,
LAI
determines
the
chance
that
incident
solar
photons
interact
with
a
leaf
.
</s>
<s>
For
photosynthetically
active
radiation
(
PAR
)
bands
and
water
absorption
bands
,
a
large
LAI
can
induce
strong
canopy
absorption
of
radiation
and
result
in
very
low
canopy
<hi rend="italic">
ρ
</hi>
.
</s>
<s>
For
weak
absorption
bands
,
such
as
NIR
,
solar
photons
are
strongly
scattered
by
the
leaves
in
a
dense
canopy
with
a
large
LAI
,
which
can
result
in
significant
anisotropic
canopy
<hi rend="italic">
ρ
</hi>
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
LAI
has
a
large
influence
on
canopy
<hi rend="italic">
ρ
</hi>
at
all
bands
,
especially
for
longer
wavelengths
.
</s>
<s>
Accordingly
,
all
the
VIs
are
sensitive
to
LAI
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
The
special
case
is
EVI
derived
from
MODIS
and
OLI
,
which
is
more
sensitive
to
CCC
(
MTCI
will
be
discussed
later
)
.
</s>
<s>
Because
CCC
is
the
product
of
total
LAI
and
Cab
,
EVI
is
considered
to
be
more
sensitive
to
green
LAI
.
</s>
<s>
Based
on
the
fact
that
photosynthesis
is
mainly
driven
by
chlorophyll
,
EVI
might
be
more
representative
for
photosynthesis-related
greenness
than
other
VIs
(
especially
NDVI
)
due
to
its
stronger
sensitivity
to
CCC
.
</s>
<s>
The
usefulness
of
MODIS-
and
Landsat-derived
EVI
(
and
two-band
EVI
,
EVI2
)
in
gross
primary
production
(
GPP
)
estimation
has
been
demonstrated
by
several
studies
at
both
ecosystem
and
global
scales
.
</s>
<s>
The
strong
sensitivity
of
EVI
to
CCC
shown
in
<figure>
Figure
2
</figure>
can
be
a
reason
for
the
good
performance
of
EVI
in
indicating
photosynthetic
capacity
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
it
is
noted
that
LAI
is
still
the
dominating
parameter
for
EVI
derived
from
MSI
and
OLCI
.
</s>
<s>
Compared
to
OLI
and
MODIS
,
the
main
difference
is
that
these
two
sensors
are
designed
with
narrow
red
and
NIR
channels
.
</s>
<s>
Because
chlorophyll
does
not
directly
affect
NIR
reflectance
,
the
potentially
stronger
sensitivity
of
broad
red
band
canopy
<hi rend="italic">
ρ
</hi>
to
CCC
is
supposed
to
be
the
reason
for
the
observed
stronger
sensitivity
of
broad-band
EVI
to
CCC
.
</s>
<s>
Different
GSA
results
for
EVI
from
broad-
and
narrow-band
sensors
indicate
that
band
settings
(
central
wavelength
and
full
width
at
half
maximum
,
FWHM
)
may
change
the
sensitivity
of
a
VI
and
should
be
considered
for
applications
with
multi-sensor
analysis
and
future
spaceborne
sensor
design
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
For
all
four
sensors
,
the
sensitivity
of
NDVI
is
dominated
by
LAI
,
and
far
behind
is
CCC
as
the
second
influential
factor
.
</s>
<s>
Generally
,
LAI
can
be
retrieved
from
canopy
<hi rend="italic">
ρ
</hi>
at
red
and
NIR
bands
on
the
basis
of
the
RT
theory
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
a
direct
relationship
can
be
established
between
NDVI
and
LAI
,
although
NDVI
can
saturate
when
LAI
is
high
.
</s>
<s>
In
this
sense
,
NDVI
,
which
is
probably
the
most
ever-used
VI
,
mainly
represents
variations
of
LAI
across
time
and
space
.
</s>
<s>
In
addition
,
compared
to
EVI
,
NDVI
exhibits
a
relatively
stronger
soil
sensitivity
.
</s>
<s>
This
is
because
a
soil
adjustment
parameter
(
<hi rend="italic">
L
</hi>
)
is
introduced
into
EVI
,
which
makes
EVI
more
resistant
against
canopy
background
changes
.
</s>
<s>
Yet
,
constant
<hi rend="italic">
L
</hi>
also
gives
EVI
additional
sensitivity
to
NIR
band
<hi rend="italic">
ρ
</hi>
,
especially
in
dense
canopy
cases
where
blue
and
red
band
<hi rend="italic">
ρ
</hi>
are
close
to
zero
.
</s>
<s>
A
similar
situation
applies
for
NIRv
,
whose
variation
is
mainly
driven
by
NIR
<hi rend="italic">
ρ
</hi>
when
NDVI
saturates
in
dense
canopy
cases
.
</s>
<s>
For
NIR
bands
,
solar
photons
are
strongly
scattered
by
leaves
and
are
weakly
absorbed
by
non-photosynthetic
constituents
.
</s>
<s>
The
way
that
NIR
photons
are
scattered
depends
on
canopy
structure
(
represented
by
LAI
and
leaf
inclination
angle
,
LIA
,
for
homogeneous
canopies
)
and
the
direction
of
incident
light
(
represented
by
solar
zenith
angle
,
SZA
)
,
while
absorption
is
dominated
by
brown
elements
(
represented
by
brown
pigment
content
,
Cbrown
and
dry
matter
content
,
Cdm
)
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
the
strong
sensitivity
of
EVI
and
NIRv
to
NIR
band
<hi rend="italic">
ρ
</hi>
makes
them
exhibit
relatively
strong
sensitivities
to
LAI
,
LIA
,
Cdm
,
and
SZA
.
</s>
<s>
The
sensitivity
of
EVI
and
NIRv
to
canopy
structure
and
non-photosynthetically
related
parameters
should
be
considered
when
applied
at
large
scales
across
different
ecosystems
with
different
canopy
architectures
.
