True

Unfortunately
the
un-democratic
Stalinist
traditions
and
practices
of
the
KKE
are
deeply-rooted
in
the
Greek
CP
[
Communist
party
]
-
one
has
only
to
read
the
analysis
of
their
last
congress
to
see
this
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
the
KKE
cannot
stand
in
coalitions
as
an
equal
to
other
opinions
.
</s>
<s>
The
current
leadership
of
the
KKE
not
only
refuses
to
collaborate
with
the
rest
of
the
left
but
treats
it
as
a
class
enemy
,
on
the
pretext
that
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synaspismos">
Synaspismos

(
the
largest
faction

voted

Maastricht

</s>
<s>
This
became
more
obvious
during
the
December
2008
uprising
where
it
denounced
the
youth
as
&quot;
agent
provocateurs
that
seak
to
destabilize
the
country
manipulating
the
masses
to
violence
&quot;
and
that
SyRizA
was
&quot;
harboring
vandals
and
criminal
elements
&quot;
,
earning
shameful
congratulations
from
the
government
and
the
far-right
.
</s>
<s>
Also
the
KKE
through
its
union
front
P.A.ME
.
refuses
to
collaborate
with
other
unions
in
industrial
action
except
general
strikes
,
and
then
always
with
separate
demonstrations
and
rallies
.
</s>
<s>
This
behaviour
however
has
not
gone
unnoticed
by
the
rank-and-file
members
,
and
there
is
sizable
discontent
with
this
hardline
approach
.

<s>
The
only
thing
that
holds
them
is
traditional
strict
party
discipline
and
the
occasional
weaknesses
of
SyRIzA
in
terms
of
less
militant
,
and
more
reformist
positions
projected
by
Synaspismos
.
</s>
<s>
In
both
cases
,
we
expect
to
see
developments
that
will
answer
to
the
indeed-confused
public
that
does
not
give
mass
support
to
the
left
mostly
because
of
disappointment
over
sectarianism
,
lack
of
militancy
and
larger
demands
rather
than
disagreement
on
principles
.
