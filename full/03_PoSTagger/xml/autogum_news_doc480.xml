Spanish
giants
Barcelona
bowed
out
of
the
Champions
League
earlier
today
,
even
after
defeating
Liverpool
1-0
at
Anfield
.
</s>
<s>
Barcelona
was
up
against
the
wall
from
the
get-go
after
losing
2-1
in
the
first
leg
of
the
series
.
</s>
<s>
Due
to
the
away
goals
rule
(
in
the
event
of
a
tie
after
both
games
,
the
side
to
score
more
away
goals
advances
)
,
Barcelona
required
at
at
least
two
goals
to
advance
.
</s>
<s>
Liverpool
have
been
strong
at
home
this
season
,
losing
only
one
domestic
league
match
this
season
at
Anfield
to
rivals
Manchester
United
.
</s>
<s>
Liverpool
featured
one
of
their
recent
January
signings
in
the
match
by
the
way
of
Alvaro
Arbeloa
,
while
Barcelona
played
their
usual
lineup
including
Ronaldinho
and
Deco
.
</s>
<s>
Though
Barca
was
the
desperate
team
in
the
match
,
Liverpool
were
the
more
dominant
side
after
the
kickoff
,
as
they
used
the
support
of
their
home
crowd
to
boost
them
.
</s>
<s>
After
only
5
minutes
,
Steve
Finnan
crossed
in
a
well
placed
ball
to
Bellamy
,
but
the
Welshman
was
n't
able
to
head
the
ball
into
the
open
net
.
</s>
<s>
Riise
,
who
scored
the
winning
goal
in
the
first
leg
,
continued
to
threaten
Barcelona
with
two
of
his
trademark
long-range
shots
.
</s>
<s>
The
first
flew
just
wide
,
and
the
second
was
even
closer
as
it
hit
off
the
crossbar
.
</s>
<s>
Another
attack
by
Liverpool
made
Barcelona
look
shaky
as
Victor
Valdes
was
force
into
a
double
save
,
first
off
Bellamy
,
then
off
Dirk
Kuyt
.
</s>
<s>
He
could
get
nowhere
near
a
diving
header
by
Riise
on
the
same
play
,
but
defender
Puyol
was
able
to
clear
the
ball
off
the
line
to
keep
Barcelonas
hopes
alive
.
</s>
<s>
Liverpool
would
hit
the
bar
again
several
minutes
later
,
after
a
poor
clearing
attempt
by
Valdes
was
handed
straight
to
Sissoko
,
and
he
was
unfortunate
to
see
his
first
time
shot
bang
off
the
bar
and
go
safely
over
the
net
.
</s>
<s>
In
the
whole
of
the
first
half
,
Barcelona
were
not
able
to
stretch
Liverpools
keeper
Jose
Reina
,
as
the
Reds
defence
snuffed
out
all
of
Barca
's
offensive
talent
.
</s>
<s>
The
second
half
started
much
as
the
first
did
,
with
Liverpool
having
a
scoring
chance
within
the
minute
.
</s>
<s>
Captain
Steven
Gerrard
made
a
run
down
the
right
side
and
crossed
the
ball
into
Kuyt
,
but
the
Dutchman
missed
the
ball
,
and
Bellamy
was
n't
expecting
the
ball
to
come
to
him
as
it
flew
safely
through
the
area
.
</s>
<s>
Jose
Reina
was
finally
forced
into
a
save
on
50
minutes
,
but
Ronaldinho
's
long
range
shot
was
easy
pickings
for
the
Spaniard
.
</s>
<s>
Ronaldinho
would
have
another
great
chance
minutes
later
as
he
made
a
quick
run
,
exchange
passes
with
Deco
,
and
twisted
past
Jamie
Carragher
,
only
to
see
his
side
footed
shot
slam
off
the
post
.
</s>
<s>
Barcelona
continued
to
push
,
and
a
good
save
by
Reina
was
required
to
keep
youngster
Lionel
Messi
from
scoring
.
</s>
<s>
Barcelona
's
coach
Frank
Rikjarrd
decided
it
was
time
for
some
changes
and
sent
Giuly
and
Gudjohnsen
into
the
mix
.
</s>
<s>
Gudjohnsen
was
used
to
playing
against
Liverpool
after
his
years
at
Chelsea
,
and
seemed
to
use
it
to
his
advantage
as
he
received
a
pass
from
Xavi
and
slotted
the
ball
home
to
give
Barcelona
sight
of
the
next
round
.
</s>
<s>
Ronaldinho
then
forced
a
save
out
of
Reina
,
and
Barcelona
appeared
to
have
regained
their
passing
game
,
which
caused
the
home
fans
to
worry
.
</s>
<s>
Liverpool
still
played
strongly
,
and
Steven
Gerrard
was
the
main
point
of
their
inspiration
winning
a
free
kick
,
which
was
wasted
,
and
then
seeing
a
left
footed
effort
palmed
away
by
Victor
Valdes
.
</s>
<s>
Liverpool
had
a
chance
to
equalise
in
the
final
minutes
,
but
were
not
able
to
convert
.
</s>
<s>
The
one
goal
would
not
be
enough
for
Barcelona
however
,
as
Liverpool
advances
to
the
next
round
of
the
Champions
League
.
