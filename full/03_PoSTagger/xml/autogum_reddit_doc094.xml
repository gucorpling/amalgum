crumbling
house

&quot;
I
stood
like
an
an
old
age
explorer
at
the
brow
of
my
ship-
in
this
case
,
a
rickety
rowboat
manned
by
two
fellow
high
schoolers
.

At

tip
over

a
water-snake

potentially
flesh-eating
bacteria

my
mom

warnings

be
believed

infested

.

&quot;
Okay

first

said

Perry
added

unhelpfully

&quot;
God
,
&quot;
I
puffed
out
a
misty
breath
into
the
cool
night
air
.

&quot;
You

dull

Why

&quot;
&quot;
Hm

&quot;
Caitlyn
retorted
shrilly
,
&quot;
let
's
see
,
creepy
house
,
teenage
girl
,
dark
and
stormy
night-
,
&quot;
&quot;
It
's
barely
raining

&quot;
I
countered
,
but
she
was
on
a
roll-
&quot;
I
'm
not
gonna
be
the

Amber
Alert

&quot;
she
hissed
.

You

A

I
clicked
my

together
threateningly

&quot;
Dude

Perry
sighed

&quot;
You

she
waved
a

&quot;

Honestly

a
chick
you

this

<s>
This
is
classic
reverse
sexism-

&quot;
&quot;
You
're
gonna
tip
the
boat

&quot;
Perry
groused
,
so
I
vaulted
off
and
onto
the
muddy
scrap
of
land
that
somehow
,
at
some
point
,
had
held
up
the
little
shack
.
</s>
<s>
My
boots
sunk
into
the
mud
,
but
not
enough
to
hinder
my
strides
up
to
the
entrance
.
</s>
<s>
The
door
was
missing
,
which
would
probably
come
in
handy
if
I
had
to
run
out
again
in
five
minutes
,
pursued
by
the
ghosts
of
dead
frogs
.
</s>
<s>
Fueled
by
adolescent
curiosity
,
and
two
cans
of
Miller
Lite
,
I
stumbled
into
the
decrepit
house
,
waving
my
flashlight
around
,
and
then
gasped
involuntary
when
a
face
came
swimming
out
of
the
darkness
.
</s>
<s>
I
nearly
jumped
out
of
my
skin
,
but
quickly
calmed
enough
to
not
piss
myself
when
I
realized
it
was
just
a
statue
.
</s>
<s>
A
very
detailed
statue
,
but
a
statue
nonetheless
.
</s>
<s>
The
face
of
a
startled
man
met
mine
,
frozen
in
marble
.
</s>
<s>
I
thought
it
might
have
been
one
of
those
knock-off
Greek
statues
,
but
the
man
's
appearance
was
very
modern
;
the
statue
worn
a
ragged
tee
shirt
and
jeans
,
and
there
was
even
a
lighter
in
one
of
his
hands
.
</s>
<s>
I
crouched
down
to
inspect
it
,
delighted
with
my
find
.
</s>
<s>
This
was
very
weird-
and
very
cool
.
</s>
<s>
Who
kept
such
a
detailed
statue
in
a
dump
like
this
?
</s>
<s>
Had
it
been
stolen
by
someone
,
and
hidden
here
?
Was
I
about
to
uncover
some
Goonies-level
treasure
?
</s>
<s>
Caitlyn
would
probably
ditch
Perry
for
me
if
I
became
the
town
kingpin
with
some
sweet
,
sweet
abandoned
shack
cash
.
</s>
<s>
Snickering
to
myself
,
I
crept
around
the
statue
,
which
was
easily
as
tall
as
me
,
and
further
into
the
room
.
</s>
<s>
There
were
even
more
figures
;
another
man
,
this
one
sitting
on
the
floor
,
glancing
up
at
me
in
horror
through
distinctly
80s-style
glasses
,
a
baseball
cap
on
his
head
.
</s>
<s>
I
traced
the
logo
with
my
figure
,
my
amusement
fading
into
confusion
.
</s>
<s>
Then
a
teenaged
couple
in
the
corner
,
a
boy
and
girl
dressed
in
what
looked
like
50s
outfits
,
cigarettes
in
hand
.
the
boy
was
gaping
at
me
,
the
girl
peering
out
at
me
in
terror
from
her
position
hiding
behind
him
,
her
stone
fingers
digging
into
his
marble
leather
jacket
.
</s>
<s>
I
could
get
one
weird
statue
,
but
why
did
they
all
look
so
scared
or
shocked
?
</s>
<s>
What
was
the
point
?
Was
it
supposed
to
be
some
kind
of
theme
?
</s>
<s>
Had
I
stumbled
upon
a
weird
indie
art
project
,
conveniently
hosted
the
middle
of
a
swamp
?
</s>
<s>
&quot;
Do
you
like
them
?
</s>
<s>
&quot;
a
breathy
voice
sounded
from
the
corner
behind
me
,
and
I
yelped
,
whirling
around
,
flashlight
beam
bouncing
off
the
rotting
walls
and
sunken
ceiling
,
glancing
over
a
gaping
hole
in
the
floor
,
which
water
glistened
darkly
through
.
</s>
<s>
Suddenly
the
shack
seemed
much
more
precarious
,
as
if
the
floorboards
underneath
my
feet
might
give
out
at
any
moment
.
</s>
<s>
Even
though
that
had
probably
been
the
case
all
along
.
</s>
<s>
Finally
I
made
out
a
faint
figure
;
a
teenaged
girl
,
probably
around
my
own
age
,
in
a
baggy
blouse
and
long
skirt
that
wisped
around
her
legs
.
</s>
<s>
Her
diminutive
size
was
the
only
thing
keeping
me
from
bolting
out
;
she
could
n't
have
weighed
more
than
100
pounds
soaking
wet
.
</s>
<s>
&quot;
Who
the
fuck
are
you
?
</s>
<s>
&quot;
I
asked
,
bringing
my
flashlight
up
to
shine
in
her
face
.
</s>
<s>
To
my
alarm
,
her
eyes
were
closed
,
although
she
was
turned
in
my
direction
and
smiling
.
</s>
<s>
Was
she
blind
?
</s>
<s>
&quot;
Do
you
like
them
?
</s>
<s>
&quot;
she
repeated
in
a
faint
,
but
adamant
voice
that
seemed
to
ease
out
of
her
like
a
breeze
.
</s>
<s>
She
nodded
in
the
direction
of
the
statues
.
</s>
<s>
&quot;
You
made
these
?
</s>
<s>
&quot;
I
asked
in
disbelief
.
</s>
<s>
She
had
to
be
a
druggie
.
</s>
<s>
&quot;
Yes
,
&quot;
her
unseeing
smile
widened
,
raising
the
hairs
on
the
back
of
my
neck
.
</s>
<s>
&quot;
They
're
all
mine
.
</s>
<s>
&quot;
&quot;
With
what
?
</s>
<s>
&quot;
I
demanded
.
</s>
<s>
This
did
n't
seem
like
the
ideal
studio
.
</s>
<s>
She
tilted
her
head
slightly
like
an
animal
questioning
a
directive
.
</s>
<s>
I
took
a
slight
step
backwards
,
the
floor
creaking
underneath
me
.
</s>
<s>
&quot;
I
've
been
waiting
a
long
time
,
&quot;
she
breathed
instead
,
&quot;
here
in
the
dark
.
</s>
<s>
It
's
so
wet
and
cold
.
</s>
<s>
It
's
so
lonely
.
</s>
<s>
&quot;
Her
hair
was
tied
back
with
a
bandanna
,
which
she
fingered
gently
.
</s>
<s>
I
kept
hearing
a
faint
nose
,
almost
like
air
coming
out
of
a
pipe-
a
sort
of
hissing
.
</s>
<s>
&quot;
Well
,
&quot;
I
said
,
deciding
that
this
was
not
the
sort
of
movie
I
wanted
to
be
in
,
&quot;
I
have
to
go-
,
&quot;
&quot;
Stay
!
</s>
<s>
&quot;
she
pleaded
,
and
her
hands
,
pale
and
bony
,
nails
cracked
like
those
of
an
old
woman
,
flew
up
to
her
faded
bandanna
.
</s>
<s>
&quot;
Everyone
leaves-
they
all
leave
...
wherever
I
go
,
they
all
leave-
,
&quot;
She
took
a
sudden
,
quick
step
forward
,
and
I
dropped
my
flashlight
.
</s>
<s>
That
saved
my
life
,
as
it
bounced
to
the
floor
,
the
darkness
obscuring
my
vision
,
and
she
pulled
down
the
bandanna
,
letting
her
hair
fall
into
her
face-
only
it
was
n't
hair
at
all
,
but
hundreds
of
tiny
snakes
like
braids
,
coiling
and
hissing
,
a
thrashing
mass
of
scales
.
</s>
<s>
I
screamed
and
turned
to
run
as
she
opened
her
eyes
,
which
I
only
met
for
a
brief
second-
they
were
bright
gold
,
shining
like
lamps
in
the
dark
,
and
pain
spread
coldly
in
my
feet
.
</s>
<s>
I
stumbled
and
tripped
onto
the
wet
floor
,
dragging
myself
up
by
latching
onto
the
nearest
statue
's
arm
,
as
the
hissing
grew
closer
behind
me
.
</s>
<s>
&quot;
Wo
n't
you
stay
with
me
?

<s>
&quot;
she
demanded
.

<s>
&quot;
It
's
not
fair
!

<s>
I
want
you
to-
,
&quot;
her
fingers
grazed
the
back
of
my
jacket
as
I
practically
threw
myself
out
of
the
house
,
falling
into
the
mud
with
a
muffled
yell
,
and
wading
into
the
swamp
and
towards
the
boat
,
which
was
already
halfway
back
to
dry
land
,
Perry
's
terror-fueled
rowing
aiding
their
flight
.

<s>
&quot;
Jesus-

&quot;
I
tripped
and
caught
a
mouthful
of
fetid
water

<s>
Gagging

I
resurfaced
,
thankful
the
deepest
part

swamp
only
came
up

my
chest

I
could
still
hear

water

I
yelled
after
them
,

Perry
paused
long
enough
,
panting
,
for
me
to
latch
into
the
boat
and
heave
myself
up
while
Caitlyn
aimed
several
smacks
at
my
sodden
frame
.

she
screech-sobbed

my
face

glanced
down
at
my
feet

running

car

toes
