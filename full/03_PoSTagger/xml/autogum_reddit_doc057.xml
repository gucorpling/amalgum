Him

this

I

from
experience

through
some
of
my
most
painful
months
without
a
support
system

I
found
myself
on

much
stronger

next
time

went
through
something
painful

That

to

stoic

alone

ca
n’t
grow
stronger

supported

but
I
just
noticed
something
different
about
myself
after
that
period

I
guess
part
of
it
was
pride
that
I
had
managed
to
drag
myself
out
of
it

and
more
confidence
because
I
had
been
forced
to
learn
that
I

alone
something

I
thought

going

break
me
