BA
targeted

<s>
The
regulation
of
BAs
on
other
pathways
occurs
mainly
through
the
activation
of
nuclear
hormone
receptors
(
NHRs
)
such
as
the
farnesoid
X
receptor
(
FXR
)
,
pregnane
X
receptor
(
PXR
)
,
and
vitamin
D
receptor
(
VDR
)
.
</s>
<s>
For
the
activation
of
these
receptors
,
it
is
necessary
that
they
interact
with
the
retinoid
X
receptor
as
a
heterodimer
(
RXR
)
.
</s>
<s>
Afterwards
,
they
act
on
various
regulatory
regions
by
binding
to
hormone
response
elements
causing
several
genes
to
be
up
or
downregulated
in
their
transcription
.
</s>

Most
BAs
and
the
secondary
BA

FXR

It
is
most
highly
expressed
in
the
liver

The
strongest
activator
is
CDCA

followed
by
DCA

CA
,

LCA

</s>
<s>
Despite
the
fact
that
LCA
is
a
weak
activator
of
FXR
,
it
is
a
very
strong
downregulator

its
function
and
thus
could
be
termed
a
partial
agonist

Controlling

After

activated
through
BA
in
the
ileum

the
expression

fibroblast
growth
factor

increases
,
leading
to
an
activation

fibroblast
growth
factor
receptor

(
FGFR4
)
in
hepatocytes
(

</s>
<s>
This
is
of
great
importance
as
FGF15/19

an
ileum-derived
enterokine
that
governs
BA
homeostasis

regulates
hepatic
glucose
metabolism
,
and
stimulates
protein
synthesis
.
</s>
<s>
If
administered
pharmacologically
or
expressed
transgenically
in
mice

FGF19

hepatic
lipid
oxidation
