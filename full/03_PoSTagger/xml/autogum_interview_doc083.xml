<s>
For
me
though
,
if
you
go
back
and
look
at
my
press
conference
,
I
pretty
methodically
laid
out
the
chronology
of
why
I
thought
that
Senator
Long
and
others
had
taken
the
issue
into
their
own
hands
in
order
to
really
kill
the
issue
for
the
session
.
</s>
<s>
And
when
I
had
met
with
them
before
learning
the
concerns
of
the
governor
,
I
had
met
with
Senator
Long
and
Senator
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent%20Steele">
[
Brent
]
Steele
</ref>
,
and
we
were
asked
—
because
we
were
members
of
the
Judiciary
Committee
—
to
do
a
whip
count
on
the
Judiciary
members
to
find
out
if
there
was
support
to
reinsert
the
second
sentence
and
if
there
was
support
to
pass
HJR-3
to
pass
out
of
the
committee
.
</s>
<s>
At
the
time
,
we
were
told
that
the
resolution
was
going
to
go
to
Judiciary
Committee
.
</s>
<s>
And
then
when
we
did
the
whip
count
,
we
found
support
to
restore
the
second
sentence
,
and
then
pass
it
out
of
committee
.
</s>
<s>
After
that
,
Senator
Long
made
the
decision
to
not
send
it
to
Judiciary
but
rather
to
his
own
Committee
,
Rules
Committee
,
and
then
he
made
the
further
decision
that
he
was
n't
going
to
allow
any
amendment
.
</s>
<s>
And
then
he
was
going
to
pass
the
resolution
to
the
floor
without
amendment
.
</s>
<s>
Which
if
you
look
at
the
numbers
,
the
mathematics
—
and
again
I
go
through
all
of
this
in
my
press
conference
,
which
is
on
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/YouTube">
YouTube
</ref>
in
detail
—
If
you
take
the
thirteen
Democrats
and
assume
that
they
are
all
going
to
vote
no
,
it
only
takes
thirteen
more
Republicans
to
vote
no
with
the
Democrats
.
</s>
<s>
And
so
the
mathematics
works
against
conservative
Republicans
on
the
Senate
floor
.
</s>
<s>
And
I
think
all
those
things
,
in
addition
to
other
things
,
factored
into
Senator
Long
's
decision
to
do
what
he
did
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Now
in
terms
of
the
tweet
when
I
was
trying
to
help
Senator
Kruse
.
</s>
<s>
I
had
started
my
own
whip
count
and
I
was
stuck
on
fifteen
solid
Republican
votes
to
agree
on
the
floor
to
reinsert
the
second
sentence
.
</s>
<s>
Well
I
needed
twenty-six
.
</s>
<s>
If
I
did
n't
have
twenty-six
,
it
was
n't
going
to
happen
because
of
the
math
with
the
Democrats
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
And
so
we
had
caucus
,
I
ca
n't
tell
you
what
was
discussed
or
said
or
done
in
caucus
,
but
because
I
had
filed
my
amendment
—
because
at
the
time
I
was
n't
positive
that
an
amendment
was
going
to
be
filed
.
</s>
<s>
In
checking
with
the
legislative
services
agency
,
and
with
the
Senate
majority
attorney
's
office
,
I
went
ahead
and
filed
an
amendment
to
make
sure
that
we
would
meet
a
deadline
so
an
amendment
could
be
filed
.
</s>
<s>
I
did
that
knowing
that
I
was
stuck
at
fifteen
votes
.
</s>
<s>
And
so
there
was
media
interest
as
to
whether
or
not
I
was
going
to
call
my
amendment
and
what
was
going
to
happen
.
</s>
<s>
We
were
on
the
senate
floor
and
this
was
after
the
caucus
meeting
.
</s>
<s>
Within
minutes
of
Dennis
Kruse
calling
HJR-3
for
second
reading
—
and
that
's
when
I
put
out
the
tweet
saying
there
was
n't
support
for
me
to
call
my
amendment
and
that
the
second
sentence
was
dead
for
the
session
of
the
General
Assembly
.
