Just
on

there

reports
every

talking

the
decline

more

As

:
We
have
n't
had
problems
in
finding
candidates
,
in
fact
I
think
we
continue
to
be
very
,
I
wo
n't
say
&quot;
lucky
&quot;
,
but
we
've
been
very
successful
in
being
able
to
attract
the
numbers
of
young
mathematical
science
graduates
that
we
need
for
our
business
.
</s>
<s>
But
if
you
asked
me
in
a
much
more
general
context
,
both
the
previous
Statistician
and
myself
,
and
when
I
was
in
New
Zealand
I
pursued
this
as
well
,
there
is
definitely
a
decline
in
the
number
of
kids
basically
going
through
high
school
and
coming
out
of
high
school
with
higher
mathematics
,
doing
the
tougher
mathematics
subjects
as
they
go
through
.
</s>
<s>
That
feeds
through
into
the
universities
-
we
've
seen
here
in
Australia
over
the
last
decade
or
more
a
significant
shrinking
of
the
maths
and
stats
departments
in
a
lot
of
the
universities
around
Australia
,
and
I
think
that
we
do
,
and
I
am
concerned
,
at
a
time
when
as
a
society
we
rely
more
and
more
on
information
and
the
skills
and
the
abilities
to
design
,
collect
,
analyse
,
interpret
,
model
information
for
decision
,
public
and
private
and
personal
,
at
a
time
when
we
're
putting
so
much
more
emphasis
on
the
importance
of
information
in
decision
processes
,
we
're
not
producing
enough
people
with
the
skills
to
take
full
advantage
of
this
rich
range
of
resources
that
we
produce
these
days
.

And
is
there
another
concern

<p>
<hi rend="bold">

Well
I
think
that
's
gone
on
for
a
long
time
in
Australia
,
and
then
if
you
were
in
New
Zealand
they
complain
about
the
brain
drain
to
Australia
.
</s>
<s>
We
live
in
a
global
world
now
,
and
the
skilled
people
are
very
portable
,
and
so
we
have
to
-
and
that
's
another
reason
why
we
should
be
thinking
about
the
sorts
of
skills
that
the
nation
needs
as
you
look
forward
in
the
next
couple
of
decades
of
the
21st
century
-
we
need
to
be
encouraging
the
kids
through
the
school
system
and
then
into
the
post-school
education
systems
to
take
the
sorts
of
courses
that
are
going
to
be
the
sorts
of
skills
that
the
nation
needs
to
continue
to
develop
and
prosper
,
and
I
think
that
's
a
challenge
that
's
there
,
and
we
have
to
accept
that
a
part
of
the
people
that
we
train
and
develop
will
go
offshore
.
</s>
<s>
That
's
reality
,
and
we
will
attract
people
from
overseas
to
come
here
.
</s>
<s>
So
I
do
n't
think
we
should
be
-
that
's
not
what
worries
me
,
to
be
honest
.
</s>
<s>
It
's
getting
enough
people
coming
through
to
ensure
that
we
do
have
the
skills
in
our
society
that
allow
us
to
continue
to
develop
those
skills
,
those
quantitative
skills
of
being
able
to
work
with
information
and
analyse
and
interpret
,
model
it
as
I
said
,
and
be
able
to
make
good
decisions
based
on
good
evidence
in
whatever
context
-
in
biotechnology
,
in
technology
,
in
social
sciences
,
in
environmental
sciences
-
they
all
need
people
with
skills
of
being
able
to
understand
and
work
with
data
,
and
we
're
not
producing
enough
really
well-skilled
people
in
that
space
.
