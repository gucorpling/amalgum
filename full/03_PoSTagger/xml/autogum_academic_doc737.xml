Our
survey
showed
that
respondents
generally
felt
less
safe
while
walking
around
dockless
e-scooters
than
they
were
around
the
different
types
of
bicycles
.
</s>
<s>
We
found
a
similar
result
for
driving
around
e-scooters
.
</s>
<s>
Increased
discomfort
around
e-scooters
may
be
explained
by
e-scooters
being
a
new
mode
that
pedestrians
(
and
drivers
)
are
not
yet
used
to
.
</s>
<s>
For
drivers
,
previous
research
has
found
that
motorists
fail
to
notice
motorcycles
at
a
higher
rate
than
automobiles
,
likely
due
to
drivers
not
expecting
to
see
motorcycles
,
making
it
difficult
to
notice
them
.
</s>
<s>
This
phenomenon
has
been
used
to
explain
the
inverse
correlation
between
the
number
of
bicyclists
and
pedestrians
and
the
rate
of
cyclist
and
pedestrian
crashes
.
</s>
<s>
Researchers
have
found
that
,
as
cyclists
and
pedestrian
numbers
increase
,
safety
increases
,
known
as
the
‘
safety
in
numbers
effect
,
’
which
could
be
explained
by
drivers
becoming
more
acclimated
to
seeing
cyclists
on
the
road
.
</s>
<s>
E-scooters
,
unlike
bicycles
and
motorcycles
,
are
a
new
mode
of
transport
,
and
both
riders
and
drivers
are
not
yet
used
to
how
they
operate
in
traffic
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
The
survey
also
reveals
large
differences
in
comfort
and
perceived
safety
between
those
who
had
used
dockless
e-scooters
before
and
those
who
had
not
.
</s>
<s>
More
than
three
quarters
(
76
%
)
of
non-riders
reported
feeling
“
unsafe
”
or
“
very
unsafe
”
walking
around
dockless
e-scooters
while
only
one
quarter
(
24
%
)
of
riders
felt
this
way
.
</s>
<s>
This
could
be
explained
by
riders
having
a
greater
familiarity
with
the
devices
than
those
who
had
never
ridden
them
before
.
</s>
<s>
A
similar
difference
appeared
when
respondents
were
asked
to
report
how
frequently
they
encountered
a
sidewalk
blocked
by
a
dockless
e-scooter
.
</s>
<s>
One-third
of
non-riders
reported
“
always
”
encountering
blocked
sidewalks
while
only
7
%
of
riders
reported
“
always
”
encountering
them
.
</s>
<s>
These
results
are
similar
toa
Washington
,
DC
survey
that
found
that
80
%
of
respondents
who
did
not
approve
of
the
city
allowing
e-scooters
to
operate
had
never
tried
the
service
(
p.34
)
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
While
these
differences
could
indicate
that
greater
familiarity
with
dockless
e-scooters
leads
people
to
be
less
bothered
by
them
and
to
feel
safer
around
them
,
causation
is
hard
to
determine
.
</s>
<s>
It
could
also
be
the
case
that
people
who
do
not
like
dockless
e-scooters
and
feel
uncomfortable
around
them
choose
not
to
use
them
.
</s>
<s>
In
our
survey
,
those
who
had
used
dockless
e-scooters
before
were
,
on
average
,
much
younger
than
those
who
had
not
(
84
%
of
riders
were
younger
than
34
compared
to
45
%
of
non-riders
)
.
</s>
<s>
This
age
difference
may
matter
.
</s>
<s>
An
e-scooter
on
the
sidewalk
might
pose
a
greater
challenge
to
older
individuals
who
may
not
be
able
to
move
the
e-scooter
out
of
the
way
or
walk
around
it
as
easily
as
younger
respondents
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Moreover
,
our
study
did
not
define
what
a
“
blocked
”
sidewalk
was
,
nor
did
we
quantify
the
frequency
terms
we
offered
(
e.
g.
“
always
”
)
.
</s>
<s>
Thus
,
our
respondents
likely
had
different
ideas
about
what
constitutes
a
blocked
sidewalk
when
responding
to
our
question
.
</s>
<s>
Similarly
,
it
is
possible
that
someone
who
has
experience
with
using
the
devices
or
is
able
to
step
over
or
move
them
out
of
the
way
does
not
notice
how
often
they
have
to
do
so
;
while
,
conversely
,
someone
who
has
more
trouble
with
them
may
notice
it
more
,
so
that
the
same
number
of
encounters
may
seem
“
frequent
”
or
“
infrequent
”
to
different
people
.
</s>
<s>
We
recommend
that
future
studies
ask
more
specifically
about
the
number
of
instances
of
blocked
sidewalks
rather
than
reporting
on
the
categories
we
used
