One
of
my
main
points
is
to
achieve
a
balanced
budget
,
sooner
not
later
,
not
five
years
down
the
road
,
not
ten
years
down
the
road

We
need
to
do
that
now

<p>

I
also
understand
the
need
for
secure
borders
.

<s>
And
I
am
the
only
candidate
that
is
in
favor
of
totally
stopping
illegal
immigration
,
and
reducing
legal
immigration
.
</s>
<s>
Immigration
costs
this
country
billions
of
dollars
.
</s>
<s>
We
should
not
be
bringing
in
more
green
card
holders
while
our
unemployment
rate
is
between
eight
and
nine
percent
.
</s>
<s>
We
need
jobs
in
America
,
and
U.S.
citizens
first
,
and
not
bring
in
so
many
from
other
countries
that
take
jobs
from
U.S.
citizens
.

<s>
Running
a
grassroots
campaign
should
be
very
appealing
to
Democrats
who
do
not
favor
the
big

’s

President
Obama

</s>
<s>
He
’s
lowering

and
he
has
maximum
limit
donations
,
which
I
believe
is
about
$
10,000
per
couple
now
.
</s>
<s>
Our
limit
is
$
200
,
so
I
think
we
’ll
take
votes
from
President
Obama
and
with
those
who
really
want
to
balance
the
budget
right
away
will
vote
