This
was
a
much-needed
signing

Poe
represents
what
the
Panthers
wanted
Star
Lotulelei
to
grow
into
.
</s>
<s>
With
Lotulelei
gone
Poe
will
start
alongside
Kawann
Short
and
should
be
an
instant
upgrade
over
the
departed
space
eating
defensive
tackle
.
</s>
<s>
All-in-all
grabbing
Poe
was
a
huge
thing
for
the
Panthers
defense
.
####Ross
Cockrell
,
CB
The
Panthers
initially
signed
Bashaud
Breeland
,
Breeland
failed
his
physical
due
to
a
lingering
injury
and
the
Panthers
moved
on
to
Ross
Cockrell
.
</s>
<s>
The
Panthers
will
be
the
fourth
team
that
Cockrell
has
played
for
since
being
drafted
in
2014
by
the
Buffalo
Bills
.
</s>
<s>
After
only
playing
seven
games
his
rookie
year
and
being
released
after
the
season
,
Cockrell
has
played
in
47
out
of
48
possible
games
and
has
recorded
36
passes
defended
and
five
interceptions
during
those
three
seasons
.
</s>
<s>
Cockrell
is
at
his
best
when
lined
up
across
from
another
good
corner
and
should
have
an
immediate
impact
for
the
Panthers
since
Daryl
Worley
was
traded
,
and
subsequently
arrested
.
####Torrey
Smith
,
WR
Speaking
of
Worley
being
traded
…
</s>
<s>
At
the
time
I
hated
the
trade
,
but
with
Worley
showing
obvious
character
flaws
,
the
trade
looks
much
better
.
</s>
<s>
Smith
offers
the
Panthers
a
deep
threat
with
experience
which
is
something
they
have
lacked
since
Ted
Ginn
left(40
%
of
Smith
’s
yards
in
2017
came
from
deep
passes
)
.
</s>
<s>
With
two
injury
prone
young
guns
behind
him(Curtis
Samuel
and
Damiere
Byrd
)
Smith
will
see
a
lot
of
snaps
in
the
coming
season
.
</s>
<s>
In
all
likelihood
he
will
enter
the
season
as
the
Panthers
#2
receiver
behind
Devin
Funchess
and
hopefully
he
can
resolve
his
drop
issues
and
give
Newton
a
legitimate
deep
threat
.
####Jarius
Wright

WR
I
do
n’t
have
much
to
say
about
Wright
because
offensive
coordinator

Norv
Turner

“

his
style

Turner

spent
two-and-a-half
seasons
coaching
Wright

Searcy

Unfortunately
for
the
Panthers
they
are
going

need
Searcy
to
become
a
great
safety
quickly
.
</s>
<s>
With
Colin
Jones
being
the
only
other
option
for
free
safety
reps
the
Panthers
passing
defense
will
rely
heavily
on
Searcy
making
the
right
reads

being
in
the
right
position
.

####Jeremiah
Sirles
,
G
Sirles
will
be
replacing
Andrew
Norwell
,
which
if
you
have
n’t
guessed
by
now
means
the
Panthers
downgraded
immeasurably
at
the
LG
position
.
</s>
<s>
Sirles
has
not
proven
to
be
a
quality
guard
in
his
four
years
in
the
league
,
furthermore
he
had
a
hard
time
solidifying
a
backup
role
on
the
Vikings
offensive
line
which
was
anything
but
inspiring
during
that
time
.

<s>
####Zach
Banner

T
Brought

his
rare
size

upside

until
he
can
prove
able
to
control
his
weight
and
keep
up
with
faster
rushers
he
wo
n’t
see
the
field
and
could
be
relegated
to
the
practice
squad
.
</s>
<s>
I
highly
doubt
he
makes
it
as
a
tackle
,
but
that
does
n’t
mean
he
ca
n’t
step
up
and
find
a
role
on
the
interior

offensive
line

Was
a
fourth
round
pick

remember
being
high
on
his
upside

if
any
team
can
get
him
to
be
a
contributor
it

##Thoughts
on
draft
as
a
whole
:
I
like
the
D.J.
Moore
pick
,
personally
I
had
Ridley
graded
higher
,
but
I
understand
why
the
Panthers
picked
him
and
truly
think
that
he
can
make
an
impact
on
the
franchise
.
</s>
<s>
Moore
was
used
poorly
in
Maryland
’s
offense
,
likely
because
of
the
constant
rotation
at
quarterback
and
thus
the
oversimplification
of
the
scheme
to
help
the
latest
quarterback
out
.
</s>
<s>
Moore
showed
flashes
of
brilliance
with
explosive
cuts
,
good
physicality
,
strong
hands
,
and
an
ability
to
create
separation
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
at
other
times
he
did
n’t
show
any
of
these
traits
.
</s>
<s>
Moore
worked
back
to
the
ball
frequently
,
made
adjustments
regularly
,
found
the
soft
spots
in
coverage
easily
and
was
electric
with
the
ball
in
his
hands
.
</s>
<s>
If
he
can
show
an
ability
to
run
a
more
diverse
route
tree
and
consistently
explode
out
of
breaks
then
the
Panthers
have
found
a
number
one
receiver
.
</s>
<s>
In
my
opinion
,
the
second
round
went
terribly
.
</s>
<s>
If
the
Panthers
were
going
to
take
a
cornerback
I
would
have
preferred
Isaiah
Oliver
,
but
disregarding
my
opinion
on
cornerbacks
for
a
second
,
Justin
Reid
was
still
on
the
board
and
I
think
it
was
a
huge
mistake
to
take
Donte
Jackson
over
him
considering
the
impact
Reid
could
have
at
the
safety
position
considering
the
average
age
of
the
safety
group
is
29
and
the
only
players
younger
than
29
are
Dezmen
Southward(27
)
,
Demetrious
Cox(24
)
and
Damian
Parms(25
)
.
</s>
<s>
Neither
Cox
nor
Parms
are
likely
to
make
the
final
roster
which
would
push
the
average
safety
age
to
31
.
</s>
<s>
Simply
by
adding
a
young
talented
player
to
the
mix
,
the
group
would
have
been
in
a
much
better
position
for
not
only
the
upcoming
season
but
for
the
future
as
well
.
</s>
<s>
Let
’s
say
that
Jackson
was
the
Panthers
guy
and
move
on
to
round
three
.
</s>
<s>
In
round
three
they
took
another
cornerback
,
with
players
like
Ronnie
Harrison
,
(
good
not
great
safety
prospect
)
Harrison
Phillips
,
(
defensive
line
pick
that
should
have
gone
higher
)
and
Arden
Key(yet
another
interesting
defensive
line
pick
,
although
he
has
a
few
too
many
question
marks
to
really
be
mad
about
them
passing
on
him
)
still
on
the
board
.
</s>
<s>
Any
of
those
three
would
have
been
picks
that
have
higher
upside
and
more
potential
to
help
the
team
long
term
than
Gaulden
.
</s>
<s>
Overall
I
was
pretty
disappointed
with
the
2nd
and
3rd
round
choices
.
</s>
<s>
Donte
Jackson
checks
all
of
the
physical
boxes
the
Panthers
look
for
in
a
cornerback
,
but
he
has
a
lot
of
room
to
grow
intellectually
.
</s>
<s>
He
is
terrible
at
anticipating
breaks
,
gets
left
behind
by
good
route
runners
and
almost
never
takes
the
right
angles
.
</s>
<s>
He
has
the
fluidity
,
burst
,
and
speed
to
match
elite
receivers
and
as
such
if
the
Panthers
can
hone
his
mental
game
he
will
make
a
big
impact
.
</s>
<s>
As
for
Rashaan
Gaulden
,
well
he
is
the
exact
opposite
.
</s>
<s>
He
plays
with
instincts
and
knowledge
but
lacks
burst
and
speed
.
</s>
<s>
Ian
Thomas
in
the
fourth
was
a
great
futures
pick
,
he
has
a
lot
of
potential
and
really
fits
the
prototype
the
Panthers
are
looking
for
at
tight
end
.
</s>
<s>
Marquis
Haynes
is
another
high
upside
pick
that
specializes
in
pass
rushing
and
could
make
an
immediate
impact
on
passing
downs
if
Addison
or
Peppers
get
injured
.
</s>
<s>
Carter
fits
the
mold
the
Panthers
love
at
linebacker
and
should
see
special
teams
snaps
.
</s>
<s>
Andre
Smith
is
basically
a
run-stopping
defender
.
</s>
<s>
I
could
see
him
being
used
as
a
box
safety
or
linebacker
,
but
his
best
chance
to
make
the
roster
would
be
as
a
safety
.
</s>
<s>
Kendrick
Norton
is
an
athletic
player
,
but
there
is
a
reason
he
was
available
in
the
7th
round
.
</s>
<s>
My
main
gripe
is
that
the
Panthers
took
Haynes
over
Shaquem
Griffin
who
in
my
opinion
proved
himself
in
college
and
at
the
combine
.
</s>
<s>
The
fact
that
Griffin
was
available
at
the
end
of
the
fourth
is
ridiculous
.
