<p>

Environmental
administrative
penalties
directly
affect
companies
’
revenues
by
disrupting
their
production
process
,
but
they
also
generate
negative
externalities
.
</s>
<s>
Companies
that
are
subject
to
environmental
penalties
are
ultimately
responsible
for
the
punishment
,
and
have
to
bear
the
related
costs
.
</s>
<s>
As
profit-seeking
entities
,
most
organizations
would
be
expected
to
react
by
undertaking
strategies
to
reduce
the
negative
effects
that
may
flow
from
unexpected
penalties
.

Previous
research
suggests
that
environmental
disclosures
in
annual
reports
can
be
integrated
as
an
environmental
strategy
or
used
as
a
self-serving
tool
to
alleviate
the
crisis
of
legitimacy
to
gain
legitimacy
from
stakeholders
.
</s>
<s>
Based
on
the
theory
of
legitimacy
,
some
researchers
found
that
companies
will
increase
environmental
disclosures
under
the
circumstances
of
being
prosecuted
by
the
Environmental
Protection
Agency
,
being
subject
to
regulatory
fines
,
or
facing
environmental
crises
or
accidents
.

<s>
Managers
can
also
rely
on
impression
management
strategies
to
obfuscate
the
company
’s
actual
performance
and
pursue
their
interests
.
</s>
<s>
The
researchers
argued
that
if
managers
want
to
conceal
negative
aspects
of
the
company
,
they
will
obfuscate
negative
outcomes
by
increasing
reading
difficulty
in
their
annual
reports
or
providing
less
complete
information
,
and
so
on
.

<s>
Then
,
under
the
environmental
administrative
penalty
,
how
might
environmental
information
disclosure
(
EID
)
be
affected
?

Revealing
the
effect
of
the
environmental
administrative
penalty
on
environmental
disclosure
is
the
key
to
understanding
the
disclosure
strategy
of
penalized
companies

In
China
,
the
Ministry
of
Environmental
Protection
encourages
listed
companies
to
disclose
environmental
information
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
companies
in
heavily
polluting
industries
are
required
to
disclose
some
specific
environmental
information
according
to
relevant
policies
.
</s>
<s>
Hence
,
mandatory
EID
is
only
a
disclosure
requirement
for
heavily
polluting
industries
.
</s>
<s>
Environmental
events
such
as
environmental
penalties
may
affect
voluntary
EID
or
mandatory
EID
,
but
few
studies
have
incorporated
the
voluntary
disclosure
and
mandatory
disclosure
together
to
addresses
the
effects
of
environmental
penalties
on
EID
.

Content
analysis
is
a
general
method
to
measure
EID

the
method
does
not

into

the

information
quality

measuring
the

disclosure

To
fill
these

gaps

stakeholders
understand
the
corporate
EID

We
seek

We

try
to
examine
the
impact
of
environmental

two
aspects
