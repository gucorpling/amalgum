<s>
I
was
nt
always
this
afraid
.
</s>
<s>
Seems
to
have
got
worse
as
I
got
older
.
</s>
<s>
I
recently
thought
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
do
the
5
mile
cliff
walk
from
Dunsevrick
Castle
to
the
Giants
Causeway
here
in
Northern
Ireland
.
</s>
<s>
Well
,
that
was
a
mistake
.
</s>
<s>
Firstly
,
I
was
on
my
own
.
</s>
<s>
I
did
nt
realise
the
path
would
be
quite
so
gut
churning
.
</s>
<s>
I
was
so
terrified
I
hardly
took
any
pics
of
the
admittedly
stunning
scenery
,
but
looking
at
it
made
my
head
spin
and
my
legs
all
wobbly
.
</s>
<s>
I
did
most
of
the
walk
looking
at
my
feet
.
</s>
<s>
It
really
was
nt
a
very
nice
experience
for
me
and
it
saddened
me
greatly
I
couldnt
enjoy
it
.
</s>
<s>
I
felt
stupid
to
be
honest
.
</s>
<s>
Now
I
have
had
my
rift
a
while
I
have
noticed
that
certain
heights
in
VR
evoke
the
exact
same
responses
in
my
body
that
real
heights
evoke
.
</s>
<s>
I
was
playing
Batman
when
an
unexpected
scene
transition
placed
me
right
on
top
and
on
the
edge
of
a
skyscraper
.
</s>
<s>
Well
fuck
me
,
my
legs
started
to
shake
,
my
heart
started
to
race
,
I
could
feel
perspiration
break
on
my
brow
.
</s>
<s>
I
took
a
step
back
a
little
further
from
the
edge
to
let
the
scene
play
out
.
</s>
<s>
I
felt
very
disorientated
.
</s>
<s>
I
kept
telling
my
brain
ITS
NOT
REAL
and
my
brain
stubbornly
refused
to
listen
.
</s>
<s>
I
tried
to
put
my
leg
forward
,
over
the
edge
and
touch
the
floor
but
,
and
this
shocked
me
,
I
couldnt
do
it
.
</s>
<s>
When
I
tried
every
fibre
of
my
being
was
screaming
&quot;
danger
&quot;
.
</s>
<s>
I
felt
absurd
and
terrified
at
the
same
time
.
</s>
<s>
It
was
bizarre
.
</s>
<s>
I
was
not
able
to
convince
myself
it
was
nt
real
.
</s>
<s>
I
am
super
interested
to
know
if
any
of
you
have
any
experience
in
this
field
or
if
its
just
too
early
for
any
type
of
studies
to
have
been
done
?
</s>
<s>
Would
love
to
be
a
research
subject
for
a
future
project
on
identifying
if
VR
could
help/hinder
someone
with
a
fear
of
heights
(
or
a
fear
of
falling
,
if
you
prefer
)
.
</s>
<s>
TLDR
:
VR
heights
evoke
the
exact
same
fear
response
in
me
as
real
heights
.
</s>
<s>
Any
experts
in
the
field
care
to
share
some
thoughts
or
have
any
studies
been
carried
out
?
EDIT
:
</s>
<s>
If
you
are
wondering
what
the
cliff
path
looked
like
,
wonder
no
more

VR
specifically
lone
echo
made
me
less
afraid
of
heights
than
I
used
to
be
.
</s>
<s>
I
often
work
on
ladders
and
lifts
and
The
weekend
before
I
got
VR
I
was
scared
of
heights
like
normal
,
and
then
like
a
week
later
I
got
on
a
lift
and
I
thought
nothing
of
it
,
like
I
completely
forgot
my
fear
of
heights
