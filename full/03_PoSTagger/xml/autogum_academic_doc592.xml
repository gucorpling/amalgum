High-rise
buildings
,
towers
,
and
long-span
bridges
need
to
be
designed
safely
and
reliably
under
the
dynamic
loads
of
earthquakes
,
wind
,
and
vehicles
.
</s>
<s>
Modern
structures
have
become
longer
and
higher
,
and
beautiful
and
economical
designs
have
also
become
possible
with
the
development
of
new
materials
and
construction
techniques
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
such
modern
structures
are
susceptible
to
excessive
structural
vibrations
,
which
may
induce
problems
in
structural
damage
or
even
the
loss
of
lives
.

<p>
<s>
Many
approaches
to
structural
vibration
control
(
passive
control
,
active
control
,
hybrid
control
,
etc.
)
have
been
proposed
over
the
past
decades
.
</s>
<s>
The
passive
control
techniques
generally
dissipate
the
vibration
energy
of
a
structural
system
or
change
its
dynamic
characteristics
.
</s>
<s>
The
passive
control
systems
provide
a
reliable
performance
.

<s>
However
,
it
cannot
be
adapted
by
various
load
conditions
.
</s>
<s>
On
the
other
hand
,
the
active
control
techniques
reduce
the
structural
vibration
using
external
control
forces
.

<s>
The
active
control
systems
can
be
adapted
by
various
external
forces
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
the
active
control
systems
have
several
problems
,
such
as
stability
and
power
requirements
.
</s>
<s>
The
hybrid
control
techniques
are
control
methods
that
combine
passive
and
active
control
to
improve
control
performance
and
safety
.
</s>
<s>
Among
these
,
structural
active
control
techniques
using
artificial
neural
networks
(
ANNs
)
were
introduced
in
the
mid-1990s
.
</s>
<s>
During
this
period
,
researchers
used
the
learning
ability
of
neural
networks
in
the
design
of
a
controller
to
control
structural
vibration
during
earthquakes
.
</s>
<s>
Many
researchers
have
presented
active
control
algorithms
using
neural
networks
in
civil
engineering
.
Chen
et
al.
</s>
<s>
presented
artificial
neural
networks
to
control
the
structural
response
of
a
10-story
San
Jose
apartment
building
to
an
earthquake
simulated
using
real
measured
data
.
</s>
<s>
Ghaboussi
and
Joghataie
conducted
a
computer
simulation
on
the
active
control
of
a
three-story
frame
structure
subjected
to
ground
excitations
.
</s>
<s>
They
used
an
emulator
neural
network
to
forecast
the
future
response
of
the
structure
from
the
response
in
the
previous
steps
.
</s>
<s>
Then
,
a
controller
neural
network
was
used
to
assess
(
train
)
the
relation
between
the
immediate
history
of
the
response
of
the
structure
and
the
actuator
.
</s>
<s>
Bani-Hani
and
Ghaboussi
applied
an
emulator
neural
network
and
a
trained
neuro-controller
of
a
linear
structure
to
active
control
of
the
nonlinear
structure
.
</s>
<s>
Nonlinearly
controlled
neural
networks
were
also
used
to
control
the
response
of
the
nonlinear
structure
.
</s>
<s>
They
then
compared
the
effectiveness
of
the
nonlinearly
trained
neuro-controller
with
that
of
the
linearly
trained
neuro-controller
and
found
that
a
trained
neuro-controller
can
successfully
control
the
response
of
nonlinear
structures
.
</s>
<s>
Bani-Hani
and
Ghaboussi
applied
the
previously
developed
neuro-control
algorithms
to
the
benchmark
problem
of
an
active
tendon
system
.
Liut
et
al.
showed
the
applicability
of
neural
network
control
of
civil
structures
subjected
to
seismic
excitations
using
the
force-matching
concept
.
</s>
<s>
Kim
and
Lee
proposed
a
new
ANN
learning
algorithm
using
an
objective
function
and
sensitivity
to
solve
the
problems
of
the
conventional
ANN
,
which
has
shortcomings
such
as
a
longer
learning
time
and
the
need
to
predetermine
the
desired
structural
response
.
Cho
et
al.
presented
an
algorithm
for
selecting
the
optimal
number
of
neurons
in
the
hidden
layer
of
a
neural
network
controller
based
on
a
measure
of
the
network
performance
and
applied
neural
controllers
to
single-degree-of-freedom
(
SDOF
)
and
two-DOF
systems
subjected
to
the
El
Centro
earthquakes
.
</s>
<s>
Generally
,
a
supervised
learning
algorithm
was
adopted
for
ANN
learning
since
an
ANN
was
used
to
control
the
response
of
structures
during
the
earthquakes
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
Madan
suggested
a
possible
alternative
approach
to
learning
in
a
neural
network
for
the
active
control
of
structures
without
the
supervision
of
a
teacher
.
</s>
<s>
Lee
,
in
his
dissertation
,
presented
a
neuro-controller
to
control
the
vibration
of
a
structure
using
the
state
vectors
of
the
structural
response
as
inputs
.
