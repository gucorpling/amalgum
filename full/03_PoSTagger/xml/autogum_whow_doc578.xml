Learn
in
the
Modern
Age
Using
Connectivism
</head>
Connectivism
is
a
modern
learning
theory
that
explores
how
learning
is
not
individualistic
but
can
actually
reside
outside
of
ourselves
and
be
a
part
of
a
bigger
picture
through
the
connections
in
a
person
’s
network
.
</s>
<s>
We
learn
from
others
,
and
this
theory
focuses
on
how
networks
are
made
and
expanded
.
