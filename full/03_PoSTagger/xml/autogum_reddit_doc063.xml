My

coworker

<s>
I
have
been
working
for
this
particular
company
for
almost
9
years
.
</s>
<s>
When
I
first
started
,
I
was
very
green
,
so
I
required
a
fair
amount
of
training
in
all
aspects
that
this
company
specializes
in
.
</s>
<s>
It
's
a
very
male
dominated
industry
,
so
she
and
the
admin
lady
are
the
only
ladies
at
this
company
other
than
myself
.
</s>
<s>
When
I
first
started
,
she
was
going
through
some
personal
issues
and
her
negative
feelings
were
seeping
into
the
work
life
.
</s>
<s>
Long
story
short
,
she
was
not
a
nice
person
to
me
at
the
beginning
.
</s>
<s>
But
as
the
personal
issues
disappeared
or
were
solved
,
her
attitude
changed
a
fair
amount
.
</s>
<s>
By
that
I
mean
that
she
became
pleasant
enough
to
not
consider
quitting
on
a
daily
basis
because
of
her
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
one
thing
did
not
change
throughout
the
years
:
her
cheapness
and
ingratitude
.
</s>
<s>
A
favor
I
’ve
done
for
her
quite
a
few
times
over
the
years
is
give
her
rides
to
random
places
.
</s>
<s>
I
never
get
as
much
as
a
please
or
thank
you
,
let
alone
a
beer
or
offered
some
money
.
</s>
<s>
Now
,
this
is
something
I
would
n’t
say
about
(
or
expect
it
from
)
someone
who
offers
at
least
some
amount
of
reciprocity
,
but
there
is
no
reciprocity
.
</s>
<s>
Ever
.
</s>
<s>
In
2017
,
she
moved
outside
the
city
to
a
town
at
least
an
hour
away
from
work
.
</s>
<s>
She
typically
works
from
home
at
least
one
day
a
week
,
and
stays
with
friends
during
other
days
in
order
to
minimize
the
amount
of
commutes
.
</s>
<s>
Except
now
the
friends
’
situations
have
changed
and
my
coworker
is
looking
for
other
people
to
use
for
sleeping
.
</s>
<s>
I
say
&quot;
use
&quot;
because
she
freely
admitted
that
's
what
she
's
doing
.
</s>
<s>
As
you
may
have
guessed
,
I
’m
one
of
those
“
lucky
”
people
.
</s>
<s>
I
live
with
my
fiancé
,
who
when
asked
what
his
thoughts
were
on
the
request
,
gave
a
resounding
no
–
he
hated
having
roommates
.
</s>
<s>
Plus
,
he
knows
my
coworker
personally
.

<s>
So
here
we
are
now
–
</s>
<s>
I
spent
the
entire
weekend
stressing
and
being
anxious
about
how
to
say
no
.
</s>
<s>
I
’m
very
worried
that
she
will
make
being
coworkers
awkward
and
will
revert
to
being
mean
and
rude
to
me
.
</s>

Any
thoughts

how

word
my
declining

request
