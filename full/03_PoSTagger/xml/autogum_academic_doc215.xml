Introduction

<p>
<s>
The
three-dimensional
(
3D
)
surface-enhanced
Raman
spectroscopy
(
SERS
)
substrate
is
a
powerful
analytical
method
with
applications
in
the
fields
of
medicine
,
environmental
monitoring
,
and
spectral
imaging
.
</s>
<s>
Compared
to
two-dimensional
(
2D
)
SERS
substrates
,
the
3D
SERS
substrate
offers
two
unique
advantages
.
</s>
<s>
Specifically
,
because
a
3D
SERS
substrate
provides
a
larger
surface
area
and
a
higher
density
of
so-called
“
hot
spot
”
zones
along
the
vertical
direction
compared
to
a
flat
2D
substrate
,
the
former
allows
increased
sensitivity
and
greater
enhancement
.
</s>
<s>
The
other
advantage
is
that
a
3D
SERS
substrate
has
a
more
wettable
nanostructure
,
which
will
improve
the
SERS
sensitivity
and
repeatability
.
</s>
<s>
A
3D
SERS
substrate
is
typically
composed
of
a
combination
of
nanowires
and
metallic
nanoparticles
.
</s>
<s>
The
metallic
nanoparticles
act
as
sensing
units
to
generate
hot
spots
in
association
with
localized
surface
plasmon
resonance
,
which
greatly
enhances
the
extent
of
Raman
scattering
.
</s>
<s>
The
nanowires
serve
as
the
backbone
of
the
3D
structure
and
the
nanowire
array
also
serves
to
further
increase
the
repeatability
of
the
Raman
signal
due
to
its
periodic
structure
.
</s>
<s>
As
an
example
,
Oh
et
al.
reported
a
3D
SERS
substrate
comprising
a
glass
nanopillar
array
with
silver
nanoislands
.
</s>
<s>
This
substrate
was
found
to
have
a
high
enhancement
factor
(
EF
)
and
increased
the
SERS
signals
by
more
than
one
order
of
magnitude
compared
to
a
2D
SERS
substrate
.
</s>
<s>
This
improved
performance
was
attributed
to
the
ability
of
the
silver
nanoislands
to
generate
a
high
density
of
hot
spots
on
both
the
top
and
side
of
the
glass
nanopillar
array
.
Park
et
al.
used
an
Ar+
plasma
to
treat
a
polyethylene
terephthalate
surface
to
form
polymeric
nanopillars
.
</s>
<s>
Gold
nanoparticles
were
subsequently
generated
by
evaporation
to
create
a
3D
gold-rich
nanopillar
structure
that
induced
the
self-clustering
of
plasmonic
nanogaps
due
to
capillary
forces
and
increased
the
concentration
of
analyte
on
the
substrate
surface
.
</s>
<s>
In
2018
,
Wang
et
al.
developed
a
3D
gold-rich
nanopillar
plasmonic
substrate
for
use
in
SERS
analyses
that
anchored
mycotoxins
via
nanotags
.
</s>
<s>
Their
work
determined
that
the
surface
tension
induced
a
leaning
effect
in
groups
of
two
or
three
adjacent
nanopillars
that
resulted
in
the
self-assembly
of
hot
spots
,
which
,
in
turn
,
significantly
enhanced
the
SERS
signal
.

<s>
Some
SERS
substrates
,
typically
containing
materials
such
as
TiO2
and
ZnO
,
can
be
reused
following
a
self-cleaning
process
based
on
the
photocatalytic
degradation
of
residual
analyte
.
</s>
<s>
Following
the
SERS
analysis
,
such
substrates
are
exposed
to
either
ultraviolet
(
UV
)
or
visible
(
VIS
)
light
to
degrade
residual
analyte
molecules
,
after
which
ions
are
removed
using
water
wash
.
</s>
<s>
Based
on
this
procedure
,
the
refreshed
SERS
substrate
can
be
reused
several
times
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
the
structure
and
morphology
of
a
metal
layer
deposited
on
a
3D
structure
are
difficult
to
control
,
which
results
in
a
relatively
low
SERS
enhancement
.

<s>
In
the
present
work
,
we
developed
a
simple
means
of
fabricating
the
3D
SERS
substrates
,
based
on
coating
silicon
nanowire
arrays
with
silver
nanoparticles
(
Ag-NP/Si-NW
)
.
</s>
<s>
The
morphology
of
these
SERS
substrates
,
which
is
critical
to
their
performance
,
could
be
controlled
using
metal-assisted
chemical
etching
(
MACE
)
followed
by
photonic
reduction
.
</s>
<s>
Herein
,
we
discuss
the
formation
of
silver
nanoparticles
via
photonic
reduction
and
their
contribution
to
the
SERS
enhancement
.
</s>
<s>
These
3D
SERS
substrates
are
also
shown
to
be
reusable
after
employing
UV
radiation
to
degrade
dye
molecules
following
an
analysis
.
</s>
<s>
Finally
,
these
3D
SERS
substrates
were
applied
for
the
analysis
of
dopamine
(
DA
)
to
verify
that
they
provide
both
high
sensitivity
and
reliability
.
