The

six

Interestingly

the
highly
conserved

also
found

showing
overall
97
%
similarity
at
the
amino
acid
sequence
level
.
</s>
<s>
The
polyketide
synthase
(
PKS
)
encoded
by
the
<hi rend="italic">
sol1

is
classified
as
a
highly-reducing
PKS
and
is
thought
to
be
involved
in
biosynthesis
of
the
precursor
prosolanapyrone
,
an
α-pyrone
with
an
unsaturated
alkyl
chain
.
</s>
<s>
The
production
of
such
linear
α-pyrones
has
been
reported
in
<hi rend="italic">
Al

solani
</hi>

related
fungi
,
but
the
difference
in
solanapyrone
biosynthesis
from
other
linear
α-pyrones
is
the
involvement
of
a
Diels

Alder
reaction
catalyzed
by
<hi rend="italic">

to
form
a
decalin
ring
from
the
unsaturated

</p>
<p>
<s>
As
mentioned
above
,
solanapyrones
have
been
considered
a

their
strong
phytotoxicity

However
,
genetic

the
production

The
expression
patterns
of
the
Diels

Alderase
gene
in
<hi rend="italic">
A.

also
supported
this
observation

the

expressed

not

Furthermore
,
solanapyrones

on
chickpea
straw

interestingly
,
xylan

the
saprobic

stage-specific
production

<s>
Given
the
observed
antimicrobial
activities

solanapyrones
produced

diverse
ecological
niches

solanapyrones

play
a
role
