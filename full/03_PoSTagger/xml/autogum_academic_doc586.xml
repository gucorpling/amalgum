Introduction

</head>
<p>
<s>
At
present
,
a
large
amount
of
natural
gas
hydrate
(
NGH
)
resources
have
been
explored
all
over
the
world
.
</s>
<s>
The
carbon
content
of
NGH
is
twice
that
of
other
fossil
energy
,
making
NGH
an
important
potential
energy
source
.
</s>
<s>
NGH
is
a
kind
of
white
crystalline
solid
in
porous
media
that
usually
forms
and
remains
stable
under
the
favorable
conditions
of
low
temperature
and
high
pressure
,
that
is
,
2
–
4
°C
and
about
20
MPa
.
</s>
<s>
When
the
temperature
increases
or
the
pressure
decreases
to
a
certain
extent
,
the
hydrate
will
decompose
.
</s>
<s>
In
the
process
of
pressure
drop
,
NGH
in
sediments
begins
to
decompose
rapidly
.
</s>
<s>
The
gas
production
rate
of
NGH
increases
with
the
decrease
in
decomposition
pressure
.
</s>
<s>
Previous
tests
have
shown
that
gas
production
rate
also
increases
with
the
increase
of
test
temperature
.
</s>
<s>
Because
of
the
metastable
behavior
of
NGH
,
it
is
still
a
challenge
to
describe
the
in
situ
occurrence
of
NGH
via
core
samples
.
</s>
<s>
To
enable
modeling
of
gas
hydrate-bearing
sediment
layers
as
a
natural
gas
reservoir
,
and
to
realize
the
large-scale
exploitation
,
it
is
necessary
to
fully
understand
its
geological
structure
characteristics
under
the
condition
of
gas
hydrate
bearing
sediments
in
situ
.
</s>
<s>
At
present
,
because
there
is
no
feasible
solution
to
detect
and
analyze
the
gas
hydrate
in
the
seabed
under
the
in
situ
conditions
,
it
is
still
necessary
to
investigate
the
gas
hydrate
morphology
and
formation
mechanism
via
x-ray
micro-computed
tomography
in
3D
.
</s>
<s>
In
addition
,
it
is
still
necessary
to
collect
long-column
high-pressure
gas
hydrate
cores
from
the
seabed
,
cut
them
into
small
sections
,
and
transfer
them
under
the
conditions
in
which
the
pressure
and
temperature
are
maintained
,
thus
obtaining
the
analyses
of
various
physical
and
chemical
characteristics
in
the
laboratory
.
</s>

<s>
The
NGH
exploration
mainly
contains
subsea
pressure
and
temperature
core
sampling
,
shipboard
core
sample
pressure-retaining
and
transferring
,
and
laboratory
analysis
of
core
samples
.
</s>
<s>
So
far
,
the
pressure
and
temperature
sampling
technology
of
core
samples
has
been
developed
well
.
</s>
<s>
After
the
core
samples
are
drilled
from
seabed
and
transferred
to
shipboard
,
the
pressure-retaining
and
transfer
system
is
used
to
perform
some
subsequent
processing
on
the
core
sample
.
</s>
<s>
There
are
two
mainstream
devices
that
can
realize
these
functions
.
</s>
<s>
The
pressure
core
analysis
and
transfer
system
(
PCATS
)
,
developed
by
Geotek
Ltd.
(
Daventry
,
UK
)
in
the
HYACINTH
program
,
can
realize
the
following
operations
at
in
situ
pressure
:
1
)
nondestructively
testing
the
core
,
2
)
cutting
the
core
into
sections
,
3
)
transferring
the
core
sections
into
and
out
of
storage
chambers
,
4
)
controlling
the
core
motion
for
third-party
analysis
.
</s>
<s>
The
pressure
core
characterization
tools
(
PCCTs
)
developed
by
the
Georgia
Institute
of
Technology
,
based
on
original
sample
detection
system
instrument
pressure
test
chamber
(
IPTC
)
,
have
more
test
chambers
,
such
as
a
direct
shear
chamber
(
DSC
)
,
bio-reactor
chambers
(
BIO
)
,
and
a
controlled
depressurization
chamber
(
CDC
)
,
having
similar
functions
to
PCAT
.
</s>
<s>
Both
PCATS
and
PCCTs
can
maintain
the
NGH
core
sample
at
low
temperature
and
in
situ
pressure
;
however
,
these
devices
depend
on
a
rather
passive
method
that
must
set
the
ambient
temperature
of
the
operation
room
to
affect
the
temperature
of
samples
.
</s>
<s>
The
method
described
above
not
only
fails
to
react
quickly
and
effectively
to
temperature
fluctuations
,
but
also
keeps
the
operating
room
at
a
temperature
close
to
4
°C
,
making
the
environment
too
adverse
for
the
operator
to
work
with
for
long
hours
.
</s>
<s>
In
addition
,
there
are
few
papers
focusing
on
temperature
control
issues
in
core
samples
during
transfer
and
analysis
.
</s>

<s>
The
first-generation
core
sample
pressure-retaining
and
transfer
device
developed
by
Zhejiang
University
in
2016
can
realize
the
functions
as
PCATS
.
</s>
<s>
Based
on
previous
development
,
this
paper
considers
the
PMTCD
,
a
part
of
new
generation
NGH
core
sample
pressure-retaining
and
transfer
devices
,
and
analyzes
the
causes
of
temperature
increase
during
the
pressure
maintenance
of
the
sample
.
</s>
<s>
By
designing
a
chiller
and
a
thermoelectrical
refrigeration
device
,
the
seawater
flowing
into
the
sample
cylinder
is
cooled
separately
before
and
after
being
pressurized
,
and
the
temperature
control
effect
is
explored
,
effectively
preventing
the
decomposition
and
deterioration
of
the
NGH
sample
due
to
temperature
increase
during
the
transfer
process
.
