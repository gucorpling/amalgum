How
much
should
I
charge
for
my
first
professionally
built
website
?

Text
in

is
the
actual
functionality

the

you

I
've
been
doing
web
dev
as
a
hobby
for
about
three
years
here
and
there
and
I
've
learned
a
lot
and
I
think
I
'm
pretty
good
.
</s>
<s>
I
've
built
things
from
chat
rooms
to
blogs
with
a
custom
CMS
to
a
custom
social
media
site
like
twitter
and
also
a
couple
sites
for
the
rec
clubs
I
'm
in
.
</s>
<s>
A
family
friend
has
a
business
and
he
accepted
a
new
contract
.
</s>
<s>
What
they
're
currently
doing
on
the
parent
companies
website
is
there
's
a
link
to
download
an
order
form
created
in
excel
with
a
bunch
of
fields
and
stuff
.
</s>
<s>
The
customer
downloads
the
excel
sheet
,
fills
it
out
,
emails
it
to
the
person
(
in
this
case
,
my
family
friend
)
and
he
has
an
invoice
created
using
the
info
from
the
excel
sheet
and
he
emails
it
back
to
them
.
</s>
<s>
So
this
is
pretty
inefficient
in
my
eyes
and
he
wanted
it
to
be
automated
and
done
online
so
I
did
just
that
.
</s>
<s>
I
created
a
website
where
there
is
n't
really
an
amazing
front
end
(
just
slapped
materialize
onto
it
)
since
they
will
come
to
this
website
after
visiting
the
parent
companies
website
which
would
mean
they
already
intend
to
order
stuff
.
</s>
<hi rend="bold">
<s>
So
there
's
just
a
bunch
of
fields
where
you
fill
out
all
your
info
,
pick
the
stuff
you
wanna
order
,
when
you
need
it
by
,
if
you
wanna
make
any
changes
to
each
item
,
how
much
of
each
item
you
need
,
etc
,
and
finally
you
click
submit
and
all
the
data
is
taken
,
and
parsed
through
where
I
put
it
through
to
an
HTML
template
I
have
made
which
then
I
convert
to
a
PDF
and
email
to
the
customer
and
my
family
friend
.
</s>
<s>
So
it
just
saves
all
the
work
of
the
user
having
to
download
and
fill
a
file
and
send
it
to
my
friend
and
then
wait
for
them
to
respond
with
the
invoice
and
etc.

</hi>
<s>
How
much
would
something
like
this
cost
to
make
?
I
ca
n't
really
count
the
hours
because
this
sort
of
stuff
just
intrigues
me
so
throughout
the
day
I
'm
thinking
of
how
I
could
do
it
in
my
mind
,
and
when
I
'm
on
the
bus
or
train
I
'm
googling
different
packages
and
trying
to
learn
ways
to
do
what
needs
to
be
done
.
</s>
<s>
However
if
I
had
to
guess
,
from
beginning
to
end
I
did
this
in
about
a
week
and
this
was
my
main
focus
throughout
this
whole
week
.
</s>
<s>
So
yeah
,
how
much
would
be
a
reasonable
amount
to
charge
him
if
he
was
just
a
regular
customer
asking
for
a
website
to
be
made
?
(
I
'm
probably
going
to
take
off
a
good
%
of
it
since
he
's
a
family
friend
who
's
helped
my
family
a
lot
)

Ask
your
self
what
you
want
to
make
a
year
,
divide
by
52
.
</s>
<s>
That
’s
what
you
charge
for
one
weeks
work
.
</s>

<p>
<s>
So
if
I
want
to
make
100k
a
year
then
I
’d
charge
1923
for
the
job
.
