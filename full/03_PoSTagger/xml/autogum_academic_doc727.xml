Reflexive

Design
for
sustainable
social
change
,
according
to
scholars

needs

pay
diligent
attention

address
contextual
issues

disparities
experienced
by
these
underserved
populations

Such
design
engagements
,
by
paying
attention

social

political

moral
and
ecological
dimensions

envision
a
just
society
that
promotes
cultural
diversity

equal
opportunity

well
as
fight
against
all
kinds
of
disparities

</s>
<s>
In
global
South
contexts
,
many
designers
oftentimes
not
only
take
their
privileges
for
granted
in
an
unreflexive
way
,
but
also
their
expertise
oftentimes
lacks
contextual
knowledge
(
including
historical
,
social
and
cultural
understanding
)
,
and
primarily
emphasize
technical
knowledge

Future
of
design
could
imagine
and
potentially
ensure
engaged
interaction

designers

non-designers

local
epistemologies

integrate
technical

Thus
,
effective
design
initiatives

sustainable
social

essentially
contingent

our
understanding

our
commitment

meaningfully
address

such

Some
of

While
the

principles

aspects

my

emanated
three
thoughts
and/or
reflections

As
a

it
is
crucial

de-construct
my
embodied

as
unexamined
presumptions

Apart

Scholars
have
noted

critical

As

scholars
have
argued
in
favor
of
participatory

,
where
the
designers
and
community
members
work
hand
in
hand
as
co-researchers

reduce

expertise

to
build
avenues

empowerment

change

Questioning
the

critical
scholars

cultural
participants

organizing
force

entity

community
mobilization

</s>
<s>
Furthermore

scholars
have
