So
as
an
answer
to
the
question
,
I
would
find
it
unlikely
that
such
a
behaviour
would
evolve
,
but
it
's
not
known
yet
.

Ants
generally
avoided
the
peroxide
if
they
were
healthy
,
but
in
some
circumstances
might
they
try
to
build
resistance
against
infection
in
advance
?

Also
not
known

unfortunately

<s>
That
said
,
there
is
a
very
interesting
study
about
resin
collection
in
ants
.

<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood%20ants">
<s>
Wood
ants
</ref>
collect
tree-resin
,
which
has
anti-microbial
properties
.
</s>
<s>
They
collect
this
even
if
not
infected
,
and
when
you
infect
them
,
they
do
n't
collect
more
of
the
resin
than
normal
.
</s>
<s>
So
basically
it
seems
like
they
collect
it
in
order
to
keep
diseases
out
of
the
nest
,
so
they
stop
the
disease
before
it
can
actually
infect
them
.

There

Dalial
Freitak

who

paper
is
currently
running
tests
with
Ph.D.
student
Siiri
Fuchs
(
who
is
also
on
the
paper

with
other
substances
to
see

any
have
the

effect

H2O2

hydrogen

Once
the
behaviour
has
been
well
described
in
this
species
of
ant
,
I
might
do
a
comparison
with
other
species
.
</s>
<s>
For
example
,
once
we
find
the
source
of
the
medicine
in
nature
...
would
species
without
access
to
this
source
also
have
evolved
the
same
behaviour
in
the
lab
?

And
if
so

where
would

get
it

can
ants
medicate

I
still
have
some
questions
left
unanswered
from
my
Ph.D.
work
related
to
how
ants
recognize
who
is
a
friend
and
who
is
n't
.
</s>
<s>
I
also
started
collaborating
with
Prof.
Michael
Poulsen
from
the
University
of
Copenhagen
on
immunity
in
fungus-growing
termites
,
as
well
as
their
chemical
recognition
abilities
.
</s>
<s>
Furthermore
we
're
working
on
social
parasitism
in
wood-ants
(
ants
have
lots
of
animals
exploiting
the
nest
for
shelter
and
resources
,
which
all
somehow
have
to
get
in
to
the
fortress
without
getting
killed
)
