Sport

Likewise

Sport
participation

Getting
and
keeping
youth
involved
in
sport
is
public
health
issue

Given
that
sport
requires
coaches

parents
,
they
are
important
to
study

<s>
The
increasing
academic
interest
in
understanding
the
nature
of
coach
and
parental
involvement
in
youth
sport
has
been
highlighted
in
many
studies
.

<s>
Research
has
illuminated
both
positive
and
negative
forms
of
the
sport
experience
from
the
perspectives
of
coaches
;
parents

and
youth
participants
.

<s>
One
less
understood
aspect
,
however

surrounds
the
potentially
conflicting
role
of
all
three
participants
,
namely
,
the
athletic
triangle
.
</s>
<s>
The
athletic
triangle
consists
of
the
coach

and
parent

The
relationships
within
this
triad
can
have
a
significant
impact
on
the
overall
development

<p>
<s>
Motivated
participation
of
coaches
,
athletes
,
and
parents
in
youth
sports
can
be
viewed
as
an
effective
educational
system

</s>
<s>
This
system
can
be
described
as
a
continuous
process
of
positive
interaction
among
all
three
members
of
the
system
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
recent
research
findings
have
shown
that
such
a
three-dimensional
educational
system
has
been
underdeveloped
and
lacks
positivism
,
and
its
effectiveness
is
limited
.
</s>
<s>
The
athletic
triangle
can
influence
the
young
athlete
’s
decision
to
participate
in
sport
,
to
remain
in
the
sport
,
and
to
pursue
a
sporting
career
.
</s>
<s>
For
example
,
parents
play
a
major
role
in
a
child
’s
athletic
development
and
are
members
of
the
athletic
triangle
.
</s>
<s>
Close
and
solid
relationships
between
children
and
parents
ensure
a
consistent
feeling
of
security
and
confidence
.
</s>
<s>
Mutual
parent
–
athlete
trust
,
respect
,
belief
,
support
,
cooperation
,
communication
,
and
understanding
are
considered
among
the
most
important
relationship
components
that
contribute
to
athlete
performance
success
and
satisfaction

</s>
<s>
By
contrast
,
parental
pressure
is
found
in
sports
with
parent
demonstration
of
excessively
high
expectations
by
criticizing
children
following
competitions
,
punishing
them
,
and
“
withdrawing
love
”
when
performances
do
not
meet
their
expectations
.
</s>
<s>
Perceptions
of
these
types
of
behaviors
have
been
associated
with
negative
aspects
of
children
’s
sporting
experiences
,
such
as
fear
of
failure
,
precompetitive
anxiety
,
burnout
,
and
dropout
.

<s>
Regarding
the
other
adult
in
the
athletic
triad
,
the
coach
is
one
of
the
main
figures
in
sports
with
direct
influence
on
athletes

participation

</s>
<s>
Coaches
are
not

expected

emotionally

<s>
To
better
understand
the
coach
–
athlete
–
parent
relationship

the
athlete
decisions

sport

the
authors
drew

attachment
theory

The
theory
states

early
experiences

parents
)
influence

future
development

close
relationships

<s>
A
central
tenet
of
attachment
theory
is
the
notion
that
early
childhood
lays
the
foundations
for
the
development

life

A
close
and
secure
relationship

parents
transforms

contexts

The
parent
–
child

relationship
model
transforms

a
basis

development

other
close
relationships

<s>
In
a
long-term
athlete
development
in
sport

the
athlete
becomes
attached

forms
a
new
type

<s>
Active
participation
of
all
three
members

the
athletic
triad

coaches
,
athletes

is
important
and
necessary
for
the
positive
development

<s>
Such
a
three-dimensional
educational
system
may
be
more
effective
if

more
actively
and
positively
involved

children

not
pressed

The
harmonization

the
main
challenge

further
research

Therefore

the
overarching
theme

to
increase
understanding

parent
interaction
in
youth

interrelationships
between
them

to
gain
an
understanding

consider
