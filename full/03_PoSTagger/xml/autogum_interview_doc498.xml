</hi>
In
temperament
,
I
'm
best
suited
to
the
writing
,
but
it
is
n't
what
I
enjoy
the
most
.
</s>
<s>
I
mean
,
I
really
enjoy
acting
,
because
it
's
a
lot
of
fun
.
</s>
<s>
But
there
's
a
certain
self-involvement
that
's
required
with
acting
,
and
a
certain
thick
skin
that
I
just
do
n't
have
.
</s>
<s>
I
'm
much
more
a
writer
,
because
I
can
have
a
homebody
quality
,
and
I
can
be
in
the
house
;
I
can
be
away
from
people
.
</s>
<s>
I
have
sort
of
a
problem
in
that
I
like
people
a
lot
,
and
I
really
hate
people
,
and
so
it
's
kind
of
difficult
to
decide
where
I
'm
at
on
any
given
day
.

DS

When
you
tackled
your
first
novel
,
was
there
ever
a
time
when
you
were
like
,
'
I
do
n't
even
know
how
people
get
an
entire
novel
out
of
their
heads

and
you
had
to
actually
sit
down
and
plot
it
?

How
did

EB

</hi>
Well
,
my
first
prose
book
was
n't
a
novel
;
it
's
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novella">
novella

called

<hi rend="italic">
Notes
from
the
Underground

.
</s>
<s>
The
way
I
did
that
--
and
this
is
a
long
time
ago
--
I
wrote
it
by
creating
diary
entries
and
just
filling
them
in
every
day
.
</s>
<s>
So
every
day
,
I
would
give
myself
the
assignment
of
writing
a
diary
entry
for
this
character
.
</s>
<s>
And
I
'd
say
that
that
's
pretty
much
the
easiest
way
to
sit
down
and
write
a
book
,
because
you
say
to
yourself
every
day
,
&quot;
I
'm
going
to
write
one
of
these
things
,
&quot;
and
one
day
it
'll
be
long
,
and
another
day
it
'll
be
short
.
</s>
<s>
I
eventually
found
out
what
that
character
was
about
.
</s>
<s>
My
current
book
I
'm
writing
now
is
also
written
in
journal
entry
form
,
although
in
a
much
more
complex
way
.

When
I
sat
down
to
write
<hi rend="italic">
Mall
</hi>
,
which
was
really
my
first
novel
,
I
wrote
it
by
understanding
that
I
'm
not
the
most
sophisticated
prose
writer
.
</s>
<s>
I
had
been
writing
a
lot
of
screenplays
and
even
some
television
,
so
I
had
learned
a
lot
about
how
to
tell
a
story
.
</s>
<s>
I
decided
to
create
a
very
clear
spine
on
which
to
hang
a
lot
of
things
,
a
very
clear
arc
.
</s>
<s>
That
arc
was
kind
of
a
thriller
.
</s>
<hi rend="italic">
<s>
Mall
</hi>
is
about
a
guy
who
's
a
disgruntled
employee
and
he
goes
to
a
shopping
mall
to
shoot
the
place
up
.
</s>
<s>
And
it
was
just
kind
of
strange
,
because
since
I
've
written
this
book
this
keeps
happening

This
happened
a

days
