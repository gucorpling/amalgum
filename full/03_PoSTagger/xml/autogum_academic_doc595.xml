Introduction

</head>
<p>
<s>
With
a
global
population
expected
to
reach
9
or
even
10
billion
by
the
year
2050
and
natural
resources
for
food
production
already
scarce
in
many
parts
of
the
world
,
humankind
is
facing
a
serious
challenge
:
how
can
we
feed
everybody
?
</s>
<s>
The
scientific
community
has
presented
various
strategies
for
using
current
resources
to
increase
the
sustainability
of
food
production
without
using
more
agricultural
land
.
</s>
<s>
The
main
strategies
are
dietary
changes
to
plant
based
alternatives
,
improvements
in
technology
and
management
and
reduction
in
food
waste
(
e.
g.
,
)
.
</s>
<s>
These
measures
call
for
changes
on
the
part
of
both
industries/retailers
and
people
involved
as
customers
and
as
scientists
.
</s>
<s>
We
investigate
several
current
trends
in
European
thinking
about
food
,
seeking
to
link
the
various
factors
involved
in
consumer
acceptance
of
new
dietary
elements
that
are
of
interest
from
a
sustainability
standpoint
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
The
process
of
industry
innovation
is
closely
linked
to
the
availability
of
new
products
on
the
market
.
</s>
<s>
To
create
consumer
demand
,
new
food
product
launches
must
combine
technological
innovation
with
a
series
of
social
and
environmental
changes
,
large
and
small
.
</s>
<s>
Indeed
,
innovation
is
born
from
the
continuous
interaction
between
the
food
industry
and
the
institutional
and
social
context
in
which
it
operates
:
it
is
an
opportunity
to
meet
the
needs
of
citizen-consumers
,
while
also
responding
to
emerging
social
challenges
such
as
environmental
sustainability
and
animal
welfare
.
</s>
<s>
By
contrast
,
research
on
market
trends
in
food
choices
shows
that
there
is
some
resistance
to
innovations
and
confirms
the
stability
of
decision-making
processes
that
proceed
from
inertia
.
</s>
<s>
Consumers
themselves
are
the
biggest
obstacle
to
innovation
in
the
food
sector
.
</s>
<s>
By
definition
,
an
innovative
food
entails
a
change
from
known
characteristics
,
and
this
tends
to
clash
with
habit-bound
consumer
behavior
.
</s>
<s>
This
makes
many
innovations
in
the
agri-food
sector
incremental
rather
than
radical
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
As
the
literature
shows
,
however
,
it
is
not
always
easy
to
distinguish
between
cases
where
consumers
’
resistance
can
be
circumvented
by
improving
specific
product
characteristics
,
and
cases
where
resistance
is
more
deeply
rooted
,
as
it
is
linked
to
specific
ideologies
about
food
and
is
thus
not
readily
overcome
.
</s>
<s>
Accordingly
,
it
can
be
useful
to
analyze
the
various
facets
of
food
neophobia
,
or
“
human
unwillingness
to
consume
unfamiliar
food
”
,
which
cuts
across
the
technological
challenges
now
facing
the
European
food
industry
.
</s>
<s>
As
food
neophobia
can
be
elicited
by
a
wide
range
of
foods
in
an
increasingly
demanding
and
specialized
food
market
,
it
can
be
a
major
obstacle
for
producers
and
consumers
alike
.
</s>
<s>
Knowing
which
products
are
generally
associated
with
neophobia
,
and
which
details
of
the
products
trigger
it
is
important
because
it
can
provide
the
industry
with
insight
into
how
to
overcome
or
curb
sales
resistance
.
</s>
<s>
It
is
equally
important
to
understand
whether
food
neophobia
is
just
an
extreme
situation
,
a
clinical
condition
consisting
of
unjustified
rejection
of
unfamiliar
food
products
,
with
no
logical
justification
for
the
adverse
emotional
reaction
of
disgust
and
refusal
,
or
whether
it
reveals
an
ingrained
attitude
that
may
extend
to
a
wide
range
of
situations
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
We
will
take
a
closer
look
at
neophobia
in
order
to
analyze
the
construct
,
understand
the
instruments
whereby
it
is
measured
,
and
explore
the
situations
to
which
it
applies
.
</s>
<s>
In
fact
,
neophobia
is
marked
by
an
underlying
“
mistrust
”
of
foods
that
have
never
been
tasted
,
and
is
probably
linked
to
a
pre-coding
of
food
in
a
rigid
visual
schema
.
</s>
<s>
Above
all
,
however
,
it
is
associated
with
food
’s
olfactory
impact
,
which
jeopardizes
its
acceptability
.
</s>
<s>
This
clinically
extreme
condition
mainly
affects
children
and
elderly
adults
,
and
thus
does
not
seem
to
involve
people
who
are
active
purchasers-consumers
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
This
review
of
studies
on
the
subject
highlights
some
of
the
limitations
of
using
the
term
indiscriminately
to
explain
consumer
choices
in
general
.
</s>
<s>
The
literature
seems
to
show
that
feelings
of
“
fear
”
or
“
disgust
”
towards
the
new
in
many
cases
reflect
very
specific
ideological
or
value
choices
,
which
may
cause
the
individual
to
take
up
positions
in
favor
of
environmentalism
,
animal
welfare
or
ecology
or
simply
because
an
individual
is
clinging
to
tradition
.
</s>
<s>
Thus
,
we
can
understand
the
reasons
for
avoiding
or
rejecting
a
food
category
only
if
we
identify
the
consumer
’s
underlying
“
food
philosophy
”
.
</s>
<s>
Moreover
,
it
is
only
in
this
way
that
we
can
circumvent
avoidance
and
rejection
.
</s>
<s>
Confining
ourselves
to
investigating
food
avoidance
behavior
could
lead
us
to
mistake
what
is
in
fact
disdain
or
rebellion
for
fear
.
</s>
<s>
For
this
reason
,
our
literature
review
will
go
into
the
details
of
some
of
these
value
positions
,
using
other
constructs
linked
to
the
type
of
diet
chosen
to
investigate
different
consumer
attitudes
to
genetically
modified
organisms
(
GMOs
)
,
cultured
meat
and
edible
insects
.
