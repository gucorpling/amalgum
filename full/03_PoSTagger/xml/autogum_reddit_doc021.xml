Just
caught
up
on
the
last
~50
chapters
of
the
manga
and
have
some
things
that
do
n't
sit
well
with
me

<p>
<s>
So
I
had
taken
a
break
from
SnS
about
a
year
back
,
and
I
was
excited
to
read
all
the
new
chapters(I
got
spoiled
about
Souma
becoming
First
seat
!
</s>
<s>
Damn
it
!
)
.
</s>
<s>
So
,
the
end
of
the
last
arc
had
a
few
things
that
just
bugged
me
.
</s>
<s>
Why
did
the
Nakiris
have
to
have
&quot;
The
Blessing
?
</s>
<s>
&quot;
Okay
,
delicious
food
making
people
have
internal
orgasms
was
fine
,
but
physical
clothes
being
torn
just
because
some
guy
found
it
to
be
delicious
?
</s>
<s>
It
's
just
something
that
really
bugged
me
throughout
.
</s>
<s>
Another
thing
was
that
Souma
saying
&quot;
I
<hi rend="bold">
ca
n't
</hi>
beat
Erina
yet
and
I
<hi rend="bold">
have
n't
</hi>
beaten
Rindou
,
Tsukasa
&quot;
.
</s>
<s>
Before
their
training
for
the
regimental
Shokugeki
began
,
Souma
had
already
beaten
Elite
ten
members
above
Erina
.
</s>
<s>
Now
,
I
'm
not
saying
that
Erina
was
surely
not
as
skilled
as
the
lower
half
of
the
E10
,
just
that
she
probably
was
n't
good
enough
to
be
in
the
upper
half
of
the
E10
at
the
very
least
.
</s>
<s>
And
we
know
Souma
's
growth
rate
since
he
joined
Totsuki
has
been
tremendous
.
</s>
<s>
So
by
that
rate
,
he
almost
surely
had
to
be
above
her
if
he
was
beating
a
fourth
seat
in
the
Elite
10
.
</s>
<s>
Also
,
this
is
the
first
time
that
Souma
has
accepted
that
he
ca
n't
beat
someone
other
than
Joichioru
.
</s>
<s>
Souma
's
mild
arrogance
and
confidence
that
he
can
beat
anyone
are
a
massive
part
of
his
character
,
imo
and
I
loved
that
about
him
.
</s>
<s>
Him
accepting
that
he
<hi rend="bold">
ca
n't
</hi>
beat
someone
for
the
first
time
took
a
lot
of
the
feels
of
the
victory
away
for
me
.
</s>
<s>
Another
thing
I
feel
is
that
Erina
could
've
been
a
lot
more
dynamic
in
the
future
chapters
as
part
of
the
student
body
rather
than
being
in
the
administration
.
</s>
<s>
She
's
basically
gonna
be
busy
with
administration
work
and
wo
n't
be
able
to
focus
much
on
cooking
if
she
's
to
do
her
job
as
the
headmaster
right
.
</s>
<s>
So
yeah
,
the
last
few
chapters
just
had
these
moments
that
took
a
lot
of
the
fun
away
for
me
.

things

The
blessing
thing
did
n't
really
bug
me
since
Food
Wars
is
by
it
's
nature
a
very
over
the
top
series
.
</s>
<s>
From
the
very
beginning
of
the
manga
and
the
anime
they
establish
that
food
is
so
good
it
has
people
explode
out
of
their
clothes
and
the
blessing
is
really
just
an
exaggeration
of
an
exaggeration
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
It
's
ridiculous
for
Azami
to
have
others
explode
out
of
their
clothes
and
it
's
cheap
fan
-service
but
it
's
a
defining
aspect
of
the
series
(
for
better
or
worse
)
.
</s>
<s>
All
of
the
Nakiri
's
have
ridiculousness
as
a
defining
trait
.
</s>
<s>
The
grandfather
goes
bare
,
one
speaks
random
English
when
the
food
is
good
etc.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Honestly
,
the
hierarchy
of
characters
in
Food
Wars
is
pretty
loose
.
</s>
<s>
While
it
's
established
that
Rindou
and
Tsukasa
are
both
stronger
than
Soma
and
Erina
in
general
the
ranking
of
the
other
Elite
10
is
a
lot
more
inconsistent
.
</s>
<s>
Erina
as
the
10th
Seat
is
able
to
defeat
the
4th
seat
.
</s>
<s>
The
6th
seat
loses
twice
to
non
seat
members
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
A
lot
of
the
characters
in
Food
Wars
are
giving
hype
by
defeating
fodder
or
built
up
by
the
author
through
reputation
rather
than
direct
explicit
rankings
in
case
the
series
wants
to
be
flexible
over
who
's
stronger
than
who
.
</s>
<s>
Barring
a
few
exceptions
like
Rindou
and
Tsukasa
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Soma
admitting
that
he
is
n't
as
strong
as
Rindou
,
Tsukasa
gives
his
character
a
direction
to
go
towards
.

Rather
than
Soma
just
trying

directly
