I
told
my
mother
about
the
invitation
and
asked
if
I
could
go
in
with
her
to
meet
Brett
,
to
which
she
agreed
.
</s>
<s>
Brett
was
a
very
handsome
man
,
posted
as
the
Public
Registrar
,
responsible
for
signing
new
people
up
for
service
and
collecting
their
money
.

<s>
He
interviewed
me
and
said
that
he
could
tell
I
had
a
lot
of
potential
and
would
go
very
far
in
life
,
but
that
I
needed
to
learn
several
tools
to
be
able
to
do
so
successfully
.
</s>
<s>
I
really
wanted
to
find
out
all
about
this
.
</s>
<s>
Brett
called
my
mother
into
his
office
and
had
her
pay
for
my
first
course
so
I
could
get
started
immediately
.
</s>
<s>
And
so
,
I
enrolled
on
my
first
course
–
the
&quot;
Communications
Course
&quot;
,
on
17
May
1978
