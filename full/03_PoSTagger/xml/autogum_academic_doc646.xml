<p>
<s>
Fever
,
defined
as
a
rectal
temperature
above
38
degrees
centigrade
(
°C
)
,
is
the
body
’s
response
to
an
illness
or
pathological
invasion
and
is
one
of
the
most
common
symptoms
of
childhood
illnesses
(
for
one-third
of
all
presenting
conditions
in
children
)
.
</s>
<s>
Generally
,
fever
is
self-limiting
and
a
symptom
of
a
banal
viral
infection
with
no
known
source
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Despite
this
,
childhood
fever
constitutes
30
%
of
pediatric
consultations
in
primary
care
in
both
Europe
and
the
United
States
.
</s>
<s>
In
Spain
,
reported
rates
are
as
high
as
60
%
.
</s>
<s>
This
represents
a
considerable
expense
considering
the
extent
of
medical
consultations
and
emergency
service
visits
in
primary
care
sectors
and
hospitals
,
together
with
complementary
exams
and
antibiotic
treatments
,
which
,
at
times
,
could
be
deemed
unnecessary
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Regarding
the
manner
in
which
parents
approach
childhood
fever
,
prior
studies
show
that
parents
fear
the
secondary
effects
of
fever
,
such
as
febrile
convulsions
or
brain
injury
,
or
the
association
between
high
fever
and
the
severity
of
the
illness
.
</s>
<s>
These
are
factors
which
are
conducive
to
parents
initiating
antipyretic
therapy
as
soon
as
possible
,
thus
increasing
the
risk
of
an
overdose
.
</s>
<s>
In
this
sense
,
according
to
previous
studies
,
approximately
50
%
of
parents
administer
antipyretics
when
temperatures
are
below
38
°C
or
administer
incorrect
doses
of
antipyretics
or
supratherapeutic
doses
of
paracetamol
and
ibuprofen
.
</s>
<s>
It
is
therefore
worth
considering
that
parent
empowerment
in
the
management
of
fever
could
be
a
helpful
tool
for
gaining
greater
control
over
the
decisions
and
actions
that
affect
both
parents
’
health
and
that
of
their
children
.
</s>
<s>
Parent
empowerment
also
enables
parents
to
actively
take
charge
of
their
children
’s
care
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Previous
studies
have
highlighted
the
fact
that
the
educational
level
or
,
more
specifically
,
health
alphabetization
,
influences
the
perceptions
related
to
the
process
of
health-illness
in
the
community
.
</s>
<s>
Moreover
,
parents
who
are
health
professionals
can
encounter
difficulties
when
assuming
the
role
of
the
patient
,
frequently
resorting
to
self-diagnosis
,
self-medication
,
and
prescriptions
issued
to
family
members
.
</s>
<s>
Despite
this
,
to
the
best
of
our
knowledge
,
the
influence
of
health
training
on
parents
,
regarding
the
management
of
childhood
fever
,
has
not
been
analyzed
to
date
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Although
the
management
of
childhood
fever
is
well
known
based
on
former
quantitative
research
performed
using
surveys
or
questionnaires
,
little
is
known
of
the
parents
’
perception
on
the
process
of
seeking
care
,
the
therapeutic
approach
,
and
the
expectations
regarding
this
phenomenon
.
</s>
<s>
These
aspects
can
provide
health
professionals
and
managers
with
key
information
for
the
design
and
implementation
of
educational
programs
targeted
at
improving
the
manner
in
which
parents
deal
with
their
episodes
of
childhood
fever
and
promoting
an
appropriate
use
of
health
resources
.

The
aim
of
this
study
was
to
explore
the
parents
’
approach
to
fever
in
children
aged
between
0
and
12
years
,
comparing
parents
with
and
without
health
training
.
