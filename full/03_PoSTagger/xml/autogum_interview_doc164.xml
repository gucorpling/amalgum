The
anti-spam
legislation
,
or
the
Unsolicited
Electronic
Messages
Act
2007
,
promotes
spam
education
and
awareness
and
will
enable
international
agencies

work

share
information

will
enable

pursuit

<p>

However
,
New

is
n't
the
most
up-to-date
country
with
implementing
similar
legislation
,
Farrar
says
,
“
We
are
in

almost
the
last
country
in

OECD

Europe

China

take
part

fight

</p>
<p>

Stewart
said
that
the
new
law
would
only
help
combat
a
small
amount
of
spam
,
as
99%-99.9
%
of
all
spam
received
originates
from
overseas

He
says
the
legislation
alone
will
not

the
problem

</p>
<p>

As
well
as
it
helping
to
fight
New
Zealand-sourced
spam
and
preventing
New
Zealand
from
“
becoming
a
haven
for
spammers
”
,
it
will
promote
good
practices
within
the
e-marketing
community
,
Stewart
said
.

</p>
<p>
<s>
The
new
Act
will
affect
legitimate
marketers
in
New
Zealand
by
making
sure
they
have
expressed
or
inferred
consent
to
continue
sending
marketing
messages
to
people
on
their
database
.
</s>
<s>
Inferred
consent
is
where
the
marketers
have
the
e-mail
address
and
send
messages
to
those
on
their
database
,
but
did
n't
get
expressed
consent
to
send
messages
.
</s>
<s>
Stewart
does
issue
a
warning
against
using
inferred
consent
saying
,
“
They
may
have
been
sending
these
people
messages
for
years
,
but
this
does
not
establish
consent
.

</p>
<p>
<s>
A
surge
in
emails
has
also
been
felt
with
companies/marketers
making
sure
they
have
consent
to
continue
the
e-mails
and
asking
those
to
confirm
they
wish
to
continue
their
subscription
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
“
However
,
many
marketers
are
already
fulfilling
these
requirements
because
they
are
standard
good
e-marketing
practice
,
”
Stewart
said
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Due
to
legislative
requirements
,
as
well
as
having
consent
,
businesses
will
have
to
provide
details
about
the
company
sending
the
item
,
and
provide
a
free
way
to
unsubscribe
from
future
mailings
.

Those
found
breaking
these
requirements
deliberately

themselves

Farrar
said

“

</p>
<p>
<s>
Farrar
also
gives
a
final
piece
of
advice
to
those
annoyed
with
spam
levels
,
“
Never
ever
respond
to
a
spam
e-mail
,
and
only
give
your
real
address
out
to
people
you
trust
.
