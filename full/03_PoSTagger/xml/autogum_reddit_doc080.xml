I

without
him
on
Saturday

It
’s
been
a
very
confusing
and
difficult
ride
the
past
year
but
I
wanted
to
share
something
I
wrote

I
encourage
anybody
going
through
a
loss
as
great
as
I
experienced
to
write
out
your
feelings

I
received
a
phone
call

spent
a
good
majority

But
the
thing
that
took
my
breath
away

knocked
me
down
the
stairwell

pile
of
cardboard

why
he
had
died

My

Nick

My

I
have
never
known
sorrow
so
deep
as
I
did
when
I
lost
Nick

Your
spelling
was
atrocious
but
your
heart
...
your
heart
was
bigger
than
I
think
even
your
understanding

In
your
mind
you
always
tried

do
the
right

sometimes
in
reality
it
was

always
right

much
in

always
wanted

be

you

were
fiercely

FIERCELY
loyal

stuck
up

Living
with

you

Whether

your
