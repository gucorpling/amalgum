Strengths

<p>

Timeseries
products
present
different
temporal
scales
components
,
such
as
seasonal
variations
,
long-term
and
short-term
fluctuations
.
</s>
<s>
Their
high
temporal
resolution
offers
the
opportunity
to
define
time
profiles
of
vegetation
dynamics
.
</s>
<s>
Although
many
methods
have
been
developed
to
explore
vegetation
dynamics
at
a
global
or
regional
scale
,
quantitative
methods
that
could
automatically
address
where
,
when
and
how
vegetation
change
are
still
lacking
.
</s>
<s>
Trajectory-based
change
detection
is
an
inevitable
choice
to
do
this
work
by
constructing
a
‘
curve
’
or
profile
of
full
temporal
records
for
each
pixel
.
</s>
<s>
Nowadays
,
the
method
has
been
successfully
applied
in
forest-related
change
analyses
,
land
use
classification
,
and
cropland
variations
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
The
framework
we
proposed
in
our
study
is
a
trajectory-based
change
detection
method
.
</s>
<s>
It
has
several
desirable
properties
compared
with
other
fashionable
methods
.
</s>
<s>
Firstly
,
unlike
the
widely
used
trend
analyses
which
hypothesize
that
ecosystems/vegetation
always
change
linearly
in
a
direction
,
our
framework
could
detect
the
non-linear
change
patterns
in
vegetation
.
</s>
<s>
All
patterns
in
the
framework
can
be
interpreted
from
unambiguous
biophysical
standpoints
.
</s>
<s>
Secondly
,
unlike
DBEST
and
BFAST
,
our
framework
automatically
generalizes
processes
of
vegetation
gradual
changes
into
different
patterns
without
setting
any
parameters
.
</s>
<s>
Furthermore
,
the
patterns
between
different
pixels
or
areas
could
be
compared
easily
.
</s>
<s>
Although
DBEST
and
BFAST
could
also
track
vegetation
gradual
change
by
a
piecewise
linear
model
on
the
pixel
scale
,
the
number
of
breakpoints
must
be
set
by
users
when
the
method
was
extended
to
the
regional
scale
.
</s>
<s>
For
example
,
de
Jong
detected
the
short-term
greening
or
browning
periods
within
long-term
timeseries
by
dividing
the
trend
component
in
BFAST
into
four
segments
which
were
separated
by
three
breakpoints
.
</s>
<s>
Then
,
the
duration
of
the
significant
greening
and
browning
segments
,
the
magnitude
of
change
in
NDVI
,
and
the
abrupt
changes
could
be
compared
between
pixels
subsequently
.
</s>
<s>
Lastly
,
trajectory-based
change
detection
only
functions
when
the
process
of
vegetation
change
matches
well
with
the
hypothesized
trajectory
.
</s>
<s>
Temporal
trajectories
of
vegetation
changes
in
different
pixels
may
be
different
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
many
mathematical
models
are
needed
to
fit
the
trajectories
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
just
a
logistic
model
is
used
to
simulate
all
the
non-linear
monotonic
patterns
in
our
framework
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Drawbacks
of
our
framework
are
obvious
.
</s>
<s>
Firstly
,
only
four
monotonic
patterns
and
eight
types
are
presented
.
</s>
<s>
All
the
patterns
are
associated
with
only
one
disturbance
event
within
the
timescales
of
the
observation
period
(

.
</s>
<s>
Generally
,
changes
in
vegetation
are
complicated
and
difficult
to
be
generalized
by
a
single
function
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
patterns
that
are
composed
of
the
general
categories
in
our
framework
,
or
patterns
that
vegetation
gradual
changes
were
stalled
or
reverse
by
abrupt
events
,
were
not
discussed
in
this
study
.
</s>
<s>
New
models
that
could
detect
both
the
monotonic
and
the
non-monotonic
patterns
are
needed
to
be
induced
in
future
.
</s>
<s>
Secondly
,
the
smoothed
treatment
implemented
on
the
NDVI
timeseries
makes
the
framework
unsuitable
to
detect
subtle
changes
or
abrupt
changes
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
it
makes
the
framework
unspecific
to
the
MODIS
timeseries
products
which
do
not
suffer
from
the
problem
of
data
discontinuity
.
</s>
<s>
The
data
discontinuities
which
may
be
caused
by
changes
in
different
sensors
,
orbital
drift
in
the
satellite
overpass
times
,
variations
in
sun-sensor-viewer
geometry
or
differences
in
the
atmospheric
conditions
(
i.
e.
,
water
vapour
content
,
aerosols
)
are
common
in
other
timeseries
products
,
such
as
datasets
from
AVHRR
,
Landsat
and
VEGETATION
.
