Background

<p>
<s>
The
emission
of
greenhouse
gas
(
GHG
)
has
steeply
increased
by
approximately
82.5
%
since
1979
,
which
has
been
a
major
contributor
to
climate
change
globally
.
</s>

This
gives
rise
to
considerable
global
efforts
to
reduce
its
emissions
.

As
a
part
of
it
,
South
Korea
announced
a
target
of
reducing
GHG
emissions
by
37
%
compared
to
Business
As
Usual
(
BAU
)
by
2030
in
the
Paris
Agreement
of
the
Intergovernmental
Panel
on
Climate
Change
(
IPCC
)
in
2016

Humans
,
who
are
mostly
responsible
for
GHG
emissions
,
spend
approximately
90
%
of
the
daytime

buildings

<s>
The
estimated
GHG
emissions
from
buildings
are
as
high
as
20
%
of
the
total
emissions

</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
many
studies
have
been
conducted

reduce

consumption
in
buildings

The

To
properly

it

In

approximately
70

90
%
