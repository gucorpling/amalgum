Glinda
,
the
Good
,
in
her
palace
in
the
Quadling
</s>
<s>
Country
,
had
many
things
to
occupy
her
mind
,
for
not
only
did
she
look
after
the
weaving
and
embroidery
of
her
bevy
of
maids
,
and
assist
all
those
who
came
to
her
to
implore
her
help
--
beasts
and
birds
as
well
as
people
--
but
she
was
a
close
student
of
the
arts
of
sorcery
and
spent
much
time
in
her
Magical
Laboratory
,
where
she
strove
to
find
a
remedy
for
every
evil
and
to
perfect
her
skill
in
magic
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Nevertheless
,
she
did
not
forget
to
look
in
the
Great
Book
of
Records
each
day
to
see
if
any
mention
was
made
of
the
visit
of
Ozma
and
Dorothy
to
the
Enchanted
Mountain
of
the
Flatheads
and
the
Magic
Isle
of
the
Skeezers
.
</s>
<s>
The
Records
told
her
that
Ozma
had
arrived
at
the
mountain
,
that
she
had
escaped
,
with
her
companion
,
and
gone
to
the
island
of
the
Skeezers
,
and
that
Queen
Coo-ee-oh
had
submerged
the
island
so
that
it
was
entirely
under
water
.
</s>
<s>
Then
came
the
statement
that
the
Flatheads
had
come
to
the
lake
to
poison
the
fishes
and
that
their
Supreme
Dictator
had
transformed
Queen
Coo-ee-oh
into
a
swan
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
No
other
details
were
given
in
the
Great
Book
and
so
Glinda
did
not
know
that
since
Coo-ee-oh
had
forgotten
her
magic
none
of
the
Skeezers
knew
how
to
raise
the
island
to
the
surface
again
.
</s>
<s>
So
Glinda
was
not
worried
about
Ozma
and
Dorothy
until
one
morning
,
while
she
sat
with
her
maids
,
there
came
a
sudden
clang
of
the
great
alarm
bell
.
</s>
<s>
This
was
so
unusual
that
every
maid
gave
a
start
and
even
the
Sorceress
for
a
moment
could
not
think
what
the
alarm
meant
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Then
she
remembered
the
ring
she
had
given
Dorothy
when
she
left
the
palace
to
start
on
her
venture
.
</s>
<s>
In
giving
the
ring
Glinda
had
warned
the
little
girl
not
to
use
its
magic
powers
unless
she
and
Ozma
were
in
real
danger
,
but
then
she
was
to
turn
it
on
her
finger
once
to
the
right
and
once
to
the
left
and
Glinda
's
alarm
bell
would
ring
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
So
the
Sorceress
now
knew
that
danger
threatened
her
beloved
Ruler
and
Princess
Dorothy
,
and
she
hurried
to
her
magic
room
to
seek
information
as
to
what
sort
of
danger
it
was
.
</s>
<s>
The
answer
to
her
question
was
not
very
satisfactory
,
for
it
was
only
:
&quot;
Ozma
and
Dorothy
are
prisoners
in
the
great
Dome
of
the
Isle
of
the
Skeezers
,
and
the
Dome
is
under
the
water
of
the
lake
.
</s>
<s>
&quot;
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
&quot;
Has
n't
Ozma
the
power
to
raise
the
island
to
the
surface
?
</s>
<s>
&quot;
inquired
Glinda
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
&quot;
No
,
&quot;
was
the
reply
,
and
the
Record
refused
to
say
more
except
that
Queen
Coo-ee-oh
,
who
alone
could
command
the
island
to
rise
,
had
been
transformed
by
the
Flathead
Su-dic
into
a
Diamond
Swan
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Then
Glinda
consulted
the
past
records
of
the
Skeezers
in
the
Great
Book
.
</s>
<s>
After
diligent
search
she
discovered
that
Coo-ee-oh
was
a
powerful
sorceress
who
had
gained
most
of
her
power
by
treacherously
transforming
the
Adepts
of
Magic
,
who
were
visiting
her
,
into
three
fishes
--
gold
,
silver
and
bronze
--
after
which
she
had
them
cast
into
the
lake
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Glinda
reflected
earnestly
on
this
information
and
decided
that
someone
must
go
to
Ozma
's
assistance
.
</s>
<s>
While
there
was
no
great
need
of
haste
,
because
Ozma
and
Dorothy
could
live
in
a
submerged
dome
a
long
time
,
it
was
evident
they
could
not
get
out
until
someone
was
able
to
raise
the
island
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
The
Sorceress
looked
through
all
her
recipes
and
books
of
sorcery
,
but
could
find
no
magic
that
would
raise
a
sunken
island
.
</s>
<s>
Such
a
thing
had
never
before
been
required
in
sorcery
.
</s>
<s>
Then
Glinda
made
a
little
island
,
covered
by
a
glass
dome
,
and
sunk
it
in
a
pond
near
her
castle
,
and
experimented
in
magical
ways
to
bring
it
to
the
surface
.
</s>
<s>
She
made
several
such
experiments
,
but
all
were
failures
.
</s>
<s>
It
seemed
a
simple
thing
to
do
,
yet
she
could
not
do
it
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Nevertheless
,
the
wise
Sorceress
did
not
despair
of
finding
a
way
to
liberate
her
friends
.
</s>
<s>
Finally
she
concluded
that
the
best
thing
to
do
was
to
go
to
the
Skeezer
country
and
examine
the
lake
.
</s>
<s>
While
there
she
was
more
likely
to
discover
a
solution
to
the
problem
that
bothered
her
,
and
to
work
out
a
plan
for
the
rescue
of
Ozma
and
Dorothy
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
So
Glinda
summoned
her
storks
and
her
aerial
chariot
,
and
telling
her
maids
she
was
going
on
a
journey
and
might
not
soon
return
,
she
entered
the
chariot
and
was
carried
swiftly
to
the
Emerald
City
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
In
Princess
Ozma
's
palace
the
Scarecrow
was
now
acting
as
Ruler
of
the
Land
of
Oz
.
</s>
<s>
There
was
n't
much
for
him
to
do
,
because
all
the
affairs
of
state
moved
so
smoothly
,
but
he
was
there
in
case
anything
unforeseen
should
happen
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Glinda
found
the
Scarecrow
playing
croquet
with
Trot
and
Betsy
Bobbin
,
two
little
girls
who
lived
at
the
palace
under
Ozma
's
protection
and
were
great
friends
of
Dorothy
and
much
loved
by
all
the
Oz
people
.

</p>
<p>

&quot;
Something
's
happened

&quot;
cried
Trot
,
as
the
chariot
of
the
Sorceress
descended
near
them
.

&quot;
Glinda
never

something

</p>
<p>

&quot;
I
hope
no
harm
has
come
to
Ozma
,
or
Dorothy

said
Betsy
anxiously
,
as
the
lovely
Sorceress
stepped
down
from
her
chariot
.
