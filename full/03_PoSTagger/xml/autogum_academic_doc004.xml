All

characteristics
of

In

under

the
practical
significance
of
enhancing

In
1990
,
a
study
on
enhancing
the
oil
recovery
of
the
potential
evaluation

development

of
waterflood
oilfields
in
China
revealed
that
polymer
flooding
is
a
technology
with
great
potential
,
and
it
is
feasible
both
technically
and
economically
for
enhanced
oil

used
it

The
following
problems
exist
in
the
application
and
promotion
of
the
second
national
potential
evaluation
software
:
(
a
)
The
model
mechanism
is
oversimplified
,
which
results
in
the
limitation
of
the
application
scope
of
the
model
and
affects
the
reliability
of
the
operation
results
.
(
b
)
The
increase
of
polymer
flooding
potential
and
chemical
compound
flooding
is
lower
than
that
of
numerical
simulation
,
and
the
enhancing
oil
recovery

most
blocks
is
less
than
2

5
