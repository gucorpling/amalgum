The

NP-hard

It
has
high
structural

multiple

So
a

A
simulated
annealing
algorithm
is
a
random
optimization
algorithm
based
on
a
Monte
Carlo
iterative
solution
strategy
,
and
has
strong
robustness
,
global
convergence
and
wide
adaptability
,
which
is
suitable
for
solving
the
problem
.

In
order
to
obtain
a
variety
of
perturbation
solutions
in
the
iteration
process
,
four
neighborhood
transform
operators
are
designed
.

The
functions
of
these
operators
are
as

adding
a
line

deleting

adding

a

Different

Each

be

Otherwise

</s>
<s>
Metropolis
criterion
is
that
the
algorithm
allows
the
inferior
solution
to
be
accepted
with
a
certain
probability
,

that
the
algorithm
can
jump
out

the
local
optimum

The
acceptance

the
criterion
is
calculated
by
Equation
(

.
</s>
<s>
As
the
temperature
decreases

the
probability

an
inferior
solution
decreases
gradually

The

designed

to
remember

</s>
<s>
As
the
iteration
proceeds
,
the
solution
in
the
memory
base
is
continuously
updated
until
the
algorithm
converges
.

<s>
Therefore
,
the
objective
value
will
approach
the
global
optimum
gradually
in
the
iterative
process

<s>
A
solution
has
many
kinds
of
changes
after
perturbation
,
so
even
if
the
current
solution
is
perturbed
into
the
solution
that
has
appeared
in
previous
iterations
,
it
will
change
in
other
directions
when
perturbed
again
,
which
will
not
have
a
negative
impact
on
the
results
