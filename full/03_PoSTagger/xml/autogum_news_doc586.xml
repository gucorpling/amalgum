Gerland
in
Lyon
earlier
today

only
to
watch
their
home
side
fall
to
Roma
of
Italy

The

leg
in
the
series
saw
the
two
teams
draw
0-0
which
gave
Roma
a
slight
advantage
from
the
start
,
as
a
draw
would
allow
them
to
advance
.
</s>
<s>
The
previous
match
was
extremely
undisciplined
,
and
Roma
was
given
eight
yellow
cards
.

<s>
The
Italian
side
showed
a
much
calmer
demeanor
this
game
,
earning
only
two
yellows
in
comparison
to
Lyon
's
four
.

Lyon
produced
the
first
chance
of
the
game
as
Romas
keeper
Alexandre
Doni
was
unable
to
cope
with
Juninho
,
but
defender
Philippe
Mexes
was
able
to
clear
the
ball
from
nearby
strikers
.

Roma
had
their
own
chance
soon
after
,
as
Daniele
De
Rossi
was
left
open
,
and
he
headed
the
ball
home
.

The
goal
was
disallowed
by
the
referee

spotted
a
push
by
De
Rossi
on
Eric
Abidal

Juninho
continued
to
threaten
Roma
,
but
his
crosses
were
not
able
to
do
any
damage
to
the
Rossinari
.
</s>
<s>
Lyon
fell
behind
on
22
minutes
when
Max
Tonetto
clipped
a
cross
into
the
middle
,

Francesco
Totti
was
in
the
right
place
to
head
the
ball
past
Gregory
Coupet

Crosses
continued

be
the
only
attack
Lyon
could
muster

kick

The
ball
ricoched
off
several

Squillaci
latch
on

sent
directly
at
Doni

keeper
made
the
save

visitors
lead

struck
the
ball
soundly
into
the
top
corner

the
net

<s>
After
the
break
,
Roma
could
have
killed
off
the
game
indefinitely
,
as
Tadei
beat
Lyon
's
offside
trap
,
but
was
unable
to
regain
the
composure
required
to
smash
the
ball
home
.

Doni
then
produced
a
few
saves
for
Roma
,
kicking
out
Sylvan
Wiltord
's
shot
,

then
diving
to
palm
away
a
curling
shot
by
Juninho

Both
teams

vain
attempts

penalty

both
Fred

Perrotta
diving

the
referee
made
the
right
decisions

awarded
only

given
a
yellow
for

Chivu

face
