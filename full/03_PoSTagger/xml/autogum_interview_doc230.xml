Proper
government
provides
an
even
playing
field

applies
the

rules

all
players

dispenses
justice
even-handedly

quickly

Libertarians
would
ensure
that
the
relevant

actually
applied

in
those
areas

the
regulations
where
change
is
required
to
catch
up
to
technology

to
cover
omissions

revise
poorly
structured

have
it
done

Specifically
with
respect

atmospheric
warming

once
the
pertinent
regulatory
environment
had
been
tightened
as
noted
above
we
would
encouage
cases
to
be
brought
to
court
in

to
resolve
the
claims
made

the
degree
to
which
action
is
indicated

The
current

It

any
government

Conservative

tears
the
heart
out
of
the
economy
of
the

draconian
steps

Setting
