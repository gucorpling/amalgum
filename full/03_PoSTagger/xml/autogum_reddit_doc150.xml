Advice
wanted
for
dealing
with
GF
's
insane
mother
</s>
</head>
<sp who="#vel0city0verdrive">
<p>
<s>
My
GF
and
I
are
in
our
sophomore
year
of
college
and
have
been
dating
for
almost
6
months
now
.
</s>
<s>
This
is
both
of
our
first
LTR
and
to
me
,
at
least
,
we
have
been
navigating
it
well
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
the
relationship
has
caused
me
more
stress
and
guilt
than
happiness
,
and
the
worst
part
is
because
it
is
from
her
mother
.
</s>
<s>
I
knew
she
did
n't
like
me
from
the
beginning
because
I
'm
19
and
she
is
20
even
though
we
are
in
the
same
class
.
</s>
<s>
My
GF
was
really
nervous
about
telling
her
mom
about
being
in
a
relationship
(
I
'll
get
to
why
later
)
and
although
I
tried
to
encourage
her
since
before
Thanksgiving
to
tell
her
family
,
she
would
n't
until
mid-December
(
after
we
have
been
dating
since
early
August
.
)
Her
mom
,
expectedly
,
went
off
on
her
for
not
saying
anything
and
guilt-tripped
her
.
</s>
<s>
The
more
our
relationship
went
on
,
the
more
frustrating
I
seemed
to
notice
about
her
mother
such
as
<hi rend="bold">
Her
never
telling
anyone
back
home/at
school
about
our
relationship
.
</s>
<s>
This
drives
me
crazy
because
if
our
relationship
does
n't
work
out
,
no
one
in
her
life
other
than
the
mother
will
even
know
it
happened
,
like
we
did
n't
even
exist
.
</s>
</hi>
<s>
Her
mom
asking
questions
about
me
constantly
,
and
not
very
accepting
of
my
honest
answers
I
tried
not
to
become
too
bothered
about
this
,
but
my
GF
told
me
her
mom
wanted
to
speak
to
me
before
they
went
home
for
Spring
Break
(
which
is
now
)
in
private
.
</s>
<s>
This
took
place
Thursday
,
and
she
grilled
me
the
entire
time
,
asking
me
so
many
questions
and
telling
me
things
like
:
</s>
<hi rend="bold">
<s>
I
'm
not
good
enough
for
her
spiritually
(
her
mom
is
insanely
religious
)
</hi>
We
do
n't
have
enough
in
common
<hi rend="bold">
I
may
have
pushed
her
into
a
relationship
</s>
</hi>
<s>
She
told
me
she
never
talked
about
sex/relationships
to
my
GF
(
homeschooled
of
course
)
because
&quot;
parenting
is
hard
.
</s>
<s>
&quot;
(
pissed
me
off
more
than
anything
)
Last
night
,
I
told
my
GF
about
the
talk
we
had
,
and
she
did
n't
apologize
for
her
mother
's
actions
or
anything
,
all
she
said
was
&quot;
I
do
n't
know
what
to
say
,
&quot;
after
I
poured
out
my
heart
to
her
.
</s>
<s>
This
really
hurt
me
,
but
I
'm
used
to
it
as
it
is
the
usual
answer
when
I
tell
her
about
something
I
'm
going
through
,
as
I
usually
go
through
friends/parents
when
I
have
problems
instead
.
</s>
<s>
I
never
post
on
forums
but
I
'm
desperate
for
advice
on
what
to
do
because
I
still
care
for
her
greatly
,
but
I
'm
becoming
more
on
edge
every
day
and
I
'm
fully
aware
we
are
in
an
unhealthy
relationship
.

Thanks

advance

You
need
to
tell
your
gf
you
want
to
keep
seeing
her
,
but
not
her
mom
.
</s>
<s>
You
are
not
at
the
stage
in
a
relationship
her
mom
needs
to
be
in
your
face
asking
probing
questions
.
</s>
<s>
Also
you
might
try
to
suggest
that
therapy
might
help
her
navigate
all
her
relationships
in
a
healthy
way
,
since
her
mom
admitted
skipping
that
part
.
</s>
<s>
Tell
her
you
never
want
her
to
feel
pressured
by
you
,
and
that
it
's
ok
to
communicate
what
she
is
comfortable
with
and
what
she
would
like
to
explore
.
</s>
<s>
Is
your
gf
very
religious
?
</s>
<s>
If
so
beware
of
the
if
you
date
hold
hands
kiss
your
ARE
getting
married
mentality
.
</s>
<s>
Make
sure
YOU
are
using
birth
control
since
she
might
be
afraid
to
get
it
for
herself
.
</s>
<s>
But
remember
it
is
n't
your
responsibility
to
hang
around
and
fix
her
if
you
are
n't
enjoying
the
relationship
.
