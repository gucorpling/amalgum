I
have
what
is
said
to
be
a
200
tab
(
but
other
reddit
users
say
this
is
probably
an
overestimate/exaggeration
made
by
my
dealer
)

anyways

I
have
the
most
perfect
set

setting

I
’m
gonna
be
with
some

my
closest
friends
I
’ve
known

I
was
4

their
houses

Their
parents
will
let
us
out

do
whatever
til
whatever
time
we
want

I
’ll
probably
start
my
trip
at
around
5:30-6
on
a
hot/warm
sunny
day
.

<s>
I
’ll
be
playing
some
soccer
and
basketball
while
they
are
stoned
,
as
I
’ll
be
the
only
one
tripping
on
acid
.

We
might
even
swim

His
house
is
full
of
great
times

memories

What
can
I
expect
from
this
trip

I
’m
scared
of
having
flashbacks

a
bad
trip
even
from
a
one
time
use

I
know
I
will
probably
trip
one

two

Its

With
4
very

pretty
good

You

be

Acid
expands
your

Make

down

wants

,
I

This

you
take
it

let
