What
is
pet
?
</s>
<s>
Based
on
Merriam
Webster
dictionary
,
pet
is
defined
as
a
domesticated
animal
kept
for
pleasure
rather
than
utility
.

<s>
Nowadays
,
people
tend
to
keep
pet
in
their
house

</s>
<s>
These
animals
can
form
very
close
bond
with
their
human
owners
and
in
fact
,
cats
are
even
known
as
man
’s
best
friend
.
</s>
<s>
But
,
most
of
the
owners

not
know
the
right
ways

take
care
of
their
pets

<s>
In
Islamic
views
,
there
are
a
few
ways
on
how
to
take
a
good
care
of
pets
.
</s>
<s>
In
order
to
be
a
responsible
owner
,
people
should
know
and
implement
the
right

to
make
sure
their
pets
are
in
a
good
condition
including
treating
them
kindly

train
the

First
and
foremost
,
Islam
expects
humankind
to
treat
all
animals
with
respect
and
dignity
and
not
cause
it
any
harm
nor
injury
.
</s>
<s>
Treating
animals
with
kindness
and
mercy
is
just
one
of
the
responsibilities
embedded
in
Allah
’s
creation
.

<s>
It
is
stated
in
the
Quran
,
“
And
We
have
sent
you
O
Muhammad
not
but
as
a
mercy
for
all
of
humankind
,
jinn
,
and
all
that
exists
.

(
Quran
21:107
)
.
</s>
<s>
From
this
verse
,
we
could
acknowledge
that
treating
every
creations
including
animals
with
warmth
and
care
is
highly
encouraged
.
</s>
<s>
Furthermore
,
according
to
one
of
the
hadith
narrated
by
Abu
Hurayrah
,
it
was
stated
that
:
</s>
<s>
The
Prophet
(
peace
and
blessings
of
Allah
be
upon
him
)
said
;
“
Whilst
a
man
was
walking
on
the
road
,
he
became
very
thirsty

<s>
He
found
a
well
so
he
went
down
into
it

drank
,
then
he
came
out

<s>
There
,
he
saw
a
dog
that
was
panting
and
biting
the
ground
out
of
thirst
.
</s>
<s>
The
man
said
:
this
dog
is
feeling
the
same
thirst
that
I
felt
.
</s>
<s>
So
he
went
back
down
into
the
well
and
filled
his
shoe
with
water
,
then
he
held
it
in
his
mouth
until
he
climbed
back
up
,
and
he
gave
the
water
to
the
dog

Allah
appreciated
(
his
action
)
and
forgave
him

</s>
<s>
(
The
Hadith
,
n.

Therefore
,
we
as
a
Muslim
must
show
kindness
towards
animals
notably
our
pets
and
that
we
must
also
have
mercy
on
animals

not
for
human
beings

also

</s>
<s>
Just
like
humans
,
animals
should
also
be
trained
so
that
they
can
behave
well

bad

who

clean

</s>
<s>
We
,
as
a
Muslim
should
always
keep
our
house
clean
because
in
the
Quran
it
was
stated
that
“
truly
Allah
loves
those
who
turns
to
Him
constantly
and
He
loves
those
who

pure

Quran

<s>
From
this
verse
,
it
is
apparent
that
Islam
really
places
a
great
emphasis
on
cleanliness

those
who
would
do
as
He
say
surely
will
be

Besides
training

well

may
require
a
huge
effort

if
consistent
commitment
were

success
could

The
pet
owners
too
must
invest
their
time

acquiring
knowledge
on
how
to
train
their

effectively

this

be
done
in
several
ways

,
they
could
ask

According

said
:
“
With

they

worse

because
it
is

kill

From

dirty
