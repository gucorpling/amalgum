<s>
The
three
biggest
issues
in
this
riding
are
the
crisis
in
public
education
;
the
increasing
debtload
of
students
because
of
tuition
hikes
;
and
the
inability
of
municipal
government
to
fund
the
social
services
downloaded
by
the
Harris
government
form
the
province
to
the
cities
in
1997
.

Re
public
education
:
Our
Party
will
commit
to
spending
$
20
billion
for
a
quality
public
secular
school
system
in
French
and
English
for
primary
and
secondary
education
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
We
would
commit
to
a
comparable
investment
in
public
post-secondary
education
while
reducing
tuition
by
50
%
now
,
and
then
eliminate
it
when
the
funding
is
adequate
to
provide
the
education
for
all
who
qualify
for
post-secondary
education
.
</s>

<p>
<s>
We
would
give
municipalities
secure
funding
through
provincial
grants
and
the
ability
to
tax
corporations
.
</s>
<s>
This
would
wean
them
off
the
property
tax
,
which
we
would
reduce
by
75
%
,
along
with
the
scrapping
of
the
market
value
assessment
taxation
scheme
.
</s>
<s>
We
would
give
50
%
of
the
gas
tax
for
mass
transit
such
as
the
O-train
in
Ottawa
that
would
travel
both
east
and
west
and
north
and
south
.

<s>
We
would
upload
to
the
province
the
funding
of
health

education

transit

welfare

Outraged

out

right-wing
candidates

promise

raise
taxes

In

the
slogan

zero

zero

The

municipal

How

The

insisting

It
should

that

closing

’s
in
Smith
Falls

Oshawa

have

Failure

do
so
