Many
of
those
who
participate
in
21st-century
business
or
enterprise
understand
the
idea
of
knowledge
workers
contributing
intangibles
to
the
marketplace
rather
than
participating
in
industrial
,
product-driven
business
processes
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
not
as
many
people
have
really
considered
how
to
think
like
a
knowledge
worker
and
operate
well
in
a
work
environment
where
ideas
are
often
more
important
than
materials
,
and
knowledge
or
access
to
data
frequently
trumps
physical
skills
like
strength
and
dexterity
.
</s>
<s>
The
idea
of
how
to
think
like
a
knowledge
worker
is
really
a
subjective
one
,
but
there
are
some
common
guidelines
that
will
often
benefit
those
who
need
to
adapt
their
way
of
thinking
to
a
less
tangible
,
more
complex
idea-driven
economy

Part
of
succeeding
in
the
business
world
of
the
21st
century
is
understanding
how

move
across

<s>
In
a
global
approach
,
there
is
often
a

workers
access

utilize

draw
on

That

For

reading
books

his
&quot;
The

Olive

global
economy

Another
part
of
really
understanding
the
role
of
a
knowledge
worker
is
to
get
diverse
data
on
a
field

industry
through
cross-reading
.

keeping

well
as
finding
more

such
as

for
greater
access
