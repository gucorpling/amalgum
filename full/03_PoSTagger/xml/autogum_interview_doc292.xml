<s>
The
problem
of
illegal
immigration
actually
has
a
very
simple
solution
.
</s>
<s>
Start
enforcing
the
penalties
against
the
hiring
of
illegal
immigrants
and
you
will
remove
the
major
attraction
that
draws
people
to
this
country
illegally
-
jobs
.
</s>
<s>
Without
jobs
and
the
prospect
of
a
much
better
life
the
vast
majority
of
people
will
stay
home
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
As
President
I
would
do
one
thing
to
ensure
that
this
situation
does
n't
happen
again
,
I
would
make
sure
our
laws
are
enforced
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
First
,
I
would
instruct
all
agencies
under
my
jurisdiction
to
strictly
enforce
and
apply
the
rules
against
hiring
illegal
immigrant
workers
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Second
,
I
would
direct
that
all
instances
of
hiring
of
illegal
aliens
be
subject
to
penalty
by
jail
time
-
real
jail
time
,
not
a
&quot;
country
club
&quot;
jail
.
</s>
<s>
It
's
real
simple
for
an
employer
to
pay
a
fine
and
move
on
-
that
's
just
a
cost
of
doing
business
.
</s>
<s>
It
's
not
so
simple
to
ignore
the
threat
of
real
jail
time
in
a
real
criminal
jail
.
</s>
<s>
No
one
wants
to
face
that
prospect
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Third
,
there
would
be
no
Federally
funded
benefit
programs
available
to
illegal
immigrants
further
removing
incentives
to
come
here
illegally
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Fourth
,
I
believe
we
need
to
change
the
Constitution
so
that
only
those
born
of
American
citizens
become
citizens
of
this
country
upon
birth
.
</s>
<s>
The
founders
of
our
country
could
and
would
have
never
envisioned
the
fact
that
there
are
hundreds
of
thousands
of
babies
being
born
each
year
in
United
States
hospitals
solely
so
their
parents
can
use
their
anchor
babies
as
an
excuse
to
demand
to
stay
here
and
take
benefits
from
the
rest
of
us
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
It
's
really
that
simple
.
</s>
<s>
If
the
laws
are
enforced
and
there
are
n't
any
jobs
or
free
government
benefits
for
illegal
aliens
then
there
will
be
no
reason
for
them
to
sneak
across
the
border
and
come
here
.

Campaigning
for
the
American
presidency
is
one
of
the
most
expensive
exercises
in
the
world

<s>
How
do
you
deal
with
the
cost
and
fundraising
?

<p>
<s>
The
Internet
is
a
wonderful
vehicle
for
getting
the
word
out
about
my
campaign
.
</s>
<s>
The
Internet
is
the
base
and
then
I
rely
on
individuals
to
tell
those
they
know
and
before
long
you
build
up
a
real
snowball
effect
.
</s>
<s>
The
vast
majority
of
the
money
spent
by
the
major
candidates
is
a
complete
waste
of
money
.
</s>
<s>
When
was
the
last
time
that
someone
listened
to
an
entire
political
campaign
ad
,
did
n't
hang
up
on
a
computer
generated
phone
call
or
actually
read
the
campaign
literature
that
was
received
in
the
mail
before
tearing
it
up
?
</s>
<s>
Unfortunately
,
today
â€™s
major
party
politics
believe
in
spending
vast
quantities
of
money
,
but
rarely
spending
it
smart
.
</s>
<s>
Sounds
like
how
our
government
operates
as
well
