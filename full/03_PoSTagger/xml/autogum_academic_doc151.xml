The
conveyor
belts
used
in
different
fields
of
industry
can
be
made
in
the
manufacturing
process
either
at
the
required
dimensions
in
exploitation
or
at
other
smaller
dimensions
,
and
this
determines
the
use
of
vulcanization
as
a
process
for
combining
the
conveyor
belts
so
as
to
obtain
the
conveyor
belts
with
the
desired
performances
.
</s>
<s>
It
is
worth
noting
in
this
regard
the
need
for
joining
of
the
conveyor
belts
that
are
used
in
the
transport
of
materials
over
long
distances
.
</s>
<s>
These
strips
have
metallic
inserts
in
structure
and
are
used
for
the
transport
of
coal
and
ores
.
</s>
<s>
Thus
,
the
maximum
lengths
at
which
the
strips
with
metal
inserts
are
manufactured
are
made
up
to
210
m
,
due
to
difficulties
that
appear
in
the
technological
manufacturing
process
.
</s>
<s>
Because
this
type
of
band
has
to
transport
materials
at
much
greater
distances
than
the
manufacturing
length
,
it
is
necessary
to
combine
them
by
vulcanization
.

</p>
<p>
<s>
Thus
,
the
conveyor
belts
of
special
importance
,
which
should
have
high
mechanical
properties
,
have
different
inserts

and
their
properties
are
based
on
rubber-insertion
adhesions
and
are
used
for
equipping
high-capacity
conveyors
or
those
working
in
high
demand
conditions
(
high
slope
,
high
speed
,
reduced
length
with
frequent
alternations
with
straight
paths
and
passes
on
drums

where
very
good
breaking
resistance

great
flexibility
and
high
reliability
are
required

In
order
to
increase
the
service
life
of
the
conveyor
belts
,
it
is
necessary
to
combine
them
by
vulcanization
so
that
in
the
joining
areas
,
the
mechanical
characteristics
will
be
the
same
or
very
close
to
those
of
the
rest
of
the
belt
and
to
obtain
a
homogeneity
of
the
entire
conveyor
belt
.

</p>
<p>
<s>
In
general
,
the
vulcanization
of
the
various
rubber
products
,
but
especially
of
the
conveyor
belts
,
generates
lower
mechanical
characteristics
in
the
joint
area
than
the
rest
of
the
product
and
this
causes
a
decrease
in
the
life
of
the
product
.
</s>
<s>
In
this
sense
,
the
aim
is
to
find
a
technical
solution
that
will
allow
the
homogenization
of
the
properties
of
the
materials
in
the
joint
area
with
those
of
the
material
from
the
respective
product
.

<p>
<s>
The
adjustment
of
the
vulcanization
time
of
the
rubber
products
,
in
order
to
combine
them
,
is
made
according
to
the
thickness
of
the
rubber
in
the
area
of
their
connection
.
</s>
<s>
In
order
to
regulate
the
vulcanization
temperature
,
the
type
of
rubber
used
in
the
vulcanization
process
is
taken
into
consideration
,
and
the
pressing
pressure
is
determined
according
to
the
thickness
of
the
rubber
and
its
structure
.
</s>
<s>
Any
vulcanization
process
of
a
rubber
product
is
currently
carried
out
by
regulating
three
technological
parameters
,
namely

</item>
</list>
</p>
<p>
<s>
The
three
parameters
mentioned
above
may
take
different
values
depending
on
a
certain
type
of
rubber
product
,
and
if
the
adjustment
of
these
parameters
is
not
achieved
at
optimum
values
then
the
results
obtained
regarding
the
characteristics
of
the
joint
area
are
not
appropriate
.
</s>
<s>
The
inadequate
results
are
mainly
determined
by
the
presence
in
the
joint
area
of
a
high
porosity
of
the
joint
material
but
also
of
an
uneven
thickness
of
the
conveyor
belt
,
and
this
causes
a
decrease
of
the
mechanical
characteristics
of
the
joints
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
The
reduction
of
the
porosity
in
the
joint
area
can
be
obtained
by
the
appropriate
adjustment
of
the
three
technological
parameters
presented
at
optimal
values
.
</s>
<s>
In
the
process
of
jointing
by
vulcanization
,
the
pressing
pressure
is
one
of
the
parameters
of
special
importance
.
</s>
<s>
At
present
,
different
opinions
have
been
issued
regarding
the
influence
of
the
pressing
pressure
,
but
in
particular
the
research
carried
out
refers
to
metallic
materials
and
less
to
rubber
materials
or
composite
materials
with
rubber
matrix
.
</s>
<s>
An
uneven
distribution
of
the
pressing
pressure
on
the
width
of
the
conveyor
belt
can
result
in
a
non-corresponding
quality
for
the
realized
joint
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
A
main
cause
that
determines
the
removal
of
the
conveyor
belts
is
that
in
the
joint
area
is
not
obtained
an
uniform
thickness
of
the
conveyor
belt
and
thus
the
dimensional
error
of
the
type
“
bell
”
appears
,
meaning
that
the
conveyor
belt
has
in
the
joint
area
a
much
greater
thickness
in
the
middle
compared
to
the
outer
parts
.
</s>
<s>
This
fact
is
determined
by
the
fact
that
the
used
vulcanization
facility
has
an
unoptimized
metal
structure
that
deforms
very
much
during
the
vulcanization
in
the
sense
that
it
has
a
very
large
deformation
in
the
middle
.
