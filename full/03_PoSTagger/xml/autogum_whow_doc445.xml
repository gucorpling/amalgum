Close

<s>
The
biggest
single
source
of
radiant
heat
loss
in
your
apartment
is
most
likely
your
windows
(
especially
if
they
are
old
,
single-pane
windows
)
.
</s>
<s>
It
may
seem
like
an
obvious
tip
,
but
check
all
of
the
windows
in
your
apartment
to
make
sure
they
are
closed
and
locked
during
the
winter
.
</s>
<s>
As
well
,
try
to
avoid
opening
the
windows
at
all
,
if
possible

Even
if
you
keep
your
windows
closed
,
however

warm
air

still
escape

<s>
Around
the
edges
of
a
loose
pane
or
through
cracks
in
the
glass
.
</s>
<s>
To
prevent
warm
air
from
escaping
through
the
window
frame
,
you
can
install
durable
metal
or
plastic
weather-stripping
between
the
window
sash
and
frame
.
</s>
<s>
Typically
,
these
types
of
weather-stripping
will
last
for
several
years
and
do
not
interfere
with
the
regular
use
of
the
window
.

Draft-Proof
Your

</hi>
</s>
<s>
Just
like
your
windows
,
keeping
your
apartment
door
closed
as
much
as
possible
during
the
winter
will
help
keep
the
heat
where
it
belongs

in

in

You
can
also
draft-proof
your

with
weather-stripping

Warm
air

In
most
apartments
,
the
vast
majority

warm

is
lost
under

<s>
Installing
a
door
sweep
or
a
draft-stopper
to
prevent
air
from
moving
under

door
can
prevent
this
loss

keep
your

warm

These
supplies

found
inexpensively

hardware

<s>
In
addition
to
keeping
your
apartment
comfortable
,
weatherproofing
your
doors
and
windows
will
also
save
a
lot
of
energy
as
you
wo
n’t
be
using
as
much
heat

warm

Do
n’t
Block
Your
Radiators
</hi>
</s>
<s>
Finally
,
if
your
apartment
has
radiators
,
they
should
always
be
kept
clean
–
any
amount
of
dirt
and
dust
sitting
on
top
of
them
will
absorb
some
of
the
heat
that
is
being
produced

</s>
<s>
You
should
also
remove
any
radiator
covers
when
the
heat
is
on
,
as
covers
can
block
the
airflow
through
the
radiator
in
addition
to
absorbing
heat
.

<s>
Be
sure
to
also
move
your
furniture
so
that
all
chairs
,
couches
,
bookcases
,
entertainment
units
,
desks
,
beds
,
etc.
are
n’t
too
close
to
your
radiators
or
heating
convectors
.
</s>
<s>
Do
n’t
let
your
drapes
or
curtains
cover
them
either
,
as
they
will
divert
heat
to
the
windows
(
and
therefore
out
of
your
apartment
if
they
are
n’t
properly
sealed
)
instead
of
into
the
rest
of
the
room
.
