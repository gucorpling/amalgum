You

the
barking

screaming

super-loud
movies
and
blaring

If
this

Believe

Carpets
do
a

good
job
of
absorbing
sound
in

instead

reflecting

rugs
you

the

the

Wall-Hangings

Sure

carpets
work
if

the
tenants
below
your

are
making
all
the

If
it
’s
the
people
beside

that
you
have
to
worry
about

try
putting
up
a

apartment

the

make
a
big
impact

Curtains
or

are
useful
in
reducing

wherever
they
are
located

whether
it
’s
on
a
wall

over
a
window
(
to
block
out

simply
placed
across

open

wall-hangings

can
