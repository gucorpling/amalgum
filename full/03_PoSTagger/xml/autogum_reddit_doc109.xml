How
much
are
basic
classification
neural
networks
actually
used
?

Most
courses
in
Machine
Learning
begin
with
basic
neural
networks
where
you
learn
how
feed-forward
and
back-propagation
works
,
and
regularisation
.
</s>
<s>
For
example
,
the
first
part
of
the
Stanford
Machine
Learning
course
on
classification
.
</s>
<s>
I
was
wondering
,
how
far
can
you
get
with
that
basic
approach
?
</s>
<s>
Is
it
scalable
to
real-world
problems
,
and
do
people
actually
use
vanilla
NNs
much
(
without
convolutions
or
other
fancy
stuff
)
?
I
'm
just
curious
what
bare
minimum
knowledge
is
required
to
actually
&quot;
get
<hi rend="bold">
real
</hi>
stuff
done
&quot;
in
ML
that
is
n't
just
MNIST
digit
classification
.
</s>
<s>
I
guess
my
question
also
extends
to
the
basic
techniques
in
unsupervised
learning
too
.
</s>
<s>
The
fact
that
ML
jobs
pay
so
well
makes
me
skeptical
that
you
can
get
really
far
on
the
basics
,
but
I
'd
like
to
hear
what
people
think
.

I
'm
still
gearing
up

get

datascience

after
a
few
months
now
doing
data
engineering
work
at
a
fortune

company

<s>
I
'm
starting
to
suspect
that
at
least
part
of
the
brick
wall
waiting
for
all
those
bright
eyed
would-be
data
scientists
has
to
do
with
the
grunt
work
of
actually
working
with
the
data
.

<s>
The
logistics
of
even
just
deploying
a
raw
ETL
pipeline
is
not
trivial
.
</s>
<s>
Even
just
getting
functional
enough
with
pandas
to
be
productive
with
basic
data
munging
is
again
...
not
trivial
.

What
's
that

Another
f'ing

utf-8

parse

The

API

're
pulling

spit
out
some
random
unicode
characters

a
Japanese
street
address
that
broke
the
system

<s>
Your
logging
sucks
and
it
took
you
two
hours
to
hunt
down
a
simple
bug
?

<s>
You
were
n't
organized
setting
up
your
ETL
DAG
and
now
it
's
a
pain
in
the
ass
to
run
the
second
half
of
this
job
after
you
hit
a
fail
point
halfway
through
?
Your
docker
skills
suck
so
you
do
n't
even
know
how
to
contribute
to
the
conversation
with
the
team
about
how
to
get
this
thing
deployed
on
AWS
?

<s>
Holy
fuck
you
guys
,
there
's
a
lot
to
learn
.

<s>
I
suspect
the
majority
of
the
companies
out
there
looking
to
get
more
into
ML
do
n't
have
the
data
to
go
beyond
making
more
basic
predictions
with
scikit-learn

Getting
production
ready

with
just
a
basic
logistic
classifier

no

gut

what
little
it
's
worth

I
wonder
how
much
vanilla
NNs
are
used
as
well
,
but
I
have
a
DS
friend
that
mostly
does
n't
deal
with
NNs
at
all

done
