<hi rend="bold">
The
Warren
,
by
Brian
Evenson
.
</hi>
*
It
's
an
interesting
little
sci
-fi
book
about
a
person
who
interacts
with
the
last
human
that
had
actually
been
created
by
fertilization
.
</s>

Very
philosophical
,

I
think
it
stops
too

Touching

Distance
,
by
Deborah

</hi>

<item>

This
is
about
Ian
Curtis
of
Joy
Division
,
written
by
his
widow
.
</s>
<s>
There
are
heated
reviews
mad
at
what
she
has
written
about
him
,
and
while
the
picture
she
paints
is
n't
a
happy
one
I
have
no
reason
to
doubt
she
tells
the
truth
about
how
bizarre
he
was
,
and
his
tendency
to
be
dishonest
and
abusive
.
</s>
<s>
Very
depressing
read
though
,
I
actually
needed
to
find
a
way

de

blowing
through
it

day

Through
the
Shadowlands
by
Julie
Rehmeyer
.
</s>
</hi>
</item>
<item>
<s>
This
is
about
a
science
writer
's
journey
through
chronic
fatigue
syndrome
and
figuring
out
what
was
likely
causing
her
symptoms
and
her
ability
to
get
back
to
health
and
a
new
life
.
</s>
<s>
She
repeatedly
claims
to
have
wanted
to
focus
only
on
the
science
of
the
illness
and
potential
solutions
but
even
she
writes
some
scientific
errors
in
her
own
book
.
</s>
<s>
It
's
rather
meandering
and
unfocused
too
,
but
it
's
an
autobio
of
sorts
,
so
I
guess
that
can
be
expected
.

I

*
*All
Our
Wrong
Todays
by
Elan
Mastai
after
avoiding
it
for
months
and
now
I
wish
I
started
it
as
soon
as
I
first
thought
of
reading
it
!
</s>
<s>
It
's
really
amusing
,
told
by
a
disappointment
of
a
son
by
a
genius
who
created
time
travel
,
and
somehow
he
screws
things
up
royally
so
he
's
stuck
in
OUR
version
of
2016
instead
of
a
technologically
advanced
2016
that
he
came
from
.
