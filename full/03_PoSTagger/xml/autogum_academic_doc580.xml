In
this
study
,
we
developed
a
simple
EAG
detection
algorithm
for
flying
robots
.
</s>
<s>
The
conditional
EMA
filter
and
D-Counter
provide
a
unique
algorithm
that
can
be
adopted
for
handling
different
cases
or
changing
the
sensitivity
by
adjusting
the
smoothing
factor
<hi rend="italic">
α

,
window
size
<hi rend="italic">

and
threshold

Compared
with
the
simple
fixed
threshold
detection
,
the
D-Counter
conferred
a
high
accuracy
of
detection
(
quantified
using
a
cross-correlation
coefficient
between
the
detection
output
and
stimulus
input
signals
)
.
</s>
<s>
Moreover
,
applying
the
conditional
EMA
filter
with
an
appropriate
smoothing
factor
<hi rend="italic">
α
</hi>
can
reduce
the
individual
differences
even
if
it
is
applied
to
signals
with
variable
signal
amplitudes
and
the
baseline
.
</s>
<s>
The
individual
diversity
in
bio-sensing
technology
has
been
the
major
problem
as
each
individual
has
different
characteristics
.
</s>
<s>
Such
diversity
is
caused
not
only
by
the
native
difference
of
individual
moths
but
also
by
the
differences
among
antenna
preparations
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
the
reduction
in
response
diversity
is
also
the
advantage
of
our
algorithm
.
</s>
<s>
In
addition
to
the
development
of
signal
processing
,
our
simplified
and
easy-to-set
up
experimental
technique
using
an
antenna
holder
can
unify
the
conditions
of
antenna
preparations
and
reduce
the
individual
differences
.
</s>
<s>
How
to
minimise
the
effect
of
the
individual
differences
is
the
great
challenge
when
utilising
insect
antennae
for
practical
use
as
chemical
sensors
.
</s>
<s>
Improvements
in
both
signal
processing
and
experimental
procedure
are
required
.

<s>
The
odour-evoked
EAG
response
encodes
multiple
information
of
an
odour
filament
.
</s>
<s>
The
fast
response
onset
indicates
the
timing
of
odour
arrival
,
the
amplitude
indicates
odour
concentration
,
the
duration
of
a
negative
potential
indicates
the
duration
of
odour
contact
,
and
the
waveform
of
a
single
response
can
be
altered
by
different
odourants
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
all
the
information
would
be
available
only
when
an
odour
is
applied
under
a
well-controlled
condition
and
the
EAG
is
obtained
using
the
same
preparation
.
</s>
<s>
In
particular
,
unlike
gas
sensors
,
it
is
difficult
to
estimate
the
absolute
odour
concentration
from
the
amplitude
of
EAGs
because
the
amplitude
of
an
EAG
to
a
certain
odour
concentration
varies
by
individual
preparations
and
their
conditions
,
and
the
signal
decays
even
if
the
antenna
is
in
a
continuous
odour
flow
.
</s>
<s>
Although
our
algorithm
only
tells
us
the
onset
and
offset
of
each
odour
response
,
this
will
not
be
a
problem
for
odour
tracking
.
</s>
<s>
Because
the
duration
of
a
single
odour
contact
for
flying
insects
is
short
(
several
hundred
milliseconds
or
less
)
,
the
detection
of
the
odour
onset
and
offset
would
be
more
reliable
than
odour
concentration
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
as
long
as
we
use
odour-searching
algorithms
of
flying
insects
in
which
the
behaviours
are
triggered
by
odour
onset
or
offset
,
our
algorithm
of
signal
processing
will
be
effective
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
our
algorithm
cannot
be
used
for
a
searching
algorithm
based
on
the
concentration
gradient
of
odour
,
such
as
osmotropotaxis
,
in
which
an
insect
turns
to
the
side
of
higher
odour
concentration
(
i.
e.
,
the
side
of
an
odour
source
if
the
odour
flow
is
continuous
)
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
whether
flying
insects
during
manoeuvres
avail
the
odour
gradient
during
such
a
short
period
is
still
in
question
,
even
though
they
are
capable
of
detecting
it
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Not
only
the
odour
concentration
,
but
the
timing
of
response
onset
also
tells
us
the
side
of
an
odour
source
if
bilateral
information
is
acquired
by
two
organs
spatially
separated
.
</s>
<s>
It
has
been
reported
that
sharks
and
silkmoths
turn
based
on
the
time
difference
of
odour
arrivals
between
their
left
and
right
olfactory
organs
.
</s>
<s>
Because
the
timing
of
response
onset
of
the
EAG
and
its
temporal
dynamics
are
highly
reproducible
,
the
time
difference
in
EAG
onsets
between
two
antennae
spatially
separated
can
be
used
to
determine
the
side
to
turn
.
Kanazaki
et
al.
implemented

time
difference
of
EAG
responses
between
two
antennae
to
the
network
model
on
an
antennae-loaded
land
robot
.
</s>
<s>
Furthermore
,
whether
the
timing
of
different
odour
arrivals
is
synchronised
or
not
is
supposed
to
be
a
cue
for
insects
to
recognise
the
odourants
as
mixed
or
not
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
the
timing
of
odour
onset
is
solely
meaningful
,
and
how
to
utilise
it
for
efficient
searching
should
be
investigated
in
the
future
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
The
time
necessary
for
processing
signals
in
our
algorithm
is
mainly
constrained
by
the
window
size
<hi rend="italic">
swin
</hi>
,
whereas
the
computational
load
for
the
algorithm
itself
is
low
.
</s>
<s>
We
showed
that
either
<hi rend="italic">
swin
</hi>
=
0.1
s
or
0.2
s
can
output
an
accurate
estimation
of
the
olfactory
input
,
which
correspond
to
0.1
s
or
0.2
s
of
latency
if
the
algorithm
is
operated
in
real
time
.
</s>
<s>
Although
the
time
delay
should
be
as
minimised
as
possible
,
it
is
worth
noting
that
the
response
delay
of
a
surge
(
the
upwind
flight
triggered
by
an
odour
contact
)
is
approximately
0.2
s
in
moths
and
flies
.
</s>
<s>
The
allowance
of
response
delay
for
successful
odour
source
localisation
was
estimated
to
be
0.4
s
,
which
was
investigated
employing
a
silkmoth-driven
land
robot
.
</s>
<s>
Altogether
,
considering
the
time
required
for
sensory-motor
control
of
insects
,
the
time
delay
for
signal
processing
in
our
algorithm
does
not
prevent
us
from
availing
odour-searching
algorithms
of
insects
for
the
drone
.
