The
deep
economic
morass
which
is
facing
our
country
today
is
not
being
adequately
addressed
.
</s>
<s>
We
are
witnessing
,
through
the
sub-prime
mortgage
crisis
,
the
greatest
wealth
transfer
in
our
history
from
Black
and
Latino
households
.
</s>
<s>
Yet
,
while
they
are
being
asked
to
tighten
their
belts
,
the
CEOs
of
the
banks
that
caused
this
crisis
are
reaping
maximum
pay
.
</s>
<s>
Even
the
solutions
proposed
by
the
major
candidates
focus
on
using
taxpayers
'
funds
to
reimburse
the
banks
instead
of
funding
alternative
refinancing
in
the
poorest
communities
.
</s>
<s>
It
is
clear
that
in
this
scenario
,
the
banks
always
win
.

</p>
<p>
<s>
Well
,
I
think
it
's
time
that
the
people
win
.

<s>
Our
children
should
n't
have
to
graduate
from
college
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
in
debt
.
</s>
<s>
That
is
a
policy
choice
made
by
public
policy
makers
.
</s>
<s>
We
do
n't
have
to
have
48
million
Americans
without
access
to
health
insurance
,
and
even
more
who
are
under-insured
.
</s>
<s>
Our
Congress
does
n't
have
to
authorize
an
increase
in
national
borrowing
to
nearly
$
10
trillion
shrouded
in
secrecy
.
</s>
<s>
This
country
should
not
have
racial
disparity
gaps
wider
now
than
at
the
time
of
the
murder
of
Dr.
Martin
Luther
King
,
Jr.
But
these
are
the
facts
about
conditions
that
Americans
are
forced
to
live
through
every
day
.
</s>
<s>
Sadly
,
our
policy
makers
would
rather
have
our
country
spend
$
720
million
a
day
on
war
.
</s>
<s>
Just
imagine
what
that
amount
could
buy
in
a
single
payer
health
care
system
,
education
subsidies
from
Head
Start
to
university
,
or
green
technology
home
conversions
and
sustainable
,
safe
and
non-polluting
energy
sources

Politics
can
change
things
.
</s>
<s>
I
have
seen
that
in
my
lifetime
.
</s>
<s>
But
we
must
have
policy
makers
committed
to
the
kind
of
public
policy
that
reflects
our
values
and
those
policy
makers
must
be
more
than
marionettes
whose
strings
are
pulled
by
forces
not
seen
or
understood
by
the
voters
.
</s>
<s>
Those
are
some
of
the
compelling
reasons
why
I
chose
to
leave
the
Democratic
Party
after
many
years
and
to
run
for
President
on
the
Green
Party
ticket

The

policy
positions

considerations
