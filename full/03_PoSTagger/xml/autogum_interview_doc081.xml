<s>
And
when
I
went
through
in
my
mind
the
different
courses
of
action
that
could
get
us
there
I
kept
coming
back
to
the
referendum
and
I
did
not
see
another
way
that
we
could
bring
final
closure
and
resolution
to
this
issue
,
this
very
sensitive
and
difficult
issue
,
without
passing
it
to
the
people
for
an
up
or
down
vote
.
</s>
<s>
Because
of
the
path
that
we
chose
,
there
is
going
to
be
pressure
to
bring
this
back
next
year
and
possibly
years
beyond
that
.
</s>
<s>
So
the
state
of
Indiana
is
going
to
be
forced
to
deal
with
this
issue
year
in
and
year
out
.

Which
is
my
fear

Shipman
:
With
the
polls
in
Indiana
showing
a
change
in
public
opinion
over
the
past
several
years
that
is
more
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recognition%20of%20same-sex%20unions%20in%20Indiana">
favorable
to
the
acceptance
of
same-sex
marriage
</ref>
,
do
you
think
it
's
going
to
be
harder
to
support
traditional
marriage
in
the
future
?
</s>
</p>
<p>

<hi rend="bold">
MD

<s>
:
Well
not
for
me
because
I
am
who
I
am
and
I
support
what
I
support
,
and
I
support
traditional
and
Judeo-Christian
values
.
</s>
<s>
I
think
if
the
polling
data
is
accurate
,
as
you
expressed
it
,
then
the
folks
that
were
the
opponents
of
HJR-3
—
specifically
the
folks
that
were
in
leadership
within
Freedom
Indiana
—
were
working
against
their
own
self-interest
.
</s>
<s>
Why
do
I
say
that
?
</s>
<s>
Well
if
public
opinion
has
truly
changed
then
it
was
in
their
interest
to
pass
this
through
the
legislature
and
send
it
to
the
people
themselves
for
an
up
or
down
vote
were
the
referendum
would
be
defeated
and
the
issue
would
forever
be
gone
and
dealt
with
.
</s>
<s>
And
so
I
think
there
is
some
dispute
where
public
opinion
is
.
</s>
<s>
This
is
a
very
sensitive
issue
.
</s>
<s>
It
divides
families
.
</s>
<s>
It
divides
political
parties
.
</s>
<s>
It
divides
neighbors
.
</s>
<s>
Obviously
you
know
about
my
family
,
and
there
is
a
difference
of
opinion
just
with
me
and
brother
on
this
issue
.
</s>
<s>
There
's
a
difference
between
me
and
my
mother
on
this
opinion
.
</s>
<s>
There
's
even
a
difference
of
opinion
in
the
Delph
household
—
in
the
house
where
I
live
.
</s>
<s>
And
so
these
are
all
things
that
our
state
and
society
have
to
reconcile
.
</s>
<s>
But
to
me
the
ultimate
issue
was
bringing
this
whole
thing
to
closure
and
by
denying
people
the
right
to
vote
this
November
we
did
not
bring
this
to
closure
.

Since

long
lasting
consequences
on

did
n't

this
time

<p>

<hi rend="bold">

<s>
:
Well
some
could
say
that
.
</s>
<s>
If
that
brings
the
issue
to
final
closure
.
</s>
<s>
But
having
sat
in
the
legislature
now
for
eight
years
,
I
think
there
's
going
to
be
pressure
to
bring
this
back
this
next
session
—
some
sort
of
version
.
</s>
<s>
And
it
may
be
amended
to
make
it
tougher
.
</s>
<s>
They
may
put
the
civil
union
ban
back
in
it
,
which
then
puts
it
on
another
two
years
.
</s>
<s>
And
so
for
me
,
I
do
n't
think
the
information
is
going
to
be
any
clearer
.
</s>
<s>
I
do
n't
think
the
issue
are
going
to
be
any
better
understood
.
</s>
<s>
To
me
it
did
n't
make
any
sense
to
delay
the
final
resolution
of
this
once
and
for
all
.
</s>
<s>
And
for
me
again
,
the
only
way
that
I
could
see
us
bringing
this
to
final
closure
was
to
have
the
referendum
by
the
public
.
</s>
<s>
And
if
public
opinion
has
changed
,
then
those
that
support
same-sex
marriage
worked
against
their
own
self-interest
by
denying
the
people
the
right
to
vote
on
this
in
November
of
2014
.
</s>
<s>
Because
if
they
would
have
allowed
the
vote
and
public
opinion
had
changed
,
then
they
probably
would
have
voted
the
referendum
down
and
that
would
have
been
the
debate
once
and
for
all
.
