<s>
When
I
did
that
,
I
did
that
to
satisfy
inquiry
from
probably
over
half
a
dozen
different
media
outlets
that
were
going
to
ask
me
or
had
asked
me
what
I
was
going
to
do
.
</s>
<s>
Rather
than
have
the
same
discussion
,
six
to
ten
different
times
,
I
just
wanted
to
handle
it
at
once
during
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Twitter">
Twitter
</ref>
.
</s>
<s>
But
what
I
did
n't
anticipate
at
the
time
was
that
everybody
under
the
sun
would
retweet
that
tweet
and
I
would
start
to
trend
nationally
.
</s>
<s>
At
that
point
,
this
evolved
into
a
whole
other
level
of
newsworthiness
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Senator
Long
came
back
on
the
floor
and
asked
me
about
it
and
I
explained
what
I
did
and
why
.
</s>
<s>
At
the
time
,
I
thought
things
were
resolved
between
the
two
of
us
.
</s>
<s>
It
was
only
later
that
he
had
a
media
availability
and
he
kind
of
blasted
me
and
accused
me
of
leaking
a
caucus
confidence
that
we
really
started
to
get
into
it
within
the
press
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
And
at
that
point
in
time
,
I
made
the
decision
to
hold
my
news
conference
and
to
vote
against
HJR-3
,
if
he
would
not
allow
the
second
sentence
to
be
restored
.
</s>
<s>
I
did
that
for
a
couple
of
reasons
.
</s>
<s>
One
of
which
was
I
had
passed
out
a
legal
memorandum
from
a
very
reputable
source
out
of
Washington
D.C.
that
had
told
us
that
without
the
second
sentence
,
our
amendment
had
no
legal
consequences
.
</s>
<s>
So
we
were
basically
passing
a
statement
that
had
no
legal
significance
.
</s>
<s>
And
for
me
,
given
how
divisive
this
was
and
how
draining
it
was
in
terms
of
energy
and
what
not
,
it
did
n't
make
any
sense
to
me
to
pass
something
for
political
purposes
that
was
n't
going
to
have
any
legal
consequence
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
And
again
,
I
talked
about
all
of
that
in
my
press
conference
on
YouTube
.
</s>
<s>
If
you
have
n't
seen
it
,
it
will
take
thirty
minutes
of
your
life
to
watch
it
.
</s>
<s>
It
was
carried
live
on
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/ABC_News">
ABC
</ref>
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WRTV">
Channel
6

news
affiliate
in
Indianapolis
and
I
walked
through
methodically
the
chronology
of
events
at
that
press
conference
.

<s>
And
I
was
trying
to
bring
to
light
my
reasoning
and
thinking
as
to
why
I
felt
like
this
was
a
set
up
job
from
the
beginning
and
that
there
was
no
intention
to
get
this
to
the
people

And
how
Senator
Long
had
controlled
the
process
.
</s>
<s>
And
how
every
step
of
the
process
the
decisions
that
he
made
gave
evidence
to
what
I
was
saying
that
the
people
were
never
going
to
see
this
amendment
at
the
ballot
box
in
November
of
2014
.
</s>
<s>
I
also
felt
like
it
was
newsworthy
that
one
of
the
most
conservative
members
of
the
Indiana
State
Senate
was
going
to
vote
against
the
marriage
amendment
because
it
had
no
legal
consequence
.
</s>
<s>
I
wanted
to
explain
to
the
public
and
to
my
constituents
why
a
guy
that
is
a
strong
supporter
of
traditional
Judeo-Christian
values
,
was
not
going
to
support
the
marriage
amendment
.
</s>
<s>
Because
I
did
n't
believe
that
the
marriage
amendment
had
legal
consequence
.
