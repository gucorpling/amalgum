<s>
The
PSAT
is
a
standardized
test
like
the
SAT
that
measures
scholastic
aptitude
.
</s>
<s>
Many
people
say
the
PSAT
is
just
a
&quot;
practice
&quot;
SAT
,
and
that
is
mostly
true
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
it
is
used
to
determine
National
Merit
Finalist
status
which
can
win
you
a
huge
scholarship
to
dozens
of
colleges
.
</s>
<s>
To
win
the
major
awards
,
you
will
have
to
score
in
the
top
~1
%
of
students
.
</s>
<s>
This
is
a
tall
order
,
but
given
the
demographics
of
this
sub
,
many
of
you
have
a
good
shot
.
</s>
<s>
Studying
can
help
you
immensely
here
because
almost
no
one
studies
for
the
PSAT
.
</s>
<s>
This
is
probably
the
easiest
chance
you
have
at
a
full
ride
scholarship
.
</s>
<s>
Seriously
,
you
could
study
for
a
5
hours
a
week
all
summer
and
win
a
scholarship
worth
over
$150K
.
$
2,500
per
hour
is
not
a
bad
wage
to
pay
yourself
.
</s>
<s>
How
do
you
cash
in
?
</s>
<s>
Study
like
crazy
,
get
a
qualifying
score
on
the
PSAT
during
your
junior
year
,
then
follow
the
steps
once
you
are
notified
if
you
made
the
cutoff
.

<s>
Note
that
while
National
Merit
status
is
not
particularly
impressive
to
T20
schools
,
it
will
be
a
quality
,
national
award
at
many
colleges

could
be
very
helpful
for
gaining
admission

winning
other
merit
