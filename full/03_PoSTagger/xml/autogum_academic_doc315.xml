Compound
parabolic
concentrating
collectors
are
non-imaging
devices
which
have
great
potential
to
supply
sustainable
solar
thermal
energy
in
the
medium
(
90
–
300
°C
)
temperature
range
.
</s>
<s>
CPC
collectors
,
generally
,
do
n’t
need
continuous
tracking
mechanisms
for
lower
concentration
range
(
below
3×
)
and
only
seasonal
or
intermittent
adjustments
are
required
for
medium
concentration
range
(
3
–
10×
)
.
</s>
<s>
The
ability
of
CPC
collectors
to
collect
diffuse
radiation
provides
an
additional
advantage
,
especially
in
tropical
regions
where
the
percentage
of
diffuse
radiation
is
relatively
higher
.
</s>
<s>
Owing
to
the
promising
benefits
of
these
collectors
,
many
researchers
have
designed
and
evaluated
CPC
collectors
for
various
low-to-medium
temperature
applications
,
including
industrial
process
heat
,
solar
heating
and
cooling
,
water
treatment
and
purification
,
methanol
reforming
and
hydrogen
production
,
building-integrated
water
heating
systems
and
photovoltaic/thermal
(
PV/T
)
hybrid
systems
.

After
the
introduction
of
CPC
as
a
potential
candidate
for
solar
energy
collection
,
many
research
studies
have
been
conducted
in
this
field
.
</s>
<s>
Gallagher
and
Winston
reviewed
basic
principles
of
the
non-imaging
optical
design
of
CPCs
for
some
selected
arrangements
of
evacuated
and
non-evacuated
solar
collectors
.
Derrick
et
al.
analyzed
different
concentrators
with
non-evacuated
tubular
absorbers
and
compared
annual
energy
collection
for
East-West
(
E-W
)
and
North-South
(
N-S
)
orientations
.
Aguilar-Jiménez
et
al.
also
developed
and
experimentally
tested
a
CPC
collector
integrated
with
a
non-evacuated
concentric
tube
receiver
.
</s>
<s>
Stationary
installation
of
the
collector
in
an
E-W
direction
exhibited
almost
6
%
better
thermal
performance
than
the
N-S
orientation
.
</s>
<s>
The
coefficient
of
heat
losses
was
also
10
%
higher
in
the
case
of
E-W
arrangement
,
probably
due
to
the
elevated
temperature
of
the
bared
absorber
.
</s>
<s>
It
is
worth
noting
that
thermal
losses
from
the
non-evacuated
receivers
of
concentrating
collectors
are
increased
due
to
higher
surface
temperatures
resulting
from
solar
radiation
concentrated
on
the
smaller
area
of
the
absorbers
.
</s>
<s>
Thus
,
the
benefit
of
radiation
concentration
is
compromised
by
increased
thermal
losses
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
conduction
and
convection
losses
can
be
minimized
by
employing
evacuated
tube
receiver
(
ETR
)
while
radiation
losses
can
be
suppressed
by
applying
selective
coatings
at
the
absorber
surface
which
can
also
increase
energy
absorption
.
</s>
<s>
An
external
CPC
coupled
with
counterflow
absorber
with
cylindrical
fin
enclosed
in
an
evacuated
glass
tube
was
designed
,
developed
,
modeled
and
tested
by
Kim
et
al.
.

<s>
Acceptance
half
angles
of
34
°and
60
°were
selected
for
stationary
installation
in
E-W
and
N-S
directions
,
respectively
.
</s>
<s>
The
experimental
results
revealed
that
N-S
arrangement
showed
better
performance
at
relatively
lower
temperatures
(
&lt;165
°C
)
while
E-W
installation
was
best
for
higher
temperatures
(
with
40
%
efficiency
at
200
°C
)
,
probably
due
to
higher
concentration
ratio
for
this
arrangement
.
</s>
<s>
Earlier
,
Balkoski
also
analyzed
three
different
evacuated
tube
receivers
coupled
with
external
CPC
.

Acceptance
half
angles
of
34

</s>
<s>
During
the
clear
sky
conditions
,
E-W
arrangement
of
all
collectors
demonstrated
superior
performance
at
higher
temperatures
(
&gt;140
°C
)
as
compared
to
N-S
alignment
which
relatively
performed
better
at
lower
temperatures
.
</s>
<s>
Thermal
performance
of
N-S
oriented
collectors
was
slightly
better
than
E-W
installation
during
cloudy
or
hazy
conditions
.
Nkwetta
et
al.
modified
a
heat
pipe
array
by
integrating
it
with
an
internal
CPC
and
compared
the
thermal
performance
with
another
array
comprising
of
an
internal
CPC
coupled
with
direct
flow
absorber
for
both
evacuated
and
non-evacuated
options
.
</s>
<s>
Evacuated
receivers
paired
with
CPC
demonstrated
better
performance
than
other
arrangements
.
</s>
<s>
In
another
study
,
an
internal
CPC
coupled
with
direct
flow
absorbers
was
integrated
with
heat
pipe
array
as
outlet
manifold
and
was
experimentally
tested
in
both
N-S
and
E-W
configurations
.
</s>
<s>
The
experimental
results
of
N-S
arrangement
exhibited
better
performance
than
E-W
installation
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
the
optical
performance
was
only
evaluated
for
transverse
angles
of
incident
radiations
and
the
results
for
longitudinal
direction
were
not
available
for
comparative
optical
analysis
.

Energy
collection
in
a
CPC
collector
greatly
depends
on
the
absorption
of
concentrated
radiations
at
the
absorber
surface
which
is
affected
by
configuration
,
material
and
surface
properties
of
collector
components
as
well
as
manufacturing
and
alignment
accuracy
.
</s>
<s>
Ray
tracing
is
a
very
useful
tool
to
precisely
estimate
the
flux
distribution
and
amount
of
solar
energy
available
at
the
receiver
.
</s>
<s>
Many
research
studies
have
successfully
applied
this
method
to
evaluate
the
effect
of
different
parameters
on
the
optical
performance
of
solar
collectors
.
Chen
et
al.
used
ray-tracing
method
to
analyze
the
optical
performance
of
an
E-W
oriented
CPC
collector
coupled
with
tubular
receiver
for
different
truncation
heights
of
reflectors
and
tilt
angles
.
Terron-Hernandez
et
al.
also
applied
the
ray-tracing
technique
to
investigate
the
energy
availability
at
the
receiver
surface
for
static
and
multi-position
setups
in
E-W
installations
.
</s>
<s>
A
past
literature
review
illustrates
that
stationary
installation
of
a
CPC
collector
is
one
of
the
main
features
to
eliminate
the
need
for
complex
and
costly
tracking
mechanisms
.
</s>
<s>
In
addition
,
the
orientation
also
predominantly
affects
its
optical
performance
which
in
turn
influence
the
thermal
behavior
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
detailed
optical
performance
evaluation
under
different
configurations
is
imperative
for
precise
performance
prediction
,
selection
,
and
installation
to
achieve
the
optimum
yield
throughout
the
year
.
