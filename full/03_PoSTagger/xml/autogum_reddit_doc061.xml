My

question

,
is
it
feasible
for
me
to
buy
my

an
apartment
with
my

She
is

Would
this

I
know
she
would
be
able

pay
the
mortgage

of
throwing
$
800
in
rent.

I
'm
viewing
it
as
a
win-win
because
i
'll
have
an
asset
in
my
name

when
its
payed
off
that
will
be
a
huge
stress-reliever
for
me
years
down
the
road

worrying
where
she
'll
live.

Are
there

Barring

A

is
actually
a
pretty
big
liability

On

of

there
are
condo
fees

homeowners

taxes

,
as

you

What

If

Consider

My
recommendation
would
be
that
you
pay
off

first

Once

're
done
with

put

into

low-fee
