In
viewing
a
microdroplet
reactor
,
the
most
obvious
effect
is
that
of
the
restricted
volume
available
to
the
reactants
,
leading
to
the
classical
but
vaguely
defined
concept
of
‘
crowding
’
.
</s>
<s>
Considering
a
1
micrometer
(
10−6
m
)
radius
droplet
,
it
will
be
capable
of
holding
thousands
of
small
molecules
,
typically
of
nanometer
(
10−9
m
)
radius
.
</s>
<s>
The
encasing
layer
or
film
will
be
of
different
composition
to
the
interior
,
depending
upon
the
detailed
characteristics
of
the
molecules
involved
;
the
solvent
involved
is
commonly
but
not
always
water
.
</s>
<s>
For
the
law
of
mass
action
to
be
applicable
,
all
reactant
molecules
must
have
random
access
to
the
entire
volume
in
the
time
scale
concerned
.
</s>
<s>
Restriction
to
less
than
three
dimensions
will
accelerate
reactions
.
</s>
<s>
It
has
been
shown
in
the
case
of
stratospheric
ozone
that
this
is
a
relevant
consideration
.
</s>
<s>
For
scale
invariance
to
be
diagnosed
and
applied
to
the
estimation
of
entropy
and
<hi rend="italic">
G
</hi>
,
there
must
be
three
orders
of
magnitude
in
scale
,
a
condition
met
with
nanometric
resolution
in
the
observations
.
</s>
<s>
This
scaling
range
will
be
defined
by
the
three
orders
of
magnitude
between
the
inner
scale
of
a
few
mean
free
paths
and
the
outer
scale
defined
by
the
microdroplet
’s
circumference
,
much
as
a
great
circle
defines
the
outer
scale
for
the
atmosphere
.

</p>
<p>
<s>
Applying
the
principle
that
attractive
forces
produce
organization
in
the
form
of
reaction
,
these
forces
will
be
more
effective
in
microdroplets
than
in
bulk
because
they
will
be
acting
over
closer
ranges
.
</s>
<s>
The
entropic
price
is
paid
by
repulsive
forces
effecting
dissipation
and
will
also
be
constrained
by
the
microdroplet
,
which
has
a
smaller
volume
than
that
in
bulk
.
</s>
<s>
Thus
,
both
these
effects
result
in
a
favorable
effect
on
Δ
<hi rend="italic">
G

</s>
<s>
‘
Organization
’
can
be
,
for
example
,
the
production
of
oligomers
or
polymers
from
monomers
,
with
the
reaction
products
at
the
bottom
of
their
potential
well
representing
dilution
of
energy
density
.
</s>
<s>
It
should
be
emphasized
that
the
interior
of
a
microdroplet
is
unlikely
to
be
of
the
same
uniform
molar
composition
as
bulk
liquid
,
because
the
effects
of
interaction
with
the
encasing
layer
will
propagate
into
the
interior
,
with
the
result
that
composition
will
have
a
dynamical
gradient
along
a
radius
from
the
center
to
the
exterior
.
</s>
<s>
The
transfer
will
be
fluid
mechanical
rather
than
diffusive
in
the
Einstein
–
Smolukowski
sense
.

<s>
In
a
homogeneous
droplet
,
the
Gibbs
energy
of
the
confining
layer
is
regarded
as
the
surface
tension
of
the
bulk
liquid
.
</s>
<s>
In
a
heterogeneous
microdroplet
,
the
situation
is
more
complicated
.
</s>
<s>
Even
for
small
polar
molecules
in
aqueous
solution
,
the
outer
layer
will
not
be
the
same
composition
as
the
interior
.
</s>
<s>
Where
amphiphiles
and
surfactants
are
concerned
,
they
may
form
films
,
which
can
be
two-dimensional
gases
,
liquids
or
solids
,
depending
upon
surface
pressure
,
with
significant
chemical
consequences
.
</s>
<s>
In
the
case
of
a
microdroplet
with
a
liquid
or
solid
exterior
film
,
it
can
provide
a
radically
different
reaction
medium
from
either
the
interior
or
the
bulk
.
</s>
<s>
Particularly
important
in
this
context
is
the
ability
to
form
an
anhydrous
environment
of
the
condensation
reactions
that
eliminate
water
to
produce
biopolymers
,
including
peptides
,
nucleotides
and
phosphorylation
reactions
.

<p>
<s>
The
scale
of
microdroplets
is
such
that
they
fall
into
the
category
of
systems
ranging
from
mesoscopic
to
macroscopic
,
thus
being
capable
of
non-equilibrium
statistical
thermodynamic
analysis

both
experimentally
and
theoretically
