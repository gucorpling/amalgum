Positive

We

aimed
to
identify
the
factors
correlated
with
adverse

ultimately
seeking
to
determine
ways
to
improve
PS

boost
the
quality

nurses

work

Ko

investigated
overtime
hours
in
diverse
medical
departments
in
South
Korea
,
revealing
that
nurses
working
daytime
shifts
in
internal
medicine
wards
worked
more
overtime
than
did
those
in
specialized
units

Weekly
overtime
was
the
highest
in
ear-nose-and-throat
wards

the
lowest

psychiatric
wards

Similarly
,
in
our
study
,
the
number
of
nurses
working
more
than
50
h/week
was
lower
in
the
intensive
care
unit
than
in
internal
medicine
or
surgery
wards
,
presumably
because
its
ratio
of
patients
to
nurses
is
relatively
smaller
,

working
overtime
is
usually
not
necessary
.

Bae

Champion
found
that
working
hours
significantly
differed

a
significantly
higher

hospitals

long-term
care
settings
worked

40

Long

hours
are
known
to
have
detrimental
effects

health

<s>
Based
on
our
findings
,
it
is
imperative
that
hospital
nurse
managers
and
health
professionals
perceive
the
impact
of
long
working
hours
.
</s>
<s>
Furthermore
,
if
longer
working
hours
are
necessary
because
of
the
nature
of
the
department

unit
,
it
is
desirable
to
adjust
them
to
appropriate
levels
through
various
approaches
,
such
as
hiring
more

altering
the
nursing
delivery
system

<s>
In
the
present
study
,
the
scores
for
PS
competencies
decreased
with
increasing

<s>
This
result
is
in
line
with
previous
findings
that
confidence
in

perceptions
about
PS
decline
as
working
hours
increase

<s>
There
is
substantial
evidence
to
suggest
the
possibility
of
the
association
of
fatigue

shorter
sleep
with
long
working

which
can
lead
to
loss

A
recent
study

the
effect

shift

the
perceived
quality

reported
that
longer
working

negatively

More
prospective
studies
are
needed
to
identify
the
mechanism

actual
PS

Furthermore
,
the
perceptions

outcomes
by
nurses
working
more
than
50
h
were
significantly
higher

those
of
nurses
working
less

This
suggests
that
working
long
hours
exposes
nurses
to
adverse
outcomes
,
potentially
having
detrimental
effects
on
PS

In

depression
to
the
working
hours
of
public
sector
workers
in
South
Korea

those
working
more

10

reported
1.63
times
higher

those
working

10
h.
In
addition

they
reported
2.2

As

Hospital

formulate
policies

Hence

our

develop
regulations

staffing

eight

<s>
Thus
,
implementing
various
work
schedules
,
such
as
night

day-only
shifts
and
12
h
shifts
,
could
be
useful
.
