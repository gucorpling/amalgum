Phosphorus
(
P
)
and
potassium
(
K
)
are
the
most
significant
macronutrients
in
the
soil
ecosystem
after
nitrogen
(
N
)
,
which
involves
various
processes
,
i.
e.
,
energy
formation
,
nucleic
acid
synthesis
,
photosynthesis
,
glycolysis
,
respiration
,
enzymes
activation
and
redox
reactions

Nutrient
management

sustainable
crop
production

<s>
P-
and
K-efficient
cultivars
are
important
options
in
an
agro-ecosystem

</s>
<s>
Uptake
efficiencies
of
nutrients
such
as
P
and
K
are
related
to
the
abilities
of
plants
to
produce
high
yields
in
low-nutrient
conditions
.
</s>
<s>
Deficiency
in
P
is
mainly
attributed
to
its
immobilization
in
soil
.
</s>
<s>
Low
K
content
is
highly
dependent
on
soil
composition
,
especially
on
its
fixation
to
clay
particles
,
leading
to
deficiency
in
plant
uptake
.
</s>
<s>
Immobilized
P
can
be
re-mobilized
,
and
non-exchangeable
K
can
also
become
available
in
soil
solution
under
biochemical
processes
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
they
could
be
strongly
dependent
on
soil
chemistry
Exploitation
of
legumes
is
an
essential
approach
for
sustainable
agriculture
as
it
can
increase
nutrient
cycling
and
promote
soil
fertility
This
approach
can
also
potentially
improve
P
and
K
availability
in
the
soil
,
which
is
beneficial
for
plant
uptake
and
soil
microorganisms
.
</s>
<s>
Root
growth
and
root
morphological
mechanisms
of
leguminous
plants
are
the
principal
factors
that
usually
require
greater
P
and
K
levels
in
the
soil
,
which
is
also
related
to
plant
P
and
K
uptake
.

Recent

According

legumes

<s>
Soil
enzymes
play
important
roles
in
catalyzing
reactions

are
associated
,
directly

indirectly
,
with
nutrient

decomposition

<s>
The
specific
activity
of
an
enzyme
is
not
considered
useful
in
the
complete
nutrient
cycle
of
soil

it

a
particular

Some
hydrolytic
enzymes
(
e.
g.

Î²-glucosidase

N-acetyl-glucosaminidase

Leucine-aminopeptidase

phosphatase
)
,
which
are
related

C

N

P

more
responsible
