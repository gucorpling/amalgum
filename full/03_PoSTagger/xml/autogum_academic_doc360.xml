<p>

The
Norwegian
Water
Regulation
introduced
cross-sector
and
multi-level
networks
at
the
RBD
and
SD
level
.
</s>
<s>
Their
main
task
is
to
formulate
and
agree
upon
RBD
Management
Plans
and
Programmes
of
Measures
.
</s>
<s>
Since
the
management
plan
is
not
legally
binding
for
either
state
sector
authorities
or
municipalities
,
compliance
is
supposed
to
be
ensured
through
participation
in
the
entire
process
of
formulating
the
plan
(
from
identifying
and
characterizing
water
bodies
,
through
identifying
crucial
matters
and
defining
environmental
goals
,
to
the
formulation
of
the
plan
and
program
)
and
through
agreement
on
the
content
of
the
plan
and
program
.
</s>
<s>
Surveys
to
the
members
of
the
RBD
boards
revealed
strong
support
for
this
system
of
water
governance
among
all
groups
of
actors
.
</s>
<s>
The
RBD
board
members
were
optimistic
regarding
the
system
’s
ability
to
improve
the
ecological
status
of
water
and
its
ability
to
protect
and
safeguard
the
water
environment
.
</s>
<s>
Furthermore
,
they
appreciated
the
fact
that
actors
representing
different
policy
sectors
meet
at
the
RBD
and
SD
boards
,
and
that
the
River
Basin
Districts
are
the
units
for
cross-sector
coordination
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
they
recognized
several
shortcomings
and
challenges
.
</s>
<s>
A
crucial
problem
was
the
ability
to
balance
different
national
sector
policy
goals
and
solve
conflicts
of
interests
among
such
goals
.
</s>
<s>
The
planning
process
makes
the
different
actors
’
interests
and
objectives
visible
but
does
not
resolve
conflicts
of
interest
among
the
actors
(

)
.
</s>
<s>
Agriculture
is
one
of
the
sectors
that
quite
a
few
of
the
RBD
board
members
found
hard
to
reach
agreement
on
,
together
with
fish
farming
and
hydroelectric
power
production

<s>
Interestingly
,
more
RBD
members
reported
problems
reaching
agreements
in
2015
,
the
year
for
finalizing
the
management
plan
and
program
of
measures
,
than
in
2013
.
</s>
<s>
This
indicates
that
the
network
cooperation
process
had
not
managed
to
solve
conflicts
of
interest
.
</s>
<s>
These
conflicts
became
more
apparent
when
the
time
came
to
agree
on
measures
.
</s>
<s>
Informants
representing
the
farmers
’
organizations
claimed
that
it
was
impossible
to
combine
the
national
goal
of
increased
food
production
with
the
ambition
of
no
discharges
to
water
from
farming
.
</s>
<s>
An
informant
representing
the
regional
agricultural
authority
(
the
county
governor
’s
office
)
claimed
that
there
were
limits
to
the
environmental
demands
they
can
impose
on
the
farmers
and
still
expect
increased
food
production
(

As
mentioned
above
,
agriculture
has
been
identified
as
one
of
the
three
main
pressures
on
Norwegian
waters
.
</s>
<s>
In
the
two
RBDs
of
Vest-Viken
and
Glomma
,
discharge
of
nutrient
from
agriculture
land
(
particularly
grain
fields
and
vegetable
fields
)
causing
eutrophication
was
the
main
problem
related
to
agriculture
.
</s>
<s>
In
these
districts
,
measures
targeting
agriculture
were
the
most
numerous
.
</s>
<s>
The
main
body
of
measures
aim
to
target
diffuse
sources
of
nutrient
loss
.
</s>
<s>
The
listed
measures
were
efforts
to
optimize
fertilization
,
to
avoid
plowing
in
the
autumn
,
to
lay
out
vegetation
belts
along
rivers
and
streams
,
and
to
construct
hydro-technical
installations
and
coffer
dams
.
</s>
<s>
There
were
also
some
measures
targeting
point
source
discharges
of
nutrients
,
such
as
manure
storages
,
silos
,
and
green
houses

The

<p>
<s>
Norway
introduced
legal
policy
instruments
that
aimed
to
regulate
pollution
from
agriculture
in
the
1970s
.
</s>
<s>
Initially
,
the
regulations
mainly
aimed
to
target
point
source
pollution
.
</s>
<s>
Later
,
the
focus
turned
towards
diffuse
sources
of
nutrient
discharges
,
partly
because
of
Norway
’s
responsibilities
in
accordance
with
the
North
Sea
Declaration
.
</s>
<s>
For
example
,
regulation
of
manure
storages
was
introduced
in
1977
.
</s>
<s>
A
major
revision
of
this
policy
came
in
1989
.
</s>
<s>
The
main
changes
aimed
to
regulate
the
amount
and
time
of
manure
spreading
.
</s>
<s>
These
regulations
were
accompanied
by
grants
supporting
and
motivating
farmers
’
investments
in
manure
storages
and
silos
,
and
regulations
demanding
fertilization
programs
at
each
farm
.
</s>
<s>
Additional
measures
and
efforts
were
introduced
in
heavily
polluted
lakes
and
rivers
,
combined
in
task
programs
.
</s>
<s>
These
were
voluntary
measures
,
backed
up
by
economic
incentives
.
</s>
<s>
The
policy
regime
logic
determining
the
agriculture
sector
’s
policy
objectives
and
instruments
was
built
on
a
preference
for
voluntary
measures
backed
by
public-
supported
consultancy
and
economic
incentives
.

<p>
<s>
During
the
2003
agricultural
negotiation
,
the
Ministry
of
Agriculture
and
Food
and
the
farmers
’
organizations
agreed
to
introduce
a
National
Environmental
Program
in
2004
.
</s>
<s>
This
program
gathers
the
policy
sector
’s
environmental
efforts
and
has
been
revised
regularly
since
its
inception
.
</s>
<s>
The
program
lists
the
national
goals
and
identifies
the
measures
and
instruments
targeting
the
industry
’s
pressures
upon
the
natural
environment
.
</s>
<s>
It
is
formulated
by
the
Norwegian
Agriculture
Agency
,
and
approved
by
the
Ministry
of
Agriculture
and
Food
,
after
consulting
the
farmers
’
organizations
.
</s>
<s>
The
amount
of
money
allocated
to
this
program
is
settled
through
the
annual
negotiations
between
the
ministry
and
the
farmers
’
organizations
