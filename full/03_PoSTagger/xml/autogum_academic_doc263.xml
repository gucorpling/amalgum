This
paper
proposed
the
architecture
of
the
Scalable
On-line
Anomaly
Detection
System
(
SOADS
)
,
which
can
be
used
to
detect
anomalies
of
the
manufacturing
flow
by
considering
the
manufacturing
process
of
an
autonomous
and
adaptive
smart
factory
.
</s>
<s>
The
goodness
of
the
system
was
verified
via
implementation
and
experimentation
.
</s>
<s>
The
first
advantage
of
the
SOADS
is
that
it
satisfies
the
large-scale
system
requirement
,
which
is
the
ability
to
analyze
the
flow
of
objects
that
are
generated
in
large
volumes
in
an
autonomous
and
adaptive
smart
factory
.
</s>
<s>
This
advantage
is
attributable
to
the
use
of
Spark
streaming
and
Hbase
as
subsystems
,
which
are
distributed
processing
technologies
.
</s>
<s>
The
second
advantage
is
that
the
method
employed
for
subsequence
pattern
derivation
using
the
<hi rend="italic">
RELATIONAL
DEPENCENCY
TABLE
</hi>
of
the
SOADS
is
efficient
in
terms
of
the
pattern
search
time
relative
to
the
existing
PrefixSpan
algorithm
,
which
searches
from
the
length-1
pattern
.

Most
studies
related
to
smart
factories
in
academic
and
industrial
circles
are
abstract
studies
from
a
high-level
perspective
,
such
as
from
the
viewpoint
of
architecture
,
reference
models
,
and
future
prospects
,
or
they
address
current
problems
such
as
automation
,
failure
diagnosis
,
and
quality
prediction
for
unit
processes
.
</s>
<s>
The
main
contribution
of
this
study
is
that
it
proposed
,
implemented
,
and
proved
a
priori
a
system
that
can
solve
problems
that
may
occur
in
future
autonomous
and
adaptive
smart
factories
for
all
processes
by
merging
manufacturing
(
domain
)
,
information
and
communication
technology
(
ICT
)
,
and
engineering
analysis
(
methodology
)
unlike
previous
studies
.
</s>
<s>
Furthermore
,
theories
that
have
been
used
for
data
mining
and
gene
sequence
analysis
were
applied
to
the
smart
factory
(
new
territory
)
using
distributed
computing
technology
(
new
computer
environment
)
,
thus
demonstrating
that
Big
Data
technology
,
which
is
a
next-generation
technology
,
can
further
evolve
existing
theories
,
which
can
be
applied
to
various
fields
.

The
anomaly
detection
perspective
in
this
study
is
centered
on
control
flow
,
and
anomaly
detection
studies
from
more
diverse
perspectives
are
required
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
in
the
future
,
we
would
need
to
expand
this
study
to
more
intensively
investigate
process
anomaly
detection
by
considering
multiple
perspectives
including
the
time
perspective
,
such
as
processing
time
and
movement
time
,
the
data
perspective
by
considering
the
properties
,
types
,
and
cost
of
objects
,
and
the
contextual
perspective
such
as
temperature
and
humidity
changes
in
the
manufacturing
flow
.
</s>
<s>
Furthermore
,
the
simulation
data
used
in
this
study
did
not
consider
the
noise
,
which
is
inevitably
generated
when
barcodes
,
RFID
,
and
sensors
are
used
in
the
actual
manufacturing
process
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
research
on
the
derivation
of
subsequence
pattern
and
anomaly
scoring
after
refinement
of
noise
of
event
logs
by
smoothing
,
noise
filtering
,
etc.
using
a
method
like
Bayesian
network
will
be
needed
.

<p>
<s>
In
the
future
,
this
research
could
be
extended
to
not
only
deriving
material
flow
patterns
in
smart
factories
,
but
also
deriving
worker
movement
and
patterns
in
factories
using
techniques
such
as
crowd
sensing
.
</s>
<s>
In
addition
,
this
research
could
be
integrated
with
numerous
Smart
X
studies
,
including
smart
logistics
,
smart
cities
and
smart
streets
,
beyond
smart
factory
fields
.
