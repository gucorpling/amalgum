<s>
Hey
,
I
need
some
advice
.
</s>
<s>
I
have
a
song
that
I
would
like
to
hire
a
professional
mixing
engineer
for
.
</s>
<s>
I
've
been
doing
my
own
mixing
for
a
couple
years
now
,
but
I
have
a
lot
of
faith
in
this
next
song
,
and
would
rather
leave
it
in
more
qualified
hands
.
</s>
<s>
My
trouble
is
whenever
I
reach
out
to
someone
I
get
their
management
asking
for
my
budget
.
</s>
<s>
I
'm
independent
so
I
do
n't
have
a
budget
,
but
they
wo
n't
tell
their
price
to
mix
the
song
.
</s>
<s>
How
do
I
navigate
this
,
and
just
get
them
to
tell
me
their
price
so
I
can
determine
if
I
can
afford
it
or
not
?
</s>
<s>
Will
I
encounter
this
asking
for
a
budget
from
everyone
?
I
'm
not
afraid
to
pay
the
hundreds
of
dollars
or
potentially
more
it
's
gonna
cost
but
I
'm
not
about
to
throw
out
a
budget
.

Hey
Kyle
,
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
I
would
be
curious
to
know
if
you
have
been
filling
in
forms
for
their
quotes
(
on
mixing
engineers
websites
)
or
emailing
them
etc
and
what
have
you
been
asking
for
?
</s>
<s>
It
seems
odd
that
none
of
them
has
given
you
a
price
.
</s>
<s>
The
advice
given
here
is
fine
but
there
are
many
mixing
engineers
who
are
at
different
levels
and
therefore
you
will
find
someone
in
your
price
range
hence
why
I
am
surprised
.
</s>
<s>
Usually
,
there
is
a
form
asking
you
basic
questions
before
the
quote
is
given
.
</s>
<s>
This
is
usually
to
save
time
down
the
line
as
the
engineer
knows
how
much
work
is
involved
,
it
may
be
a
hassle
to
do
it
but
again
if
you
have
done
it
's
odd
they
would
not
then
respond
with
their
prices
(
for
all
they
know
you
are
a
billionaire
with
a
songwriting
hobby
!
)
</s>
<s>
Sometimes
if
something
seems
off
it
is
worth
investigating
how
it
has
been
approached
.
</s>
<s>
Some
of
the
help
here
is
I
am
sure
honest
but
it
is
speculation
to
suggest
what
a
good
place
would
charge
.
</s>
<s>
If
someone
does
n't
give
you
their
prices
they
probably
are
not
a
good
fit
however
you
will
need
to
give
them
some
info
first
,
unfortunately
.
</s>
<s>
Some
of
those
who
have
straight
up
prices
or
simple
hourly
rates
may
seem
more
genuine
due
to
their
transparency
but
in
my
experience
,
it
may
not
include
everything
you
need
to
get
a
finished
mix
such
as
editing
,
tuning
etc.
</s>
<s>
They
will
either
charge
what
they
advertised
giving
you
a
result
that
is
not
really
finished
or
add
in
extras
on
top
of
the
advertized
price
whereas
often
a
quote
request
will
prompt
a
quote
that
is
total
after
they
figure
out
what
you
need
and
therefore
how
much
work
it
will
be
.
</s>
<s>
A
bit
like
an
electrician
coming
to
your
house
to
look
at
an
issue
before
giving
you
a
quote
.
</s>
<s>
Hourly
rates
are
almost
arbitary
in
my
book
,
you
do
n't
know
how
long
they
will
take
unless
you
have
used
them
before
and
how
will
you
know
if
they
have
actually
spent
that
time
doing
it
?
</s>
<s>
Again
I
would
want
my
electrician
to
look
at
the
issue
after
I
give
him
her
the
details
and
then
give
me
a
quote
.
</s>
<s>
I
do
n't
care
at
that
point
if
he
is
quick
or
not
,
I
do
n't
want
him
drawing
out
the
project
because
he
is
paid
hourly
especially
if
I
could
n't
see
him
work
on
it
.
</s>
<s>
I
know
this
is
long
and
does
n't
answer
you
directly
but
we
could
maybe
help
with
your
approach
to
stay
clear
of
charlatans
if
we
know
how
you
have
gone
about
it
.
