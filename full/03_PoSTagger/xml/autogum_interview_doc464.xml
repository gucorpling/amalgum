The

In
mathematics
at
the
PhD
level
when
I
was
studying
was
about
constructing
these
elaborate
systems

concepts

playing
around
with

fitting
them
together

More
than
ideas
is
playing
around
with
the
ideas

constructing
them
,
and
creating
something
out
of
them

</s>
<s>
For
example
,
in
music
I
will
have
an
idea
to
put
some
different
sounds
together
or
a
melody
that
meshes
with
a
chord
sequence
or
a
sonic
mood
,
or
whatever
.
</s>
<s>
I
'm
not
the
type
of
person
who
takes
physical
things
apart
and
plays
around
with
them
,
but
I
like
taking
mental
ideas
apart
and
playing
around
with
them
.

<s>
That
's
what
appeals
to
me
about
what
I

doing
