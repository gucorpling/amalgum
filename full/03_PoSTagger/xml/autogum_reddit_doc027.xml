I
have
a
warrant

not

So
first
,
I
’ve
never
been
to
jail
,
and
I
’ve
never
had
any
serious
charges
on
my
record
,
just
a
few
speeding
tickets
here
and
there
.
</s>
<s>
About
2
years
ago
,
I
was
pulled
over
for
speeding
,
the
cop
said
he
car
smelled
like
marijuana
and
I
consented
to
a
search
(
I
had
no
idea
at
the
time
I
could
have
said
no
)
.
</s>
<s>
I
let
him
know
there
was
a
marijuana
bowl
in
the
glove
box
.
</s>
<s>
I
ended
up
getting
a
ticket
for
it
(
possession
of
drug
paraphernalia
,
which
looks
so
much
worse
on
paper
)
.
</s>
<s>
At
court
,
they
said
I
was
required
to
do
community
service
.
</s>
<s>
I
did
a
few
hours
at
a
place
in
my
city
,
but
received
no
guidance
on
the
job
and
was
just
expected
to
know
what
I
was
doing
.
</s>
<s>
I
ended
up
not
finishing
my
40
hours
.
</s>
<s>
I
went
back
to
court
and
they
gave
me
an
extension
.
</s>
<s>
I
called
some
places
and
most
of
them
did
n’t
take
community
service
,
only
volunteers
(
makes
no
sense
)
.
</s>
<s>
So
I
got
another
extension
.
</s>
<s>
Then
I
had
a
lot
of
life
stuff
happen
,
and
did
n’t
do
it
again
.
</s>
<s>
Now
I
have
a
warrant
bc
it
was
never
completed
so
I
will
have
to
go
in
front
of
a
judge
again
.
</s>
<s>
I
have
generalized
anxiety
disorder
and
am
absolutely
terrified
I
will
go
to
jail
so
I
keep
continuing
to
put
it
off
.
</s>
<s>
Will
I
go
to
jail
?
I
honestly
would
just
like
to
plead
guilty
and
pay
the
fine
,
I
know
it
will
be
on
my
record
and
all
of
that
but
I
just
want
to
move
on
so
I
do
n’t
have
to
keep
dealing
with
the
court
system
.

Might

I
doubt
it

I
've
seen
luckier

happen

criminal
years

It
tends
to
piss
them
off
if
they
give
you
multiple
chances
to
do
your
community

you
keep
not
doing
it
.

<s>
I
can
tell
you
that
from
experience
.
</s>
<s>
I
got
sentenced
to
a
year
in
jail
myself
for
it
.
</s>
<s>
I
only
had
to
serve
3
months
of
that
though
.

<s>
Out
of
all
the
shenanigans
I
pulled
that
should
have
landed
me
in
jail
,
blowing
off
the
community
service
is
what
got
me
