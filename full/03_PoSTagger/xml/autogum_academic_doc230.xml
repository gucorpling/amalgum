Introduction

<p>
<s>
Carbon
fiber-reinforced
plastic
(
CFRP
)
is
an
attractive
material
candidate
for
weight
reduction
due
to
its
high
strength-to-weight
ratio
compared
to
metals
.
</s>
<s>
It
is
especially
promising
for
the
automotive
industry
since
toughening
environmental
regulations
and
high
fuel
prices
have
demanded
reduced
carbon
emissions
and
improved
fuel
efficiency
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
the
lack
of
reliable
and
productive
means
for
joining
dissimilar
materials
has
limited
the
use
of
CFRPs
.
</s>
<s>
Only
a
handful
of
methods
for
joining
CFRP
and
other
metals
have
been
used
such
as
chemical
binders
and
a
few
mechanical
means
.
</s>
<s>
The
toxic
chemicals
comprising
the
binders
pose
serious
environmental
and
health
problems
and
the
relatively
long
processing
time
accompanied
by
the
need
for
temporary
fixtures
has
made
chemical
joining
process
inefficient
.
</s>
<s>
The
mechanical
joining
methods
usually
require
careful
alignment
of
the
holes
between
the
parts
to
be
joined
,
and
this
poses
a
challenge
for
automation
.
</s>
<s>
In
addition
,
the
added
weight
of
rivets
,
bolts
,
and
screws
increases
the
overall
weight
,
which
defeats
the
purpose
of
using
lightweight
CFRPs
.
</s>
<s>
Furthermore
,
at
the
end
of
the
lifecycle
of
the
products
,
the
presence
of
both
chemical
binders
and
mechanical
joints
makes
recycling
costly
,
which
can
be
a
significant
environmental
issue
in
the
near
future
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
there
is
a
high
demand
for
new
joining
technologies
such
as
fusion
welding
.
</s>
<s>
Fusion
welding
is
nearly
impossible
for
thermoset
CFRPs
since
they
burn
under
the
intense
heat
of
the
welding
process
.
</s>
<s>
Thermoplastic
CFRPs
,
on
the
other
hand
,
allow
fusion
welding
and
thus
can
be
a
good
alternative
for
increasing
the
production
efficiency
.
</s>
<s>
Thermoplastic
CFRP
has
been
known
to
exhibit
lower
strength
and
lower
heat
resistance
compared
to
its
thermoset
counterpart
,
but
the
recent
advancement
of
thermoplastics
has
removed
most
of
its
weaknesses
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Many
prior
studies
have
investigated
the
application
of
laser
fusion
welding
between
CFRP
and
metals
.
Katayama
et
al.
showed
that
tight
bonding
between
the
polymer
matrix
and
the
metal
surface
could
be
achieved
by
generating
bubbles
in
the
molten
zone
of
the
CFRP
matrix
.
</s>
<s>
Expanding
pressure
caused
by
the
bubbles
pushes
the
molten
polymer
flow
onto
the
metal
surface
structures
.
</s>
<s>
Surface
pre-treatments
prior
to
the
joining
process
have
been
demonstrated
as
an
effective
method
to
enhance
dissimilar
joining
strength
.
</s>
<s>
Lambiase
and
Ko
investigated
the
feasibility
of
mechanical
clinching
for
CFRP
–
aluminum
joining
and
found
that
a
high
jointing
strength
of
2.5
kN
can
be
achieved
.
Zhang
et
al.
showed
that
the
pre-treatment
of
aluminum
with
the
laser
Surfi-Sculpt
process
could
improve
the
shear
strength
of
dissimilar
joints
to
a
large
extent
and
discussed
the
bonding
and
the
failure
mechanisms
of
the
dissimilar
joints
.
</s>
<s>
The
same
group
also
investigated
the
effect
of
surface
grafting
on
the
laser
joining
strength
of
CFRP
and
aluminum
alloy
.
</s>
<s>
The
results
showed
that
the
shear
strength
of
the
joint
could
be
enhanced
up
to
600
%
using
optimized
UV
grafting
parameters
,
and
new
bonds
including
Al
–
C
and
Al
–
O
–
C
could
be
the
reason
for
such
high
joining
strength
improvement
.

In
this
study
,
we
investigate
the
influence
of
pre-inscribed
laser
surface
patterning
,
via
nanosecond
pulse
laser
,
on
the
laser
fusion-bonding
strength
of
carbon
fiber-reinforced
polyetheretherketone
(
CFR-PEEK
)
and
zinc-coated
steel
(
so-called
galvannealed
steel
)
.
</s>
<s>
The
materials
are
chosen
since
PEEK
is
considered
as
one
of
the
most
promising
candidates
for
replacing
PA6
or
PA66
for
a
thermoplastic
polymer
matrix
for
carbon
fiber
composites
due
to
its
high
thermal
resistance
,
mechanical
strength
,
and
moisture
resistance
,
and
zinc-coated
steel
has
been
increasingly
adopted
in
the
automotive
industry
for
improved
corrosion
resistance
.

Optimization
of
the
processing
parameters
,
including
laser
power
,
focal
position
,
pitch
,
number
of
passes
,
and
clamping
pressure
was
done
prior
to
introducing
the
pre-inscribed
laser
patterns
.
</s>
<s>
Then
,
the
laser
power
,
a
number
of
passes
,
and
pitch
were
varied
to
find
the
optimized
patterning
parameters
using
the
secondary
nanosecond
laser
.
</s>
<s>
The
tensile
shear
strength
test
reveals
that
the
strength
of
the
joint
with
laser
surface
structuring
increased
by
up
to
100
%
compared
to
that
of
the
samples
without
surface
structures
.
</s>
<s>
We
also
present
SEM
images
of
the
patterned
surface

the
cross-section
of
the
joint
to
investigate
the
nature

increased
bonding
strength

the
optimized
parameters
