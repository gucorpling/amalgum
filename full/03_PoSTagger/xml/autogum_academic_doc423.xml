With
the
development
of
the
economy
and
improvements
in
quality
of
life
,
the
demand
for
energy
is
increasing
.
</s>
<s>
Meanwhile
,
the
exploitation
and
utilization
of
irreproducible
fossil
fuels
worldwide
has
made
energy
crises

environmental
pollution
,
and
global
warming
increasingly
prominent
.
</s>
<s>
Thus
,
there
is
an
urgent
need
to
seek
a
renewable
and
clean
energy
source
as
an
alternative
.
</s>
<s>
To
date
,
hydrogen
energy
has
been
regarded
as
an
ideal
alternative
energy
source
because
of
the
clean
byproduct
(
i.
e.
,
water
vapor
)
produced
from
its
reaction
with
oxygen
and
the
varieties
of
production
methods
.
</s>
<s>
Among
the
various
production
methods
,
the
photobiological
hydrogen
production
of
microorganisms
is
considered
to
be
an
important
potential
method
,
since
hydrogen
production
processes
are
operated
at
ambient
temperatures
and
pressures
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
The
photobiological
hydrogen
production
processes
of
microorganisms
can
be
classified
as
follows
:
</s>
<list>
<item>
<s>
Photolysis
of
water
using
algae
and
cyanobacteria
.
</s>
<s>
For
green
algae
,
the
electrons
are
derived
from
water
under
the
light
and
used
to
reduce
protons
,
to
produce
a
hydrogen
molecule
with
hydrogenase
enzymes
in
a
hydrogen
production
process
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
for
cyanobacteria
and
blue-green
algae
,
the
electrons
from
the
photolysis
process
of
water
are
first
converted
into
organic
molecules
.
</s>
<s>
Then
,
these
organic
molecules
are
degraded
and
the
electrons
are
used
by
the
hydrogenase
and/or
nitrogenase
enzymes
to
produce
hydrogen
.
</s>
</item>
<item>
<s>
Photodecomposition
of
organic
compounds
by
photosynthetic
bacteria
.
</s>
<s>
For
hydrogen
production
of
photosynthetic
bacteria
,
the
electrons
are
derived
from
external
organic
medium
of
photosynthetic
bacteria
in
photo-fermentation
and
are
used
by
nitrogenase
to
generate
H2
.

<p>
<s>
In
the
processes
of
photobiological
hydrogen
production
of
cyanobacteria
,
levels
of
around
30
%
O2
in
the
mixed
gases
with
H2
is
dangerous
for
the
system
.
</s>
<s>
In
addition
,
the
processes
of
hydrogen
production
of
photosynthetic
bacteria
cause
water
pollution
and
CO2
emissions
.
</s>
<s>
In
photobiological
H2
production
system
of
green
algae
,
hydrogenase
is
particularly
sensitive
to
O2
.
Melis
et
al.
showed
that
pure
hydrogen
production
can
be
achieved
by
Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii
under
sulfur
deprivation
.
</s>
<s>
This
means
that
the
oxygen
inhibition
of
hydrogenase
and
the
danger
of
gases
mixed
with
H2
and
O2
can
be
avoided
.
</s>
<s>
In
fact
,
the
photobiological
H2
production
process
of
C.
reinhardtii
can
generally
be
divided
into
three
phases
.
</s>
<s>
In
the
first
phase
,
C.
reinhardtii
grows
through
ordinary
photosynthesis
.
</s>
<s>
In
the
second
phase
,
C.
reinhardtii
is
cultured
in
a
sulfur-deprived
medium
,
and
O2
production
is
slowed
down
.
</s>
<s>
In
the
third
phase
,
the
anaerobic
state
of
cells
is
achieved
by
sulfur
deprivation
,
and
cells
produce
pure
hydrogen
.
</s>
<s>
Until
now
,
the
Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii
has
been
regarded
as
a
potential
best
candidate
for
photobiological
hydrogen
production
,
because
of
its
abilities
to
absorb
CO2
and
large
photosynthetic
efficiency
,
which
are
larger
than
higher
plants
(
e.
g.
,
tree
or
sugar
cane
)
.
</s>
<s>
Moreover
,
the
hydrogen
production
of
C.
reinhardtii
has
been
studied
extensively
,
and
this
means
that
mass
data
experimental
data
,
radiation
characteristics

characteristic
parameters

the
photobiological
H2

be

Therefore

the
