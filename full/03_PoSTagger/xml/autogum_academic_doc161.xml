Introduction

<p>
<s>
Since
the
end
of
the
20th
century
,
with
the
increasing
development
of
globalisation
and
informatisation
,
the
flow
of
various
elements
(
people
,
goods
,
knowledge
and
information
)
has
become
more
frequent
across
various
scales
,
and
accordingly
,
regions
have
become
the
space
of
flows
.
</s>
<s>
In
this
context
,
the
concept
of
space
of
flows
is
gradually
replacing
the
space
of
place
.
</s>
<s>
Mobilities
have
become
a
hallmark
of
modern
times
.
</s>
<s>
The
emergence
of
flow
space
has
had
a
disruptive
impact
on
space-distance-based
and
cored
geography
.
</s>
<s>
Regional
spatial
morphology
is
also
being
redefined
and
modified
as
researchers
from
multiple
disciplines
have
begun
to
recognize
and
analyse
spatial
structure
using
the
flow
rather
than
central
place
perspective
.
</s>
<s>
As
the
most
important
form
of
spatial
interaction
to
connect
and
increase
communication
between
different
geographical
spaces
,
transport
flow
undoubtedly
has
remarkable
impacts
on
economic
activity
space
and
is
a
key
factor
in
the
shaping
of
socio-economic
spatial
structure
.
</s>
<s>
Understanding
these
impacts
has
wider
significance
for
interpreting
the
spatial
distribution
law
of
various
economic
phenomena
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
With
the
increasing
demand
for
fast
inter-city
transport
,
the
infrastructure
including
expressways
,
airlines
,
high-speed
railways
and
ETC
(
Electronic
Toll
Collection
)
systems
have
become
the
most
important
parts
of
the
modern
transport
system
.
</s>
<s>
As
such
,
the
transport
flows
over
the
network
of
these
infrastructure
systems
have
been
widely
studied
.
</s>
<s>
The
regional
transport
flow
on
well-networked
expressways
has
contributed
remarkably
to
the
socio-economic
links
between
large
and
medium
cities
,
particularly
in
view
of
the
spatial
interactions
.
</s>
<s>
Compared
with
the
air
and
railway
networks
,
the
expressway
network
has
its
own
unique
characteristics
.
</s>
<s>
Firstly
,
the
flow
pattern
is
much
more
complex
due
to
high
frequency
and
dynamics
,
which
results
in
spatial
heterogeneity
.
</s>
<s>
Secondly
,
the
transport
flow
on
such
network
is
more
fragile
and
vulnerable
to
many
physical
and
human
factors
(
e.
g.
,
weather
,
accidents
and
regulations
)
,
it
can
be
envisioned
that
its
spatial
interaction
patterns
have
strong
economic
and
demographic
effects
and
implications
for
policy-making
.
</s>
<s>
Thirdly
,
such
a
pattern
with
the
mixture
of
long-
and
short-distance
flows
across
the
region
indicates
varied
levels
of
urban
agglomeration
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
In
the
field
of
geographical
mobility
,
there
is
a
long
history
of
deploying
a
gravity
model
to
analyse
the
spatial
economic
interactions
between
cities
and
regions
by
considering
a
variety
of
physical
,
social
,
economic
and
even
environmental
dimensions
.
</s>
<s>
The
traditional
methods
of
calibrating
the
spatial
interaction
models
are
dominated
by
global
regression
models
(
e.
g.
,
Ordinary
Least
Square
(
OLS
)
,
Poisson
Regression
and
negative
binomial
regression
)
based
on
the
assumption
that
the
mobility
pattern
is
spatially
stationary
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
the
socio-economic
systems
driving
the
transport
flows
at
a
regional
scale
demonstrate
heterogeneous
density
,
intensity
and
diversity
.
</s>
<s>
This
has
resulted
in
the
development
of
flow
models
by
considering
spatial
heterogeneity
,
which
will
be
calibrated
by
local
regression
methods
.
</s>
<s>
There
is
a
recent
development
of
such
local
regression
methods
in
geography
in
considering
spatial
non-stationarity
,
among
which
geographically
weighted
regression
(
GWR
)
has
become
one
of
most
popular
approaches
.
</s>
<s>
The
extension
of
GWR
into
flow
modelling
was
initiated
by
the
seminal
paper
of
spatially
weighted
interaction
models
(
SWIM
)
.
</s>
<s>
This
modelling
method
was
upgraded
to
geographically
weighted
negative
binomial
regression
(
GWNBR
)
.
</s>
<s>
In
parallel
,
the
flowAMOEBA
method
,
based
on
a
multidirectional
optimum
ecotope-based
algorithm
,
is
able
to
analyse
flow
patterns
through
defining
a
spatial
flow
neighborhood
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
the
classic
GWRs
,
using
multiple
explanatory
variables
,
assume
that
all
the
explanatory
variables
have
a
spatially
homogeneous
process
of
determining
the
pattern
of
a
dependent
variable
,
or
simply
speaking
,
operate
on
a
single
spatial
scale
.
</s>
<s>
Scale
is
a
fundamental
geographic
concept
,
and
the
role
it
plays
in
different
geographical
contexts
and
processes
has
been
documented
extensively
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
a
new
multiscale
geographically
weighted
regression
(
MGWR
)
was
proposed
and
developed
in
the
innovative
work
.
</s>
<s>
The
MGWR
method
allows
for
the
conditional
relationship
between
response
(
dependent
)
variable
and
the
variation
of
explanatory
variables
at
different
spatial
scales
.
</s>
<s>
That
is
to
say
,
each
variable
changes
on
the
surface
of
the
parameter
to
allow
different
bandwidths
to
be
represented
.
</s>
<s>
Technically
,
MGWR
minimizes
overfitting
by
eliminating
the
limitations
of
all
relationships
varying
on
the
same
spatial
scale
,
reducing
bias
and
collinearity
in
parameter
estimation
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
when
using
flow
focused
GWR
(
FGWR
)
to
explore
multi-scale
spatial
heterogeneity
in
flow
patterns
,
MGWR
has
become
the
most
ideal
local
model
specification
.
</s>
<s>
Compared
with
the
classic
GWRs
,
the
MGWR
parameter
estimates
are
more
accurate
and
more
intuitive
.
</s>
<s>
Since
the
MGWR
method
currently
only
supports
point/polygon
data-based
modeling
,
the
aim
of
this
paper
is
to
extend
MGWR
and
apply
it
to
the
modeling
of
spatial
interaction
data
.
