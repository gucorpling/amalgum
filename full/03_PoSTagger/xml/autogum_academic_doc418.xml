The
application
of
the
Second
Law
of
Thermodynamics
to
living
beings
has
its
initial
applications
from
the
middle
of
the
past
century
with
two
symbolical
works
proposed
by
Schrödinger
and
Prigogine
and
Wiane
.
</s>
<s>
These
works
open
a
new
field
of
application
of
the
Second
Law
of
Thermodynamics
,
nowadays
usually
applied
by
means
of
the
Exergy
Analysis
.
</s>
<s>
As
proposed
by
Oliveira
,
one
of
the
most
interesting
applications
of
the
Second
Law
is
understanding
the
functioning
of
living
beings
and
use
the
physical
property
entropy
generation
(
or
destroyed
exergy
)
as
an
indicator
or
diagnosis
of
pathology
.
</s>
<s>
This
assessment
tool
was
applied
to
a
cancerous
cell
,
neuron
under
hypoxia
,
human
lungs
,
human
heart
,
athletes
under
different
training
level
,
hypothermia
as
a
therapy
,
orientated
healing
of
burned
patients
and
,
the
most
common
application
,
the
analysis
of
thermal
comfort
conditions
(
comparison
of
the
comfort
indexes
with
destroyed
exergy
and
exergy
efficiency
)
systematized
in
.
</s>
<s>
Furthermore
,
Ozilgen
carried
out
an
extensive
review
of
this
area
,
pointing
out
that
this
field
has
promising
applications
in
several
areas
of
interaction
of
Thermodynamics
with
living
beings
’
behavior
.

Regarding
the
pollutant
carbon
monoxide
(
CO
)
,
it
is
considered
to
be
a
harmful
gas
since
it
bounds
to
hemoglobin
,
decreasing
the
blood
capacity
to
deliver
oxygen
to
tissues
.
</s>
<s>
Pregnant
women
can
be
poisoned
by
work-related
sources
like
some
industrial
process
(
hot
furnaces
,
gas
refineries
)
,
or
household
sources
like
defective
water
heaters
,
or
even
passing
through
a
tunnel
in
an
urban
environment
.
</s>
<s>
Smoking
or
being
a
passive
smoker
can
also
cause
damage
:
a
smoke-filled
room
has
a
carbon
monoxide
concentration
as
high
as
100
ppm
.
</s>
<s>
This
concentration
is
enough
to
cause
a
chronic
poisoning
,
characterized
by
carboxyhemoglobin
(
HbCO
)
in
the
5
–
25
%
range
.
</s>

<p>
<s>
The
bind
between
O
and
hemoglobin
(
)
forms
oxyhemoglobin
(
)
.
</s>
<s>
Each
hemoglobin
can
carry
four
molecules
of
O.
The
easiness
of
the
reaction
increases
when
the
first
oxygenation
occurs
.
</s>
<s>
The
gas
CO
is
toxic
because
it
has
an
affinity
with
the
hemoglobin
200
–
300
times
greater
than
O.
Hence
,
even
relatively
small
concentrations
of
CO
inspired
can
reduce
the
delivered
oxygen
to
the
tissues
,
causing
hypoxia
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
the
toxicity
of
CO
is
related
to
the
increase
of
carboxyhemoglobin
(
reaction
of
carbon
monoxide
with
hemoglobin
)
.
</s>
<s>
The
usual
treatment
of
CO
poisoning
consists
of
reducing
the
inspired
CO
to
zero
and
increasing
the
oxygen
inspired
,
thus
generating
an
increment
in
the
gradients
of
these
gases
in
the
alveolar
ventilation
and
increasing
O
partial
pressure
in
the
blood
.

The
intoxication
symptoms
usually
are
headaches
,
sensations
of
weakness
,
dizziness
,
sleepiness
,
impaired
physical
performance
,
visual
difficulties
,
palpitations
,
nausea
,
and
vomiting
.
</s>
<s>
Effects
in
fetus
depend
on
the
pregnancy
stage
in
which
the
poisoning
occurs
.
</s>
<s>
During
the
embryonic
stage
,
it
can
cause
skeletal
and
neurological
effects
.
</s>
<s>
Later
in
pregnancy
,
it
is
responsible
for
anoxic
encephalopathy
,
which
occurs
when
there
is
not
enough
O
delivered
to
the
fetus
’
brain
.
</s>
<s>
During
gestation
,
oxygen
and
nutrients
are
provided
to
embryo
through
the
placenta
,
which
uses
several
transport
mechanisms
to
accomplish
this
task
:
simple
or
facilitated
diffusion
,
active
transport
,
pinocytosis
and
phagocytosis
.
</s>
<s>
Transport
of
O
and
CO
occurs
mainly
by
simple
diffusion
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Herein
,
O
,
CO
and
CO
transport
are
modeled
to
occur
as
a
result
of
simple
diffusion
of
the
number
of
gases
dissolved
in
maternal
blood
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
some
authors
suggest
that
,
for
carbon
monoxide
,
this
mechanism
could
happen
due
to
facilitated
diffusion
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
this
work
aims
at
modeling
and
expanding
the
phenomenological
behavior
of
a
healthy
male
human
lung
subjected
to
the
inhalation
of
O
,
CO
,
and
CO
,
first
proposed
by
Albuquerque
Neto
et
al.
.
</s>
<s>
Moreover
,
based
on
the
exergy
method
proposed
by
Henriques
et
al.
and
Cenzi
et
al.
,
the
objective
is
to
expand
the
phenomenological
and
exergy
model
to
a
pregnant
woman
subjected
to
conditions
usually
found
in
urban
ecosystems
and
during
stress
periods
such
as
passive
smoking
or
prolonged
exposure
to
a
tunnel
environment
.
</s>
<s>
The
distinguishing
feature
of
this
article
is
the
application
of
these
conditions
to
a
pregnant
woman
,
with
a
phenomenological
of
the
mother
and
fetus
(
proposed
in
the
present
article
)
