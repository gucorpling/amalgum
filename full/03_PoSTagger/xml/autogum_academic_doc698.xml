Introduction

</head>
<p>
<s>
Students
with
disabilities
are
increasingly
included
in
mainstream
education
systems
.
</s>
<s>
The
access
of
these
students
to
the
practice
of
physical
education
(
PE
)
is
a
fundamental
right
for
all
of
them
,
as
stated
by
the
United
Nations
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
physical
education
teachers
(
PET
)
are
often
frustrated
with
their
inability
to
accommodate
inclusion
in
mixed-ability
PE
classrooms
for
reasons
related
to
students
’
safety
or
the
difficulty
in
designing
tasks
that
do
not
negatively
impact
the
type
and
severity
of
the
disability
.
</s>
<s>
Many
PE
teachers
feel
that
their
education
system
did
not
sufficiently
prepare
them
to
undertake
this
role
.
</s>
<s>
This
seems
to
be
a
common
situation
in
many
countries
,
as
it
was
reported
in
the
latest
Teaching
and
Learning
International
Survey
(
TALYS
)
that
22
%
of
teachers
across
the
Organization
for
Economic
Cooperation
and
Development
(
OECD
)
asked
for
more
training
in
teaching
students
with
special
needs
.
</s>
<s>
In
2015
,
the
United
Nations
established
Sustainable
Development
Goal
Four
(
SDG-4
)
,
which
focuses
on
quality
education
,
aiming
to
ensure
that
qualified
,
professionally
trained
,
motivated
,
and
well-supported
teachers
are
available
to
all
students
and
highlighting
the
role
that
teachers
play
in
the
complex
education
process
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
when
talking
about
students
with
disabilities
,
studies
in
inclusive
education
have
demonstrated
that
PETs
present
negative
attitudes
towards
their
inclusion
,
driven
by
their
poor
self-efficacy
(
SE
)
in
meeting
students
’
needs
.
</s>
<s>
It
seems
clear
that
investing
in
teacher
training
is
crucial
for
the
effective
delivery
of
the
UNESCO
Education
Agenda
,
as
teachers
who
present
adequate
subject
and
pedagogic
content
knowledge
and
are
well-trained
in
the
necessary
skills
can
make
a
huge
difference
in
educating
students
,
especially
those
with
special
needs
.
</s>
<s>
Education
for
sustainable
development
has
encompassed
a
wide
range
of
objectives
to
ensure
that
teachers
help
students
understand
the
rapidly
changing
world
in
which
they
live
,
as
well
as
the
need
to
participate
in
that
world
.
</s>
<s>
Because
of
this
,
investigating
teacher-training
programs
is
necessary
for
the
understanding
of
evidence-based
inclusive
practices
and
to
address
common
concerns
and
misconceptions
about
inclusion
.
</s>
<s>
When
this
happens
,
PETs
apply
strategies
in
practice
,
design
learning
experiences
for
students
of
all
abilities
,
and
support
participation
by
students
with
disabilities
,
resulting
in
increased
student
learning
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
to
the
best
of
the
authors
’
knowledge
,
studies
that
present
evidence-based
strategies
based
on
action-oriented
pedagogy
to
promote
education
for
sustainability
in
PE
are
scarce
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
To
improve
professional
standards
in
inclusive
physical
education
(
IPE
)
,
it
is
necessary
that
education/training
curricula
present
those
contents
as
a
contribution
to
achieving
proper
PET
training
.
</s>
<s>
Education
is
very
dynamic
,
and
there
is
no
universal
design
for
educational
programs
,
which
are
heavily
influenced
by
national
education
curricula
and
,
thus
,
differ
across
countries
.
</s>
<s>
Education
policies
can
also
be
influenced
by
the
geographical
and
economic
dimensions
of
a
country
and
by
the
spatial
distribution
of
the
population
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
it
is
plausible
for
education
curricula
to
differ
within
a
nation-state
or
region
.
</s>
<s>
A
clear
case
occurs
in
Spain
,
a
country
that
has
17
autonomous
regions
,
two
of
them
belonging
to
insular
areas
(
i.
e.
,
the
Balearic
Islands
and
the
Canary
Islands
)
.
</s>
<s>
Although
since
2013
,
there
has
been
a
national
education
law
with
clear
inclusion
policies
,
each
Spanish
region
has
the
authority
to
design
its
own
educational
curricula
,
including
policies
about
inclusive
education
.
</s>
<s>
It
is
for
this
reason
that
such
inclusive
policies
may
vary
between
Spanish
regions
.
</s>
<s>
Educational
differences
between
peninsular
and
insular
areas
have
already
been
reported
in
several
studies
,
but
,
to
the
authors
’
best
knowledge
,
there
is
no
previous
research
on
this
topic
applied
to
a
PE
context
.
</s>
<s>
For
example
,
the
two
regions
examined
in
this
study
have
disparate
university
programs
for
pre-service
PET
,
including
content
regarding
the
inclusion
of
students
with
special
education
needs
in
PE
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Considering
the
aforementioned
,
the
aim
of
this
study
was
to
deliver
an
in-service
PET
training
course
on
inclusive
physical
education
,
comparing
the
outcomes
of
PET
from
insular
and
peninsular
regions
.
</s>
<s>
The
hypotheses
of
this
study
were
i
)
good
PET
training
can
significantly
improve
PET
self-efficacy
towards
students
with
disabilities
,
and
ii
)
the
self-efficacy
improvement
ratio
is
constrained
by
the
region
where
the
teaching
takes
place
.
