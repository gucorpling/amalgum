A
wide
range
of
length
scales
exist
and
the
terminology
used
to
describe
these
length
scales
varies
in
the
literature
.
</s>
<s>
For
our
purposes
,
three
discrete
length
scales
are
of
concern
to
support
the
discussion
that
follows
.
</s>
<s>
The
microscale
is
a
length
scale
that
is
long
compared
to
the
mean
distance
between
molecular
collisions
or
the
vibrational
scale
for
a
solid
.
</s>
<s>
At
the
microscale
a
point
represents
an
averaging
region
that
is
related
to
the
lower
bound
on
the
length
scale
needed
for
the
laws
of
continuum
mechanics
to
apply
.
</s>
<s>
Another
characteristic
of
the
microscale
is
that
a
point
exists
entirely
within
an
individual
phase
,
even
in
a
system
that
includes
multiphase
phases
(
fluids
,
solids
)
.
</s>
<s>
Porous
medium
systems
are
systems
that
contain
multiple
phases
by
definition
.
</s>
<s>
At
the
microscale
,
the
morphology
and
topology
of
the
phase
distributions
are
resolved
in
time
.
</s>
<s>
For
porous
medium
systems
,
the
microscale
is
oftentimes
referred
to
as
the
pore
scale
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
The
second
scale
of
concern
herein
is
the
macroscale
.
</s>
<s>
The
macroscale
is
a
scale
where
phase
distributions
are
resolved
only
in
an
averaged
sense
;
a
point
is
the
centroid
of
an
averaging
region
which
extends
over
all
phases
,
interfaces
,
common
curves
,
and
common
points
that
exist
in
a
system
.
</s>
<s>
Macroscale
extent
measures
involve
concepts
such
as
volume
fractions
,
fluid
saturations
,
specific
interfacial
areas
,
and
specific
common
curve
lengths
.
</s>
<s>
The
boundaries
of
the
phases
are
not
resolved
at
the
macroscale
,
only
the
averaged
extent
measures
are
resolved
.
</s>
<s>
Macroscale
representations
are
necessary
to
make
many
systems
of
interest
tractable
,
including
engineered
systems
such
as
filters
and
reactors
and
natural
systems
such
as
subsurface
porous
medium
systems
,
including
petroleum
reservoirs
.
</s>
<s>
This
is
so
because
even
for
cases
in
which
microscale
details
of
phase
distribution
are
accessible
,
computational
limitations
of
even
the
world
’s
fastest
computers
precludes
the
detailed
simulations
of
systems
at
the
scale
of
applications
of
concern
,
say
the
unsaturated
zone
above
an
aquifer
.
</s>
<s>
Macroscale
representations
are
also
used
as
a
simplification
when
microscale
details
are
unnecessary
for
the
problem
of
interest
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
The
third
scale
of
interest
is
termed
the
megascale
,
and
it
is
the
overall
length
scale
of
the
system
of
concern
,
which
might
vary
greatly
in
size
between
a
model
laboratory
system
,
an
engineered
system
,
and
a
natural
system
.
</s>
<s>
What
is
common
at
the
megascale
however
is
that
the
details
of
the
spatial
distribution
of
quantities
within
the
system
are
not
resolved
.
</s>
<s>
Instead
,
inputs
and
outputs
from
the
system
are
considered
only
on
the
boundaries
of
the
system
.
</s>
<s>
Oftentimes
systems
may
be
considered
megascale
in
one
or
two
dimensions
and
say
macroscale
in
the
remaining
dimensions
.
</s>
<s>
An
example
of
such
an
instance
is
the
treatment
of
a
subsurface
region
in
a
vertically
averaged
fashion
;
only
spatial
variations
in
the
horizontal
plane
are
resolved
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
The
typical
situation
is
that
macroscale
models
are
phenomenological
in
nature
—
meaning
conservation
equations
are
written
following
an
assumed
form
usually
based
upon
a
presumed
extension
of
microscale
principles
,
which
are
better
understood
.
</s>
<s>
Then
the
macroscale
models
are
typically
closed
using
empirical
relations
intended
to
represent
small-scale
behavior
in
a
simplified
,
yet
meaningful
and
tractable
manner
.
</s>
<s>
The
literature
is
replete
with
such
examples
,
and
flow
and
transport
phenomena
in
porous
medium
systems
is
a
prime
class
of
example
.
</s>
<s>
The
phenomenological
approach
can
lead
to
solvable
systems
that
enable
solutions
,
but
the
general
procedure
is
fraught
with
problems
,
many
of
which
are
not
well
understood
because
the
general
approach
is
deeply
ingrained
in
text
books
and
practice
,
and
generally
accepted
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
The
phenomenological
approach
of
model
formulation
suffers
from
several
problems
.
</s>
<s>
First
,
fundamental
microscale
physics
may
not
be
naturally
and
explicitly
present
in
posited
macroscale
models
.
</s>
<s>
Second
,
certain
microscale
principles
,
such
as
thermodynamics
,
are
often
completely
ignored
.
</s>
<s>
Third
,
quantities
that
appear
in
macroscale
models
may
not
be
precisely
defined
in
terms
of
microscale
quantities
,
precluding
a
rigorous
connection
between
microscale
systems
and
macroscale
systems
.
</s>
<s>
Fourth
,
macroscale
closure
relations
are
often
constructs
of
convenience
intended
to
produce
solvable
systems
but
not
deduced
from
fundamentals
or
constrained
to
obey
thermodynamic
principles
,
such
as
the
second
law
of
thermodynamics
.
</s>
<s>
Fifth
,
phenomenological
models
are
typically
evaluated
and
validated
by
comparing
to
the
overall
system
of
concern
,
and
when
they
fail
to
provide
an
adequate
description
a
new
model
must
be
formulated
without
a
rigorous
,
well-defined
procedure
to
do
so
.
</s>
<s>
TCAT
has
been
developed
to
resolve
these
issues
associated
with
standard
phenomenological
approaches
