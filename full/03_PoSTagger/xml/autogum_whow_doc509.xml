Yet
,
a
desire

experience
to
achieve
this
.
</s>
<s>
While
creativity
is
a
major
part
of
apparel
design
,
the
reality
is
that
well-honed
technical
skills
and
sound
operational
knowledge
are
necessary
to
transform
that
creativity
into
a
profitable
start-up
fashion
business
.

Most
fashion
entrepreneurs
fail
because
they
do
not
know
how
to
communicate

negotiate

production

Buyers
are
concerned

sell

including
its
price
