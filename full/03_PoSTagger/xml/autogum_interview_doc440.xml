As
you
campaign
around
your
riding
,
it
's
likely
that
some
issues
are
mentioned
more
often
by
voters
,
than
other
issues
.

What
would
you
say
are
the
three
hottest
topics
this
election

address
these

In
Don
Valley
West
,
whether
in
a
challenged
area
like
Flemingdon
Park
or
a
more
comfortable
area
like
Lawrence
Park
,
people
are
concerned
about
the
same
things
.
</s>
<s>
The
economy
(
jobs
)
,
keeping
a
roof
over
their
head
and
food
on
the
table
and
the
future
.
</s>
<s>
Certainly
their
perspectives
are
different
.
</s>
<s>
The
Flemingdon
resident
wants
a
national
housing
strategy
that
will
lower
their
rent
or
give
them
hope
of
home
ownership
.
</s>
<s>
The
senior
in
Lawrence
Park
wants
to
know
that
they
wo
n't
be
forced
to
leave
their
home
simply
because
their
property
tax
is
rising
faster
than
their
fixed
income

Immigrants
want

know
they
can
have
hope

professional
certification

they

field
they

been
trained
in

The
managers

creative
workers

employment

50

Through
public
healthcare

Jack

The

Right

Canadian
tax
dollars

Alberta
providing
tax
breaks

subsidies

profitable

multi-national

They
are
also
spending
billions
