It
was
a

the

were

legends

<p>

In
these

it

definitely
performing

We
have
performed
throughout
New
Zealand
with
our
biggest
audience
probably
being
the
Qtn
Winter
Fest
openings
in
2005
&amp;
2006
but
I
think
the
Rock2Wgtn
was
bigger
than
that
...

<s>
And
it
was
different
to
feel
part
of
a
whole
production
,
with
the
stunt
guys
and
zombie
girls
and
the
NZ
bands
and
the
big
time
bands
and
the
dragon
!
!
?
…
Often
we
’ve
been
a
stand
alone
performance
so
it
felt
good
to
have
a
role
,
alongside
others
,
in
creating
a
rocking
experience
for
the
rock
enthusiasts
.

Was
it
hard

a
show
around
the
rock

was

offer

Our
fire
dance
performances
are
usually
fully
choreographed
routines
,
from
start
to
finish
of
one
track
,
with
an
assortment
of
fire
spinning
devices
…
for
this
gig
we
requested
the
bands
set
list
,
in
order
of
their
play
.
</s>
<s>
We
familiarised
ourselves
with
their
music
and
used
combinations
of
toys
that
would
work
best
with
each
song
,
according
to
rhythms
,
tempo
and
feel
.
</s>
<s>
For
example
,
the
up
beat
rock
songs
were
great
for
the
fire
hula
hoop
or
staff
or
poi
,
where
as
the
more
tragic
rock
ballads
leaned
towards
a
slow
seductive
fire
whip
.
</s>
<s>
We
skipped
the
songs
that
did
n’t
inspire
us
and
went
for
it
,
having
heaps
of
fun
,
with
those
songs
that
did
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
The
combining
improvised
fire
dance
with
tight
choreography
on
the
chorus
seemed
to
work
best
for
us
.
</s>
<s>
It
flowed
naturally
and
looked
effective
in
performance
.
</s>
<s>
We
discovered
rock
music
,
at
times
,
had
quite
complex
beats
,
making
some
songs
harder
to
choreograph
than
others
,
in
such
instances
we
avoided
choreography
and
let
the
improvised
fire
dance
roll
!
!
</s>
<s>
Our
aim
was
to
use
toys
that
had
the
biggest
fire
for
the
hottest
most
blazing
effect
.
</s>
<s>
We
had
well
over
a
month
of
rehersing
two
nights
a
week
,
to
get
to
know
the
songs
,
the
choreography
and
practise
improvised
rock
dance
moves
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
So
while
still
being
flexible
for
any
last
minute
changes
we
were
ready
to
rock
with
prepared
toys
,
routines
and
dancers
specifically
for
each
song
.
