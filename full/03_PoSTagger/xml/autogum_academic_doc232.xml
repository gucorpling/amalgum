Research
Results
in
a
Broader
Context
</s>
</head>
<p>
<s>
Today
,
the
scarce
number
of
research
publications
on
architectural
SPIF
indicates
that
knowledge
of
this
promising
fabrication
method
is
still
limited
and
should
be
expanded
further
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
considering
SPIF
research
in
a
broader
context
of
the
engineering
disciplines
can
provide
,
to
a
certain
extent
,
a
background
for
discussing
the
significance
of
our
study
and
its
role
in
the
development
of
the
current
approaches
to
handling
the
errors
in
fabrication
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
The
key
discipline
researching
SPIF
is
manufacturing
engineering
,
in
which
a
number
of
methods
have
been
developed
to
deal
with
the
geometrical
inaccuracies
introduced
by
this
forming
method
.
</s>
<s>
Many
of
these
methods
embrace
alterations
of
the
geometrical
input
for
the
process
,
just
as
our
method
does
.
</s>
<s>
For
instance
,
they
advocate
the
creation
of
addendum
surfaces
and
extracurricular
support
structures
,
input
geometry
splitting
and
varying
toolpath
designs
to
enable
multi-pass
forming
,
as
well
as
input
geometry
alteration
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
what
makes
all
those
methods
fundamentally
different
from
our
approach
is
their
goal
.
</s>
<s>
In
engineering
research
,
forming
inaccuracies
are
perceived
as
a
problem
and
the
main
aim
is
to
develop
methods
that
eliminate
them
.
</s>
<s>
In
our
case
,
we
invert
inaccuracies
from
being
problematic
to
being
generative
.
</s>
<s>
In
addition
,
in
the
manufacturing
engineering
methods
,
the
geometry
alteration
is
a
straightforward
and
deterministic
one
and
is
often
preceded
by
computational
analyses
of
material
stresses
and
precise
digital
simulation
of
the
forming
conditions
.
</s>
<s>
For
us
,
the
process
of
geometry
alteration
is
iterative
,
explorative
,
and
with
an
uncertain
outcome
.
</s>
<s>
Such
a
process
is
,
in
our
case
,
based
on
approximate
,
qualitative
ocular
examinations
and
not
computational
calculations
.

Advantages
of
the
Approach
</s>
</head>
<p>
<s>
In
contrast
to
the
engineering
approaches
described
above
,
the
framework
resulting
from
this
study
embodies
an
alternative
,
bottom-up
approach
to
erroneous
feature
handling
.
</s>
<s>
Although
the
framework
is
supported
by
digital
and
computational
means
,
which
by
definition
are
precise
,
an
advantage
is
that
it
also
offers
several
entry
points
for
ambiguous
explorations
that
may
be
preferred
by
some
designers
,
especially
those
with
an
artistic
orientation
.
</s>
<s>
The
framework
’s
construction
and
implementation
workflow
also
ensure
that
geometric
feature
explorations
take
place
in
a
gradual
,
iterative
manner
.
</s>
<s>
The
benefit
of
this
is
that
each
iteration
opens
up
several
potential
avenues
for
further
explorations
,
all
originating
from
one
initial
design
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Importantly
,
we
also
believe
that
an
advantage
of
our
method
is
its
capacity
to
be
combined
with
conventional
,
precision-oriented
fabrication
.
</s>
<s>
This
is
important
for
a
wider
application
of
our
process
in
non-standard
building
element
manufacturing
.
</s>
<s>
Practical
applications
at
the
scale
of
an
actual
building
will
necessitate
that
some
parts
of
the
formed
molds
,
such
as
edges
that
connect
with
other
building
elements
,
maintain
high
levels
of
geometrical
precision
,
while
the
middle
zones
of
the
geometry
can
be
treated
in
a
less
strict
and
more
explorative
manner
.
</s>
<s>
Further
research
is
needed
to
find
out
how
to
make
such
a
combined
approach
effective
from
an
industrial
application
standpoint
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Another
advantage
of
our
method
pertains
to
a
novel
mode
of
operation
that
it
offers
,
in
which
the
material
is
allowed
to
shape
and
compose
itself
partially
on
its
own
,
with
the
human
designer
and
the
fabrication
machine
only
to
a
certain
extent
guiding
the
process
instead
of
controlling
it
entirely
.
</s>
<s>
The
conventional
mode
of
material
crafting
and
processing
,
in
which
the
material
is
merely
formed
,
transformed
,
and
reshaped
,
either
by
the
designer
’s
hand
or
by
the
machine
tool
,
is
therefore
expanded
in
our
framework
.
</s>
<s>
This
can
be
considered
beneficial
from
an
esthetic
standpoint
,
as
the
material
accumulations
caused
by
the
intentionally
tweaked
mold
errors
emphasize
the
intricate
esthetic
attributes
of
the
material
cast
into
the
mold
,
offering
an
opportunity
for
unusual
,
bottom-up
design
feature
generation
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Our
framework
therefore
mediates
a
novel
approach
to
design
,
in
which
designers
can
work
very
closely
with
material
behaviors
and
react
to
these
behaviors
in
an
artistic
,
intuitive
,
and
ambiguous
way
.
</s>
<s>
Influencing
these
behaviors
in
an
indirect
manner
creates
a
possibility
to
shape
the
expressive
attributes
of
the
design
through
the
medium
of
the
material
,
instead
of
mere
drawing
.
</s>
<s>
This
seems
unique
in
light
of
the
conventional
design
methods
that
often
operate
in
a
top-down
manner
.
</s>
<s>
We
hope
that
our
research
can
play
a
part
in
the
emergence
of
an
alternative
strand
of
architectural
design
methods
,
featuring
material
agency
as
an
enriching
design
medium
,
existing
side-by-side
with
the
conventional
design
means
.
