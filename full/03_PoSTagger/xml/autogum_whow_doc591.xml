First
introduced
by
philosopher
Soren
Kierkegaard
,
and
later
discussed
by
philosophers
such
as
Friedrich
Neitzche
and
Jean-Paul
Sartre
the
idea
of
existentialism
is
a
simple
one
:
Human
existence
is
not
,
does
not
have
an
objective
purpose
.
</s>
<s>
Instead
,
meaning
for
life
must
be
made
by
the
individual
and
is
entirely
subjective
.
</s>
<s>
In
order
to
accomplish
this
goal
of
creating
meaning
in
a
purposeless
world
,
there
are
a
few
important
steps
,
which
will
be
described

<s>
Philosopher
</s>
<s>
Jean-Paul
Sartre
established
the
idea
that
existence
precedes
essence
,
which
means
essentially
that
humans
existed
before
any
meaning
to
life
was
thought
to
have
existed
,
therefore
he
claims
meaning
is
not

</s>
<s>
Philosopher
Viktor
</s>
<s>
Frankl
created
a
theory
in
philosophy
of
Logotherapy
which
states
that
one
must
understand
first
,
that
our
main
motivation
in
life
is
to
find
meaning
,
because
life
is
inherently
meaningless
and
that
we
have
inalienable
freedom
to
find
meaning
.
</s>
<s>
Both
theories
are
grounded
in
the
notion
that
in
order
for
something
to
have
an
objective
purpose
it
must
have
been
created
with
that
purpose
in
mind
.
</s>
<s>
For
example
,
a
hammer
is
created
with
the
purpose
of
hammering
nails
and
therefore
its
essence
precedes
its
existence
.
</s>
<s>
Existentialists
believe
this
is
not
the
case
with
humans
and
therefore
,
there
is
no
objective
purpose
to
life
.
</s>
<s>
It
is
still
possible
to
live
a
fulfilling
life
according
to
philosophers
,
and
the
first
step
to
achieving
this
is
to
come
to
terms
with
the
reality
that
life
has
no
objective
purpose
.

Accept
your
freedom
and
personal
responsibility
.
</s>
<s>
According
to
Jean-Paul
Sartre
,
existentialism
requires
one
to
take
personal
responsibility
for
their
purpose
and
to
actively
use
their
freedom
to
make
their
purpose
.
</s>
<s>
This
presupposes
that
you
possess
free
will
,
an
idea
accepted
by
most
notable
existentialists
.
</s>
<s>
Another
important
component
of
choosing
purpose
freely
is
the
existentialist
notion
of
authenticity
introduced
by
Soren
Kierkegaard
,
which
states
that
one
must
remain
authentic
by
choosing
a
purpose
which
is
true
to
themselves
and
their
own
desires
and
passions
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
one
must
embrace
their
own
personal
responsibility
and
choose
their
purpose
freely

authentically

If

recognize
deaths
inevitability
it
will
help

your
life

and
add
extra
importance

According
to
existentialist
philosopher
,
Martin
Heidegger
an
awareness

death

mortal
fragility
gives

a
crucial
component
of
existentialism
,
to
be
possible

Furthermore
,
philosopher

<s>
Karl
Jaspers
argues
that
if
one
is
unable
to
face
the
inevitable
reality
of
death
he
will
either
resort
to
mythical
beliefs
to
avoid
death

immerse
himself

things

Because

according
to
existentialists

you
must

In
the
words

Jean-Paul

It
is
up

you
to
give
it

and
value
is
nothing
but
the
meaning
that
you
choose
