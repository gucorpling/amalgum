Othello

Christianity

,
alternates

Desdemona

Othello
’s
wounded
ego
and
his
appeal
to
justice
in
murdering
Desdemona
becomes
evident
in
his
wavering
between
Christian
identity

a
husband

struggling

the
belief

his
wife
has
been
unfaithful

Muslim
beliefs

Othello
’s
shifting
identity
can
be
considered
within
the
larger
framework
of
personal
identity
in

theater
during
Shakespeare

time
.
Although
racial
stereotypes
played
a
role
in
Elizabethan
perceptions
of
non-European
beliefs
and
values
,
Peter
Berek
raises
the
question
of
the
fluidity
of
social
and
religious
identity
on
the
Elizabethan
stage
:
</s>
<s>
“
The
theater
of
the
1590s
was
obsessed
by
the
possibilities
that
identity
might
be
willed
or
chosen
and
social
position
achieved
by
deeds
,
not
birth
”
(
Berek
1998
,
p.

)

Plays
like

tetralogy
beginning
with

this
theme

Marranos

are
plausible
representations

the
notion
that
identity
is
not

can
be
created
by
individuals
themselves

an
idea

</s>
<s>
Othello
is
a
prime
example
of
shifting
identities
:
He
was
presumably
born
Muslim
,
kidnapped
into
slavery
,
and
converted
to
Christianity
;
he
eventually
became
a
Venetian
general
who
secretly
married
into
Venice
’s
ruling
class
and
led
a
military
expedition
to
Cyprus
.
</s>
<s>
During
the
play
,
questions
subtly
arise
as
to
whether
he
is
Christian
or
Muslim
,
Venetian
or
Moor
,
honorable
or
criminal
.

duality
