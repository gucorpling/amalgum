I
’ve
worked
in
the
Corporate
world
and
Government
world
and
I
know
how
both
operate
.
</s>
<s>
I
would
run
The
White
House
like
an
up
to
date
corporation
that
can
see
monthly
reports
of
where
we
’re
heading
financially
.
</s>
<s>
We
would
balance
the
budget
,
cut
spending
and
programs
that
have
not
worked
,
and
we
would
n’t
spend
money
we
do
n’t
have
.
</s>
<s>
I
am
a
Public
Speaker
,
and
an
Expert
on
Race
Relations
and
I
bring
communications
skills
with
a
Non
Profit
Organization
,
“
A
Place
For
Us
”
National
www.aplaceforusnational.com
,
,
for
over
25
years

<s>
The
people
who
have
worked
with
me
for
over
25
years
believe
in
what
this
mission
and
this
campaign
is
about
.
</s>
<s>
When
they
hear
me
speak
they
are
energized
by
my
message
of
taking
back
America
and
having
the
essentials
of
our
security
handled
by
our
Government
as
well
as
empowering
people
to
depend
on
themselves
more
and
less
on
Government
.

<p>

Look
me
up

</p>
<p>
<s>
All
of
the
work
positions
I
’ve
held
will
prepare
me
for
the
Oval
office

<hi rend="bold">
<s>
Obviously
,
the
next
American
President
and
his
or
her
administration
will
face
many
diverse
issues
.
</s>
<s>
But
if
you
were
to
narrow
identify
the
three
most
important
issues
,
what
would
they
be
?
</s>
<s>
How
will
you
address
these
issues
?
</s>
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<s>
I
would
free
the
Border
Patrol
Agents
who
are
imprisoning
because
they
tried
to
protect
our
Countrys
secure
the
Northern
and
Southern
Borders
,
and
place
A
Moratorium
on
all
immigrants
from
everywhere
.
</s>
<s>
Then
I
’d
start
the
deportation
process
first
for
illegal
prisoners
we
take
care
of
everyday
,
then
penalize
the
employers
who
knowingly
hire
illegal
’s
.
</s>
<s>
Concerning
,
National
Security
,
we
should
protect
ourselves
and
Our
Military
with
the
best
we
can
give
them
with
the
New
GI
Bill
.
</s>
<s>
Should
they
parish
,
their
families
will
be
taken
care
of
and
I
believe
if
a
parent
is
the
only
heir
of
a
fallen
soldier
that
parent
should
be
able
to
go
to
the
Commissary
to
purchase
food
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
I
will
protect
us
by
any
means
necessary
without
abusing
Americans
’
Privacy
and
Free
Speech
.
</s>
<s>
As
far
as
Education
goes
,
I
believe
in
giving
Educators
salaries
through
private
entities
where
they
make
200K
or
the
equivalent
depending
where
they
live
in
the
Country
.
</s>
<s>
I
would
even
include
not
having
to
pay
rent
,
because
if
they
do
n’t
teach
our
children
we
have
a
failing
country
.
</s>
<s>
If
they
like
their
job
they
will
go
beyond
their
regular
duty
.
</s>
<s>
For
example
,
my
husband
is
an
Educator
and
as
far
as
his
private
clients
are
concerned
(
and
I
concur
)
he
’s
the
best
in
the
country
.
</s>
<s>
He
would
teach
for
free
if
he
did
n’t
have
to
eat
and
pay
bills
;
that
’s
how
much
he
loves
seeing
children
learn
and
better
themselves
,
but
with
all
of
the
political
correctness
I
did
n’t
want
him
ever
teaching
in
public
schools
again
.
