NK

<s>
I
think
it
's
important
to
remember
Pyongyang

periodic
provocations

its
pursuit
of
nuclear
arsenal

not
reactions

self-defense

Washington

Incapable
of
competing
with
economically
flourishing
South

the
North
relies
on
bolstering
its
nuclear
arsenal
and
on
military
and
political
brinkmanship
to
make
up
ground
