Unmanned
Surface
vehicles
(
USVs
)
,
also
known
as
autonomous
surface
crafts
,
have
attracted
worldwide
attention
in
commercial
,
scientific
and
military
fields
recently
.
</s>
<s>
USVs
have
the
advantages
of
low
operation
and
maintenance
costs
,
reduced
casualty
risk
,
and
good
maneuverability
and
deployability
for
different
operating
conditions
.
</s>
<s>
With
the
aid
of
effective
and
reliable
navigation
equipment
,
such
as
global
positioning
systems
(
GPS
)
,
wireless
communication
units
,
and
various
types
of
sensors
,
USVs
can
be
employed
cost-efficiently
for
a
variety
of
applications
,
including
underwater
surveying
,
pollutant
tracking
,
acoustic
navigation
,
marine
rescue
,
and
obstacle
detection
.
</s>
<s>
Although
rapid
progress
of
corresponding
techniques
for
USV
systems
have
been
achieved
in
recent
times
,
it
is
still
challenging
in
promoting
the
level
of
USV
autonomy
when
faced
with
complex
or
hazardous
environments
.

Key
issues
,
including
hull
hydrodynamics
,
communication
techniques
,
and
navigation
,
guidance
and
control
(
NGC
)
strategies
,
require
further
developments
.

<p>
<s>
As
a
vital
component
of
USV
guidance
systems
,
path
planning
is
of
critical
importance
in
designing
and
updating
feasible
and
optimal
trajectories
for
the
control
system
on
basis
of
navigation
information
,
mission
demands
,
and
environmental
conditions
.
</s>
<s>
Its
effectiveness
not
only
determines
the
autonomy
of
unmanned
vehicles
,
but
also
affects
the
reliability
and
efficiency
of
mission
execution
.
</s>
<s>
From
the
literature
,
plenty
of
intelligent
techniques
have
been
employed
in
the
USV
path
planner
.
</s>
<s>
Meanwhile
,
it
is
a
research
hot
pot
to
propose
an
algorithm
having
fast
convergence
speed
,
admirable
robustness
,
low
computation
consumption
,
and
satisfactory
route
planning
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
The
USV
path
planning
problem
is
normally
formulated
as
a
travelling
salesman
problem
(
TSP
)
,
which
is
a
typical
combinatorial
optimization
problem
.
</s>
<s>
The
specific
description
is
to
find
a
shortest
loop
that
passes
through
all
target
cities
without
repetition
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
when
a
USV
performs
multi-objective
tasks
in
a
complex
marine
environment
,
the
number
of
possible
paths
increases
exponentially
with
the
increase
of
target
points
’
number
,
resulting
in
the
so-called
“
exponential
explosion
”
.
</s>
<s>
In
this
circumstance
,
traditional
algorithms
,
such
as
the
exhaustive
method
and
branch-and-bound
algorithm
,
are
unable
to
find
the
optimal
solution
within
reasonable
time
cost
.
</s>
<s>
Hence
,
it
is
vital
to
develop
efficient
and
feasible
heuristic
algorithms
instead
of
traditional
methods
to
solve
this
kind
of
problem
,
although
the
optimality
,
accuracy
,
and
completeness
becomes
sacrificed
for
running
speed
to
some
degree
.
</s>
<s>
Commonly
used
heuristic
algorithms
include
elephant
search
algorithm
(
ESA
)
,
genetic
algorithm
(
GA
)
,
particle
swam
optimization
(
PSO
)
,
firefly
algorithm
(
FA
)
,
grey
wolf
optimizer
(
GWO
)
,
and
so
on
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
However
,
the
conventional
type
of
each
method
has
its
inherent
limitation
.
</s>
<s>
For
instance
,
it
is
known
that
the
ESA
provides
a
random
and
improper
replacement
for
an
elephant
with
the
worst
fitness
,
which
is
likely
to
result
in
the
deterioration
of
search
space
.
</s>
<s>
The
conventional
GA
has
inherent
issues
of
slow
convergence
speed
,
poor
capability
of
local
search
and
easy
occurrence
of
premature
convergence
.
</s>
<s>
In
other
words
,
the
loss
of
population
diversity
is
likely
to
appear
during
the
implementation
of
GA
,
making
individual
genes
tend
to
be
same
and
terminating
the
search
at
local
optimum
.
</s>
<s>
Additionally
,
the
use
of
a
real-number
code
also
generates
repetitive
genes
during
crossover
operations
,
which
affects
convergence
speed
greatly
.
</s>
<s>
For
the
PSO
,
the
lack
of
a
balanced
mechanism
would
lead
to
the
loss
of
population
diversity
and
finally
being
trapped
into
the
local
optimum
.
</s>
<s>
In
addition
,
the
FA
only
considers
the
distance
and
maximum
attractive
force
between
two
fireflies
,
and
has
intrinsic
shortcomings
of
poor
search
capability
during
early
iterations
and
severe
oscillations
around
the
optimal
solution
during
later
iterations
.
</s>
<s>
In
terms
of
the
GWO
,
the
search
mechanism
of
judging
distance
from
prey
would
lead
to
a
slow
convergence
speed
for
later
iterations
.
</s>
<s>
Nowadays
,
it
has
become
a
tendency
to
combine
two
or
more
algorithms
,
making
full
use
of
their
respective
advantages
to
enhance
the
algorithm
effectiveness
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Inspired
by
the
combination
strategy
,
this
work
optimizes
the
conventional
PSO
method
by
introducing
a
greedy
mechanism
to
generate
partial
particles
and
2-opt
operation
to
eliminate
path-crossing
phenomena
.
</s>
<s>
Comparative
study
with
some
state-of-the-art
algorithms
is
conducted
to
verify
the
effectiveness
and
reliability
of
the
improved
method
in
terms
of
solution
quality
,
algorithm
robustness
,
and
computing
efficiency
.
</s>
<s>
Then
the
improved
algorithm
is
adopted
to
generate
a
feasible
closed
trajectory
for
a
self-developed
USV
to
follow
in
real
marine
environments
.

<p>
<s>
It
is
worth
noting
that
this
work
has
certain
connections
and
essential
differences
with
our
two
recently
published
works
.
</s>
<s>
In
the
first
work
,
we
optimized
GA
by
multi-domain
inversion
for
the
purpose
of
increasing
the
number
of
offsprings
.
</s>
<s>
The
inspiration
comes
from
the
biological
theory
foundation
,
where
the
number
of
offsprings
needs
to
be
larger
than
the
number
of
parents
so
as
to
prevent
species
extinction
and
maintain
species
diversity
in
the
process
of
biological
evolution
.
</s>
<s>
In
the
other
work
,
we
optimized
PSO
by
iteratively
adjusting
the
control
parameters
of
the
PSO
algorithm
,
such
as
inertia
weight
and
acceleration
coefficients
,
and
introducing
merit-based
selection
and
uncertain
mutation
.
</s>
<s>
The
optimization
is
from
the
point
of
view
of
global
searching
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
in
this
work
,
we
start
form
the
inspiration
of
the
combination
strategy
of
several
intelligent
algorithms
and
introduce
the
greedy
mechanism
and
2-opt
operation
in
order
to
optimize
the
local
search
of
PSO
.
