Conceptual
Background

</head>
<p>
<s>
Regarding
economic
development
strategies
,
two
basic
models
have
been
identified
:
exo-
and
endogenous
development
.
</s>
<s>
The
first
emphasizes
top-down
management
using
external
technology
,
capital
and
human
resources
,
often
organised
in
separate
,
sectoral
agencies
under
central
government
control
(
e.
g.
,
agriculture
,
industry
,
culture
)
.
</s>
<s>
The
second
concept
,
the
endogenous
(
or
grass-roots
)
approach
,
encourages
bottom-up
development
factors
,
trusting
in
the
sustainable
use
of
local
resources
for
socio-economic
development
by
cooperating
residents
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
The
exogenous
model
of
sectoral
development
policies
was
common
in
democratic
countries
in
the
mid-20th
century
and
dominated
in
the
socialist
(
or
“
communist
”
)
countries
of
Central
and
Eastern
Europe
to
such
an
extent
that
independent
local
and
regional
self-government
did
not
exist
,
in
Poland
for
example
,
until
these
were
re-introduced
in
1990
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
in
the
Western
liberal
democracies
,
in
the
1980s
,
that
model
of
development
policy
began
to
be
perceived
as
ineffective
and
even
detrimental
,
leading
to
regional
disparity
,
environmental
damage
and
the
degradation
of
nature
.
</s>
<s>
As
a
result
,
a
neo-endogenous
approach
,
based
on
territorial
cross-sectoral
cooperation
of
local
stakeholders
(
i.
e.
,
on
territorial
governance
processes
)
began
to
gain
favour
.
</s>
<s>
The
model
of
territorial
governance
as
a
horizontal
,
cross-sectoral
regional
network
has
tended
to
be
most
pronounced
in
the
Anglo-Saxon
countries
and
has
remained
popular
through
much
of
Western
Europe
where
traditions
of
co-operative
governance
are
strong
,
not
least
because
the
state
is
sufficiently
powerful
to
be
confident
of
maintaining
the
initiative
in
partnerships
.
</s>
<s>
In
developing
countries
the
notion
of
collaborative
governance
has
been
widely
promoted
as
a
means
of
legitimising
and
strengthening
the
role
of
civil
society
in
the
management
of
public
goods
in
the
absence
of
sufficient
local
state
capacity
or
for
increasing
state
accountability
.
</s>
<s>
Collaborative
territorial
governance
may
be
seen
as
an
instrument
not
only
for
the
production
of
public
goods
and
management
of
local
,
limited
resources
,
but
also
for
changing
the
nature
and
logic
of
state-society
relations
in
a
given
country
.
</s>
<s>
It
was
disseminated
throughout
most
European
post-socialist
countries
from
the
early
21st
century
,
mainly
after
their
accession
to
the
European
Union
.
</s>
<s>
The
term
“
endogenous
development
”
is
considered
as
more
or
less
synonymous
with
the
“
grassroots
”
,
“
bottom-up
”
or
“
participatory
”
approach
to
management
of
local
resources
and
is
closely
related
to
“
sustainable
development
”
in
policy
practice
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
The
advantages
attributed
to
local
stakeholders
’
territorial
cooperation
encouraged
EU
policy
makers
to
promote
neo-endogenous
and
place-based
integrated
development
,
in
which
such
governance
processes
have
an
important
role
,
and
have
similar
features
and
are
considered
more
sustainable
than
the
top-down
exogenous
approach
.
</s>
<s>
These
models
seek
to
construct
a
hybrid
of
top-down
and
bottom-up
development
by
incorporating
top-down
support
for
bottom-up
territorial
governance
in
functional
areas
.
</s>
<s>
According
to
Ray
,
neo-endogenous
development
has
a
strong
emphasis
on
local
resources
,
capacities
,
perspectives
,
needs
and
knowledge
but
it
also
involves
hierarchical
management
of
incentives
and
the
replacement
of
the
principle
of
“
administrative
territory
”
by
a
functional
principle
,
with
inter-sectoral
co-operation
through
regional
networks
and
partnerships
and
increased
self-governing
responsibilities
at
regional
or
local
levels
.
</s>
<s>
In
other
words
,
these
models
assume
the
mobilisation
of
local
stakeholders
,
their
knowledge
,
demands
and
concerns
by
instruments
and
territorial
organisational
forms
determined
by
central
government
,
for
example
,
via
financial
grants
with
territorial
partnership
creation
as
conditionality
.
</s>
<s>
The
approach
is
seen
to
further
the
European
Union
’s
objectives
of
smart
,
inclusive
and
sustainable
growth
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
The
term
“
place-based
development
”
was
popularised
initially
by
the
Organisation
for
Economic
Co-operation
and
Development
(
OECD
)
report
and
the
Barca
report
to
the
European
Union
as
a
means
of
social
inclusion
and
participatory
and
fair
process
in
development
policy
.

<s>
It
implied
territorially
sensitive
,
multi-sectoral
approaches
,
involving
multilevel
governance
and
co-ordination
of
all
relevant
levels
,
policies
and
stakeholders
.
</s>
<s>
The
approach
informed
the
creation
of
area-based
development
partnerships
in
functional
regions
,
managed
by
diverse
local
stakeholders
,
for
instance
EU
Local
Action
Groups
in
rural
and
urban
areas
within
the
framework
of
Community-Led
Local
Development
,
Integrated
Territorial
Investment
Partnerships
in
metropolitan
areas
,
“
Urban
Action
Europe
”
(
URBACT
)
Local
Support
Groups
in
cities
and
others
.
</s>
<s>
Place-based
development
,
according
to
Zaucha
and
Świątek
,
is
a
long-term
development
strategy
aimed
at
reducing
persistent
inefficiency
(
underutilisation
of
the
full
potential
)
and
inequality
(
the
share
of
people
below
a
given
standard
of
well-being
and/or
extent
of
interpersonal
disparities
)
in
specific
places
.
</s>
<s>
It
can
be
attained
through
the
production
of
bundles
of
integrated
,
place-tailored
public
goods
and
services
,
designed
and
implemented
by
eliciting
and
aggregating
local
preferences
and
knowledge
through
participatory
political
institutions
,
and
by
establishing
linkages
with
other
places
.
</s>
<s>
It
can
be
promoted
from
outside
by
a
system
of
multilevel
governance
in
which
grants
,
subject
to
conditionality
on
both
objectives
and
institutions
,
are
transferred
from
higher
to
lower
levels
of
government
.
</s>
<s>
Both
place-based
and
neo-endogenous
development
emphasise
the
need
to
take
into
simultaneous
consideration
the
social
,
economic
and
environmental
needs
of
the
locality
,
through
a
cooperative
network
of
different
local
and
external
stakeholders
,
an
approach
which
is
termed
as
“
sustainable
”
or
“
integrated
”
.
