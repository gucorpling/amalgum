Health
monitoring
is
a
diverse
subject

it
covers
biological
systems
as
well
as
physical
systems

Biological
systems
are
usually
associated
with
the
monitoring
of
human
health
,
whether
it
is
related
to
diagnosis
of
diseases
,
monitoring
of
daily
activities
,
or
vital
signs
.

On
the
other
hand
,
physical

health
monitoring
is
associated
with
checking
physical
systems
,
such
as
structures
and
rotary
or
linear
displacement
machines
.

Structural
health
is
related
to
checking
vibration

cracks

or
fatigues
of
materials
in
buildings

pipes
.

Due
to
the
development

the
penetration
into

has
received
intense
interest
