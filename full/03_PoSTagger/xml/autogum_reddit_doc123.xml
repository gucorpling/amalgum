Hey

Race
here

We
are
doing
some
research
into
gaming
mice
and
we
are
also
giving
away
free
mousepads
to

For
those
of
you
that
do
n't
know
we
are
a
PC
gaming
peripherals
company
,
that
started
out
with
<ref target="https://www.pcgamingrace.com/collections/glorious-large-gaming-mouse-pads-mats">
large
size
mousepads
</ref>
and
then
transitioned
into
the
Mechanical
Keyboard
scene
with
our
<ref target="https://www.pcgamingrace.com/products/gmmk-full-customized">
GMMK
keyboard
</ref>
.
</s>
<s>
And
as
some
of
you
may
have
already
picked
up
on
it
-
we
are
working
our
way
into
the
mouse
realm
,
and
are
gathering
some
knowledge
on
what
you
guys
would
like
to
have
.
</s>
<s>
Realistically
its
pretty
much
impossible
to
make
the
&quot;
*final
mouse*
&quot;
,
but
we
will
instead
make
several
models
of
shapes
and
sizes
of
mice
that
can
hopefully
satisfy
everyones
need
.
</s>
<s>
We
are
also
working
on
a
solution
to
have
a
way
for
everyone
to
test
out
the
shape
of
the
mouse
before
committing
to
a
particular
shape
(
or
having
to
go
to
a
store
and
test
)
.
</s>
<s>
But
all
in
all
that
will
take
some
time
,
and
you
guys
can
keep
track
of
our
progress
with
our
periodic
updates
on
this
sub
or
