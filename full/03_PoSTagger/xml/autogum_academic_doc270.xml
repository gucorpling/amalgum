We
take
a
close
look
at
the
nature
of
expansive
mappings
on
certain
metric
spaces
(
compact
,
totally
bounded
,
and
bounded
)
,
provide
a
finer
classification
for
such
mappings
,
and
use
them
to
characterize
boundedness
.

When
finding
an
original
proof
to
a
known
result
describing
all
expansive
mappings
on
compact
metric
spaces
as
surjective
isometries
(
Problem
)
,
we
reveal
that
relaxing
the
condition
of
compactness
to
total
boundedness
still
preserves
the
isometry
property
and
nearly
that
of
surjectivity
.

<p>

We
provide
a
counterexample
of
a
not
totally
bounded
metric
space
,
on

the
only
expansion
is
the
identity
mapping
,
demonstrating
that
the
converse
to
the
above
descriptions
do
not
hold
