He

Every

All

you
find
dark-skinned
women
waiting
for
their
young

white
blazer-clad
private
school
boy

escorting
him
either
into

The

they

dependent

largess

life

support

because
the
military
affords
them
opportunity

so
they

not

The
sections
I

reading
are

stories
about
life
in

section

Because
at
daytime
when
you
usually
look
at
a
place
you
think
you
might
want
to
rent

buy

it
looks
a
certain
way

Then
go
at
night

it
looks
a
different
way

It
might
be
more
isolated
at
night
;
it
might
be
the
fact
there
are
nightclubs
you
are
n't
aware
of
during
the
day
so
it
has
a
lot
of
noise

This

the
real
estate
section

very
interesting
section

The
level
of
writing
is
now
better
at
the
paper
in
2007
than
when
I
was
there
up

1965

Of

people
are
better

is
now
far
more

educated

were

today

education

In
my
generation

most
of
us
were
probably
the
first

go

We
had
more

Jews
,
the
Irish
and
Italians
back
in
the
1950s

1960s

I
do
believe
we
had
a
sense

being
isolated
from
power
and
therefore
on
the
outside
looking
in
