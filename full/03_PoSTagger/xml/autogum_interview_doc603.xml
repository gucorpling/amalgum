<s>
And
I
think
also
what
we
need
to
do
is
is
that
we
need
to
ask
the
oil
companies
why
it
is
that
they
're
always
a
little
bit
short
.
</s>
<s>
It
could
be
that
they
do
n't
refine
things
like
they
should
.
</s>
<s>
They
always
make
it
to
where
the
demand
is
a
little
bit
more
than
supply
just
to
keep
that
extra
pressure
on
oil
.
</s>
<s>
That
needs
to
be
investigated
too
.
</s>
<s>
That
needs
to
be
more
tightly
regulated
because
energy
is
like
money
.
</s>
<s>
The
banks
are
the
same
way
,
energy
's
no
different
.
</s>
<s>
One
's
the
veins
of
the
economy
and
one
's
the
arteries
of
the
economy
.
</s>
<s>
And
both
those
things
need
more
federal
oversight
.
</s>
<s>
They
make
plenty
of
profit
,
no
one
's
talking
about
taking
them
over
.
</s>
<s>
But
they
need
to
be
regulated
.
</s>
<s>
And
these
artificial
shortages
and
things
should
n't
be
allowed
to
happen
.
</s>
<s>
You
ca
n't
do
that
.
</s>
<s>
What
they
got
is
basically
a
monopoly
.
</s>
<s>
All
this
would
be
doing
is
just
like
regulating
phone
companies
.
</s>
<s>
There
can
only
be
a
few
people
who
do
it
.
</s>
<s>
There
's
not
going
to
be
that
much
competition
.
</s>
<s>
We
know
that
.
</s>
<s>
So
they
actually
,
when
a
sector
of
the
economy
basically
is
in
oligopolistic
or
monopolistic
hands
,
that
the
government
's
got
a
right
to
step
in
and
regulate
on
behalf
of
the
people
,
because
the
more
money
that
goes
into
energy
unnecessarily
,
just
like
interest
at
the
bank
and
things
like
that
,
then
that
hurts
other
parts
of
the
economy
.
</s>
<s>
That
means
people
have
less
money
to
spend
at
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Wal-Mart">

<s>
They
have
less
money
to
buy
furniture
.
</s>
<s>
They
have
less
money
to
buy
other
goods
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Same
with
healthcare
,
that
's
why
you
have
to
regulate
that
.
</s>
<s>
It
's
somewhat
of
a
monopoly
as
well
considering
that
the
health
care
industry
,
the
insurance
companies
do
n't
have
to
compete
.
</s>
<s>
By
law
,
they
've
been
exempt
from
competition
for
about
50
or
60
years
,
which
really
has
n't
worked
out
too
well
.
</s>
<s>
I
mean
what
we
have
to
pay
equals
six
or
eight
percent
of
GDP
,
which
is
twice
what
they
have
to
pay
in
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Germany">
Germany
</ref>
in
relation
to
their
GDP
.
</s>
<s>
You
know
Germany
out-exports
the
United
States
,
a
country
of
70
million
,
because
they
do
n't
have
to
factor
all
these
health
care
costs
for
their
products
.
</s>
<s>
Health
care
should
be
something
that
is
individual
and
not
related
to
the
work
.
</s>
<s>
It
should
be
paid
for
through
the
taxes
.
</s>
<s>
People
should
be
afforded
so
much
health
care
costs
,
so
many
health
care
costs
,
like
take
for
instance
in
Germany
,
exports
go
up
,
prices
on
exports
get
more
competitive
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance%20of%20trade">
trade
deficit
</ref>
narrows
and
people
have
more
work
because
you
have
more
exports
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
The
United
States
is
hurt
.
</s>
<s>
We
're
the
only
one
of
our
competitors
that
does
n't
have
some
form
of
a
single
payer
that
controls
costs
and
gives
people
a
choice
of
doctors
.
</s>
<s>
As
a
result
,
that
has
to
be
built
in
to
the
cost
of
the
product
and
that
makes
us
less
competitive
,
makes
the
trade
balance
larger
.

Germany
,
again
,
a
nation
of
70
million
,
actual
gross
dollars
,
not
per
capita
,
gross
dollars
or
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Euro">
Euros

,
out-exports
the
United
States
of
America
,
which
has
four
and
a
half
times
the
people
of
Germany
,
and
that
's
pathetic
