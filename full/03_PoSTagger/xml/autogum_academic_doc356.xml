As
the
frequency
is
a
major
parameter
indicating
the
balance
between
generation
and
demand
of
a
power
system
,
it
is
controlled
in
the
Korean
power
system
by
providing
frequency
control
services
.
</s>
<s>
The
frequency
control
services
consist
of
primary
and
secondary
frequency
control
,
which
are
provided
by
the
resources
’
local
responses
and
the
automatic
generation
control
(
AGC
)
central
response
,
respectively
,
as
shown
in
Table

.

<p>
<s>
The
primary
frequency
control
is
the
frequency
response
provided
mainly
by
the
generator

governor

and
ESS
was
permitted
to
participate
in
the
primary
frequency
control
service
in

<p>
<s>
In
addition
,
in
the
Korean
power
system
,
the
frequency
response
is
evaluated
by
using
two
indices
,
the
speed
droop
and
the
response
quantity
.
</s>
<s>
The
speed
droop
is
evaluated
by
calculating
the
ratio
of
the
responding
amount
of
a
generator
power
to
the
frequency
change
in
percentage
.
</s>
<s>
The
responding
quantity
,
which
is
defined
as
the
governor
free
response
quantity
(
GFRQ
)
,
is
evaluated
by
the
difference
between
outputs
before
and
after
the
disturbance
using
the
Equation
(

:
(

where
is
the
time
of
a
disturbance

is
the
time
of

59.8

KEPCO
announced
a
plan

MW-scale
BESS

According
to
the
plan

a
BESS

</p>
<p>
<s>
The
main
purpose
of
MW-scale
BESS
is
substituting
the
existing
primary
frequency
response
reserves
from
a
thermal
generator
,
which
has
low
generation
cost
.
</s>
<s>
By
doing
that
,
the
thermal
generator
can
increase
the
generation
level
,
and
the
system
marginal
price
(
SMP
)
will
be
reduced
by
excluding
high-cost
generators
in
the
electricity
market
.
</s>
<s>
Furthermore
,
the
BESS
can
provide
or
absorb
the
power
within
200
ms

considering
the
communication
delay

<s>
Therefore
,
the
BESS
can
provide
the
needed
frequency
response
by
injecting
the
power
into
the
power
system
just

disturbance
