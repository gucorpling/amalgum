<s>
This
paper
took
IPTP
as
the
research
object
and
used
CHFS
data
to
analyze
the
impact
of
IPTP
on
income
inequality
and
social
poverty
.
</s>
<s>
Statistical
analysis
shows
that
the
proportion
of
private
transfer
income
in
the
total
household
income
of
rural
families
is
lower
than
that
of
urban
families
.
</s>
<s>
Family
income
inequality
analysis
showed
that
the
income
inequality
of
rural
households
is
more
serious
than
that
of
urban
areas
.
</s>
<s>
Because
the
living
standards
and
consumption
levels
in
urban
areas
are
far
higher
than
those
in
rural
areas
,
only
when
household
income
reaches
a
certain
level
can
they
live
in
cities
.
</s>
<s>
That
is
to
say
,
there
is
a
threshold
of
household
income
,
which
is
the
floor
level
to
meet
the
basic
life
needs
in
cities
,
and
the
urban
household
incomes
are
mostly
above
the
threshold
value
.
</s>
<s>
Moreover
,
the
middle-income
group
in
urban
areas
accounts
for
the
vast
majority
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
in
rural
areas
,
the
income
of
poor
families
is
very
low
,
and
the
income
of
rich
families
may
be
very
high
,
resulting
in
greater
inequality
than
in
urban
areas
.
</s>
<s>
If
IPTP
is
exogenous
,
it
can
reduce
the
inequality
of
both
rural
families
and
urban
families
,
and
the
improvement
in
rural
areas
is
greater
than
that
of
urban
areas
.
</s>
<s>
This
is
because
in
rural
areas
,
the
lower
family
income
,
the
more
motivation
to
work
in
cities
,
so
as
to
increase
the
income
of
poor
families
.
</s>
<s>
Considering
the
possible
endogeneity
of
IPTP
,
counterfactual
analysis
shows
that
IPTP
increases
family
income
inequality
.
</s>
<s>
From
the
perspective
of
the
human
network
,
every
family
has
its
own
private
transfer
payment
network
.
</s>
<s>
Private
transfer
payment
has
a
strong
correlation
with
the
family
income
level
in
the
network
.
</s>
<s>
According
to
the
hierarchical
distribution
of
family
income
levels
,
the
hierarchical
distribution
of
private
transfer
payment
can
be
obtained
.
</s>
<s>
Private
transfer
payments
can
create
more
wealth
in
high-income
family
networks
,
while
in
low-income
family
networks
,
private
transfer
payments
are
also
at
a
low
level
,
which
plays
a
very
limited
role
.
</s>
<s>
One
result
of
this
is
that
the
rich
get
richer
,
while
the
poor
are
still
at
a
low-income
level
,
thus
widening
the
gap
between
the
rich
and
the
poor
and
aggravating
inequality
.
</s>

<p>
<s>
From
the
analysis
of
income
,
consumption
,
and
household
poverty
,
we
found
that
the
IPTP
not
only
directly
subsidizes
the
total
household
income
but
also
indirectly
promotes
the
increase
of
household
income
.
</s>
<s>
At
the
same
time
,
IPTPs
also
stimulate
household
consumption
and
increase
household
consumption
expenditure
.
</s>
<s>
Although
IPTPs
increases
household
income
and
consumption
expenditure
,
they
have
no
significant
impact
on
the
poverty
level
of
Chinese
households
.
</s>
<s>
On
the
whole
,
the
objective
existence
of
IPTPs
still
have
a
positive
significance
.
</s>
<s>
Firstly
,
IPTPs
improve
people
’s
living
standards
from
two
aspects
:
Increasing
the
total
family
income
and
rising
household
consumption
expenditure
.
</s>
<s>
Secondly
,
although
the
IPTP
may
deepen
the
inequality
of
household
income
,
it
makes
the
rich
richer
by
promoting
the
income
growth
of
high-income
families
,
thus
widening
the
income
gap
.
</s>
<s>
For
low-income
families
,
although
there
is
no
significant
improvement
,
it
does
not
make
the
poor
poorer
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Based
on
the
findings
of
this
study
,
we
can
draw
the
following
policy
implications
about
improving
income
inequality
and
reducing
social
poverty
.
</s>
<s>
First
,
people
should
try
their
best
to
maintain
the
&quot;
exogeneity
&quot;
of
IPTP
and
reduce
its
substitution
for
household
income
.
</s>
<s>
The
study
finds
that
if
the
IPTP
is
exogenous
,
it
can
reduce
the
income
inequality
of
both
urban
and
rural
households
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
urban
and
rural
residents
should
be
encouraged
not
to
reduce
their
production
and
work
time
even
if
they
have
IPTP
,
so
that
IPTP
is
independent
of
family
income
expectations
.
</s>
<s>
Second
,
be
good
at
making
use
of
IPTP
to
invest
or
reproduce
.
</s>
<s>
At
present
,
IPTPs
have
not
significantly
alleviated
the
poverty
levels
of
families
.
</s>
<s>
The
main
reason
is
that
for
most
families
,
the
IPTP
has
directly
transformed
into
household
consumption
expenditure
and
has
not
played
a
greater
role
.
</s>
<s>
Third
,
the
government
should
encourage
urban
and
rural
residents
to
strive
to
develop
stable
sources
of
income
and
become
rich
through
hard
work
.
</s>
<s>
IPTP
is
often
an
“
unexpected
gift
.
”
</s>
<s>
To
get
rid
of
poverty
and
become
rich
,
people
should
rely
on
their
own
efforts
to
increase
family
income
,
instead
of
expecting
other
people
’s
private
gifts
.
</s>
<s>
Just
as
Chinese
President
Xi
Jinping
said
,
“
Happiness
comes
from
struggle
.
”
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
In
future
research
,
we
can
focus
on
more
details
,
such
as
who
remits
,
and
how
much
,
if
the
data
permits
it
.
</s>
<s>
Remittances
are
always
related
to
migration
closely
.
</s>
<s>
In
this
paper
,
we
did
not
differentiate
the
remittances
according
to
their
sources
.
</s>
<s>
We
can
also
research
remittances
together
with
population
migration
in
a
further
study
.
</s>
<s>
Different
migration
routes
lead
to
different
remittances
styles
.
</s>
<s>
We
could
also
conduct
research
on
how
different
styles
of
migration
and
remittances
affect
income
distribution
and
poverty
.
