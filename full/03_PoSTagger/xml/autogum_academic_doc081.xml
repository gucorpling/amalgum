<p>
<s>
Victims
were
central
to
the
detection
and
prosecution
of
crime
for
most
of
the
eighteenth
and
nineteenth
centuries
.
</s>
<s>
Without
victims
taking
action
of
some
kind
to
instigate
and
progress
formal
proceedings
,
there
would
be
relatively
little
recorded
crime
before
the
early
nineteenth
century
in
European
and
Anglophone
countries
.
</s>
<s>
In
most
of
these
states
,
newly-formed
police
forces
then
took
the
lead
in
the
prosecution
process
until
their
role
was
,
in
turn
,
supplanted
by
professional
lawyers
and
state
prosecution
services
.
</s>
<s>
Despite
their
‘
removal
’
from
the
courtroom
,
victims
have
remained
important
agents
in
the
justice
system
.
</s>
<s>
Today
they
are
frequently
evoked
and
re-imagined
within
media
and
political
debates
and
have
become
symbolic
ciphers
for
a
range
of
concerns
around
crime
and
related
social
challenges
.
</s>
<s>
This
special
issue
sets
out
to
address
three
broad
research
questions
:
</s>
<s>
How
has
victims
’
access
to
justice
been
(
re)framed
over
the
last
two
centuries
?
How
,
and
to
what
end
,
have
cultural
representations
shaped
perceptions
of
victims
?
</s>
<s>
How
,
why
and
when
did
victims
come
to
shape
political
and
criminal
justice
discourse
and
practice
?
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Two
articles
address
the
issue
of
victim
participation
in
legal
processes
.
</s>
<s>
The
early
decades
of
our
selected
period
are
addressed
in
an
article
by
Kathrine
M.
Reynolds
and
Carol
Liston
.
</s>
<s>
Prior
to
(
and
,
indeed
,
for
some
time
after
)
the
gradual
introduction
of
local
state
police
forces
in
the
early
nineteenth
century
,
victims
acted
as
prosecutors
.
</s>
<s>
This
article
uses
records
of
English
regional
courts
to
explore
prosecutions
conducted
by
a
diverse
range
of
victims
between
1800
and
1835
.
</s>
<s>
The
cases
sampled
are
drawn
from
a
larger
study
of
female
offenders
punished
by
transportation
to
New
South
Wales
,
Australia
.
</s>
<s>
The
second
article
,
by
Buluma
Bwire
,
explores
victims
’
participation
in
restorative
justice
processes
in
contemporary
Kenya
.
</s>
<s>
It
suggests
that
restorative
approaches
are
aligned
with
African
customary
law
and
that
they
foster
offender
accountability
,
reparation
for
the
victim
and
participation
by
affected
community
members
in
the
resolution
of
the
alleged
offence
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Two
further
articles
in
the
special
issue
focus
on
two
very
different
groups
of
victims
who
were
culturally
marginalised
for
different
reasons
and
who
,
as
a
result
,
struggled
to
gain
recognition
of
their
victimisation
.

Jo
Turner
’s
article
explores
prosecutions
of
violence
involving
alleged
assaults
on
male
victims
by
female
perpetrators
in
an
English
Midland
town
,
Stafford
,
in
the
late
nineteenth
century
.
</s>
<s>
Using
legal
and
newspaper
records
,
she
argues
that
both
the
courts
and
the
press
were
dismissive
of
violence
towards
men
in
domestic
settings
,
and
that
this
contributed
to
low
rates
of
prosecution
and
conviction
.

Ben

article

child
abuse
in
youth
custodial
institutions
in
England
and
Wales
during
the
second
half
of
the
twentieth
century
.
</s>
<s>
It
contends
that
state
authorities
failed
to
recognise
the
victimisation
of
children
held
in
such
institutions
and
that
this
failure
constituted
a
disavowal
of
the
state
’s
responsibility
towards
them

Two
final

the
rise
and
outcomes
of
victims
’
movements
in
the
US
and
England
from
the
mid-twentieth
century
onwards
.
</s>
<s>
Her
comparison
demonstrates
,
among
other
things
,
how
the
adversarial
legal
models
common
to
both
states
flexed
differently
in
response
to
these
movements

David
Miers
’
article
examines
a
key
element
of
the
modern
state
’s
response
to
crime
:
the
payment
of
state
compensation
to
‘
blameless
’
victims
of
personal
and
sexual
violence
through
the
Criminal
Injuries
Compensation
Scheme

explores
the
ways
in

eligible
(
‘
ideal

perceived

their
claims
determined

<p>
<s>
Overall
,
this
interdisciplinary
and
transnational
collection
of
articles
sheds
new
light
on
the
history
of
victims
—
an
emergent
field
within
victimology
,
criminology
and
socio-legal
studies
.
</s>
<s>
We
hope
that
,
together
with
our
own
broader
study
of
the
changing
role
of
victims
in
criminal
trials
(

)
,
framed
in
their
various
capacities
as
complainants

prosecutors

witnesses

they
will
encourage
further
research
into
a
critical
history
of
victims
’
roles

recognition
