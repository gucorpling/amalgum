There
is
so
much
debate
around
which
hosts
actually
<hi rend="bold">
are
</hi>
conscious
and
which
ones
are
n't
.
</s>
<s>
Some
say
it
is
just
Maeve
,
or
just
Bernard
,
or
just
Dolores
,
or
all
three
.
</s>
<s>
Some
believe
that
a
host
becomes
conscious
once
they
are
aware
that
they
are
a
host
.
</s>
<s>
Others
think
it
is
when
they
become
aware
of
themselves
as
an
individual
self
.
</s>
<s>
Others
say
it
is
when
they
first
make
a
&quot;
free
&quot;
choice
.
</s>
<s>
But
all
of
this
debating
completely
disregards
what
<ref target="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S94ETUiMZwQ">
Dr.
Ford
said
himself
.

<s>
This
is
the
relevant
quote
,
after
Bernard
asks
ford
what
makes
a
host
's
consciousness
different
from
a
human
's
(
emphasis
mine
)
:
&gt;&quot;This
is
the
very
question
that
consumed

The
answer
always
seemed
obvious
to
me
.
</s>
<hi rend="bold">
<s>
There
is
no
threshold
</hi>
that
makes
us
greater
than
the
sum
of
our
parts

<hi rend="bold">
no
inflection
point
at
which
we
become
fully
alive

<s>
We
ca
n't
define
consciousness

consciousness
does
not
exist

</hi>

Ford
is
telling
us
the
truth
here
,
at
least
the
closest
thing
to
the
truth
we
're
likely
to
ever
have
.
</s>
<s>
Consciousness
,
whether
you
're
an
ant
,
a
dog
,
a
human
,
or
robot
,
is
a
matter
of
<hi rend="bold">
degrees
</hi>
.
</s>
<s>
It
is
a
fluid
spectrum
.
</s>
<s>
The
only
real
measure
we
have
to
tell
if
something
is
conscious
or
not
is
how
it
reacts
to
stimuli
.
</s>
<s>
I
believe
you
're
conscious
because
if
I
say
&quot;
Hello
&quot;
to
you
,
you
will
greet
me
back
in
a
more
or
less
expected
way
.
</s>
<s>
That
is
you
reacting
to
an
external
stimulus
.
</s>
<s>
But
,
if
I
drop
a
banana
on
the
floor
and
it
bruises
,
is
that
an
example
of
a
living
thing
reacting
to
a
stimulus
?
</s>
<s>
When
the
leaves
on
trees
turn
upside-down
in
anticipation
of
the
rain
,
is
it
because
they
are
<hi rend="bold">
conscious
</hi>
of
the
subtle
changes
in
the
atmosphere
around
them
?
</s>
<s>
It
would
be
easy
to
say
&quot;
No
,
because
bananas
and
trees
do
n't
think
or
make
choices
.
</s>
<s>
&quot;
But
that
begs
the
question
.
</s>
<s>
It
misses
the
point
.

<s>
You
do
n't
have
any
access
to
what
that
tree
may
or
may
not
be
<hi rend="bold">
experiencing

If
I
say
&quot;
Hello

it
back

I
<hi rend="bold">

that
you
chose

do
that

<s>
But
what
if
we
were
both
in
Westworld
?

<s>
How
could
I
know
based
just
on
that
interaction
whether
or
not
your
&quot;
thoughts
&quot;
and
&quot;
choices
&quot;
were
electrical
impulses
in
your
brain
or
electrical
impulses
in
your
weird-egg-pearl-thingy
?
</s>
<s>
No
matter
how
many
times
I
say
&quot;
Hello
&quot;
and
watch
your
reaction
,
I
'll
never
have
direct
,
unfiltered
access
to
your
<hi rend="bold">
actual
qualitative
experiences
</hi>
,
and
so
I
can
never
be
100
%
sure

For
anyone
more
interested
in
this
,
I
highly
recommend
researching
(
beyond
just
these
wikipedia

the

I

this

a
clue

there

no
consciousness
transfer

since
Ford
just
died

He
's
been
in
control
of
the
host
brains
until
just
now

he
does
n't
believe
consciousness

a
real
thing

how
could
it
be
transferred
