But
there
is
also
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States">
Supreme
Court
</ref>
that
the
legislature
would
have
to
deal
with
any
kind
of
decision
that
's
made

now
and
when
they
act
next

MD

Certainly
,
there
is
a
couple
of
things
at
play
there
.
</s>
<s>
Recently
,
I
think
in
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Michigan">
Michigan
</ref>
,
they
stuck
down
and
then
stayed
the
decision
—
the
Michigan
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex%20marriage%20in%20Michigan#Constitutional_amendment">
constitutional
amendment
</ref>
.
</s>
<s>
So
there
is
no
question
that
the
federal
courts
are
getting
involved
.
</s>
<s>
There
is
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution#Equal_Protection_Clause">
equal
protection
ground
</ref>
litigation
that
is
being
filed
throughout
the
country
.
</s>
<s>
And
specifically
in
Indiana
,
I
think
,
there
has
been
four
law
suits
filed
challenging
the
Indiana
Statute
,
which
has
been
on
the
books
since
1986
.
</s>
<s>
And
so
this
is
a
big
battle
that
's
going
on
legally
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Traditionally
,
the
widely
held
view
is
that
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United%20States%20Constitution">
US
Constitution
</ref>
trumps
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution%20of%20Indiana">
State
Constitution
</ref>
and
that
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal%20judiciary%20of%20the%20United%20States">
federal
decisions
</ref>
in
court
trump
state
constitutional
law
.
</s>
<s>
And
so
those
are
all
things
that
have
to
be
reconciled
with
the
public
opinion
,
and
with
the
will
of
the
people
,
and
what
they
want
,
and
how
they
view
their
government
,
and
how
they
want
society
to
react
and
deal
with
these
types
of
issues
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
But
there
is
no
question
that
even
if
we
would
have
passed
the
constitutional
amendment
and
even
if
the
public
would
have
adopted
it
,
that
that
did
not
prevent
a
court
challenge
in
federal
court
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Let
me
just
make
one
more
comment
...
</s>
<s>
To
me
though
we
cannot
as
a
legislative
body
at
the
state
level
of
government
,
live
in
fear
of
litigation
.
</s>
<s>
We
have
an
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article%20Six%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution#Oaths">
Article
6
</ref>
oath
of
office
that
we
take
to
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/US_Constitution">
US
Constitution
</ref>
that
binds
all
elected
officials
to
the
same
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rule%20of%20law">
rule
of
law
</ref>
—
except
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States">
President
of
the
United
States
</ref>
,
who
takes
a
separate
oath
of
office
.
</s>
<s>
And
that
oath
of
office
is
to
the
written
Constitution
,
as
written
in
the
Constitution
.
</s>
<s>
It
has
nothing
to
do
with
common
law
,
has
nothing
to
do
with
Supreme
Court
decisions
and
<hi rend="italic">
stare
decisis
</hi>
[

</s>
<s>
It
has
to
do
with
the
written
law
,
the
written
constitution
.
</s>
<s>
We
also
take
an
oath
to
uphold
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution%20of%20Indiana">
Indiana
state
constitution
</ref>
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
And
that
oath
of
office
is
something
I
take
very
,
very
seriously
.
</s>
<s>
And
that
is
what
should
drive
us
,
our
own
understanding
of
the
Constitution
—
not
any
fear
of
litigation
in
Federal
Court
.

You
know
the
irony
in
all
of
this
is
that
HJR-3
was
really
not
my
issue

I
had
found
through

the

[

pretty
displeased

what

could

He
spoke
in
favor
of
HJR-3

in
a
&quot;
State
