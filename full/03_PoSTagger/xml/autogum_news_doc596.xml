An

The
people

In

case

obvious
differences

Richard
III
's
burial
was
some
500
years
ago
whereas
Alfred
's
was
about
1100
years
ago
.
</s>
<s>
Other
things
being
equal
—
and
I
do
not
know
anything
about
the
condition
of
the
bones
—
it
is
likely
to
be
harder
to
make
positive
identification
for
human
material
that
is
more
than
twice
as
old
as
Richard
's
Again
I
must
stress
that
I
am
not
an
archaeologist
or
DNA
person
but
my
understanding
is
that
in
Richard
III
's
case
procedure
centred
on
comparison
between
his
DNA
and
that
of
people
who
are
alive
today
and
who
are
descended
from
other
members
of
his
family
—
including
his
brother
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George%20Plantagenet,%201st%20Duke%20of%20Clarence">
Duke
of

</s>
<s>
I
was
struck
by
how
many
figures

importance
today
are
related
to
Richard
—
in
other
words
they
are
the
sort
of
people
whose
family
trees
are
well
known
.
</s>
<s>
While
I
am
sure
that
there
are
many
people
related
to
Alfred
,
the
greater
length
of
time
and
the
dispossession
of
so
many
Saxons
at
the
time
of
the
Norman
Conquest
would
mean
that
present
day
descendents
would
be
harder
to
trace
with
certainty
.
</s>
<s>
In
other
words
I
do
not
say
that
the
DNA
method
would
be
impossible
but
it
would
face
much
bigger
challenges
than
in
the
case
of
Richard
III
.
</s>
<s>
One
of
the
clinching
factors
with
Richard
III
was
that
contemporary
accounts
describe
the
King
as
having
a
humped
back
—
as
did
the
skeleton
.

As
far
as
I
know
Alfred
did

any
unusual
physical
features
