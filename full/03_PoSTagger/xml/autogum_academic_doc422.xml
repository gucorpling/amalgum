Most
ecosystems
are
exposed
to
multiple
environmental
stressors
acting
simultaneously
and
combined
multiple-stressor
effects
can
be
difficult
to
predict
because
they
can
be
larger
or
smaller
than
expected
based
on
the
effects
of
the
individual
stressors
involved
.
</s>
<s>
Stable
isotope
values
have
long
been
considered
indicators
of
anthropogenic
disturbance
.

In
aquatic
environments
,
the
use
of
δ15N
(
a
measure
of
the
abundance
of
the
heavier
isotope
15N
relative
to
the
lighter
isotope
14N
)
as
potential
indicators
of
land-use
intensification
and
nitrogen
enrichment
has
been
suggested
for
streams
and
rivers
,
ponds
and
lakes
,
estuaries
and
coastal
waters
.
</s>
<s>
Agricultural
land
use
can
impose
a
variety
of
stressors
on
stream
ecosystems
,
including
nutrient
enrichment
,
increased
sediment
load
,
higher
light
availability
and
augmented
water
temperatures
due
to
removal
of
riparian
vegetation
.
</s>
<s>
Another
important
stressor
is
water
diversion
for
irrigation
,
which
commonly
reduces
stream
discharge
and
flow
velocity
and
changes
sediment
and
temperature
regimes
.
</s>
<s>
Any
of
these
stressors
may
alter
stream
nitrogen
dynamics
,
for
example
by
flow
reduction
intensifying
in-stream
nitrogen
transformation
processes
such
as
denitrification
by
increasing
water
retention
times
,
respiration
rates
and
occurrence
of
anoxic
conditions
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
the
combined
effects
of
multiple
agricultural
stressors
on
stable
isotope
values
in
stream
ecosystems
still
need
to
be
investigated
.

Delta
15N
values
differ
between
nitrogen
sourced
from
precipitation
,
fertilizer
and
sewage
,
and
also
due
to
subsequent
fractionation
during
assimilation
by
plants
and
other
nitrogen
transformation
processes
.
</s>
<s>
Fractionation
is
the
enrichment
of
one
isotope
relative
to
another
through
biogeochemical
processes
that
discriminate
against
the
heavier
isotope
.
</s>
<s>
Further
,
gaseous
nitrogen
losses
through
denitrification
and
ammonia
volatilisation
can
lead
to
even
more
elevated
δ15N
values
of
the
nitrogen
initially
derived
from
both
inorganic
fertilizer
and
manure
.
</s>
<s>
Catchment
land-use
intensity
has
been
positively
related
to
δ15N
values
of
stream
water
,
sediment
,
aquatic
plants
,
consumers
and
fish
.

<p>
<s>
Among
stream
consumers
,
invertebrate
grazers
represent
an
important
link
for
nutrient
and
energy
transfer
from
primary
producers
to
higher
trophic
levels
.
</s>
<s>
Moreover
,
they
have
been
used
as
bioindicators
because
they
are
widely
distributed
in
running
waters
and
generally
reflect
the
isotopic
values
of
their
periphyton
food
sources
(
after
taking
into
account
enrichment
through
trophic
fractionation
)
.
</s>
<s>
Compared
to
the
high
spatiotemporal
variation
of
periphyton
stable
isotope
values
,
grazers
provide
a
more
time-integrated
and
habitat-integrated
measure
of
nitrogen
sources
and
transformation
processes
.

<p>
<s>
Most
of
the
existing
stream
studies
have
reported
positive
linear
relationships
between
δ15N
values
and
catchment
land-use
intensity
,
although
Larson
et
al.
reported
a
saturation
curve
for
δ15N
values
along
a
wide
gradient
of
%
agriculture
.

<s>
To
our
knowledge
,
no
studies
have
investigated
the
combined
effects
of
multiple
,
simultaneously
operating
agricultural
stressors
on
consumer
stable
isotope
ratios
,
even
though
non-additive
effects
such
as
antagonisms
and
synergisms
have
been
documented
from
experiments
assessing
changes
in
diversity
and
ecosystem
processes
in
freshwater
ecosystems
.
</s>
<s>
Nor
have
previous
studies
focused
on
multiple
primary
consumers
:
most
have
investigated
the
relationship
between
a
single
primary
consumer
taxon
or
calculated
δ15N
values
from
several
taxa
combined
where
the
focal
consumer
taxon
was
not
present
at
all
sites
.

<s>
Whether
different
primary
consumer
taxa
show
similar
relationships
along
gradients
of
anthropogenic
disturbance
remains
to
be
investigated
.

<p>
<s>
Against
this
background
,
we
studied
consumer
stable
isotope
values
at
43
stream
sites
spanning
wide
gradients
of
land-use
intensity
(
sheep/beef
farming
intensity
and
streamflow
reduction
)
within
an
agricultural
river
catchment
,
to
test
the
following
hypotheses
:

<list>
<item>

δ15N
values
of
common
primary
consumers
(
grazers
)
will
show
similar
patterns
along
the
gradients
of
catchment
land-use
intensity
because
they
all
feed
on
one
resource
(
periphyton
)
and
are
therefore
ingesting
food
with
the
same
isotopic
composition
;
</item>
<item>
δ15N
values
are
positively
related
to
catchment
land-use
intensities
because
higher
farming
intensity
and
greater
flow
reduction
increase
the
input
of
heavy
isotopes
from
fertilisation
and
increase
the
intensity
of
nitrogen
transformation
processes
;
and
</item>
<item>
δ15N
values
follow
antagonistic
response
patterns
along
the
gradients
of
land-use
intensity
and
flow
reduction
because
both
stressors
have
strong
individual
effects
and
their
joint
effects
cannot
exceed
100
