Ultimately

the

purpose

shine
a
light

reflect

right

<p>

Of

it

Why
did
you
register
alternate
domain
names
:

As
I
said
about
the
original
domain
-
I
wanted
to
register
the
meme
as
the
domain
,
and
that
's
what
I
referred
to
as
the
&quot;
statement
&quot;
domain
.
</s>
<s>
The
&quot;
question
&quot;
domain
came
about
because
the
entire
concept
of
the
meme
is
not
to
try
and
convince
people
that
Beck
raped
and
murdered
;
but
how
the
supposed
rumour
that
he
did
is
a
direct
parody
of
the
techniques
he
himself
uses
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
I
thought
that
the
question
form
would
serve
the
meme
better
,
so
I
went
ahead
and
registered
it
;
and
as
soon
as
I
did
,
I
changed
the
website
to
the
question
instead
of
the
statement
(
in
the
title
and
header
for
the
page
)
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
When
the
domain
dispute
was
filed
,
I
registered
gb1990.com
,
as
well
as
gb1990.net
.
</s>
<s>
I
did
this
partly
because
if
he
managed
to
get
the
question
or
statement
domains
taken
down
,
I
would
have
a
backup
in
place
.
</s>
<s>
Also
,
it
's
a
lot
easier
to
type
&quot;
gb1990
&quot;
than
either
of
the
long
versions
,
so
that
was
a
part
of
it
as
well
.

<s>
I
made
gb1990.com
the
primary
domain
for
the
website
,
and
parked
the
other
two
on
top

<s>
I
put
gb1990.net

something
happened
to
the

It
bears
observing
that
by

you

I

into
play

Even
before

up

Farkers

asking

So
it
definitely
got
attention
out
there

the

dropped
off
drastically

couple
of
days

n't
until
people
posted
news
about
the
legal
threats
to
Reddit

Fark
,

many
blogs
that
I
saw
spikes
in

</s>
<s>
The
major
spikes
in
traffic
to
the
site
have
all
come
from
updates
about
where
the
legal
fight
stood
.

<s>
For
example
,
when
a
thread
went
green
(
public
)
on
Fark.com
,
traffic
to
my
servers
nearly
overwhelmed
them
for
a
couple
of
hours

<s>
When
we
posted
my
brilliant
lawyer
Marc
Randazza
's
responses
to
the
original
WIPO
complaint

traffic
was
high
for
a
couple
of
days

In

it
dropped
down
