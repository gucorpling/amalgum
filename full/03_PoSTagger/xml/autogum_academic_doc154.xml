Titanium
nitride
is
an
important
technological
material
due
to
its
excellent
characteristics
such
as
high
melting
point
(
2950
°C
)
,
extreme
hardness
(
8
–
9
on
the
Mohs
scale
)
,
high
chemical
and
thermal
stability
,
gold
color
,
and
good
thermal
and
electrical
conductivity
.
</s>
<s>
This
material
has
been
considerably
applied
in
various
fields
such
as
wear-resistant
coatings
on
machine
tools
and
bearings
,
and
nontoxic
exteriors
on
medical
implants
.
</s>
<s>
Several
physical
and
chemical
methods
have
been
reported
in
the
literature
for
synthesizing
TiN
such
as
direct
nitridation
of
metallic
Ti
,
carbothermal
reduction
in
TiO2
in
N2
atmosphere
,
microwave-assisted
or
direct
carbothermic
reduction
–
nitridation
of
FeTiO3
,
self-propagating
high-temperature
synthesis
,
and
microwave
plasma
synthesis
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
these
processes
require
costly
raw
materials
,
high
temperatures
,
long
reaction
time
,
and/or
costly
equipment
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
affordable
processes
using
low-cost
materials
for
the
preparation
of
TiN
are
needed
.

<p>
<s>
The
Panzhihua
titanomagnetite
deposit
accounts
for
more
than
90
%
of
the
Ti
reserves
in
China
.
</s>
<s>
Titanomagnetite
concentrates
(
TMCs
)
are
currently
used
to
produce
molten
iron
through
the
blast
furnace
process
in
the
Panzhihua
.
</s>
<s>
Nearly
all
amounts
of
Ti
were
concentrated
into
the
slag
after
smelting
in
the
blast
furnace
.
</s>
<s>
As
a
result
,
more
than
three
million
tons
of
the
slag
containing
22
–
25
%
TiO2
are
produced
annually
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
no
appropriate
and
economical
method
to
process
this
slag
is
available
to
date
because
of
the
dispersed
distribution
of
Ti
in
various
fine-grained
(
&lt;10
μm
)
mineral
phases
.
</s>
<s>
Thus
,
this
slag
is
treated
as
a
solid
waste
and
stored
;
this
process
not
only
wastes
Ti
resources
,
but
also
poses
a
threat
to
the
environment
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
many
studies
have
been
devoted
to
develop
a
cleaner
production
process
than
before
for
comprehensively
utilizing
Fe
,
Ti
,
and
V
compounds
of
TMCs
such
as
the
direct
reduction-smelting
process
,
and
the
direct
reduction
–
magnetic
separation
process
.
</s>
<s>
Among
these
,
iron
oxides
are
first
reduced
to
metallic
iron
,
whereas
titanium
oxides
are
rarely
reduced
.
</s>
<s>
The
reduced
products
are
then
separated
by
smelting
or
magnetic
separation
to
produce
DRI
and
titanium
slag
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
the
subsequent
process
of
extracting
titanium
from
the
titanium
slag
is
very
complicated
and
is
not
environmentally
friendly
due
to
its
high
impurity
content
and
low
reactivity
.
</s>
<s>
Moreover
,
several
studies
have
been
conducted
on
the
preparation
of
iron-based
wear-resistant
material
from
TMCs
through
the
carbothermal
process
,
in
which
iron
oxides
are
reduced
to
metallic
iron
while
titanium
oxides
are
transformed
into
TiC
or
Ti(C
,
N
)
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
all
impurities
contained
in
the
TMCs

reductant
remain
in
the
prepared
material
,
which
may
degrade
its
performance
.

<s>
In
our
previous
study
,
a
new
process
was
proposed
to
prepare
TiN
and
direct
reduced
iron
(
DRI
)
from
TMCs
.
</s>
<s>
In
this
process
,
the
TMCs
were
first
reduced
by
anthracite
to
metallic
Fe
and
TiN
,
and
then
magnetically
separated
to
produce
DRI
and
impure
TiN
.
</s>
<s>
This
process
provides
a
way
to
realize
the
high
value
utilization
of
iron
and
titanium
simultaneously
from
the
TMCs
.
</s>
<s>
Our
results
showed
that
the
Ti
component
was
nearly
completely
transformed
into
TiN
under
the
conditions
of
reduction
temperature
of
1300
°C
,
the
anthracite
dosage
of
26
%
,
and
the
reduction
time
of
90
min
.
</s>
<s>
Moreover
,
the
separation
results
revealed
that
metallic
iron
and
TiN
can
be
separated
precisely
through
grinding
and
magnetic
separation
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
the
purification
of
impure
TiN
is
the
key
technology
of
this
process
.
</s>
<s>
Traditional
beneficiation
methods
including
flotation
,
magnetic
separation
,
and
gravity
separation
are
unsuitable
for
purifying
impure
TiN
because
the
particle
size
of
TiN
is
generally
less
than
10
μm
.
</s>
<s>
The
acid
leaching
process
can
be
used
to
remove
impurities
from
impure
TiN
given
that
TiN
has
excellent
acid
resistance
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
large
amounts
of
MgAl2O4
,
which
are
difficult
to
dissolve
in
acid
solution
,
are
observed
in
the
roasted
product
.
</s>
<s>
Magnesium
aluminate
spinel
is
also
concentrated
in
the
impure
TiN
after
magnetic
separation
and
will
thus
hinder
the
purification
of
TiN
by
acid
leaching
.
</s>

Therefore
,
the
formation
of
MgAl2O4
should
be
inhibited
during
the
reduction
roasting
process

borate

carbothermic

Herein

sodium
borate
was
used
as
an
additive
to
inhibit

TiN
