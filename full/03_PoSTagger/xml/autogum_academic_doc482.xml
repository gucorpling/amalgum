<s>
HIV/AIDS
continues
to
be
one
of
the
most
challenging
individual
and
public
health
concerns
of
our
days
.
</s>
<s>
According
to
the
latest
UNAIDS
data
,
in
2018
,
roughly
37.9
million
individuals
were
infected
with
HIV
globally
,
while
around
770,000
people
died
of
AIDS-related
illness
.
</s>
<s>
During
that
same
year
,
an
estimated
1.7
million
new
infections
occurred
,
mainly
due
to
unprotected
sexual
intercourse
.
</s>
<s>
Investment
in
the
field
has
been
considerable
,
but
a
cure
to
the
infection
remains
elusive
.
</s>
<s>
Nonetheless
,
tremendous
advances
have
been
made
over
the
last
36
years
since
HIV-1
was
identified
,
namely
in
prevention
,
diagnostics
,
and
treatment
.
</s>
<s>
The
development
of
antiretroviral
drugs
and
the
introduction
of
highly
active
antiretroviral
therapy
(
HAART
)
in
the
mid-1990s
—
currently
referred
to
as
combination
antiretroviral
therapy
(
cART
)
—
led
to
a
dramatic
shift
of
AIDS
from
a
fatal
disease
into
a
chronic
and
often
stable
medical
condition
.
</s>
<s>
In
fact
,
cART
contributed
decisively
to
a
steady
decrease
in
the
number
of
HIV-related
deaths
since
the
first
years
of
the
new
millennium
.
</s>
<s>
Antiretroviral
drugs
have
also
been
found
useful
in
the
prevention
field
,
particularly
in
post-exposure
prophylaxis
or
mother-to-child
transmission
.
</s>
<s>
Treatment
as
prevention
and
pre-exposure
prophylaxis
(
PrEP
)
have
further
contributed
to
the
reduction
of
sexually
transmitted
HIV
infections
.
</s>
<s>
Long-lasting
injectable
products
and
antiretroviral-based
microbicides
that
are
currently
in
late
stages
of
clinical
development
or
regulatory
approval
may
soon
provide
new
options
for
prevention
.
</s>
<s>
Gene
therapy
and
the
use
of
broadly
neutralizing
antibodies
are
also
attracting
a
great
deal
of
interest
as
possible
approaches
to
HIV/AIDS
management
.
</s>

<s>
Still
,
different
challenges
remain
in
anti-HIV
drug
therapy/prophylaxis
,
and
these
include
the
following
,
among
others
:
(
i
)
the
onset
of
severe
adverse
effects
leading
to
the
discontinuation
or
interruption
of
therapy
or
even
prophylaxis
;
(
ii
)
sub-optimal
biodistribution
and
pharmacokinetics
,
particularly
in
reservoir
sites
or
mucosae
involved
in
sexual
transmission
;
(
iii
)
the
occurrence
of
viral
resistance
;
(
iv
)
troublesome
regimens
and/or
drug
delivery
routes
that
lead
to
poor
adherence
by
patients/users
;
(
v
)
low
stability
and
reduced
shelf-life
of
active
molecules
,
which
may
be
particularly
challenging
in
tropical
climates
and
low-resource
regions
lacking
adequate
refrigerated
distribution
channels
and
storage
;
(
vi
)
lack
of
suitable
dosage
forms
for
particular
populations
(
e.
g.
,
children
and
women
)
;
(
vii
)
costly
drug
products
that
are
often
inaccessible
to
populations
in
need
of
therapy/prophylaxis
;
and
(
viii
)
social
and
legal
constraints
resulting
in
poor
access
to
and
the
discontinuation
of
anti-HIV
therapy/prophylaxis
.

The
response
from
the
scientific
community
could
not
be
more
affirmative
,

novel
ideas
and
concepts
have
been
emerging
throughout
the
