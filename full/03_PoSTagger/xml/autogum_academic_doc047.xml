Free
radical
nitric
oxide
(
NO
)
is
generated
via
non-enzymatic
and
enzymatic
pathways
in
plants
.
</s>
<s>
As
a
multifunctional
physiological
regulator
,
NO
has
been
shown
to
be
involved
in
every
aspect
of
plant
growth
and
every
developmental
process
in
plants
.
</s>
<s>
Furthermore
,
an
increasing
body
of
evidence
has
indicated
that
NO
could
play
an
essential
role
in
response
to
various
abiotic
stresses
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Previous
studies
suggested
that
NO
could
exert
its
effects
depending
on
the
cyclic
guanosine
monophosphate
(
cGMP
)
signaling
pathway
.
</s>
<s>
For
example
,
NO
could
promote
the
adventitious
rooting
of
marigold
through
the
cGMP-dependent
pathway
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Additionally
,
the
emerging
picture
is
that
NO
also
could
operate
biological
functions
through
protein
<hi rend="italic">
S
</hi>
-nitrosylation
which
is
a
NO-dependent
posttranslational
modification
(
PTM
)
.
</s>
<s>
It
has
been
shown
that
NO
groups
could
be
covalently
bound
to
cysteine
(
Cys
)
residues
of
target
proteins
,
resulting
in
the
formation
of
<hi rend="italic">
S
</hi>
-nitrosothiols
during
<hi rend="italic">
S
</hi>
-nitrosylation
.
</s>
<s>
At
present
,
increasing
evidence
demonstrates
that
<hi rend="italic">
S
</hi>
-nitrosylation
might
be
involved
in
processes
for
regulating
the
growth
,
development
,
and
stress

In
general
,
proteomics
deals
with
the
large-scale
determination
of
gene
and
cellular
function
directly
at
the
protein
level

<s>
Recently
,
global
protein
<hi rend="italic">
S
</hi>
-nitrosylation
has
been
identified
using
the
proteomic
approach

According
to
Hu
et

,
more
than
2200
<hi rend="italic">
S
</hi>
-nitrosylated
proteins
have
been
identified
in
mammals

plants

</s>
<s>
In
the
present
work
,
several
<hi rend="italic">
S
</hi>
-nitrosylated
proteins
have
been
identified
using
proteomic
analyses
in
different
plants
.
</s>
<s>
For
example
,
Lindermayr
et
al.
identified
proteins
,
which
,
when
treated
with
NO
,
were
involved
in
various
pathways
such
as
cytoskeleton
organization
,
metabolic
processes
,
redox
homeostasis
,
as
well
as
cellular
signaling
transduction
.
</s>
<s>
Moreover
,
Morisse
et
al.
identified
492
<hi rend="italic">
S

-nitrosylated
proteins
and
392
sites
in
<hi rend="italic">
chlamydomonas
reinhardtii

cells
,
which
were
treated
with
<hi rend="italic">
S
</hi>
-nitrosoglutathione

GSNO
)
.
</s>
<s>
Moreover
,
926
proteins
that
undergo
nitrosylation
have
been
identified
in
<hi rend="italic">
Arabidopsis
</hi>
.
</s>
<s>
Certain
NO
target
proteins
have
been
pointed
out
as
important
for
regulating
physiological
and
pathological
cellular
processes
through
proteomic
and
transcriptomic
analyses
.

<s>
Although
the

research
on
<hi rend="italic">
S

-nitrosylation
is
increasing
,
the
mechanism
of
<hi rend="italic">
S

unclear

The
aim

this

was

Therefore

adventitious

The
objective

to
decipher
the

<hi rend="italic">
S

-nitrosylation
in
the
process

adventitious
