Eavesdropping

Assumptions

<p>
<s>
To
allow
for
communication
,
the
only
prior
knowledge
assumed
is
the
address
of
both
parties
.
</s>
<s>
This
address
can
be
in
any
form
:
ip
address
,
unique
imei
embedded
in
the
device
,
or
phone
number
allocated
to
the
smart
node
.
</s>
<s>
To
avoid
collisions
,
we
assume
that
this
address
is
unique
and
cannot
be
spoofed
.
</s>
<s>
To
justify
this
assumption
,
we
note
that
spoofing
an
address
only
influences
some
of
the
routing
tables
;
not
all
of
them
.
</s>
<s>
This
allows
for
the
correct
delivery
of
packets
not
traveling
through
malicious
nodes
.

Last
,
no
trusted
third
party
(
ttp
)
is
available
for
the
coordination
or
authentication
of
sender
and
receiver
