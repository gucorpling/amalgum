Do
you

could
survive
periods

time
in
the
distant
past
when
the

axial
tilt
exceeds
45
degrees

for

,
might
there
be
subsurface
oxygen-rich
oases
in
caves

recolonize
the
surface

Also
what
is
the
exact
figure

the
tilt

which
oxygen
levels
sufficient
for
sponges
become
possible

(
It
looks
like
about
45

Radiolysis

The
