Hi
!
</s>
<s>
Done
a
few
BIAB
brews
so
far
,
all
of
them
hitting
right
around
50
%
efficiency
.
</s>
<s>
Here
are
some
of
the
details
I
figure
are
important
:
•
I
use
Beersmith
,
and
did
the
Brulosophy
tutorial
for
setting
up
mash
profile
and
equipment
profile
.
</s>
<s>
All
looks
good
there
,
and
my
water
amounts
seem
correct
(
I
end
up
with
the
right
amount
of
wort
at
the
end
of
the
boil
to
put
in
the
fermenter
)
•
I
use
Portland
,
OR
water
.
</s>
<s>
I
am
assured
by
the
brew
store
people
that
our
water
is
insanely
good
and
mash
PH
is
not
an
issue
.
•
</s>
<s>
I
do
a
full
volume
mash
,
and
I
insulate
my
pot
.
</s>
<s>
I
lose
about
a
degree
over
the
hour
.
•
Crush
should
n't
be
an
issue
.
</s>
<s>
The
brew
store
has
an
adjustable
crusher
and
I
've
been
setting
it
at
.025
•
</s>
<s>
I
squeeze
the
bag
real
well
,
and
jostle
it
around
to
make
sure
I
'm
really
letting
the
trapped
wort
escape
the
bag
.
</s>
<s>
Plus
,
I
'm
hitting
my
water
volumes
based
on
Beersmith
,
so
this
does
n't
seem
to
be
an
issue
.
</s>
<s>
As
far
as
I
can
tell
,
the
two
things
that
I
do
n't
do
right
now
are
sparging
and
mashing
out
.
</s>
<s>
I
do
n't
sparge
because
I
'm
trying
to
come
up
with
a
process
where
I
can
hit
70
%
without
sparging
,
and
it
seems
like
everyone
on
here
swears
up
and
down
that
they
do
n't
sparge
when
BIAB
and
they
hit
well
over
70
%
.
</s>
<s>
As
for
mashing
out
,
I
have
n't
been
doing
that
yet
because
I
do
n't
have
a
false
bottom
,
but
I
am
ordering
one
.
</s>
<s>
Once
I
get
it
,
I
'll
feel
comfortable
enough
that
I
wo
n't
burn
my
bag
in
the
bottom
of
my
pot
.
</s>
<s>
Could
sparging
and
mashing
out
really
be
the
20
%
difference
here
?
I
am
at
a
loss
,
and
throughout
all
of
my
searching
in
this
sub
,
it
seems
like
the
#1
thing
that
everyone
says
is
a
problem
is
crush
.
</s>
<s>
But
I
_know_
my
crush
is
good
.
</s>
<s>
Any
advice
is
greatly
appreciated
!
</s>
<s>
Thanks
all
!

Your
process
looks
nearly
the
same
as
mine
except
two
things
.
</s>
<s>
First
,
I
've
had
my
water
tested
by
Ward
Labs
and
use
BruNWater
to
figure
out
what
additions
my
water
needs
.
</s>
<s>
Second
,
I
give
the
grains
a
quick
stir
twice
during
the
mash
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<s>
I
am
able
to
consistently
hit
the
high
70s
,
occasionally
the
80s
.
