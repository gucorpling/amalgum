Zigbee
is
a
low-cost
wireless
communication
technology
based
on
the
IEEE
802.15.4
standard
,
which
is
often
used
to
create
personal
area
networks

<s>
Due
to
its
low
power
consumption
and
secure
networking
capabilities
,
it
is
often
preferable
for
wireless
control
and
monitoring
in
smart-building
technologies

In
this
study
,
we
use
XBee
embedded
modules
with
the
Zigbee
protocol
to
create
four
transmitters
that
are
placed
at
preassigned
positions
,
and
one
receiver
which
is
the
target
node
to
be
localized
.

In

introduce
mobility

the

to
verify
the
proposed
indoor
localization
strategies

NSBot2
,
which
is
a
nonholonomic

mobile
robot

With
regard
to
control
mechanism
,
NSbot2
was
preprogrammed
with
closed-loop
cascade
control
where
its
motion
was
constrained
to
constant
translational
and
rotational
velocities
.

<s>
This
technique
does
not
just
allow
the
robot
to
travel
along
various
types
of
planned
path

it
also
enables
each
experiment
with
a
specific
path
to
be
repeated
with
minimal
variations

<p>

The
basic
idea
for
indoor
localization
with
RSSI
is
that
the
target
node
to
be
localized
stays
at
a
fixed
coordinate
,
and
the
RSSI
from
different
anchor
nodes
with
known
positions
are
measured
.
</s>
<s>
RSSI
values
can
be
converted
into
distances
using
a
path-loss
model
,
which
are
then
used
with
the
triangulation
,
multilateration
,
or
trilateration
method
to
estimate
the
position
of
the
target
node
.

One
of
the
most
commonly
used
path-loss
propagation
models
in
a
WSN
is
the
log-distance
function
.
</s>
<s>
Via
this
model
,
the
value
of
RSSI
,
(
in
dBm
)
can
be
theoretically
expressed
as
follows
:
(

)
where
<hi rend="italic">
d

(
in

is
the
distance
between
transmitter
(

receiver
(

)
,
is
the
free
space
reference
distance
,
typically
1
m
,
is
the
path-loss
exponent
coefficient
,
and
is
the
RSSI
value
when
the
transmitter
and
the
receiver
are
1
m
apart
,
which
in
this
case
is
found
to
be
dBm
.

The
theoretical
value
for

occlusions

Hence

the

RSSI-distance

no
