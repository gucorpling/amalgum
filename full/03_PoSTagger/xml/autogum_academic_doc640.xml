This
study
found
that
more
than
half
of
respondents
have
taken
DSs
,
and
out
of
these
groups
,
almost
half
were
taking
the
aforementioned
supplements
during
the
course
of
the
research
.
</s>
<s>
This
result
is
similar
to
the
outcome
of
the
KNHANES
,
which
indicated
that
about
42
%
of
Korean
adults
have
taken
a
DS
at
least
once
in
their
life
.
</s>
<s>
Interestingly
,
the
most
important
driver
of
DS
consumption
is
recommendation
from
family
members
.
</s>
<s>
College
students
’
behaviors
,
such
as
valuing
their
peers
’
opinions
,
were
in
line
with
adolescent
behaviors
.
</s>
<s>
A
previous
study
found
that
most
college
students
who
took
DSs
were
usually
recommended
to
by
family
and
friends
.
</s>
<s>
This
study
also
found
similar
outcomes
.
</s>
<s>
University
students
are
still
in
the
transition
stage
between
adolescence
and
adulthood
and
may
therefore
continue
to
need
extra
care
from
their
families
.
</s>
<s>
Adolescents
are
a
most
vulnerable
and
easily
misinformed
population
,
who
are
targeted
by
the
DS
industry
.
</s>
<s>
Suggestions
from
friends
also
considerably
influence
the
health
behaviors
of
university
students
,
who
tend
to
emulate
their
peers
.
</s>
<s>
DS
consumption
is
likewise
prompted
by
the
desire
to
promote
general
health
.
</s>
<s>
The
transition
from
high
school
to
college
may
result
in
alterations
to
dietary
behaviors
because
of
dramatic
changes
in
surrounding
environments
.
</s>
<s>
To
compensate
for
lifestyle
adaptations
,
college
students
may
consume
DSs
to
maintain
overall
well-being
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
The
current
work
found
that
nutritional
information
on
product
packaging
was
the
most
important
factor
for
the
consideration
of
DS
purchase
.
</s>
<s>
Consumers
search
for
information
when
they
make
decisions
because
of
the
many
choices
and
products
that
are
available
to
them
.
</s>
<s>
An
intriguing
finding
in
this
research
is
that
although
the
respondents
’
knowledge
levels
were
low
,
they
still
carefully
examined
nutritional
information
on
packaging
,
suggesting
that
some
information
can
be
misleading
or
some
other
reasons
for
consumers
.
</s>
<s>
Abundant
information
on
DS
products
may
confuse
consumers
,
especially
those
who
have
low
knowledge
of
these
commodities
.
</s>
<s>
Many
previous
studies
confirmed
that
knowledge
level
and
health
behaviors
are
irrelevant
to
consumers
’
decision
to
purchase
products
;
that
is
,
purchase
is
based
on
perceptions
rather
than
objective
evidence
.
</s>
<s>
Hence
,
education
that
cultivates
adequate
knowledge
about
DSs
is
needed
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Recommendations
from
others
accounted
for
the
second
most
influential
factor
for
DS
consumption
for
the
same
reasons
discussed
in
regard
to
family
and
peer
influence
.
</s>
<s>
The
most
commonly
consumed
DSs
were
multivitamins
,
consistent
with
the
findings
of
another
study
.
</s>
<s>
Meanwhile
DS
users
and
non-users
significantly
differed
in
terms
of
DS
intake
,
but
no
such
difference
was
found
in
connection
with
other
health-related
behaviors
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
DSs
can
be
beneficial
to
one
’s
health
;
if
an
individual
is
driven
to
take
these
products
out
of
concern
for
his/her
well-being
,
then
such
behavior
may
motivate
other
healthful
habits
,
such
as
regular
exercise
.
</s>
<s>
However
,
no
differences
were
found
between
DS
users
and
non-users
.
</s>
<s>
The
relationship
between
stress
and
food
intake
is
a
well-known
phenomenon
.
</s>
<s>
Food
intake
increases
and
shifts
toward
unhealthy
choices
when
people
are
exposed
to
stressful
conditions
.
</s>
<s>
Concerns
have
been
raised
regarding
the
possibility
that
DSs
will
encourage
individuals
to
eat
less
healthy
food
or
pursue
unhealthy
lifestyles
.
</s>
<s>
DS
users
may
rely
solely
on
supplements
and
neglect
other
health
behaviors
that
may
bring
about
positive
health
outcomes
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
The
prevalence
of
DS
consumption
has
been
attributed
to
health
conditions
and
health
consciousness
.
</s>
<s>
This
study
postulated
that
health
consciousness
significantly
affects
DS
consumption
,
but
general
health
conditions
and
health
consciousness
were
viewed
in
a
neutral
manner
by
both
the
DS
users
and
non-users
.
</s>
<s>
These
individuals
were
highly
confident
about
their
health
and
physical
strength
.
</s>
<s>
Given
that
DSs
are
dispensed
without
the
need
for
a
prescription
and
are
available
to
all
individuals
who
may
have
different
health
conditions
,
the
benefits
of
such
products
may
be
minimal
,
and
their
efficacy
remains
controversial
.
</s>
<s>
Therefore
,
although
the
DS
users
may
have
been
aware
of
the
potentially
weak
efficacy
of
DSs
,
they
also
held
positive
perceptions
of
the
benefits
of
consuming
these
supplements
.
</s>
<s>
This
positivity
might
have
stemmed
from
advertisements
that
deliver
highly
persuasive
messages
in
a
fiercely
competitive
DS
market
.
</s>
<s>
The
result
can
also
be
attributed
to
the
DS
users
understanding
that
supplement
consumption
helps
them
keep
pace
with
the
demands
of
campus
life
,
which
is
known
to
present
easy
access
to
rapidly
available
snacks
,
regardless
of
the
health
condition
and
consciousness
of
students
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Given
that
involvement
is
difficult
to
measure
,
information
search
behaviors
were
used
instead
.
</s>
<s>
These
behaviors
were
significantly
more
prevalent
among
the
DS
users
than
non-users
.
</s>
<s>
Involvement
is
related
to
certain
manners
of
conduct
because
DS
purchase
requires
considerable
cognitive
effort
,
in
contrast
to
food
purchase
.
</s>
<s>
As
previously
mentioned
,
the
DS
users
and
non-users
exhibited
no
difference
in
terms
of
health
conditions
and
consciousness
.
</s>
<s>
Thus
,
individuals
in
need
of
DSs
look
for
information
and
are
finally
led
to
purchase
these
supplements
.
