As

most
proud
of

there
are
multiple
to
choose
from
in
respect
to
the
total
City
perspective

the
May
2004
Implementation
of
pesticide
bylaw
in
which
Council
decided
on
an
implementation
schedule
for
phasing
in
full
enforcement
of
the
bylaw

a
decision
that
our
incumbent
councilor
voted
on
behalf
of
the
ward
13
constituents
behalf
in
support
of
the
pesticide
ban
and
one
that
is
of
great
importance
on
our
ward
level
as
citizen
engagement
in
respect
to
environmental
issues
is
strong
within
and
listening
to
and
supporting
the
opinions
of
the
local
citizenry
is
,
in
my
belief
,
one
of
the
key
aspects
to
promoting
further
and
increased
citizen
engagement
in
respect
to
all
issues
brought
forth
for
discussion

In

increasing

about

87,000

95,000

a
decision
that
while
deemed
to
be
reflective

bring
the

average
