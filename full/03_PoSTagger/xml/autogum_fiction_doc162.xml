‘
O
our
Lord
,
and
Sovereign
Prince
Emmanuel
,
the
potent
,
the
long-suffering
Prince
!
grace
is
poured
into
thy
lips
,
and
to
thee
belong
mercy
and
forgiveness
,
though
we
have
rebelled
against
thee
.
</s>
<s>
We
,
who
are
no
more
worthy
to
be
called
thy
Mansoul
,
nor
yet
fit
to
partake
of
common
benefits
,
do
beseech
thee
,
and
thy
Father
by
thee
,
to
do
away
our
transgressions
.
</s>
<s>
We
confess
that
thou
mightest
cast
us
away
for
them
;
but
do
it
not
for
thy
name
’s
sake
:
let
the
Lord
rather
take
an
opportunity
,
at
our
miserable
condition
,
to
let
out
his
bowels
and
compassions
to
us
.
</s>
<s>
We
are
compassed
on
every
side
,
Lord
;
our
own
backslidings
reprove
us
;
our
Diabolonians
within
our
town
fright
us
;
and
the
army
of
the
angel
of
the
bottomless
pit
distresses
us
.
</s>
<s>
Thy
grace
can
be
our
salvation
,
and
whither
to
go
but
to
thee
we
know
not
.

</p>
<p>
<s>
‘
Furthermore
,
O
gracious
Prince
,
we
have
weakened
our
captains
,
and
they
are
discouraged
,
sick
,
and
,
of
late
,
some
of
them
grievously
worsted
and
beaten
out
of
the
field
by
the
power
and
force
of
the
tyrant
.
</s>
<s>
Yea
,
even
those
of
our
captains
,
in
whose
valour
we
did
formerly
use
to
put
most
of
our
confidence
,
they
are
as
wounded
men
.
</s>
<s>
Besides
,
Lord
,
our
enemies
are
lively
,
and
they
are
strong
;
they
vaunt
and
boast
themselves
,
and
do
threaten
to
part
us
among
themselves
for
a
booty
.
</s>
<s>
They
are
fallen
also
upon
us
,
Lord
,
with
many
thousand
doubters
,
such
as
with
whom
we
cannot
tell
what
to
do
;
they
are
all
grim-looked
and
unmerciful
ones
,
and
they
bid
defiance
to
us
and
thee
.

</p>
<p>
<s>
‘
Our
wisdom
is
gone

our
power

gone

thou
art
departed

nor
have
we
what
we
may
call
ours
but
sin
,
shame
,
and
confusion
of
face
for
sin

<s>
Take
pity
upon
us
,
O
Lord
,
take
pity
upon
us
,
thy
miserable
town
of
Mansoul
,
and
save
us
out
of
the
hands
of
our
enemies

Amen

This
petition
,
as
was
touched
afore
,
was
handed
by
the
Lord
Secretary
,
and
carried
to
the
court
by
the
brave
and
most
stout
Captain
Credence
.
</s>
<s>
Now
he
carried
it
out
at
Mouth-gate
,
(
for
that
,
as
I
said
,
was
the
sally-port
of
the
town
,
)
and
he
went
and
came
to
Emmanuel
with
it
.
</s>
<s>
Now
how
it
came
out
,
I
do
not
know
;
but
for
certain
it
did
,
and
that
so
far
as
to
reach
the
ears
of
Diabolus
.
</s>
<s>
Thus
I
conclude
,
because
that
the
tyrant
had
it
presently
by
the
end
,
and
charged
the
town
of
Mansoul
with
it
,
saying
,
‘
Thou
rebellious
and
stubborn-hearted
Mansoul
,
I
will
make
thee
to
leave
off
petitioning
.
</s>
<s>
Art
thou
yet
for
petitioning
?
</s>
<s>
I
will
make
thee
to
leave
.
’
Yea
,
he
also
knew
who
the
messenger
was
that
carried
the
petition
to
the
Prince
,
and
it
made
him
both
to
fear
and
rage
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Wherefore
he
commanded
that
his
drum
should
be
beat
again
,
a
thing
that
Mansoul
could
not
abide
to
hear
:
but
when
Diabolus
will
have
his
drum
beat
,
Mansoul
must
abide
the
noise
.
</s>
<s>
Well
,
the
drum
was
beat
,
and
the
Diabolonians
were
gathered
together
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Then
said
Diabolus
,
‘
O
ye
stout
Diabolonians
,
be
it
known
unto
you
,
that
there
is
treachery
hatched
against
us
in
the
rebellious
town
of
Mansoul
;
for
albeit
the
town
is
in
our
possession
,
as
you
see
,
yet
these
miserable
Mansoulians
have
attempted
to
dare
,
and
have
been
so
hardy
as
yet
to
send
to
the
court
to
Emmanuel
for
help
.
</s>
<s>
This
I
give
you
to
understand
,
that
ye
may
yet
know
how
to
carry
it
to
the
wretched
town
of
Mansoul
.
</s>
<s>
Wherefore
,
O
my
trusty
Diabolonians
,
I
command
that
yet
more
and
more
ye
distress
this
town
of
Mansoul
,
and
vex
it
with
your
wiles
,
ravish
their
women
,
deflower
their
virgins
,
slay
their
children
,
brain
their
ancients
,
fire
their
town
,
and
what
other
mischief
you
can
;
and
let
this
be
the
reward
of
the
Mansoulians
from
me
,
for
their
desperate
rebellions
against
me
.
’
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
This
,
you
see
,
was
the
charge
;
but
something
stepped
in
betwixt
that
and
execution
,
for
as
yet
there
was
but
little
more
done
than
to
rage
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Moreover
,
when
Diabolus
had
done
thus
,
he
went
the
next
way
up
to
the
castle
gates
,
and
demanded
that
,
upon
pain
of
death
,
the
gates
should
be
opened
to
him
,
and
that
entrance
should
be
given
him
and
his
men
that
followed
after
.
</s>
<s>
To
whom
Mr.
Godly-Fear
replied
,
(
for
he
it
was
that
had
the
charge
of
that
gate
,
)
that
the
gate
should
not
be
opened
unto
him
,
nor
to
the
men
that
followed
after
him
.
</s>
<s>
He
said
,
moreover
,
that
Mansoul
,
when
she
had
suffered
awhile
,
should
be
made
perfect
,
strengthened
,
settled
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Then
said
Diabolus
,
‘
Deliver
me
,
then
,
the
men
that
have
petitioned
against
me
,
especially
Captain
Credence
,
that
carried
it
to
your
Prince
;
deliver
that
varlet
into
my
hands
,
and
I
will
depart
from
the
town
.
’
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
Then
up
starts
a
Diabolonian
,
whose
name
was
Mr.
Fooling
,
and
said
,
‘
My
lord
offereth
you
fair
:
it
is
better
for
you
that
one
man
perish
,
than
that
your
whole
Mansoul
should
be
undone
.
’
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
But
Mr.
Godly-Fear
made
him
this
replication
,
‘
How
long
will
Mansoul
be
kept
out
of
the
dungeon
,
when
she
hath
given
up
her
faith
to
Diabolus
!
As
good
lose
the
town
,
as
lose
Captain
Credence
;
for
if
one
be
gone
the
other
must
follow
.
’
</s>

But
to
that
Mr.
Fooling
said
nothing
