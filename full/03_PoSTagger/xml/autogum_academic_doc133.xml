The
accompanying
increased
traffic
due
to
the
rapid
development
of
tourism
at
present
calls
for
the
better
sustainability
and
equilibrium
of
tourism
and
traffic
resources
in
the
future

<s>
This
paper
proposed
a
double-layered
coupling
system
focusing
on
tourism
traffic
,
which
combined
optimization
of
the
network
structure
and
adjustment
of
future
resource
levels
in
a
systematic
way
.
</s>
</p>
<p>
<s>
In
the
upper
layer
of
the
system
,
we
examined
three
main
tourism
traffic
factors
,
i.
e.
,
socioeconomic
benefits
,
levelling
benefits
of
tourism
and
traffic
resources
,
and
green
benefits
,
which
have
been
identified
as
important
aspects
of
the
multi-objective
model
.
</s>
<s>
The
socioeconomic
benefits
mainly
consist
of
the
optimization
cost
of
the
tourism
traffic
network
and
the
time
cost
saved
for
road
users
.
</s>
<s>
The
levelling
benefits
of
tourism
and
traffic
resources
comprise
both
the
investment
and
income
of
tourism
projects
.
</s>
<s>
Last
but
not
least
,
emission
of
carbon
dioxide
is
set
as
a
fundamental
index
of
green
benefits
.
</s>
<s>
This
comprehensive
benefit-oriented
model
not
only
paves
the
way
to
utilize
the
importance
degree
of
nodes
to
quantify
the
long-neglected
radiation
effect
of
the
tourism
economy
,
but
also
has
a
more
concise
format
,
and
the
involved
factors
are
more
relevant
compared
with
other
models
.
</s>
<s>
In
addition
,
a
genetic
algorithm
approach
with
adapted
parameters
has
been
developed
to
solve
the
established
model
.
</s>
<s>
Through
the
adjustment
of
relevant
parameters
,
Pareto
solutions
were
obtained
at
a
high-iteration
speed
.

</p>
<p>
<s>
In
the
lower
layer
,
we
introduced
the
idea
of
the
tourism
traffic
matching
curve
,
which
provided
a
direct
and
efficient
evaluation
method
for
the
equilibrium
of
the
tourism
traffic
network
.

<s>
On
the
curve
,
the
abscissa
and
the
vertical
axis
stand
for
the
importance
degree
of
the
tourism
node
and
the
cumulative
percentage
of
the
network
scale
respectively
.
</s>
<s>
It
is
notable
that
the
slope
change
of
the
curve
could
evaluate
the
equilibrium
of
allocations
of
the
network
,
and
that
the
boundaries
of
two
indicators
,
i.
e.
,
and
,
are
calculated
in
terms
of
the
results
of
the
upper
layer
and
are
used
as
evaluation
criteria
.
</s>
<s>
Thus
,
the
corresponding
indicators
of
the
current
network
could
be
determined
and
compared
with
standards
,
which
results
in
an
effective
evaluation
of
the
tourism
traffic
network

The
practical
case
study
in
this
paper

proof

the
feasibility

effectiveness
of
the
proposed
system

graphs
and
concise
results

Genetic
algorithm
parameters
are
adjusted
to
make
the
iteration
process
more
efficient

a
population

probability

a

Relative
to
the
current
indicators

a
certain
range
was
successfully
identified
wherein
jump
phenomena
could
possibly
occur

More
importantly

Certain
nodes

imbalanced

it

In
