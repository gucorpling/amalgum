<head id="Study_shows_that_carrying_excess_fat_around_waist_increases_risk_of_early_death">Study shows that carrying excess fat around waist increases risk of early death</head>
<p>A new study has found that people storing extra fat around their waist have a strongly increased chance of early death, even if their overall weight is average. The study, published in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New%20England%20Journal%20of%20Medicine">New England Journal of Medicine</ref> today, found that for each addition 5cm on the waist, the chance of early death is increased by between 13% and 17%.</p>
<p>In the study, 360,000 people from across nine countries in Europe were surveyed.</p>
<p>One of the study's authors, Professor Elio Riboli of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial%20College%20London">Imperial College London</ref>, commented on the findings. "We were surprised to see the waist size having such a powerful effect on people's health and premature death," he stated.</p>

<p>The <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European%20Commission">European Commission</ref>, the executive branch of the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/European_Union">European Union</ref>, has today lifted its ban on unusually shaped fruits and vegetables, in what the EU's agriculture commissioner has called "a new dawn for the curvy cucumber and the knobbly carrot".</p>
<p>The regulation has previously been criticized as an example of the EU's bureaucracy by critics of the organisation.</p>
<p>The products affected by the deregulation are apricots, artichokes, asparagus, aubergines, avocadoes, beans, Brussels sprouts, carrots, cauliflowers, cherries, courgettes, cucumbers, cultivated mushrooms, garlic, hazelnuts in shell, headed cabbage, leeks, melons, onions, peas, plums, ribbed celery, spinach, walnuts in shell, water melons and witloof/chicory.</p>

<head id="Blackwater_may_pay_financial_penalties_for_improper_arms_shipments">Blackwater may pay financial penalties for improper arms shipments</head>
<p>Recent anonymous press briefings by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United%20States%20Department%20of%20State">US State Department</ref> officials indicated that its arms control division may punish <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackwater%20Worldwide">Blackwater Worldwide</ref> for improper paperwork.</p>
<p>The Directorate of Defense Trade Controls has the power to fine or agree voluntary penalties with exporters of certain weapons, who do not follow correct procedures.
Blackwater Worldwide, a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/private%20military%20company">private military company</ref>, exported automatic weapons to Iraq that became the subject of a federal investigation first disclosed in 2007.
Concern was expressed by the unnamed officials that paperwork errors may make the weapons untraceable, and that some reached Iraq's black market.</p>
