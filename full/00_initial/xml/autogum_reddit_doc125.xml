<head>Laptop for programming and light gaming</head>
<sp who="#unknown">

<list type="unordered"><item>  <hi rend="bold">Total budget and country of purchase:</hi>  $1000 USD Max. Lower price is always nice. </item>
<item>  <hi rend="bold">Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply.</hi>  I dont need a 2 in 1 so I prefer a decent battery life and overall best specs. </item>
<item>  <hi rend="bold">How important is weight and thinness to you?</hi>  The lighter the better. </item>
<item>  <hi rend="bold">Which OS do you require? Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Linux.</hi>  Windows and Linux </item>
<item>  <hi rend="bold">Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.</hi>  N/A </item>
<item>  <hi rend="bold">Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.</hi>  IDEs and test servers mainly. </item>
<item>  <hi rend="bold">If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?</hi>  Overwatch and Fortnite mainly. I dont mind low graphics settings as long as fps is decently high. </item>
<item>  <hi rend="bold">Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?</hi>  A decent keyboard is preferred and build quality that lasts for a few years at least. </item>
<item>  <hi rend="bold">Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.</hi>  Preferably not too flashy with the gamer black and red accents but its fine if unavoidable. Also, if possible, provide a couple of options that I can choose from. Thank you so much! EDIT: I do want to say that I don't plan on doing a lot of gaming since I already have a desktop PC for that. The only time I would use it for gaming is if I'm away or if a friend visits. So in all honesty, I value other qualities like battery and CPU more than GPU power.</item>

<p>I would recommend this [Dell Inspiron] (https: www.amazon.com dp B0764HW117 ?tag=bkadamos_alltest-20) because it comes with everything you may need, 7th generation, i5 quad core CPU which is one of the best in the market and great for your usage, 8GB of ram for smooth multitasking, good SSD storage of 128GB for faster boot up and loading, 15.6 inch Full HD IPS anti-glare screen which is a must have for this price range, 1TB HDD, GeForce GTX 1060 GPU that should be able to handle games on medium to high settings with very good FPs, long battery life, high build quality, but itâ€™s within your budget. </p>
