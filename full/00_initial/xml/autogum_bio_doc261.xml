<p><hi rend="bold">Tan-Che-Qua</hi> (alternatively <hi rend="bold">Tan Chitqua</hi> or <hi rend="bold">Tan Chetqua</hi>) (c. 1728 – �1796) was a Chinese artist who visited England from 1769 to 1772.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-ODNB-1">[1]</ref> He exhibited his work at the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Academy">Royal Academy</ref> in 1770, and his clay models became fashionable in London for a short period. He returned to China in 1772. After the merchant <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loum_Kiqua">Loum Kiqua</ref> in 1756-7, and the Christian convert <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Shen_Fuzong">Michael Shen Fuzong</ref> in 1687, Tan-Che-Qua is one of the earliest Chinese people known to have visited England.</p>
<head>Career</head>
<p>Tan-Che-Qua was probably born in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong">Guangdong</ref> in China.</p>
<p>He became an artist and clay modeller in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canton_(Guangzhou)">Canton</ref>, making clay portrait figures.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-ODNB-1">[1]</ref> In his middle years, Tan-Che-Qua arrived in London from Canton on 11 August 1769 on the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Indiaman">East Indiaman</ref> <hi rend="italic">Horsendon</hi>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-gm-2">[2]</ref> The Chinese authorities had given him permission to travel to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta">Batavia</ref> (now Jakarta), but he went to England instead. He lived in lodgings on <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strand,_London">the Strand</ref>, where he worked as a clay modeler, creating busts for 10 guineas and small statuettes for 15 guineas.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-ODNB-1">[1]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-3">[3]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-4">[4]</ref> One of the few known surviving examples of his work is a figurine of physician <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Askew">Anthony Askew</ref>, held by the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_College_of_Physicians">Royal College of Physicians</ref>. The Museum of London has another attributed to Tan-Che-Qua of the London merchant <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Todd">Thomas Todd</ref>; the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rijksmuseum">Rijksmuseum</ref> in Amsterdam has one of Dutch merchant <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Everardus_van_Braam_Houckgeest">Andreas Everardus van Braam Houckgeest</ref>; and one of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Garrick">David Garrick</ref> is in a private collection<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-ODNB-1">[1]</ref>, which is confirmed not out of his hand but another Chinese modeler working in Canton in the 1730s.</p>
<p>He attended an audience with <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_III">George III</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Charlotte">Queen Charlotte</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-ODNB-1">[1]</ref> He also attended meetings at the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Academy_of_Arts">Royal Academy of Arts</ref> and exhibited work there in 1770. He was included in a group portrait of the Royal Academicians by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Zoffany">Johann Zoffany</ref>.

<p>He boarded the East Indiaman <hi rend="italic">Grenville</hi> in March 1771 intending to return to China. After a series of accidents the crew took against him, he disembarked at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deal,_Kent">Deal, Kent</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-gm-2">[2]</ref> He returned to China in 1772. The <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentleman's_Magazine">Gentleman's Magazine</ref></hi> reported that he committed suicide in Canton in the mid-1790s.

<head>Legacy</head>
<p>Sir <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Chambers_(architect)">William Chambers</ref> used his name – Tan Chet-qua – for the narrator of his <hi rend="italic">Explanatory Discourse by Tan Chet-qua, of Quang-Chew-fu, Gent.</hi>, an appendix to the second edition (1773) of his book on Chinese gardening, <hi rend="italic">Dissertation on Oriental Gardening</hi> (1772), a fanciful elaboration of contemporary English ideas about the naturalistic style of gardening in China.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-8">[8]</ref></p>
