<p><hi rend="bold">DS:  What you think the proper role of Congress is in a time of war?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">SB:</hi>  To <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War%20Powers%20Clause">declare it</ref>, which we did in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq%20Resolution">War Resolution on Iraq</ref>, is, I think, a proper role of Congress; to fund it, as we have been, and if people don't like the war, to stop the funding for the war.  That's the role.  I think there's an oversight role for Congress to play that can be very effective and helpful.  I think there are suggestions that we can make, critical or complimentary in fashion, like what Joe Biden and I are doing on suggesting our political setup in Iraq is not working, and we think it should go another route.  That ultimately has to be decided by the Iraqis, and not by us, but we can highlight these issues.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">DS:  Do you feel the American people were misled with the war in Iraq?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">SB:</hi>  Based on the information we had at the time, I do not. On what we have found since, we have not found weapons of mass destruction.  But the information we had at the time, from our intelligence service and from intelligence services overseas, was that they had weapons of mass destruction, chemical and biological, and they were working on nuclear, and they had used them in the past, which we know they had--used them.  There's also, I think, David, a real tendency, a decision made in 2003 through the eyes of 2007.  In 2003, we're within two years of 9/11.  The country is still in shock of what had happened at 9/11, and there was no way we were going to let somebody else, if we could stop it, get in a position to be able to use weapons of mass destruction, give them to terrorists, and come after us. And that seemed like an all-too-plausible scenario with Saddam Hussein having had weapons of mass destruction--we thought still had them.  And having terrorists operate on this soil.  We had a strong thought that he would mix the two against us.  And we were not going to let that happen in light of that close proximity to 9/11.  Now you go to 2007, you say, "Well, that doesn't seem like a very highly likely scenario, but in 2003, it seemed an all-too-plausible scenario.  And the first charge of the Federal government is to protect the people.  When a bipartisan majority strongly voted to support the war in Iraq, it was with the thought of protecting the American people.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">DS:  What do you think is going to happen to <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Egypt">Egypt</ref> after <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Hosni_Mubarak">Mubarak</ref>?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">SB:</hi>  It looks like now he's grooming <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamal%20Mubarak">his son</ref>, and they may well be able to pull off that succession.  I would hope over a certain period of time they would get a more democratic, open economic system and that they would bring in people with the courage for that.  I'm fearful of the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Muslim_Brotherhood">Muslim Brotherhood</ref> taking over if there was an open election today in Egypt.  It seems to me they have the upper hand in a general election in Egypt today.</p>
