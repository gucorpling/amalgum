<p><hi rend="bold">Prince Christopher:</hi>  Vikesland came into being officially in July of 2005. I first came across the concept of Micronationalism in late 2004 and thought it would be a great concept for a documentary. Then the idea of creating my own nation for that documentary would be even better, so  I came up with Vikesland. The name is an homage to the Vikings of old who adventured into the unknown world in search of new things. The documentary is very slow in developing due to lack of funding mainly but that will hopefully be solved in the next year or two. Vikesland quickly developed into a real passion for me and others and has developed into what it is right now. We have a constitution and various Government Ministries that oversee the running of the nation.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN (Joseph Ford)</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">Does Vikesland have its own flag, currency and national anthem?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Prince Christopher:</hi> Yes we currently have a flag as well as our own currency and our own national anthem. We minted a small run of $1 Vikeslandic Crowns and have various denominations in paper currency. We also have postal stamps. The national anthem is currently only an instrumental theme but lyrics are in the works.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN (Joseph Ford)</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">What is the official language of Vikesland?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Prince Christopher:</hi> The official language of Vikesland is English but we are possibly going to adopt an official second language in the future.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN (Joseph Ford)</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">What is the governmental structure of Vikesland?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Prince Christopher:</hi> I like to call our system a democratic monarchy where the head of state is directly involved in the Government workings but most major things require a majority vote from the royal council. Think of city hall with the Prince as Mayor and the rest of the Government as council. Our system also allows for general citizen involvement through an electoral position of Chancellor or Ministerial portfolio. As Prince I have constitutional rights to appoint Government ministers and Noble titles, but I always like to confer with the Royal council to get their approval as well.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN (Joseph Ford)</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">Does Vikesland have its own military?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Prince Christopher:</hi> Yes, we have the Vikeslandic Security force which has land, air and sea capability. Mind you these are all on a very small scale. Our force is essentially an unarmed entity that is primarily focused on security, search and rescue and having a lot of fun. We have no desire to wage any wars on anyone and will defer any violent threats against us to the larger Macro-national authorities. The only time any of us carry a weapon is for wild animal defense, hunting or sporting purposes. This is of course in accordance with local Macro-national laws and with the Noble land owners consent.</p>
