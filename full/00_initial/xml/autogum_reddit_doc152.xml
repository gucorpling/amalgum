<head>What makes you unwanted by people?</head>
<sp who="#Ortilex">
<p>I spend most of my free time alone and i dont mind it much, untill i start seeing friends or people i know hang out and go to fun places on facebook. I'm not really a hated person and i have a few friends, but i'm just never invited anywhere, therefore i have no solid or true friendships, i honestly feel sad sometimes. So whats the reason for that? Sometimes i think its because i'm not that interesting, or maybe just look unfriendly, or maybe because i don't follow people and leave a social gathering faster than anyone( its more of an escape because i'm sacred they find me uniteresting) So do you guys know a reason for this? Or have any solutions? How can i build solid relationship and get invited to event like most people?</p>

<p>the best advice i can give is to go out alone and just approach people. If the people in your life don't give a damn, you don't owe them anything. Go to places and events you're interested in and have genuine fun. Life is suffering homie. plain and simple, we bond over our mutual struggles and interests, what people seek out the most is someone who can make their life bearable and entertain them. The key is if you can make yourself happy you can make others happy, that's how you take control of your life, your circle and your social interactions. Make people rise to your level, don't grovel for their attention or seek it out if they're not seeking you. the best gift you can give to others is to make the most of yourself remember that and repeat it. let the fakes and haters stay where they are. </p>
<p>love is not possible without personal growth and self respect, love actually develops naturally if those 2 things are a solid part of your personality and life. </p>
<p>hope this helped.</p>

<p>I think you need to stop thinking you're uninteresting first. When you're out hanging out, remember that it's also for you, so try to enjoy it in whatever way you like, while still maintaining polite manners. You aren't out there to entertain and perform, you're there to hang out and have fun. </p>
<p>Basically, don't force it too much. Try what jokes stories you may have in your head but don't necessarily feel compelled to do it. </p>
<p>I think that's the only advice i can think of for now. It's really tough trying to figure out how to socialise intially because the problem can be very hard to pinpoint sometimes, but just keep trial and error and im sure you'll get closer to figuring it out.</p>
