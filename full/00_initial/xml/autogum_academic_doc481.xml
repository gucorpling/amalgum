Sport is a global phenomenon. Likewise, physical inactivity, especially at the youth level, is epidemically low. Sport participation is one prominent avenue for physical activity engagement. Getting and keeping youth involved in sport is public health issue. Given that sport requires coaches and parents, they are important to study. The increasing academic interest in understanding the nature of coach and parental involvement in youth sport has been highlighted in many studies. Research has illuminated both positive and negative forms of the sport experience from the perspectives of coaches; parents; and youth participants. One less understood aspect, however, surrounds the potentially conflicting role of all three participants, namely, the athletic triangle. The athletic triangle consists of the coach, athlete, and parent. The relationships within this triad can have a significant impact on the overall development of the athlete. </p>

<p>Motivated participation of coaches, athletes, and parents in youth sports can be viewed as an effective educational system. This system can be described as a continuous process of positive interaction among all three members of the system. However, recent research findings have shown that such a three-dimensional educational system has been underdeveloped and lacks positivism, and its effectiveness is limited. The athletic triangle can influence the young athlete’s decision to participate in sport, to remain in the sport, and to pursue a sporting career. For example, parents play a major role in a child’s athletic development and are members of the athletic triangle. Close and solid relationships between children and parents ensure a consistent feeling of security and confidence. Mutual parent–athlete trust, respect, belief, support, cooperation, communication, and understanding are considered among the most important relationship components that contribute to athlete performance success and satisfaction. By contrast, parental pressure is found in sports with parent demonstration of excessively high expectations by criticizing children following competitions, punishing them, and “withdrawing love” when performances do not meet their expectations. Perceptions of these types of behaviors have been associated with negative aspects of children’s sporting experiences, such as fear of failure, precompetitive anxiety, burnout, and dropout. </p>

<p>Regarding the other adult in the athletic triad, the coach is one of the main figures in sports with direct influence on athletes’ participation. Coaches are not only expected to coach technically and tactically but also to coach and help a person to develop physically, emotionally, socially, and cognitively. </p>

<p>To better understand the coach–athlete–parent relationship and the athlete decisions in sport, the authors drew upon attachment theory. The theory states that early experiences with primary caregivers (typically parents) influence a child’s future development of close relationships. A central tenet of attachment theory is the notion that early childhood lays the foundations for the development of personality throughout life. A close and secure relationship with parents transforms in other contexts such as, in this case, in the sport. The parent–child experienced relationship model transforms and is a basis of development of other close relationships. In a long-term athlete development in sport, the athlete becomes attached to coach and forms a new type of relationship. Attachment theory helps in understanding coach–athlete–parent interpersonal relationships in the sport environment and is developed in one direction and having one common goal to increase the the benefits of youth sport. Active participation of all three members of the athletic triad—coaches, athletes, and parent—is important and necessary for the positive development of this system. Such a three-dimensional educational system may be more effective if parents are more actively and positively involved in the sport of their children, athletes are not pressed but motivated by the psychologically positive environment, and coaches are given continuous learning possibilities. The harmonization of the athletic triad remains the main challenge of further research on this issue. Therefore, the overarching theme is to increase understanding of coach–athlete–parent interaction in youth sport and interrelationships between them and to gain an understanding of how these relationships will affect the young athlete. More specifically, to evaluate and analyze the psychological and educational benefits coach–athlete–parent interpersonal relationships and to consider what strategies may have been used to strengthen, support, and empower these relationships to maximize the motivation of young athlete and to minimize the drop out of the sporting phenomenon. </p>
