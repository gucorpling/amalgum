<head>If you're going to be a Junior this fall, start studying for the PSAT now.</head>
<sp who="#ScholarGrade">
<p>The PSAT is a standardized test like the SAT that measures scholastic aptitude. Many people say the PSAT is just a "practice" SAT, and that is mostly true. However, it is used to determine National Merit Finalist status which can win you a huge scholarship to dozens of colleges. To win the major awards, you will have to score in the top ~1% of students. This is a tall order, but given the demographics of this sub, many of you have a good shot. Studying can help you immensely here because almost no one studies for the PSAT. This is probably the easiest chance you have at a full ride scholarship. Seriously, you could study for a 5 hours a week all summer and win a scholarship worth over $150K. $2,500 per hour is not a bad wage to pay yourself. How do you cash in? Study like crazy, get a qualifying score on the PSAT during your junior year, then follow the steps once you are notified if you made the cutoff. You can find more information at www.NationalMerit.org. Note that while National Merit status is not particularly impressive to T20 schools, it will be a quality, national award at many colleges and could be very helpful for gaining admission or winning other merit awards. Below is a list of large merit awards for National Merit Finalists and Semifinalists. If any of these interest you, be sure to check the schools website to verify the awards, criteria, deadlines, and process. Some of these may be outdated or may change, so look them up if you're interested. If any of these links are broken, just go to the school's financial aid page and look up their merit scholarship offerings and you should be able to find the most up-to-date info. One additional note worth mentioning - you will see that most of the awards are for National Merit Finalists. These awards are broken up into tiers: - NMCS: National Merit Commended Student. This is the top ~4% of students or about 50k. - NMSF: National Merit Semi-Finalist. This is the top ~1% of students or about 16k. - NMF: National Merit Finalist. This is the Semi Finalists who are able to complete the application materials on time, take the SAT (and not bomb it), and jump through the hoops. Every year there are around 1,000 students who just let this fall through the cracks or bomb the SAT. Don't let this be you. If you are a NMSF,  <hi rend="bold">do the paperwork and take the SAT seriously</hi>  so you can get the NMF status. That's the easiest way to get a massive scholarship. Other notes in the list: exp- stipend for experiential learning (internship, study abroad, etc., allowable uses vary by college) Full Tuition- covers the cost of tuition for 4 years Full Ride- covers Tuition, Room, and Board for 4 years (may include other benefits as well) Section 1 – Full Tuition or better, no residency required, automatically qualification This is a compilation of large scholarship awards for National Merit Semifinalists and Finalists. The awards included in this section meet the following criteria: 1. At least Full Tuition/Full Ride in magnitude (or equivalent) 2. Automatically awarded (not a competitive process or a limited number of awards). Note that this means you don't have to meet any other requirements to win, but you still may have to fill out some paperwork or apply by a certain deadline. 3. Available to out-of-state students 4. College must be accredited, public or non-profit private, 4-year degree-granting institution ==== ALABAMA ==== University of Alabama NMSF Award: Full Tuition (NMSF + 3.5 GPA required) NMF Award: Full
