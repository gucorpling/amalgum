<head>Description</head>
<figure><caption>Additional <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_facial_reconstruction">Facial reconstruction</ref> of Racine County Jane Doe</caption></figure>
<p>Racine County Jane Doe may have been a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_disability">mentally disabled</ref> individual. She had a "cauliflower ear" deformity, which likely resulted from abuse.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-authorities-1">[1]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-fox-3">[3]</ref> It is believed that she was most likely 18 to 30 years old, although she may have been up to 35.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-narrative-2">[2]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-11">[11]</ref> Her teeth were not well cared for. Her front <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisor">incisors</ref> protruded from the mouth, and decay was present on many teeth. Some teeth were missing.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-fox-3">[3]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-wisn-5">[5]</ref> Her curly hair was reddish-brown, collar-length, and appeared to have blond <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_highlighting">highlights</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-fox-3">[3]</ref> Her eyes were either brown, green, or hazel. There were two <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earring">earrings</ref> in each of her ears.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-narrative-2">[2]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-doe-4">[4]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-new-7">[7]</ref></p>
<p>She had visible bruises and cuts across her body, and a fractured nose.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-12">[12]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-13">[13]</ref></p>
<p>She wore a man's shirt, gray in color, with a floral design on the front. After contacting the shirt's manufacturer, it was learned that this type of shirt was first sold in 1984.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-wisn-5">[5]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-spotlight-6">[6]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-abc-8">[8]</ref> She was also wearing black <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweatpants">sweatpants</ref>. She was not wearing shoes.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-authorities-1">[1]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-fox-3">[3]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-doe-4">[4]</ref></p>
<head>Investigation</head>
<p>Multiple <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_facial_reconstruction">reconstructions</ref> have been created of the decedent's face.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-doe-4">[4]</ref> In 2012, an additional reconstruction was created by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-14">[14]</ref> Another version of this facial composite exists, which depicts a differing facial rendition of how Racine County Jane Doe may have appeared in life.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-wisn-5">[5]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-new-7">[7]</ref></p>
<p>At one time, she was thought to be Aundria "Alexis" Bowman, who was presumed to have run away from her adoptive parents' house in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton,_Michigan">Hamilton, Michigan</ref> on March 11, 1989, but <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_profiling">DNA profiling</ref> via her mother Cathy demonstrated that they were not the same person. <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_person">Missing persons</ref> such as Aundria, Tina D'Ambrosio, and Karen Wells have been ruled out.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-authorities-1">[1]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-15">[15]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-16">[16]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-17">[17]</ref></p>
<p>Some believed that this case could be linked to the murder of Mary Kate Chamizo (n√©e: Sunderlin), a previously unidentified victim who was discovered in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_County,_Illinois">Lake County, Illinois</ref>. Sunderlin was also found malnourished, had poor dentition and had been beaten to death. Three were arrested in that case; one was convicted.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-18">[18]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-19">[19]</ref> All three were later cleared due to new evidence.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-20">[20]</ref></p>
<figure><caption>Alternate facial reconstructions of the victim, made prior to the creation of her 2012 facial composite</caption></figure>
<p>The remains were <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhumation">exhumed</ref> on October 16, 2013, for further study and transported to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee,_Wisconsin">Milwaukee, Wisconsin</ref>, where the body had previously been examined in 1999.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-fox-3">[3]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-abc-8">[8]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-21">[21]</ref> Authorities hoped that by studying the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone">bones</ref>, they would be able to tell where the woman had lived prior to her death.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-spotlight-6">[6]</ref></p>
<p>It was announced on July 19, 2015, that the examination of the remains had been completed and that they would be reburied on July 21 on the 16th anniversary of their discovery.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-22">[22]</ref> Authorities stated they had indeed uncovered new leads from the exhumation, but they declined to state any details.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-23">[23]</ref></p>
<p>On October 20, 2016 it was announced that chemical isotope testing performed by the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smithsonian">Smithsonian</ref> on a sample of her hair and bone suggest she may originally have been from or spent several years of her life in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska">Alaska</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana">Montana</ref> or portions of southern <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada">Canada</ref>. Authorities did not comment on what testing the results are from, whether recent with hair or history from bone.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-24">[24]</ref></p>
<p>Although the murder remains unsolved, investigators hope that the case will eventually come to a close. A press conference in 2013 is said to have uncovered more clues.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-fox-3">[3]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-wisn-5">[5]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-named-25">[25]</ref></p>
