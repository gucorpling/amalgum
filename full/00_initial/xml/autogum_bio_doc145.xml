<head>Controversies</head>
<p>Zirin has repeatedly called for sports boycotts of certain teams, states, or nations for political reasons.</p>
<head>Call for boycott of Arizona</head>
<p>On April 27, 2010, writing for <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian">The Guardian</ref></hi>, Zirin called for a boycott against sports teams from Arizona, in particular the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks">Diamondbacks</ref>, to protest the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_SB_1070">Arizona SB 1070</ref>, the Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-11">[11]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-12">[12]</ref> He expressed support during the 2010 NBA Playoffs for the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns">Phoenix Suns</ref>, who went by "Los Suns" as a statement against the Arizona immigration law.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-13">[13]</ref></p>
<head>Support of boycotts of Israel</head>
<p>On June 2, 2010, writing for <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nation">The Nation</ref></hi>, Zirin justified the decision of the Turkish U-19 soccer team to boycott a match against Israel. He described the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_flotilla_raid">Gaza flotilla raid</ref> as an act of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_terror">state terror</ref> committed by the Israeli government and proposed a boycott of Israel.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-14">[14]</ref></p>
<head>Criticism of Hank Williams, Jr.</head>
<p>On October 6, 2011, during a live interview conducted on the sports cable television network, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN">ESPN</ref>, Zirin referred to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hank_Williams,_Jr.">Hank Williams, Jr.</ref> as <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism">racist</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proslavery">proslavery</ref> after Williams, the writer and singer of ESPN's then-<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monday_Night_Football">Monday Night Football</ref> theme song, made a political statement in which he compared <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiracial">multiracial</ref> US President <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama">Barack Obama</ref> to former German <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism">national socialist</ref> leader, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler">Adolf Hitler</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-15">[15]</ref></p>
<head>Defense of Barry Bonds</head>
<p>Zirin maintains the opinion that the aggressive hatred toward <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Bonds">Barry Bonds</ref> is in large degree due to racism. In 2004 Zirin wrote “The greatest case for reasonable doubt lies in Bonds' very late career success. His unparalleled middle-aged majesty screams his innocence.”<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-16">[16]</ref> However, in an undated interview, Zirin claims “I never wrote that I "believe Bonds has never done steroids."” He continues: “unlike oh so many others, the man never actually failed a steroids test. Is there a ton of circumstantial evidence that the man juiced? Absolutely. But he is still the best player I've ever seen. The best player of what will go down as the anabolic era.”<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-17">[17]</ref> Zirin claims that, rather than steroid use, “much of the reaction to Bonds is simply bad old-fashioned racism”.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-18">[18]</ref></p>
