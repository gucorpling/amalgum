<p>After the match, England's coach <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth%20Southgate">Gareth Southgate</ref> said, "At the moment we all feel the pain of defeat. I don't think realistically we expected to be here, but once you're here and played as well as we did, you want to take those opportunities in life. The dressing room is a difficult place at the moment." He also added, saying, "You have to suffer the result first sometimes. I'm hugely proud of what we've done — I couldn't have asked for any more. They've broken through a number of barriers in the past weeks."</p>
<p>Croatian coach <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zlatko%20Dalić">Zlatko Dalić</ref> said, "Nobody wanted to give in when I was preparing the first eleven, nobody wanted to say I was not ready in extra time, no one wanted to be subbed and this shows character and what makes me proud. Nobody gave up."</p>
