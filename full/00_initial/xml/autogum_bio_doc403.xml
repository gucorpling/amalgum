<p><hi rend="bold">Mere Hüseyin Pasha</hi> (died July 1624) was an <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire">Ottoman</ref> statesman of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanians">Albanian</ref> origin.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-uzuncarsili-1-1">[1]</ref> He was two times <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Vizier_of_the_Ottoman_Empire">Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire</ref> in 1622 and 1623,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-turkbook-2">[2]</ref> and previously the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Ottoman_governors_of_Egypt">Ottoman governor of</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt_Eyalet">Egypt</ref> between 1620 and 1622.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-uzuncarsili-1-1">[1]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-sicilli-3">[3]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Öztuna1994-4">[4]</ref> His epithet "Mere!" comes from the word for "Take it!" in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_language">Albanian</ref>; he was nicknamed so because of the many times he ordered his men to "take [the heads]" of his opponents, i.e. execute them. He was purportedly the only grand vizier who did not speak <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_language">Turkish</ref>.</p>
<head>Life</head>
<p>Hüseyin Pasha was born to the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begolli_family">Begolli</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanians">Albanian</ref> family from the region of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/İpek">İpek</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-5">[5]</ref> in the mid to late 16th century.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-uzuncarsili-1-1">[1]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-sicilli-3">[3]</ref> It is purported that he never learned to speak <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_language">Turkish</ref>, a very rare occurrence in the Turkish-controlled <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire">Ottoman Empire</ref>.</p>
<p>He began his government career as the <hi rend="italic">aşcıbaşı</hi> (chief cook) of Satırcı Mehmed Pasha, soon becoming a member of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sipahi">sipahi</ref> corps.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-sicilli-3">[3]</ref> He then took on a series of increasingly high level government posts, until July 1620, when he was appointed the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Ottoman_governors_of_Egypt">governor of</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt_Eyalet">Egypt Eyalet</ref> and made a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vizier">vizier</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-sicilli-3">[3]</ref></p>
<p>As the governor of Egypt, Hüseyin Pasha's manners were described as "rough and unpolished."<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-France1796-2-6">[6]</ref> He was ill for the first few months of his term, but when he recovered, he threw a feast for his children and received many gifts, although he sent most of the gifts given to him by the wealthy back.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-France1796-2-6">[6]</ref> While he was governor, the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flooding_of_the_Nile">flooding of the Nile</ref> caused widespread drought in Egypt, leading to his dismissal from the office in March or April 1622.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-sicilli-3">[3]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-France1796-3-7">[7]</ref> His <hi rend="italic">defterdar</hi> (finance minister) Hasan, having become the acting governor (<hi rend="italic">kaymakam</hi>) after Hüseyin Pasha's removal, accused him of having embezzled money from the treasury and crops from the granary and prevented him from leaving Cairo.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-France1796-3-7">[7]</ref> Hüseyin Pasha paid 25,000 gold pieces (<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinar">dinars</ref>; half of the claimed amount) and claimed that a local , who had disparaged him after his removal from office, should pay the rest, claiming that the Money Lender was indebted to Hüseyin Pasha in the same amount, with this obtaining permission to leave.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-France1796-3-7">[7]</ref> However, when the authorities went to the Money Lender to demand payment of the money that Hüseyin Pasha had said he owed him, the Lender claimed that he had already paid Hüseyin Pasha.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-France1796-3-7">[7]</ref> When this response was made known to Hüseyin Pasha, he claimed that he was not at fault and the Lender was lying, but agreed to pay the remaining 25,000 gold pieces in exchange for the Lender being brought to him.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-France1796-3-7">[7]</ref> The acting governor accepted this proposal and delivered the Lender to Hüseyin Pasha, who tortured and killed him and took the 25,000 gold pieces by force.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-France1796-3-7">[7]</ref> After these events, Hüseyin Pasha traveled to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temeşvar_Eyalet">Romania</ref> Rumelia, not to be confused with modern day Romania.</p>
<p>A few months later, on June 13, 1622, Hüseyin Pasha was appointed <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Vizier_of_the_Ottoman_Empire">grand vizier</ref> for the first time, serving for less than a month until July 8, 1622 under sultan <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustafa_I">Mustafa I</ref>. The next year, the sultan appointed him grand vizier once more, from February 5, 1623 to August 30, 1623.</p>
