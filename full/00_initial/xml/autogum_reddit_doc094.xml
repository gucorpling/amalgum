<head>I Know A Girl With Looks That Could Kill</head>

<p>"Isn't this a little cliche?" I asked, sweeping over the decaying, crumbling house in the middle of the swamp with my flashlight. "Daring the new kid to break into a haunted house?" I stood like an an old age explorer at the brow of my ship- in this case, a rickety rowboat manned by two fellow high schoolers. At any moment, we were liable to tip over into a water-snake and potentially flesh-eating bacteria (if my mom's warnings were to be believed) infested swamp. "Okay, first of all," said Caitlyn, taking this as a personal slight, "you're not new anymore. It's been two months. And this was totally your idea, dumbass." "You're rocking the boat," Perry added, unhelpfully. "God," I puffed out a misty breath into the cool night air. "You guys are so fuckin' dull. Why won't you come in with me?" "Hm," Caitlyn retorted shrilly, "let's see, creepy house, teenage girl, dark and stormy night-," "It's barely raining," I countered, but she was on a roll- "I'm not gonna be the next Amber Alert," she hissed. "Got it? You can go on in there and get possessed by whatever demonic-," "Demonic what, Caitlyn? A demonic snapping turtle?" I clicked my jaw together threateningly. "Dude," Perry sighed. "You're such an asshole," she waved a hand at my mocking clicking noises. "Have fun dying or whatever." "Honestly," I said, "if I was a chick you wouldn't let me do this. This is classic reverse sexism-," "You're gonna tip the boat," Perry groused, so I vaulted off and onto the muddy scrap of land that somehow, at some point, had held up the little shack. My boots sunk into the mud, but not enough to hinder my strides up to the entrance. The door was missing, which would probably come in handy if I had to run out again in five minutes, pursued by the ghosts of dead frogs. Fueled by adolescent curiosity, and two cans of Miller Lite, I stumbled into the decrepit house, waving my flashlight around, and then gasped involuntary when a face came swimming out of the darkness. I nearly jumped out of my skin, but quickly calmed enough to not piss myself when I realized it was just a statue. A very detailed statue, but a statue nonetheless. The face of a startled man met mine, frozen in marble. I thought it might have been one of those knock-off Greek statues, but the man's appearance was very modern; the statue worn a ragged tee shirt and jeans, and there was even a lighter in one of his hands. I crouched down to inspect it, delighted with my find. This was very weird- and very cool. Who kept such a detailed statue in a dump like this? Had it been stolen by someone, and hidden here? Was I about to uncover some Goonies-level treasure? Caitlyn would probably ditch Perry for me if I became the town kingpin with some sweet, sweet abandoned shack cash. Snickering to myself, I crept around the statue, which was easily as tall as me, and further into the room. There were even more figures; another man, this one sitting on the floor, glancing up at me in horror through distinctly 80s-style glasses, a baseball cap on his head. I traced the logo with my figure, my amusement fading into confusion. Then a teenaged couple in the corner, a boy and girl dressed in what looked like 50s outfits, cigarettes in hand. the boy was gaping at me, the girl peering out at me in terror from her position hiding behind him, her stone fingers digging into his marble leather jacket. I could get one weird statue, but why did they all look so scared or shocked? What was the point? Was it supposed to be some kind of theme? Had I stumbled upon a weird indie art project, conveniently hosted the middle of a swamp? "Do you like them?" a breathy voice sounded from the corner behind me, and I yelped, whirling around, flashlight beam bouncing off the rotting walls and sunken ceiling, glancing over a gaping hole in the floor, which water glistened darkly through. Suddenly the shack seemed much more precarious, as if the floorboards underneath my feet might give out at any moment. Even though that had probably been the case all along. Finally I made out a faint figure; a teenaged girl, probably around my own age, in a baggy blouse and long skirt that wisped around her legs. Her diminutive size was the only thing keeping me from bolting out; she couldn't have weighed more than 100 pounds soaking wet. "Who the fuck are you?" I asked, bringing my flashlight up to shine in her face. To my alarm, her eyes were closed, although she was turned in my direction and smiling. Was she blind? "Do you like them?" she repeated in a faint, but adamant voice that seemed to ease out of her like a breeze. She nodded in the direction of the statues. "You made these?" I asked in disbelief. She had to be a druggie. "Yes," her unseeing smile widened, raising the hairs on the back of my neck. "They're all mine." "With what?" I demanded. This didn't seem like the ideal studio. She tilted her head slightly like an animal questioning a directive. I took a slight step backwards, the floor creaking underneath me. "I've been waiting a long time," she breathed instead, "here in the dark. It's so wet and cold. It's so lonely." Her hair was tied back with a bandanna, which she fingered gently. I kept hearing a faint nose, almost like air coming out of a pipe- a sort of hissing. "Well," I said, deciding that this was not the sort of movie I wanted to be in, "I have to go-," "Stay!" she pleaded, and her hands, pale and bony, nails cracked like those of an old woman, flew up to her faded bandanna. "Everyone leaves- they all leave... wherever I go, they all leave-," She took a sudden, quick step forward, and I dropped my flashlight. That saved my life, as it bounced to the floor, the darkness obscuring my vision, and she pulled down the bandanna, letting her hair fall into her face- only it wasn't hair at all, but hundreds of tiny snakes like braids, coiling and hissing, a thrashing mass of scales. I screamed and turned to run as she opened her eyes, which I only met for a brief second- they were bright gold, shining like lamps in the dark, and pain spread coldly in my feet. I stumbled and tripped onto the wet floor, dragging myself up by latching onto the nearest statue's arm, as the hissing grew closer behind me. "Won't you stay with me?" she demanded. "It's not fair! I want you to-," her fingers grazed the back of my jacket as I practically threw myself out of the house, falling into the mud with a muffled yell, and wading into the swamp and towards the boat, which was already halfway back to dry land, Perry's terror-fueled rowing aiding their flight. "Jesus-," I tripped and caught a mouthful of fetid water. Gagging, I resurfaced, thankful the deepest part of the swamp only came up to my chest. I could still hear the hissing, but she hadn't followed me into the water. "Wait!" I yelled after them, and Perry paused long enough, panting, for me to latch into the boat and heave myself up while Caitlyn aimed several smacks at my sodden frame. "You! Fucking! Retard!" she screech-sobbed, looking around wildly. "What the fuck was that? What were those noises?!" "Don't look back, just row!" I yelled, and Perry obliged, while I rested my face in my hands, and then glanced down at my feet. We hit dry land and Caitlyn scrambled out, running for the car, phone in hand, while Perry stayed, heaving with exhaustion, before looking at me. "What the hell happened in there?" I was too busy yanking off my boots and wet socks to examine my toes, which I could no longer feel, to answer. They were hard and white, and when I tapped them, feeling sick rush up in my throat, solid stone answered back.</p>
