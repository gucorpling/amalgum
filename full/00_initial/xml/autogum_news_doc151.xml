<p>"He is fully conscious, he can follow instructions and answer our questions in a weak voice," Dr. Jusuf Misbach said. "He scratched himself and raised his hands. It's an amazing accomplishment."</p>
<p>Mardjo Soebiandono said that Suharto would be given <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/physiotherapy">physiotherapy</ref>, but he also stated that his condition is still considered critical.</p>
<p>According to doctors, Suharto's blood pressure is now stable, his heart and lungs are functioning better, and infections are being treated with <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antibiotics">antibiotics</ref>.</p>

<head id="Zimbabwe,_Zambia_suffer_widespread_power_outages">Zimbabwe, Zambia suffer widespread power outages</head>
<p>Major <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/power%20outage">power outages</ref> in <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Zambia">Zambia</ref> left many without services such as electricity, water, and mobile phone connections for much of Saturday and Sunday.</p>
<p>The blackout reportedly hit the two nations almost simultaneously on Saturday evening. In Zambia, the power was restored eight hours later, but residents of Zimbabwe had to wait until Sunday afternoon for power.</p>
<p>Officials in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harare">Harare</ref> said the cause of the blackout was a fault that "tripped" the power grid, while some in Zambia blamed "turbine problems" at one of the country's <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hydroelectricity">hydroelectric</ref> dams.</p>
<p>40% of Zimbabwe's power is imported from neighboring countries like <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/South_Africa">South Africa</ref>. As the power situation in South Africa has also been worsening, state utility company <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eskom">Eskom</ref> announced it will stop supplying power to Zimbabwe and other countries in order to meet domestic needs.</p>

<p><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis%20Joyon">Francis Joyon</ref> of <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/France">France</ref> completed his maritime journey around the globe in a 57 days, 13 hours, 34 minutes, and 6 seconds, breaking <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen%20MacArthur">Ellen MacArthur</ref>'s record by 2 weeks. He sailed the world's oceans in a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trimaran">trimaran</ref> of his own making. </p>
<p>The journey began November 23 in the port of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brest,%20France">Brest</ref>. Joyon then sailed under the tip of <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Africa">Africa</ref> and across the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern%20Hemisphere">Southern Hemisphere</ref> before making his way back to France.</p>
<p>MacArthur was there to greet him when he landed on shore. "I'm really happy for him, proud of him," she said. "He was very fast, he played really well, and he really deserves this record." MacArthur had previously beaten Joyon's record in 2005.</p>
<p>"The speed part, the sailing passion part, that's extraordinary. But what is the strongest of all is having precious moments when you can be in harmony with the planet, with the elements. That is what will stay with me," Joyon said.</p>
