<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN (Joseph Ford)</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">Five years after it began, the Iraq War is still raging with no end in sight. As president, how would you handle it?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Lt. Colonel Riekse:</hi> We would be out in 3-4 months of my taking office. With 32 years in the military, I know how to do it in an orderly and professional way. Within ten days of my being confirmed of being the next president, I will let those planners in the Pentagon know what I expect and to plan for it. Bush will keep the war going until the day he is out of the office. When I take office, I expect to have a plan on my desk to pull out of both Iraq and Afghanistan within 24 hours. No plan on my desk within 24 hours, I will start firing a lot of generals. I am not only a graduate of the US Army Command &amp; General Staff College, but taught it for nearly six years.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN (Joseph Ford)</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">The American economy is worsening. How would you help the struggling working class man, woman or family?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Lt. Colonel Riekse:</hi> Put an end to free and very unfair trade, especially NAFTA;  Republicans and Democrats working together gave us free, unfair trade and NAFTA.  It will take Mad Max and the Constitution Party to end it.  Simple.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN (Joseph Ford)</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">For many Americans, health care is a major issue. How would you handle this?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Lt. Colonel Riekse:</hi> Socialized medicine is the wrong way; look at England and Canada. It does not work very well. I will have my people study the French system. It works for both their doctors and insurance companies.  We can do it in this country.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN (Joseph Ford)</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">How would you handle America's education system?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Lt. Colonel Riekse:</hi> Eliminate the Federal Education Department. The states know best how to educate their children.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN (Joseph Ford)</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">Illegal immigration is a major problem in America. How would you handle it?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Lt. Colonel Riekse:</hi> I will send all 20 to 30 million home. End birth right babies; no social security for them, etc. They are here illegally; now what part of that does anyone not understand? There are filling up our jails, prisons, stressing out our schools and hospitals. I will see to that they are ALL removed ASAP. To be sure many of them are good people, but they are illegal. Go home. They are also stressing out our environment.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN (Joseph Ford)</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">Abortion is a controversial subject amongst Americans. How would you handle it?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Lt. Colonel Riekse:</hi> This is a state issue; period. Millions of abortions have taken place since the federal government has gotten involved. I trust the states to do the right thing. Michigan is a leader in saving the unborn; and would do more if not for the federal government.</p>
