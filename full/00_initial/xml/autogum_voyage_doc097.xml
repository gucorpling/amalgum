<head>Santa Clara (California)</head>

<p><hi rend="bold">Santa Clara</hi> is a town in the <ref target="South%20Bay%20%28Bay%20Area%29">South Bay</ref>, part of the <ref target="Bay%20Area%20%28California%29">San Francisco Bay Area</ref>, in <ref target="California">California</ref>.</p>

<head>Understand</head>
<p>Santa Clara is a small city of big contrasts. If any city can claim to be "the center of <ref target="Silicon%20Valley">Silicon Valley</ref>," it is this town of just over 100,000. Intel, AMD, WebEx, NVIDIA, and National Semiconductor all have headquarters here. At the same time, Santa Clara is one of the oldest settlements (by Europeans) in Northern California. The Mission Santa Clara de Asís was established in 1777, and the Jesuit-run Santa Clara University, founded in 1851, is the oldest university in California. Dozens of 19th-century homes are well-maintained by their 21st-century owners in the "old quad," the earliest residential area, adjacent to the university.</p>

<p>Yet another contrast is the diversity of the local population, driven by the tech boom of the 1970s-1990s. Visitors from <ref target="Asia">Asia</ref> and <ref target="Europe">Europe</ref> frequently overhear strangers speaking their native languages. Specialty markets offer native ingredients from around the world, and the Indian and East Asian restaurants are some of the best in the Bay Area. But many of the best places in Santa Clara are not visible at first glance. You could drive right through this town and see nothing of any interest, or you could take the time to learn where to look, explore, and enjoy.</p>

<item> Just west of <ref target="San%20Jose%20%28California%29">San Jose</ref>, Santa Clara is adjacent to San Jose Mineta Airport ( SJC ). To reach the airport take the free shuttle from the Santa Clara Caltrain station, <ref target="http://www.vta.org/routes/rt10">route 10</ref>.</item>
<item> To the <ref target="San%20Francisco%20International%20Airport">San Francisco International Airport</ref>, take Caltrain north (toward San Francisco) to <ref target="Millbrae">Millbrae</ref>. From there, transfer to BART and take BART to <ref target="San%20Bruno">San Bruno</ref> and then to SFO. Allow about an hour and a half.</item>
<item> The Oakland International airport is accessible by via the Coliseum/Oakland Airport BART station and the <ref target="http://www.bart.gov/guide/airport/inbound_oak">AirBART shuttle</ref>. From Amtrak, transfer to BART at Jack London Square.</item>

<head>By train</head>
<p><hi rend="bold"><ref target="http://www.caltrain.com/">Caltrain</ref></hi> stops at Santa Clara Station, on the east side of Santa Clara University (1001 Railroad Avenue). Though Caltrain doesn't really stop at San Jose Mineta Airport, the free <hi rend="bold">Airporter</hi> bus (VTA line 10) shuttles passengers between the airport and the Santa Clara Caltrain station.</p>

<p>The <hi rend="bold"><ref target="http://www.acerail.com/">Altamont Commuter Express</ref></hi> (ACE) is an <ref target="Amtrak">Amtrak</ref> express train running from the central valley towns of <ref target="Stockton%20%28California%29">Stockton</ref>, <ref target="Tracy">Tracy</ref>, <ref target="Livermore">Livermore</ref> and <ref target="Pleasanton">Pleasanton</ref> to <ref target="San%20Jose%20%28California%29">San Jose</ref>. The train shares the Santa Clara station with Caltrain and also stops at the Great America station at Lafayette and Tasman, near the Santa Clara Convention Center, Levi's Stadium, and California's Great America. Only a few trains run per day. The Great America stop doesn't include a station building, just a platform under an overpass, so plan connecting transportation before you arrive.</p>

<list type="unordered">
<item> When you get off the southbound ACE train at Great America in the morning, there are free shuttle buses waiting to take you to destinations throughout Silicon Valley (as far away as the offices of Google in the west, Cisco in the east, and Nvidia in the south). Similar shuttles run in the reverse direction in the afternoon/evening.</item>

<ref target="Amtrak">Amtrak</ref> California's <hi rend="bold"><ref target="http://www.capitolcorridor.org/">Capitol Corridor</ref></hi> train runs between <ref target="Sacramento">Sacramento</ref> and San Jose via East Bay cities such as <ref target="Berkeley%20%28California%29">Berkeley</ref> and <ref target="Emeryville">Emeryville</ref>. The Capitol Corridor shares the same stations as the ACE above, stopping at the University and Great America. The nearby Diridon Station in San Jose includes a building with a ticket counter and may even be closer to parts of Santa Clara. Read schedules carefully, since some trains include a bus connection.

<head>Get around</head>
<p><hi rend="bold">Light rail and bus</hi>. The <ref target="http://www.vta.org/">Valley Transportation Authority</ref> (VTA) offers light rail in Santa Clara on the Alum Rock-Santa Teresa and Mountain View-Winchester lines. VTA also offers bus service within and around Santa Clara. Consult the VTA website for schedules, fares, and trip planning.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">Rental car</hi>. Numerous national car rental chains serve Santa Clara and surrounding cities. Most people living in the area prefer automobiles as their primary means of transportation, and it is likely to be the fastest, although area freeways do get congested during commute hours. Rental cars are available both at the San Jose Airport and at various locations in the city. Throughout most of Santa Clara, public parking is ample and free.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">Bicycle</hi>. Many city streets are wide and bicycle-friendly with painted bicycle lanes; expressways permit bicycles but have high-speed, heavy traffic that may be uncomfortable, especially for inexperienced riders. Stop by City Hall for a copy of the Santa Clara bicycle map showing recommended bicycle routes. Bicycles should ride on the right side of the road, going the same direction as traffic. Take care when crossing expressway exits and right turn lanes in traffic. Caltrain, Amtrak Capital Corridor, and VTA (both light rail and buses) are all equipped with bicycle racks. If you plan to take a bicycle on area public transit, consult the website of the system(s) you will use for information on locating and using the bicycle racks.</p>

<item> <hi rend="bold">Agnews Developmental Center</hi>, 4030-4070 Lafayette St (just off the Montague Expressway). The Agnews Historic Park preserves three buildings from the old <hi rend="bold">California Hospital for the Chronic Insane</hi>. Founded in 1889, the facility's original buildings collapsed in the "San Francisco Earthquake" of 1906, killing 117 people. The new buildings, including the still-standing auditorium, clock tower and superintendent's residence, are good examples of early twentieth century Mediterranean Revival architecture, heavily influenced by the Arts and Crafts style. The new buildings represented a more modern attitude toward the mentally ill. The smaller buildings with larger windows were designed to comfort and stimulate the mentally ill, rather than imprison them. The state of California moved the last few hundred residents out in the mid 1990s, and sold the campus to Sun Microsystems, who promised to preserve the grounds and buildings, and make the auditorium and executive mansion available for public events. Unfortunately, you cannot get inside to see the very impressive interiors of the buildings, unless you've got a Sun employee badge or are lucky enough to slip in during a meeting or public event. Neither tours nor docents seem to be available. You can visit a small shelter that has public restrooms, as well as historic photographs and information about the hospital. </item>
