<head>Origin</head>
<p>Grdan was part of the Nikšić tribe.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Zapisi-1">[1]</ref> The tribe had originated from Nikša, who was the son of <hi rend="italic">ban</hi> Ilijon of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grbalj">Grbalj</ref> and maternally a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nemanjić_dynasty">Nemanjić</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Zapisi-1">[1]</ref> Nikša had moved to what is now <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Župa_Nikšićka">Župa Nikšićka</ref> directly after the death of Serbian Emperor <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Dušan">Stefan Dušan</ref> (1355), his relative.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Zapisi-1">[1]</ref> From Nikša sprung a powerful tribe, which gave its name to the old <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Župa">župa</ref></hi> (county) of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onogošt">Onogošt</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Zapisi-1">[1]</ref> Nikšić was conquered by the Ottomans and was organized into the Ottoman <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjak_of_Herzegovina">Sanjak of Herzegovina</ref> in the late 15th century.

<p>The Orthodox Christians in the Balkans sought the right moment to revolt against the Ottomans.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-HanlonHanlon2008-4">[4]</ref> Serbian, Greek, Bulgarian and Albanian monks visited European courts for help.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-HanlonHanlon2008-4">[4]</ref>  The crushed <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banat_Uprising">Banat Uprising</ref> (1594) had been aided by Serbian Orthodox metropolitans <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rufim_Njeguš">Rufim Njeguš</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitanate_of_Cetinje">of Cetinje</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visarion,_Metropolitan_of_Herzegovina">Visarion</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitanate_of_Herzegovina">of Trebinje</ref> (s. 1590–1602).<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-ES-1971-5">[5]</ref> In 1596 revolts would spread into <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montenegro_Vilayet">Ottoman Montenegro</ref> and the neighbouring tribes in Herzegovina, especially under influence of Metropolitan Visarion.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-ES-1971-5">[5]</ref> Visarion and the chieftains in Herzegovina asked the Pope for help.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Veselinović1966-6">[6]</ref> A <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ragusa">Ragusan</ref> document from the beginning of 1596 claims that many Herzegovinian chieftains with the metropolitan gathered in the Trebinje Monastery where they swore oath "to give up and donate 20,000 heroes to the emperors' light."<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Hercegovine1959-7">[7]</ref> Grdan and the rebels were defeated on the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gacko">Gacko</ref> Field sometime in 1597. The rebels then made peace with the Ottomans; Grdan accepted the Ottoman proposal of peace, in talks with Ahmed Pasha Khadum (Ahmet-paša Kadum), who forgave him.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-8">[8]</ref> The Beylerbey of Bosnia did nothing to him, not even stripping him of his voivodeship in Nikšić nahija.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Kočić1936-9">[9]</ref> However, he and Patriarch Jovan would continue to plan revolts against the Ottomans in the coming years.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Zapisi-1">[1]</ref></p>
<head>1607–12</head>
<p>In 1607, Patriarch Jovan Kantul negotiated with Emanuel I to be sent a force for the liberation of the Balkans, in exchange for "the Crown of Macedonia".<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-HanlonHanlon2008-4">[4]</ref> Jovan assured him that an army of 20,000, 25 guns and weapons for 25,000 more to be distributed in the Balkans would overwhelm the Ottoman sultan.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-HanlonHanlon2008-4">[4]</ref> After years of planning, nothing concrete resulted in it, because such an operation "required Spanish naval and logistical support".<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-HanlonHanlon2008-4">[4]</ref></p>
<p>Grdan and Patriarch Jovan continued contact with the successor of Pope Clement, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Paul_V">Pope Paul V</ref> (s. 1605—1621), with the intention to establish a Christian league against the Ottoman Empire. The rebels asked Austria and the Imperial Spanish <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Naples">Kingdom of Naples</ref> for aid, in vain. In March 1608, after the assembly at the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosijerevo_monastery">Kosijerevo monastery</ref>, Grdan, the chieftains of Herzegovina and Patriarch Jovan II sent a letter to Spanish king Emanuel I, supporting his liberation plans. In April 1608, at the assembly held at the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morača_(monastery)">Morača monastery</ref>, the rebels sent a letter to Pope Paul V, encouraging him to influence the Spanish decision to aid them. In the next assembly at Morača, held December 13, 1608, the chieftains (of South Herzegovina, Brda, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Montenegro">Old Montenegro</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zadrima">Zadrima</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metohija">Metohija</ref>) proclaimed the Duke of Savoy for their only king and lord. However, the Spanish court, having other plans in the West and being threatened by the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ragusa">Republic of Ragusa</ref> and the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Navy">Ottoman Navy</ref>, did not want to start a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusade">crusade</ref> war in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkans">Balkans</ref>. </p>
<p>In 1610 and again in 1612, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincenzo_Gonzaga,_Duke_of_Mantua">Vincenzo Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua</ref> sent envoys to Dalmatian coast near Ragusa (Dubrovnik), to meet with Serb and Montenegrin chieftains.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-HanlonHanlon2008-4">[4]</ref> Grdan died in 1612, and he was succeeded as <hi rend="italic">vojvoda</hi> of Nikšić by his son Jovan.  With the death of Grdan (1612), and the subsequent imprisonment of Jovan Kantul at Istanbul, Gonzaga never aided in revolt.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-HanlonHanlon2008-4">[4]</ref></p>
<head>Aftermath</head>
<p>After Grdan, the title went to his sons and relatives throughout the 17th century.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-SANU-280-281-225-3">[3]</ref> Nikša's descendants are the Jovanović brotherhood, a branch of the Nikšić tribe.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Zapisi-1">[1]</ref></p>
