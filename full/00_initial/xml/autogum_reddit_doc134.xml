<head>solo Kryla carry for Scorch of the White Dragon Trial (3/4 missions completed)</head>
<sp who="#m177a">
<p># Kryla carry for Scorn of the White DragonTrial  <hi rend="bold"> A week hasn't even passed and yet my Kryla was able to solo this boss without any issues. The main thing to take into consideration is that you will probably have to run this trial again to get the 5</hi>  trust moogle but with all of the other restrictions out of the way, it should be a lot easier to achieve.  <hi rend="bold"> Why does this work? The Hex mechanic is a consistent DOT damage that feeds off of negative effects on a unit. This boss only has 1.2 million hp and the damage from Hex is not effected by the buffs of the target. # What to bring: </hi>  Bring one unit with the Hide skill. This unit will remain hidden for the entire fight. Kryla cannot generate enough esper orbs for you to do a summon. # Boss Fight  <hi rend="bold"> Turn 1: use Nullifying Chant </hi>  Turn 2 and on: cycle through debuffs and Hex. *  <hi rend="bold">ALERT: DEFEND when the boss' HP drops below 80%, 60%, and 40%. If you don't, you risk dying from his elemental attacks.</hi>  Note: using Kryla's LB is optional but keep in mind that it will add one extra turn into the rotation. Just remember to use Wicked Eye instead of Hex. You have 2 turns to use it before it disappears. # Link to video  <hi rend="bold"> https://youtu.be/_m7XprgSURg # Equipment and Esper </hi>  Kryla 6â˜…  <hi rend="bold"> Right hand: Wing Edges ATK+45 </hi>  Left hand: Zodiac Escutcheon DEF+60, SPR+70  <hi rend="bold"> Head: Cat-ear Hood MAG+25, SPR+25 </hi>  Body: Rainbow Robe DEF+45, MAG+45, SPR+45  <hi rend="bold"> Accessory 1: Ring of the Lucii ATK+30%, MAG+3, MAG+30%, SPR+3 </hi>  Accessory 2: Ring of the Lucii ATK+30%, MAG+3, MAG+30%, SPR+3  <hi rend="bold"> Materia 1: Magic Sanctuary SPR+15% </hi>  Materia 2: Pure White Blessing  <hi rend="bold"> Materia 3: True Spirit of Freedom ATK+20% </hi>  Materia 4: Equip H Shield  <hi rend="bold"> Esper: Titan HP+60, MP+20, ATK+53, DEF+40, MAG+18, SPR+32 </hi>  Total: HP:5275, MP:346, ATK:371, DEF:301, MAG:350, SPR:407 # Other Carries Anyone willing to carry should make a top level comment below.
