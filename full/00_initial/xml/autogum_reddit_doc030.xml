<head>Concept better than the reality?</head>
<sp who="#forgotusername">
<p>I think Raisinbat on the forums summed up the concept of Starmade's ship system pretty well: "Like all the other games, and unlike starmade, you can't design how ships work. This is starmade's massive advantage; it does ship combat far better than any of it's competitors because you have control over how your ships behave in combat. You design your own weapons instead of strapping prefabs onto your ship." This idea of designing a ship was what really got me interested in Starmade to begin with. Over time, I have come to realize that this doesn't actually play as well as I had hoped. I would like to lay out why I don't think this is working as well as we would like and maybe open up the discussion for ideas and counter-arguments. Why I don't think the ship system as it is today works: 1. There exists a sort of sliding scale between strong and cool/unique. If you're a min-maxer, your ship is likely going to be shaped/operate extremely similar to other min-maxers. If you have a cool/unique ship, you're likely going to get your ass handed to you in combat. 2. Poor performance. When considering the overall value to actual gameplay, does the fact that each individual block can be damaged or that each block has a hit-box really have a positive impact? Personally, I care more about stuttering, lag, and server instability. 3. Complexity. If you're a new player, it has to be really, really overwhelming to understand how to make a ship in Starmade. Additionally, tieing back to #1, the more you learn, the more you realize that you're being tied down creatively by game mechanics. Although I doubt this will be hugely popular, I really think we should consider some sort of system simply based around ship size. You could make a cool-looking ship that doesn't PvP like shit. You could standardize the hit-boxes which should massively improve performance. You could massively simplify the ship-building process for new players and leave logic systems to entertain veterans. If you find yourself completely aghast by this suggestion, I would say that if the developers ever manage to create a system that allows for strong ships that are cool/unique, the systems will likely have been so watered down that it would mostly be indistinguishable from this anyway. Also, think of the development resources being poured into trying to make the existing paradigm work... Again, I would be interested in your thoughts/ideas on this.</p>

<p>While you have som points for sure, I think I have a better solution to this. But one thing is clear, the current system is not the best. Doesn't have to be bad though. </p>
<p> Shields are a joke right now, this shield system makes the best fix for it to simply remove shields from the game. With no shields it is more simple to understand, we keep the new power and have the ship overheating when reactor is down, then calculate the damage tolerance on the volume of the ship, not amount of blocks. This would force players to have empty rooms that might as well be decorated = interior. Layers of armour would then be traded of damage tolerance, and thus optional and working but would remove filling of rooms with blocks behaviour. </p>
