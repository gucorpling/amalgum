<p><hi rend="bold">Peter Kenneth Hogan</hi> (born 5 May 1954) is an <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England">English</ref> writer and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comics_creator">comics creator</ref> who started out as editor of cult political <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom">British</ref> comic <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolver_Comic_(UK)">Revolver</ref></hi> in 1990–1991, before working for <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_AD_(comics)">2000 AD</ref></hi> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_comic_book">American comic book</ref> publishers <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertigo_(DC_Comics)">Vertigo</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America's_Best_Comics">America's Best Comics</ref>.</p>
<head>Biography</head>
<p>Hogan first worked as <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commissioning_editor">commissioning editor</ref> for <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eel_Pie_Publishing">Eel Pie Publishing</ref> from the late 1970s to the early 1980s.  He managed the Magic Bus Bookstore in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond,_London">Richmond</ref> until its closure in 1982. His known associates at that time were Dave Marsh and Patrick Humphries, Rock Music journalists.  He also was a contributing writer to a biography about <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monkees">The Monkees</ref> pop group and a movie/DVD correspondent for <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncut_(magazine)">Uncut</ref></hi> magazine. Hogan is the brother-in-law of noted UK comic artist/typographer/design guru <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rian_Hughes">Rian Hughes</ref>.</p>
<p>After <hi rend="italic">Revolver</hi> folded, Hogan became a scriptwriter for the <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_AD_(comics)">2000 AD</ref></hi> comic, working on short story series <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_13">Vector 13</ref></hi> and <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tharg">Tharg</ref>'s Dragon Tales</hi>, as well as reinventing the long-running <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strontium_Dog">Strontium Dog</ref></hi> series as <hi rend="italic">Strontium Dogs</hi> and supervising the <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durham_Red">Durham Red</ref></hi> spin-off series.  Hogan also had a short stint working on <hi rend="italic">Sam Slade, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robo-Hunter">Robo-Hunter</ref></hi>. He also created the gentle fantasy <hi rend="italic">Timehouse</hi>.</p>
<p>Hogan's writing is noted for a whimsical, fantastic quality that stood out from the more usual hard-edged sci-fi to appear under the <hi rend="italic">2000 AD</hi> banner.</p>
<p>However, when <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bishop_(writer)">David Bishop</ref> took on the editorship of <hi rend="italic">2000 AD</hi>, he informed Hogan that he would commission no more of Hogan's scripts because he "didn't believe his writing fitted the comic [he] wanted 2000 AD to be." The two commissioned scripts, <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strontium_Dog">Strontium Dogs</ref></hi> "Hate and War" and <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durham_Red">Durham Red</ref></hi> "Night of the Hunters" were heavily rewritten and Hogan asked for his name to be removed – they were credited to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Smithee">Alan Smithee</ref>. With hindsight Bishop says "He was rightly furious about having his work summarily rewritten and demanded his name taken off the scripts, which I did. I regret the brutal way I treated Peter: I was in a hurry to make changes and he caught the full force of that haste." <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-1">[1]</ref></p>
<p>Hogan went on to write books covering the bands <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.E.M._(band)">REM</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_(band)">Queen</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Doors">The Doors</ref>.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, Hogan wrote for some titles on <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Comics">DC Comics</ref>' <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertigo_(DC_Comics)">Vertigo</ref> imprint, including <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dreaming_(comics)">The Dreaming</ref></hi> and <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sandman_Presents">The Sandman Presents</ref>: Love Street</hi>. Most recently, his unpublished followup to the latter, <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sandman_Presents:_Marquee_Moon">The Sandman Presents: Marquee Moon</ref></hi>, was published online.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-marquee-2">[2]</ref> Like <hi rend="italic">Love Street,</hi> <hi rend="italic">Marquee Moon</hi> is a tie-in to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Gaiman">Neil Gaiman</ref>'s The Sandman and offers a look at the early days of John Constantine of <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swamp_Thing">Swamp Thing</ref></hi> and <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellblazer">Hellblazer</ref></hi> fame.</p>
<p>In addition, Hogan has worked with <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Moore">Alan Moore</ref> on Moore's <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America's_Best_Comics">America's Best Comics</ref> series, including his own spin-off title <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_Obscura">Terra Obscura</ref></hi>. He also wrote three issues of <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Strong">Tom Strong</ref></hi> with artist <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Sprouse">Chris Sprouse</ref> and the two of them returned to the character in 2010 with the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_series_(comics)">limited series</ref> <hi rend="italic">Tom Strong and the Robots of Doom</hi>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-3">[3]</ref></p>
<p>Known, with great affection, by many of "The Ealing Lot" as The Count – for his legendary nocturnal working habits.</p>
