<p>In the second half, Serbia won a free kick in the 55th minute because of a foul by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David%20GuzmÃ¡n">David GuzmÃ¡n</ref>. Serbia's captain <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandar%20Kolarov">Aleksandar Kolarov</ref> scored from the free kick in the top right corner, which proved to be the winning goal of the match. <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nemanja%20MatiÄ‡">Nemanja MatiÄ‡</ref>'s attempt in the 77th minute to double the lead was blocked.

Aleksandar Kolarov won the Budweiser Man of the Match award. After the match, he said, "The free-kick came in a difficult moment in the match and I knew I could step up and change things, and that's exactly what I did."</p>

<p>This was the fifth World Cup tournament for <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael%20MÃ¡rquez">Rafael MÃ¡rquez</ref>; only two other players have played five. In the last six World Cup tournaments, Mexico has never lost their first game, winning five of those. It was the first defeat for Germany since losing to France in the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/UEFA_Euro_2016">UEFA Euro 2016</ref>'s semi-finals.</p>
<p>After the match, Germany's coach <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joachim%20LÃ¶w">Joachim LÃ¶w</ref> said "In the first half, we played very badly. We were not able to impose our usual way of playing, attacking, and there were lots of counter-attacks against us and we were very vulnerable.  In the second half, we were able to press more, but Mexico drew back and then carried the ball forward fast. We had a couple of [shots], but it seemed jinxed and the ball did not go into the goal. Everybody is really unhappy and crestfallen but we have to put this behind us. Our team has experience of losses."</p>

After the match, Brazil's coach <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenor%20Bacchi">Tite</ref> said, "We had too many balls off target, if we had been a bit more focused we could have made the goalkeeper work a bit more.
