<head>Tecate</head>

<p><hi rend="bold"><ref target="http://tecate.gob.mx/">Tecate</ref></hi> is a small city in <ref target="Baja%20California%20%28state%29">Baja California (state)</ref> on the border with California, about an hour east of <ref target="Tijuana">Tijuana</ref>. Unlike most US/Mexico border crossings, there is no town on the US side.</p>

<head>By car</head>
<h4>From <ref target="San%20Diego">San Diego</ref></h4>
<p>Take Highway 94 east.</p>

<h4>From <ref target="Tijuana">Tijuana</ref></h4>
<p>Take the toll road ("cuota") that parallels Mexico Highway 2, 30 miles east. Highway 2 then leads east about 80 miles to <ref target="Mexicali">Mexicali</ref> by way of the notorious "Rumorosa Grade".</p>

<head>From Ensenada</head>
<p>Take Mexico Highway 3 east. The highway is two lanes and is about a 75 minute drive to the border crossing.</p>

<head>From the border</head>
<p>Tecate's border crossing is probably the easiest in California. You can pay a few dollars to park at one of the lots on the US side and walk across the border. It can also be an alternative border crossing to get back into the US; it's less crowded than the San Ysidro and Otay Mesa border crossings (to get back into the US). It will be a long drive from Tijuana, but it will save you some time.</p>
