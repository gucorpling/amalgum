<head>M4F - Orc Slave</head>
<sp who="#BlueTowelWithHoles">
<p>"Cheers for the hero!" "All hail!" The cheers echoed off the stone walls of the keep's great hall. The feeling was one of celebration: of hope and relief. For many moons the lands of the House Fredrick had been plagued by a fierce gang of bandits, bolstered by hellish beasts: travelers would be waylaid along the roads, flocks would be decimated in the night, men were found in the mornings with their heads torn off and maidens would be found brutally ravished (if found alive at all). But now that was done. Lord Fredrick had placed a bounty on the heads of the gang, and I had turned up at his audience chamber and placed the heads of the gangs (in a sack) on his table. Now I sat next to the good Lord Fredrick at the high table, his face - where visible around his ruddy beard - already red from the wine and ale he'd consumed. In addition to the large amount of purse of gold that I'd been given, and the lavish bedchamber I'd been given for the night, a feast had been thrown in my honor (and also to celebrate the freedom the lands of Fredrick had regained). Bread, meat, ale, and wine - it all flowed freely tonight. Laughter that had been missing for too long reigned again. I smiled and indulged along with the townspeople. I hoped that, perhaps, one of the young serving-maidens would be persuaded to return to my bedchambers with me for the night. But then, Lord Fredrick stood, banging his tankard on the wooden table for silence. "My people! We have one  <hi rend="bold">last</hi>  reward for our hero!" He bellowed. He gave a sign to one of the guards who left the great hall. He soon returned with a small group of his brethren, escorting a chained prisoner between them. The prisoner, an orc - a female one, apparently, by her chesty figure - was bound by wrist and ankle manacles. She was muscular, though also had an iron collar around her thick neck. She was clad in simple tunic and trousers, though the stains and creases of the garments told me that she had been wearing armour of recent. Her thick mane of red hair, clashing drastically with her green skin, was contained in a braid of the Nordic style and long enough to drop over her rear. The guards pulled her down the hall aisle and made her kneel at the foot of the dias of the high table. Lord Fredrick leaned into me, "This one is the only survivor my guardsmen took from a gang of raiders in the western villages. She's your, to do with as you wish. I'll proclaim her bonded to you." I looked down upon her. She did have a ferocious beauty to her... *** If you're looking on playing a ferocious female in a  <hi rend="bold">long-term RP</hi> , then this is the prompt for you! I've written this with your character being an <ref target="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3c/f7/4a/3cf74a0ed77a5c4cc6e5b30c5660672b.jpg">Orc</ref>, but this could easily be re-written to accommodate a <ref target="https://pre00.deviantart.net/68be/th/pre/f/2015/060/d/7/kaida_san_by_pasiphilo-d8k29np.jpg">Half-Orc</ref> or even a <ref target="https://pre00.deviantart.net/10a1/th/pre/f/2016/157/7/b/tiefling_thief_by_sirtiefling-da56uy1.jpg">Tiefling</ref>. While I imagine the smut might start fairly early, I would like there to be some adventure to sustain the story over the long-term. I imagine at first there would be a lot of humiliation (in private - especially an orc submitting to a "weaker" human) and roughness, but over time there might be a bit more romance. I'll declare openly that I'm an Aussie who works full-time on Australian Eastern Time, so replies won't always come quickly. But I do promise to reply when I can. Hard limits of Blood, Scat, and Vore. My kinks are in my profile (linked in my signature below), and I have particular liking for those who link in pics (as illustrations) in their replies. So, if this sounds like a fantasy for you, I'd love to get chatting and we can work things out :) Regards, <ref target="https://redd.it/5xrh53">BlueTowelWithHoles</ref></p>
