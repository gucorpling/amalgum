<head>Wikinews interviews English mathematician Marcus du Sautoy</head><p><hi rend="bold">Monday, September 24, 2007</hi></p>
<p><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus%20du%20Sautoy">Marcus du Sautoy</ref> is Professor of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics">Mathematics</ref> at the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University%20of%20Oxford">University of Oxford</ref>. He is not only a researcher; he had great success with the popular book <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Music%20of%20the%20Primes">The Music of the Primes</ref></hi>. His last book <hi rend="italic">Finding Moonshine</hi> will be published in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English%20language">English</ref> in February 2008. It has already been published in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian%20language">Italian</ref> with the title <hi rend="italic">Il disordine perfetto</hi> ("The perfect disorder").</p>
<p>In September 2007 he was in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levico%20Terme">Levico Terme</ref> (<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trento">Trento</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Italy">Italy</ref>) for a conference. He was interviewed for Wikinews.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">What are you doing here in Levico? Are you going to talk?</hi></p>
<p>Actually, I'm an organizer. So many people wanted to talk, so we decided to take a step backwards so I am not giving a talk here. But I have several students here who are talking about work related to what I do. My work is looking at symmetry, something called  group theory, but using tools from number theory, something called the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeta%20function">Zeta function</ref>, which was introduced by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard%20Riemann">Riemann</ref>. So I used that tool to try and understand instead of prime numbers, which are very hard to understand, what sort of symmetry can exist. That is one of the major things I have been investigating. This conference is looking at ways of connecting lots of different ideas in mathematics to help us understand groups and symmetry.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">As a mathematician you are dedicating yourself not only to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/research">research</ref> but also to popularization. Why?</hi></p>
<p>I think being a scientist is about making discoveries but it is also as much about communication. I mean discoveries really cannot be said to exist, I think, unless you communicate them to other people. So, for example this conference is about communicating to our peers but I think that communication can go to a  much broader audience. It brings the mathematics alive much more, if you can communicate it to more people. But also, you know, I became a mathematician because people, the generation above me,  made the effort to excite the general public about mathematics and I thought that was what I wanted to be when I grow up, so my hope is as well that my popularization will encourage the next generation of mathematicians but also to encourage politicians to recognize that maths is an important part of our society and needs to be funded.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">What about your experiences on radio and television?</hi></p>
<p>I've done a lot of radio work, exploring mathematical ideas on the radio. However, people could not just think that maths could be done on television, you know, what are you going to see? It was a real breakthrough for me to be able to make some documentaries about mathematics. In particular I did a documentary about The Music of the Primes, and it was great! It was a travel program because mathematics is a very international subject and so we travel around the world: to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India">India</ref>, to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany">Germany</ref>, to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece">Greece</ref>. At the moment I'm in the middle of making a history of mathematics series for the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC">BBC</ref>, four one-hour programs from the Ancient <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon">Babylon</ref> through to the modern day. So we've been all over the world to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China">China</ref>, to India again, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa">Africa</ref>... And I also did a game show, that was quite fun, called Mind Games, which was a puzzle show which I hosted. I think a lot of people got into mathematics because of puzzles, especially at the moment, with <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku">Sudoku</ref> being so popular, I think people will love doing puzzles - now it's a very popular TV show.</p>
