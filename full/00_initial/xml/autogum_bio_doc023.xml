<head>Background</head>
<p>Patch was born in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>He attended <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakwood_Preparatory_School">Oakwood Preparatory School</ref> in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chichester_District">Chichester</ref> and then went on to attend <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bembridge_School">Bembridge School</ref> on the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Wight">Isle of Wight</ref>. After Bembridge, Patch went on to study at the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portsmouth_College">Portsmouth College of Art</ref> and the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_West_of_England_Academy">Royal West of England Academy</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-penileart-1">[1]</ref> Unable to earn a degree in fine arts he attended furniture design courses and became a builder.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-bbc2006-2">[2]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-lanacion-3">[3]</ref></p>
<p>In 1977 he <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_Australia">migrated from the United Kingdom to Australia</ref> and from 1978 to 1982 he exhibited woodcarvings and other artworks in art galleries.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-penileart-1">[1]</ref> In 1984 Patch established <hi rend="italic">Hellfire Pottery</hi> with his sister, which produced various pottery and ceramic works.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-4">[4]</ref> In 2002, Patch began work on building a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaudí">Gaudí</ref>-style house and art gallery, and during this same period he began working as a portrait and caricature artist in markets in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland">Queensland</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-whois-5">[5]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-shocks-6">[6]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-iolzuma-7">[7]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-radiosantiago-8">[8]</ref></p>
<p>Patch states that he conceived of the idea of painting with his penis in 2005. Inspired after watching <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puppetry_of_the_Penis">Puppetry of the Penis</ref></hi>, he drew a smiley face in the back of a urinal with his penis and then decided to attempt it at home using paint.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-falafil-9">[9]</ref> After telling a friend of his work, she had him paint at a 2005 New Year's Eve party on a dare.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-shocks-6">[6]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-iolzuma-7">[7]</ref> In 2006, Patch chose the name of "Pricasso" – a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau">portmanteau</ref> of "prick" (a slang term for penis) and "<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picasso">Picasso</ref>".<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-penileart-1">[1]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-radiosantiago-8">[8]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-voima-10">[10]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-nie-11">[11]</ref></p>

<p>In an interview with <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voima_(newspaper)">Voima</ref></hi>, Pricasso said that portrait work is the most challenging type of painting, so he set himself a goal of painting an accurate-looking portrait within 20 minutes.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-voima-10">[10]</ref> Due to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitewash">normal paint</ref> containing <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lime_(material)">lime</ref>, which erodes the skin, Pricasso makes his own <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water-based_paint">water-based paints</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-metropolis-12">[12]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-13">[13]</ref> Before he begins painting he also covers his penis and buttocks in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaseline">Vaseline</ref> in order to work for several hours without causing irritation to his skin.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-metropolis-12">[12]</ref></p>
<p>While art galleries showed little interest in his paintings, Pricasso became a regular attraction at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexpo">Sexpo</ref> exhibitions<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-shocks-6">[6]</ref> around the world, where he paints portraits for attendees.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-shocks-6">[6]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-expresso-14">[14]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-smhtired-15">[15]</ref></p>
<p>Pricasso's appearance at the 2010 Expo Sexo y Entretenimiento México was cancelled after censors from the Mexico City authorities attended the exposition to verify the shows.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-16">[16]</ref> He made his North American debut at the 2011 Miami <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xposed_Expo">Xposed Expo</ref>, and signed an agreement to appear exclusively at future Xposed Expo events.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-17">[17]</ref></p>
<p>In 2008, Pricasso entered a nude self-portrait into the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archibald_Prize">Archibald Prize</ref>. His submission came after an unsuccessful entry in the 2007 competition using a portrait of plastic surgeon Joseph Georghy.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-smhtired-15">[15]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-18">[18]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-19">[19]</ref></p>
<p>Pricasso told <hi rend="italic">Fala Fil</hi> that, while celebrities tend to be wary of having him paint their portrait, he has painted at private parties for famous individuals after agreeing to not publicise the event. <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Murphy">Charlie Murphy</ref> was one celebrity who Pricasso noted as approving.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-falafil-9">[9]</ref> Amongst the celebrities he has painted portraits of are <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Hefner">Hugh Hefner</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Howard">John Howard</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Beazley">Kim Beazley</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush">George W.

<p>In the latter half of 2010, Pricasso appeared on the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Supertalent_(season_4)">4th season</ref> of German TV talent show <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Supertalent">Das Supertalent</ref></hi>. After painting a female portrait on the stage, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvie_van_der_Vaart">Sylvie van der Vaart</ref> voted down the performance, but he progressed to the next round due to the support of the two male judges on the panel–<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieter_Bohlen">Dieter Bohlen</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Darnell">Bruce Darnell</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-23">[23]</ref> In November 2011, Pricasso appeared on <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tosh.0">Tosh.0</ref></hi>, where <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Tosh">Daniel Tosh</ref> interviewed and commissioned a picture of himself painted by the artist.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-24">[24]</ref></p>
<head>Response to technique</head>
<p>Nicholas Chare, in an article titled "Sexing the Canvas", has linked Pricasso's work with statements by classic modern painters who referred to the activity of painting as a "seminal" or "spermatic" activity with sexual connotations.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-25">[25]</ref></p>
<p>In the lead-up to the 2008 <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexpo">Sexpo</ref> in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Town">Cape Town</ref>, Pricasso published a video online showing him creating a painting of then-<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_Cape_Town">Mayor of Cape Town</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Zille">Helen Zille</ref>. Although he stated the painting was not meant to insult or embarrass Zille, <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times_(South_Africa)">The Times</ref></hi> reported that two art galleries in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannesburg">Johannesburg</ref> declined to associate themselves with Pricasso's artwork. The curator of Moja Modern gallery suggested that the ridicule of his work could abate in fifty years time and his painting seen as having broken boundaries in art. Julia Charlton, the senior curator of the Wits Gallery, said that it is not a question of whether it is art, but whether it is "good art". Charlton and Pieter van Heerden, the director of the Pretoria Art Institute, stated that how he painted did not determine the artistic nature of his work, with Charlton adding that "art is not only meant to be pleasant, but provocative, and it should get people talking." Van Heerden further stated his work is not offensive and that works only become art when they are great.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-26">[26]</ref> On hearing of Pricasso's painting, Zille stated "This is a free country. A free society throws up these kinds of people, who exercise their freedom in unusual ways. And if this is how he wants to do it, I must accept his constitutional right to do so." Zille further commented that Pricasso "achieved a good likeness and I can't imagine how he painted it without brushes or conventional equipment."<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-27">[27]</ref></p>
<p>In November 2011, Pricasso participated in the Gold Coast Sculptors' Society <hi rend="italic">Exotic Erotic</hi> show. The controversial nature of his technique caused several members of the Society to object to his participation, with one member resigning in protest. Pricasso responded to criticism by saying, "I think I'm just as good as anyone with a brush and I'm probably a lot quicker ... They can complain if they want to but other people love it."<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-28">[28]</ref></p>
