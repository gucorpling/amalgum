<p>The integration of the Latin America is the politics  repeatedly proposed by Lula during the meetings of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foro%20de%20São%20Paulo">Foro de São Paulo</ref>.

<p>On December 4, 2001 during the 10th edition of the Foro de São Paulo in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havana">Havana</ref> Lula said:"A shoal  of small fish may mean the finishing of the hungry in our countries, in out continent. We should not think as the History ended on our journey by the Earth. Even it happens just once, or with one gesture, let's effectively  contribute to the improve the life of millions of human beings who live socially excluded by  this neoliberal model."</p>
<p>In Venezuela, once again, he brought out the integration wish:
"This is the biggest dream I am carrying, that we can negotiate collectively, not like one country, but like a set of countries so we can do that our people may have the chance to conquer the full citizenship."</p>
