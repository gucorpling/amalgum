<head>Career</head>
<head>Bosnia</head>
<p>From 1495 to 1496, Firuz was <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjak-bey">sanjak-bey</ref> of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjak_of_Bosnia">Sanjak of Bosnia</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTESarajevu2007200-1">[1]</ref> His predecessor Jahja Pasha built a mosque in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarajevo">Sarajevo</ref> during his reign in Bosnia (1494–95) but did not provide a water supply to it. According to a legend, he asked his successor, Firuz Bey to do so from Sedrenik to the Jahja Pasha mosque. Firuz Bey did so and also built a public tap in honour of his predecessor.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-2">[2]</ref></p>
<head>Scutari</head>
<p>Firuz Bey held the position of Sanjak-bey of the Sanjak of Scutari from 1496 to 1502.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTERizaj1982299-3">[3]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPreto201033-4">[4]</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Đurađ_Crnojević">Đurađ Crnojević</ref> who controlled the neighboring <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Zeta">Principality of Zeta</ref> maintained frequent correspondence with other Christian feudal states with the intention of establishing an anti-Ottoman coalition. When his brother Stefan betrayed him to the Ottomans in 1496,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEdruštvo1935194-5">[5]</ref> Đurađ proposed to accept the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzerainty">suzerainty</ref> of the Ottoman Empire and Firuz Bey if they allowed him to remain as governor in Zeta. Firuz Bey refused this proposal and invited Đurađ to either come to Scutari to clarify his anti-Ottoman activities or to flee Zeta. When Firuz Bey attacked Zeta with strong forces in 1496 Đurađ was forced to flee to Venice.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJovanović194752-6">[6]</ref> In 1497, Firuz Bey captured <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grbalj">Grbalj</ref> and put Zeta under his effective military control, although it was still part of the Zeta governed by Stefan Crnojević.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPavle_S._Radusinović197844-7">[7]</ref> In 1499, Firuz Bey formally annexed Zeta to the territory of Sanjak of Scutari,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPavle_S._Radusinović197844-7">[7]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJovanović194752-6">[6]</ref> after he became suspicious of Stefan because of his connections with Venice. Firuz Bey invited Stefan Crnojević to Skadar where he imprisoned him. It is thought that Stefan probably died in prison since he was never mentioned again in historical sources.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEМарковић1969154-8">[8]</ref> In 1499, Firuz Bey organized raids of the territory around <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durrës">Durazzo</ref>. It was poorly defended and its population would have surrendered if Firuz Bey had brought more forces.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPress194876-9">[9]</ref> During the same year Firuz Bey joined Isa Pasha and raided the inland of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalmatia">Dalmatia</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGoodwin2013104-10">[10]</ref> In 1501, Firuz Bey captured Durazzo.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPress194880-11">[11]</ref> After the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman–Venetian_War_(1499–1503)">Ottoman–Venetian War (1499–1503)</ref>, Firuz Bey became the Ottoman representative for the region of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattaro">Cattaro</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEElezović195388-12">[12]</ref></p>

<p>Until 1945, one street in Sarajevo was named after Firuz Bey.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBejtić1973162-19">[19]</ref> After Bosnia and Herzegovina seceded from Yugoslavia in 1992, one street is again named after Firuz Bey.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-20">[20]</ref> His madrasa was destroyed at the end of the 17th century by the army of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_of_Savoy">Eugene of Savoy</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKasumović1999158-21">[21]</ref> His hammam was operational until 1810 when it was closed because of the poor state of its roof.
