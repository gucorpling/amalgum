<head>Biography</head>
<p>Susane Colasanti grew up in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peapack-Gladstone,_New_Jersey">Peapack-Gladstone, New Jersey</ref>, a rural area known for its many acres of woods. As a teenage Jersey girl, Susane felt like her true home was across the water in New York City. She moved to Manhattan to attend grad school at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_University">New York University</ref> in 1996 and has lived in New York City ever since.</p>
<p>Susane has a bachelor's degree from the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</ref> in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics">Astrophysics</ref>/Earth and Space Science with a minor in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology">psychology</ref>. She has a master's degree from New York University in Science Education 7–12, Teachers of Physics.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-cmlibrary-2">[2]</ref> Before becoming an author, Colasanti was a high school teacher of earth science, physics and meteorology in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan">Manhattan</ref> and the South Bronx.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-3">[3]</ref> In 2007, Colasanti was finally able to pursue writing as her full-time career, after spending ten years teaching.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-cmlibrary-2">[2]</ref></p>
<head>Teaching career</head>
<p>Speaking of her teaching career in high school, she always broke from tradition and followed her own creative approach to her work, like preparing materials way out of the text books, taking after school lessons and designing unconventional science labs. The results that followed always proved outstanding: one hundred percent students sailed through exams when barely forty percent made it before she taught the class. And this miracle indeed happened in a school at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Bronx">South Bronx</ref>, considered one of the poorest congressional districts in New York.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Susane-4">[4]</ref></p>
<p>"Giving back to the community is something I've always felt really strongly about. I believe in karma, that if you put positive energy out into the Universe, you are creating positive energy in your own life", writes Susane, the teen-romance writer.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Colasanti-5">[5]</ref></p>
<p>She believes that teachers play a pivotal role in the life of kids at school. Some of her former students and colleagues have called her another "real life" Louanne Johnson (<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Pfeiffer">Michelle Pfeiffer</ref>'s character in the Hollywood movie <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangerous_Minds">Dangerous Minds</ref>).</p>
<head>Writing career</head>
<p>Colasanti's first book <hi rend="italic">When It Happens</hi> was published in 2006.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-6">[6]</ref> In 2007, after its publication, Colasanti left her job as a teacher in New York City to become a full-time writer.

<p>Colasanti currently and lives in New York City as a full-time writer.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Susane-4">[4]</ref></p>
