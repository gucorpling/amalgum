<head>Giorgio Mainerio</head><p><hi rend="bold">Giorgio Mainerio</hi> (ca. 1530-1540 – 3 or 4 May 1582) was an <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy">Italian</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musician">musician</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composer">composer</ref>, and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occultist">occultist</ref>.</p>
<head>Biography</head>
<p>Mainerio was born in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parma">Parma</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy">Italy</ref> between 1530 and 1540. His father is thought to have been <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland">Scottish</ref> given that Giorgio signed <hi rend="italic">Mayner</hi> as his family name. During his education he studied <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music">music</ref>, but he did not immediately begin a musical career. In 1560, being a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyter">presbyter</ref>, he sought work as a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaplain">chaplain</ref> and <hi rend="italic">altarista</hi> by the church of <hi rend="italic">Santa Maria Annunziata</hi> in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udine">Udine</ref>.</p>
<p>In Udine, Mainerio spent ten years (from 1560 to 1570) and there, thanks to his previous musical knowledge and to the lessons given to him by two local contrapuntists, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriele_Martinengo">Gabriele Martinengo</ref> (<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maestro_di_cappella">Maestro di cappella</ref> from 1562 to 1567) and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ippolito_Chiamaterò">Ippolito Chiamaterò</ref> (Maestro di cappella from 1567 to 1570), he started his musical career. After three years in Udine he became interested in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occultism">occultism</ref> (<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrology">astrology</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(paranormal)">magic</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necromancy">necromancy</ref>) and there were rumours that—together with some women—he was attending night-rites. The <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquisition">Inquisition</ref> in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquileia">Aquileia</ref> started a preliminary investigation but the case was closed for lack of evidence. After the investigation, Mainiero had more troubles with his colleagues in the Chapter of Udine and, after applying for a position at the Patriarchal <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilica_of_Aquileia">Basilica of Aquileia</ref>, he quit partially the job in Udine, motivating his decision with "impellent although honest reasons". He was accepted at Aquileia and moved there, living in the quiet and isolated <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarchate_of_Aquileia_(Episcopal)">Patriarchate</ref>.</p>
<p>In 1578 he became <hi rend="italic">Maestro di cappella</hi> at the church of <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilica_of_Aquileia">S. Chiesa d'Aquilegia</ref></hi>. During the last years of his life he had problems with his health and often left the church in favour of travels to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice">Venice</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancona">Ancona</ref>, and thermal baths.</p>
<p>His death was announced to the Chapter on May 4, 1582.</p>
