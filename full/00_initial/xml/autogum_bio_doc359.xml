<head>Syed Ibrahim Danishmand</head><p><hi rend="bold">Syed Ibrahim Danishmand</hi> (<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali_language">Bengali</ref>: সৈয়দ ইব্রাহীম দানিশমন্দ) was a 16th century <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zamindar">landowner</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam">Islamic</ref> scholar who belonged to the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufi">Sufi</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qadiriyya">Qadiriyya</ref> order. Well respected during his lifetime, Danishmand was considered an expert in several Islamic and secular subjects. He is believed to be among the first of the Qadiriyya order to have operated and preached in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal">Bengal</ref>.</p>
<head>Early life</head>
<p>Born into a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syed">Syed</ref> family, there are differing opinions on the exact origins of Ibrahim Danishmand, with one suggestion being that he was a native of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persia">Persia</ref> who migrated to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal">Bengal</ref> in the 16th century.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Banglapedia-1">[1]</ref> It may therefore be possible that he was among the many Syeds who were invited from <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia">Central Asia</ref> and Persia by the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultan_of_Bengal">Sultan of Bengal</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alauddin_Husain_Shah">Alauddin Husain Shah</ref>, to aid in the administration of his kingdom.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-2">[2]</ref></p>
<p>Alternatively, historian <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achyut_Charan_Choudhury">Achyut Charan Choudhury</ref> states that he was a great-grandson of the Sufi general <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syed_Nasiruddin">Syed Nasiruddin</ref> and belonged to the Syeds of Taraf, a land owning family who had had a presence in Bengal since the 13th century.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-auto-3">[3]</ref></p>
<head>Life</head>
<p>A prolific writer, Syed Ibrahim was learned in many areas of Islam, though he was particularly focused on Islamic mysticism or <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasawwuf">Tasawwuf</ref></hi>. For his knowledge he was styled <hi rend="italic">Danishmand</hi> (wise), the title he is most commonly associated with.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Banglapedia-1">[1]</ref> Under Danishmand’s guidance, the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism">Hindu</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajput">Rajput</ref> nobleman Kalidas Gazdani converted to Islam.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-SamitiP600-4">[4]</ref> Gazdani took the name Sulaiman Khan and later became the father of the famous <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isa_Khan">Isa Khan</ref>, who led the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baro-Bhuyan">Baro-Bhuyan</ref> in rebellion against the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughal_Empire">Mughal Empire</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-5">[5]</ref></p>
<p>Syed Ibrahim was also a noted scholar in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_Language">Persian</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_Language">Arabic</ref> languages.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-SamitiP600-4">[4]</ref> He was recognised for these achievements by the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lodi_Dynasty">Emperor of Delhi</ref>, from whom he received the title <hi rend="italic">Malik-ul-Ulama</hi> (Prince of Scholars), as well as also being known by the honorific <hi rend="italic">Qutb-ul-Ashekeen</hi>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-6">[6]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Banglapedia-1">[1]</ref> At some point, Danishmand was granted land tax-free in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonargaon">Sonargaon</ref> by the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal_Sultanate">Sultan of Bengal</ref>, later transferring there from his previous holdings in Taraf, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylhet">Sylhet</ref>. Here, he established a <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khanqah">Khanqah</ref></hi> or Sufi meeting-house from which he preached Islam as well as <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qadiriyya">Qadiriyya</ref> Sufism. This practise was continued by his descendants as well as his spiritual successors.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Banglapedia-1">[1]</ref></p>
<p>He was eventually buried in Sonargaon, near the 15th century Fath Shah Mosque in a tomb complex he shares with several family members and other Islamic figures. It is considered a sacred site and is commonly visited by devotees.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-7">[7]</ref></p>
<head>Family</head>
<p>Many sources state that Syed Ibrahim was married to the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal_Sultanate">Sultan of Bengal's</ref> eldest daughter, whose name may have been Raushan Akhtar Banu.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-8">[8]</ref> However, there is some disagreement about the exact identity of this sultan. Suggestions include the last <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilyas_Shahi_dynasty">Ilyas Shahi</ref> ruler <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalaluddin_Fateh_Shah">Jalaluddin Fateh Shah</ref>, as well as <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alauddin_Husain_Shah">Alauddin Husain Shah</ref> or his son <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghiyasuddin_Mahmud_Shah">Ghiyasuddin Mahmud Shah</ref>, both of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hussain_Shahi_dynasty">Hussain Shahi dynasty</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-9">[9]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Banglapedia-1">[1]</ref> Through this marriage Syed Ibrahim had four sons: Musa, Isa, Yusuf and Ishaq.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-10">[10]</ref> He also had a daughter (or granddaughter) named Fatima Bibi, who later became the wife of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isa_Khan">Isa Khan</ref> and the probable mother to his son <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musa_Khan_(Bengal_Ruler)">Musa Khan</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-11">[11]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-12">[12]</ref></p>
