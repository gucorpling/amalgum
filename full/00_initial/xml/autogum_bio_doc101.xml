<head>Harris County Does</head>
<p><hi rend="bold">The Harris County Does</hi> consist of two currently unidentified youths discovered on January 12, 1981 in Houston, Harris County, Texas near Wallisville Road. Extensive investigation has been conducted with few leads.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-ncmec-1">[1]</ref></p>
<head>Victims</head>
<p>Both victims, a male and female, were found <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder">murdered</ref>, approximately eight weeks to two months before, between November and December 1980.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-ncmec-1">[1]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-namusf-2">[2]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-canyouidf-3">[3]</ref> Although their weights were impossible to estimate and the faces were not recognizable due to decomposition, their <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint">fingerprints</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentition">dental</ref> records and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA">DNA</ref> were taken.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-namusf-2">[2]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-canyouidm-4">[4]</ref> Both of their bodies were hidden on private property in the woods around 100 yards from the road and later found by a dog.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-hope-5">[5]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-ncmec-1">[1]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-namusf-2">[2]</ref> They were both buried in indigent graves near to the then-unidentified <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Michelle_Garvey">Michelle Garvey</ref>, who was later identified and transported to Connecticut in 2014.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-bone-6">[6]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-hope-5">[5]</ref></p>
<head>Female victim</head>
<p>The female, who was <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Americans">white</ref> with a possible <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States">Native American</ref>-<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscegenation">admixture</ref>, was between the ages of eighteen and twenty five, although she may have been as young as fifteen.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-canyouidf-3">[3]</ref> The cause of her death was ruled to be strangulation.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-betz1-7">[7]</ref> She was estimated to have been around five feet four inches to five feet nine inches tall. Her hair was eighteen inches long and reddish-brown, styled in a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponytail">ponytail</ref>. Her eyes were believed to have been brown and both of her ears were likely pierced, although only one earring was found in her right ear.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-ncmec-1">[1]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-namusf-2">[2]</ref> She had excellent dental hygiene, as did her companion.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-hope-5">[5]</ref> The victim was found near a pair of green jogging shorts and a "bloody towel" and no clothing was found on her body.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-betz1-7">[7]</ref> What are considered to be identifying factors for the girl is that she likely had an abnormal amount of hair on her face and she had a gap between her two front teeth.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-ncmec-1">[1]</ref> The victim was presumably a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_biting">nail biter</ref>, as her <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingernail">fingernails</ref> were noticeably short.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-doenetf-8">[8]</ref> Her wisdom teeth were emerging at the time of death.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-canyouidf-3">[3]</ref> Nine missing people from Texas and one from Pennsylvania have been ruled out as possible identities of the female.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-namusf-2">[2]</ref></p>
<head>Male victim</head>
<p>The male was somewhat older, estimated to be twenty to thirty years old, although he could have been as young as fifteen.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-ncmec-1">[1]</ref> Like the female, he was also white, had brown eyes and brown hair, although it was wavy and six inches long. The male was around five feet four to five feet eight inches tall at the time of his murder, which had been committed through beating.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-namusm-9">[9]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-betz1-7">[7]</ref> Unlike the female, he was bound and gagged.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-hope-5">[5]</ref> He had prominent <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyebrow">eyebrows</ref> and some deterioration of some of his upper <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrae">vertebrae</ref> in the neck region, possibly the result of an injury in the past or the presence of an abnormal joint.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-canyouidm-4">[4]</ref> As for dentals, one <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_filling">filling</ref> was found in one of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molars">molars</ref>; he also had restorations and his upper <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_teeth">wisdom teeth</ref> were not found, as they may have been <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_canal">removed</ref> or they may not have developed.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-10">[10]</ref> Six missing men were ruled out as possible identities for the male victim.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-namusm-9">[9]</ref></p>
