The Germans had greater ball possession and also led in passing accuracy. But they had to wait till the 65th minute when <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Mesut_Özil">Mesut Özil</ref> scored a goal. Thirteen minutes later, the lead was nullified as the Italians were awarded a penalty kick as defender <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jérôme%20Boateng">Jérôme Boateng</ref> committed a handball foul in the penalty area. Stepping up for the penalty, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo%20Bonucci">Leonardo Bonucci</ref> scored the equaliser.

The previous record was set by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepp%20Maier">Sepp Maier</ref> at 481 minutes.</p>
<p>The match proceeded to additional time as the score was 1–1.

I am especially sorry for Mario. [...] For us this means accepting the new situation and having to find solutions. We will do so. The quality in the squad is high and I have full confidence in all players."</p>
