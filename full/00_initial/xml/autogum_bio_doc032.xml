<p><hi rend="bold">Emily Stanley</hi> is an American professor of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limnology">limnology</ref> at the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Wisconsin–Madison">University of Wisconsin–Madison</ref>. She was named a 2018 <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_Society_of_America">Ecological Society of America</ref> Fellow and her research focuses on the ecology of freshwater ecosystems.</p>
<head>Early life and education</head>
<p>Emily Stanley was born in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethlehem,_Pennsylvania">Bethlehem, Pennsylvania</ref> to parents Frank and Elizabeth. She has three siblings: Jonathan, Elizabeth, and James. Emily Stanley received her B.S. in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology">Biology</ref> at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University">Yale University</ref> in 1984, her M.S. in Biology at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_State_University">Southwest Texas State University</ref> in 1986, and her Ph.D. in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoology">Zoology</ref> at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_State_University">Arizona State University</ref> in 1993.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-:0-1">[1]</ref> Her Ph.D. advisor was Stuart Fisher, a Professor Emeritus at the School of Life Sciences at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_State_University">Arizona State University</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-2">[2]</ref></p>
<head>Career and research</head>
<p>After completing her Ph.D., Stanley worked as a Post-Doctoral Research Assistant at the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Alabama">University of Alabama</ref> for two years, then was Associate Professor at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_State_University–Stillwater">Oklahoma State University</ref> in the zoology department for three years. In 1998 she became associate professor at the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Wisconsin–Madison">University of Wisconsin</ref> Center for Limnology and Department of Integrative Biology. In 2010, she was promoted to Full Professor.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-:0-1">[1]</ref></p>
<p>Stanley's research focuses on <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limnology">limnology</ref>, as well as river and stream <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem_ecology">ecosystem ecology</ref>. Her Ph.D. thesis studied a stream in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona">Arizona</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonoran_Desert">Sonoran Desert</ref> to determine how the different parts of the streams dried during warmer months, and it was determined that when each part of the stream <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem">ecosystem</ref> shrinks and expands, the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream">stream</ref> as a whole fluctuates in size.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-:1-3">[3]</ref> According to her paper, this research could help predict how drying patterns cause changes in ecosystems, and knowing that stream ecosystems change over space and time can also be used to predict how streams could change due to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change">climate change</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-:1-3">[3]</ref></p>
<p>Other research of hers includes studying the effects of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dam_removal">dam removal</ref> on ecosystems and predicting how best to manage the consequences.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-:2-4">[4]</ref> She has also researched how different factors such as <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrology">hydrology</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry">biochemistry</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species">invasive species</ref>, and human <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_use">land-use</ref> alter lakes and rivers. Changes in freshwater ecosystems, according to her research, can affect services humans get from these ecosystems, such as <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_water">drinking water</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-:3-5">[5]</ref> Emily Stanley has also studied <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riparian_zone">riparian zones</ref>, which are the areas between rivers and land, and how human impacts can change these ecosystems.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-:4-6">[6]</ref> In addition, she has studied <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyporheic_zone">hyporheic zones</ref>, areas where <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_water">surface water</ref> mixes with <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundwater">groundwater</ref>, and researched how water and nutrients are exchanged between the two.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-:5-7">[7]</ref></p>
