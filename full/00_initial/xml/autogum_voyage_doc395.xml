<head>Swift Current</head>

<p><hi rend="bold"><ref target="http://www.tourismswiftcurrent.ca/">Swift Current</ref></hi> is a city of about 16,600 people (2016) in <ref target="Southern%20Saskatchewan">Southern Saskatchewan</ref>. It was a small wheat growing town in the 1930s, but has since developed into a regional city.</p>

<head>Understand</head>
<p>The settlement of Swift Current was established in 1883, after the Canadian Pacific Railway surveyed a railway line as far as Swift Current Creek.</p>

<head>Climate</head>
<p>Winters are long, dry, and cold, while summers are short, warm, and relatively wet. The coldest month is January, with a mean temperature of −10.1 °C (14 °F), while the warmest month is July, with a mean temperature of 18.2 °C (65 °F). The driest month is February, with an average of 11.8 mm (0.46 in) of precipitation, while the wettest month is June, with an average of 77 mm (3.0 in). Annual precipitation is low, with an average of 392.5 mm (15.45 in). Its location in southwest Saskatchewan gives it slightly milder winters than the provincial capital, Regina, even though it is higher in elevation. Chinook winds happen several times a year allowing residents to enjoy unseasonably warm weather for short periods of time.</p>
