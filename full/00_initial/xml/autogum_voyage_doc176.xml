<head>The Canadian</head>


<p><hi rend="bold"><ref target="https://m.viarail.ca/en/explore-our-destinations/trains/rockies-and-pacific/toronto-vancouver-canadian">The Canadian</ref></hi> (French: <hi rend="italic">Le Canadien</hi>) is a passenger train route operated by Via Rail Canada running from <ref target="Toronto">Toronto</ref> to <ref target="Vancouver">Vancouver</ref>, with numerous intermediate stops including <ref target="Winnipeg">Winnipeg</ref>, <ref target="Saskatoon">Saskatoon</ref>, <ref target="Edmonton">Edmonton</ref>, <ref target="Jasper">Jasper</ref> and <ref target="Kamloops">Kamloops</ref>. The trip, which takes over three days, is the longest passenger train route in North America, and covers several distinct landscapes. It runs from Toronto's financial district, through the sprawling suburbs of the Greater Toronto area, passing Ontario's Lake Country and through the massive Canadian Shield, the open expanse of the prairies, across the <ref target="Rocky%20Mountains%20%28Canada%29">Rocky Mountains</ref>, and into the lush <ref target="Fraser%20Valley">Fraser Valley</ref> of <ref target="British%20Colombia">British Colombia</ref>, before ending in the bustling Pacific city of <ref target="Vancouver">Vancouver</ref>.</p>

<head>Understand</head>

<p>The Canadian is the longest scheduled passenger train outside Eurasia, and at 4,466 km, it is 542 km longer than the <ref target="Amtrak">California Zephyr</ref>, and 114 km longer than the <ref target="Across%20Australia%20by%20train">Indian Pacific</ref> in <ref target="Australia">Australia</ref>, though it is less than half the distance of the <ref target="Trans-Siberian%20Railway">Moscow-Vladivostok Trans-Siberian Railway</ref>.</p>

<p>The train inherited its name from a previous service operated by the Canadian Pacific Railway, which ran from Toronto to Vancouver, albeit on a more southern route that ran through <ref target="Thunder%20Bay">Thunder Bay</ref>, <ref target="Calgary">Calgary</ref> and <ref target="Banff">Banff</ref>. The current route is largely that used by the rival Canadian National Railway's Super Continental. After both railways turned their passenger service over to Via in the 1970s, Via operated both trains until the southern route was mostly cancelled in the 1990s due to budget cuts, and the Canadian brand was transferred to the northern route.</p>

<p>The train operates using an assortment of cars used on the original Canadian and cars of the same era purchased from US railways. The cars, mostly built in the 1950s, have been rebuilt several times and while quaint, are functional and have been modernized to a limited degree. During the summer months, when demand is higher, the train will be longer than 20 cars. While the train is dominated by tourists, especially in the summer, one of its purposes is to provide transportation services to the remote communities between Capreol and Winnipeg, and thus it makes many stops in remote places along the line. </p>

<p>Service on the train and major stations is available in English and French, all staff will speak English and most will speak French as well. With a few exceptions the communities served by the train are primarily English-speaking.</p>

<head>Tickets</head>

<p>Tickets can be purchased directly from Via Rail through its website, over the phone (‚òè +1 888 842-7245 (in Canada and the United States), +1 514 989 2626 (worldwide), +1 800 268-9503 (TTY) ), in person at any staffed Via station counter, or through <ref target="http://www.viarail.ca/en/travel-info/international-travellers/overseas-sales-agents">overseas travel agents</ref>. Unlike European rail tickets, the ticket is valid only for a specific date of departure.</p>

<p>See the sleep section of this article for a breakdown of classes and full prices. </p>

<head>Discounts</head>

<p>Sales and special online discounts are available through sporadically on Via's website for both economy and sleeper tickets, but unless there is a general sale, <ref target="http://www.viarail.ca/en/fares-and-packages/special-offers/discount-tuesdays">discounts for the next few weeks of travel in economy class are available every week Tuesday</ref> Toronto (Eastern) Time. Sleeper class discount fares are available on a <ref target="http://www.viarail.ca/en/deals">separate page</ref> at any time. Especially in the off season these sales can halve the base fare. Via sometimes offers $15 fares for children age 11 and under between any two points on the route during the peak season.</p>

<head>Boarding</head>

<p>For passengers getting on in Toronto, Sudbury Junction, Capreol, Winnipeg, Saskatoon, Edmonton, Jasper or Vancouver, this is simply a matter of showing up at the station at the right time and if necessary checking your baggage at the baggage counter. In Toronto, sleeper class passengers have access to the Business class lounge. As Toronto is the only station on the route with frequent departures of other trains, economy passengers leaving Toronto should make sure that they get in the right line in the station concourse. </p>

<p>At all other stations boarding is simply a matter of waiting until the train arrives. Depending on the station, there my be a building for you to wait in, washrooms and a wheelchair lift, passengers should check the station's page on Via's website. Many remote stations will only have a signpost, and some not even that. Passengers check the status of their train ahead of time. When the train approaches at a remote station, stand a safe distance from the tracks, but so the conductor can see you. Approach the conductor when they beckon or turn a flashlight on you. They may ask you to take your baggage to the baggage car yourself and will help you board the train. At most remote stations you are on railway property and should abide by the directions of railway staff, though they will typically leave you alone if you keep out of their way.</p>

<head>Route</head>

<p>This description may not reflect what is visible on the train, some areas will inevitably be covered by darkness as the train passes through them. Westbound travellers should read the travel guide in reverse. </p>

<head>Vancouver-Gifford</head>
<p>Vancouver is the third largest metropolitan area in the country, with a population of 3.4 million. The Canadian's eastbound journey begins (and the westbound ends) at <hi rend="bold">(4,466 km/3 days, 19h to Toronto, 0 km/0h from Vancouver, Time zone: Pacific)</hi> Neoclassical Pacific Central Station, located just east of the downtown core. It uses the BNSF tracks through suburban communities including <ref target="Burnaby">Burnaby</ref>, to <ref target="New%20Westminster">New Westminster</ref>. After the train crosses the New Westminster Bridge, the Canadian leaves BNSF for CN tracks east. From New Westminster to Gifford, the route passes railway yards and industry.</p>

<head>Fraser and Thompson River Canyons</head>
<p>At Gifford, the train diverts from the CN mainline and crosses the Fraser River to Mission. CN and CPR utilize directional running through the Fraser and Thompson River canyons; eastbound trains use the CPR lines and westbounds the CN tracks. Thus, for the section through the two canyons, the <hi rend="italic">Canadian</hi> runs on its original CPR route. From Mission to Cisco, the CPR runs west (north) of the river; afterwards, it runs east (south). Near Basque, the eastbound Canadian transfers onto the CN main.</p>

<p>Westbound, the Canadian stays on the CN tracks all the way into Vancouver. The CN route passes through Painted Canyon, and features CN's 240 m steel-arched bridge over the Fraser River and the CPR mainline at Cisco. The tracks in Painted Canyon are only approximately 60 m above the Thompson River. After Cisco, the CN mainline stays of the east/south side of the Fraser River all the way to the New Westminster Bridge, where the two routes merge.</p>

<p>On their regular schedules, both east and westbound Canadian's travel through the Fraser and Thompson river canyons at night.</p>
