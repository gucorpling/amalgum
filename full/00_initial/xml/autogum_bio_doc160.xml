<head>Education</head>
<p>Ruttley was born in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houma,_Louisiana">Houma, Louisiana</ref>, and raised in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lafayette,_Louisiana">Lafayette, Louisiana</ref>.  Since Ruttley had always loved biology and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology">physiology</ref>, she started her educational journey focusing on a career in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_sciences">life sciences</ref>.  She received a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science">Bachelor of Science</ref> degree in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology">Biology</ref> and a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Science">Master of Science</ref> in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_Engineering">Mechanical Engineering</ref> with an emphasis in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomedical_Engineering">Biomedical Engineering</ref> from <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_State_University">Colorado State University</ref> (CSU), where she was a member of the Class of 2000.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-LinkedIn-2">[2]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-NASA_Bio-3">[3]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Events-6">[6]</ref>  She also received a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ph.D">Ph.D</ref> in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience">Neuroscience</ref> in 2007 from <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Texas_Medical_Branch">University of Texas Medical Branch</ref> at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galveston">Galveston</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-LinkedIn-2">[2]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-ColoState-7">[7]</ref>  Ruttley was a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_E._McNair_Post-Baccalaureate_Achievement_Program">McNair Scholar</ref> at CSU.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-ColoState-7">[7]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Keynote-8">[8]</ref></p>
<p>At CSU, Ruttley became involved with the Colorado Space Grant Consortium and the student branch of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Institute_of_Aeronautics_and_Astronautics">American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics</ref> (AIAA).  As an undergraduate, and through her participation in student design conferences, she became more interested in the hardware aspects of maintaining optimal crew health in space.  Ruttley soon realized the importance of an interdisciplinary approach to designing hardware for crew health, so she pursued her master's degree in Mechanical Engineering.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-NASA_Bio-3">[3]</ref>  Ruttley also belonged to the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Society_of_Mechanical_Engineers">American Society of Mechanical Engineers</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigma_Xi">Sigma Xi</ref> while attending CSU.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Gold-9">[9]</ref></p>
<p>Ruttley's master's <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesis">thesis</ref> was the testing of a novel gravity-independent resistive exercise device, the Constant Force Resistive Exercise Unit (CFREU), which she had developed in collaboration with CSU's AIAA student design team.  The team had tested one version of the machine in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microgravity">microgravity</ref> aboard <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Aeronautics_and_Space_Administration">NASA</ref>'s <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KC-135">KC-135</ref> aircraft.  They subsequently received a $70,000 contract from NASA to develop an improved prototype.  Ruttley and her husband, Paul Colosky, patented the CFREU design when they graduated from CSU.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-NASA_Bio-3">[3]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-ColoState-7">[7]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Gold-9">[9]</ref></p>
<head>NASA career</head>
<p>Ruttley received an offer to work for NASA's Biomedical Systems Division upon graduation.
