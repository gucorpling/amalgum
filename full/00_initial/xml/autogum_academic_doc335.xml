<head> 4. Discussion</head>
<p>
Our study, conducted on a limited, though well characterized, number of young, healthy volunteers, aimed at comparing the autonomic response to cognitive and sensory tests to the best of our knowledge, and tried to fill in a significant gap in the existing literature. </p>

<p>With respect to the baseline, the presentation of the six different olfactory stimuli was seen to elicit a significant response in terms of activation of the sympathetic branch of the ANS. Having reported that the olfactory compounds used included odors normally judged as both pleasant and unpleasant, our findings are somewhat similar to the retrievals of Bensafi et al., limited to unpleasant odors. In addition, we also failed to find significant correlations between autonomic parameters and odor pleasantness, confirming that pleasant versus unpleasant odors do not cause significantly different autonomic responses in healthy subjects. </p>

<p>After the olfactory stimulation, the TSST further increased the SNS activity, at the same time highlighting a somewhat parasympathetic withdrawal, as demonstrated by the simultaneous decrease of both SDNN and pNN50. Despite not being extensively studied with respect to the TSST, this kind of ANS behavior is consistent with the results by Boesch et al., which, with a slightly different protocol, found an increase in HR together with a contextual decrease of HRV features during the administration of the TSST for groups (TSST-G). Similar results in terms of HR augmentation and HRV reduction under TSST stress were also found in several other protocols (see), strengthening the scientific value of our findings. </p>

<p>The comparison between ANS responses to olfactory stimulation and to the TSST protocol made it possible to compare Task I and Task II, as well as Task II and Task III responses, and highlighted a much higher contribution to the SNS activation borne by the TSST. Therefore, TSST was confirmed to represent a powerful psychosocial stress task capable to induce an acute stress response of all main physiologic stress systems. </p>

<p>In addition, olfactory stimulation also elicited ANS activation (particularly SNS) The magnitude of this response was significantly smaller than that occurring with TSST, highlighting its usefulness in stress monitoring of subjects unable to undergo complex mathematical stress tests, limited to some particularly controlled experimental settings. </p>

<p>Interestingly, the trends noticed in the phase transition between Task III and recovery suggest an overall ANS withdrawal after a massive psycho-sensory stress protocol, being that both SNS and PNS activity decreased at this stage. </p>

<p>Finally, the only significant correlation revealed that subjects who more quickly completing the TSST protocol displayed higher PNS activation in the following phase. This result could be speculated in terms of sustained hyper-reactivity of the PNS, as a marker of increased selective attention and higher-order behavior and cognition (e.g., see). </p>

<head> Limitations</head>
<p>
All these findings should be taken into account in light of some limitations. </p>

<p>First, the relatively small sample size does not allow drawing considerations based on subgroups (e.g., gender- or age-based, etc.). This fact did not allow investigating the possible effects of confounding factors, including gender-specific ones (i.e., the sexual-hormone influences for female subjects, menstrual cycle phases, etc.) or variables related to some physical characteristics of the subjects (i.e., the body mass index), even though none of the volunteers was apparently under- or overweight. Second, due to the necessity of keeping the overall length of the protocol reasonably low, we did not consider long-term ANS measurements that could be more precise in characterizing the overall stress state of the volunteers. Third, for the same reason, we decided not to administer stress-related questionnaires, such as Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) or State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), to monitor both state and trait anxiety. Such protocols can be applied in future studies, allowing assessing possible correlations between the subjective, perceived stress and the variations of the ANS parameters. </p>

<p>Fourth, for the reason mentioned above, we decided to keep the recovery phase reasonably short. With a longer duration of this phase, one could have inferred the duration of the autonomic effects of both cognitive and sensory stimulation. This limitation could be taken into account and solved in future studies. </p>

<p>Fifth, the somewhat counterintuitive results retrieved in studying time- versus frequency-domain features were partially explained by the contrasting literature explanation regarding the physiological processes underlying frequency-domain variations, as explained in the signal analysis subsection of the Materials and Methods. Further studies conducted on larger samples, and using other time-domains and more robust ECG features, including RMSSD and the Cardiac Vagal Index calculated from the Lorenz plot, could also help in clarifying this point. </p>

<p>Finally, the administration of both pleasant and unpleasant odors would have represented a possible confounding factor if oneâ€™s aim was to control the selective ANS response to one of the two categories. In light of such considerations, future protocols could be structured starting from the selection of odors based on their hedonic tone, even referring to pleasantness data reported in previously published studies. </p>
