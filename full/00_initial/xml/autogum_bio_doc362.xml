<p>In late 1609, Abbas I sent the Portuguese diplomat and missionary <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_de_Gouvea">Antonio de Gouvea</ref> (now in Safavid service) back to Spain and Rome in order to construct an alliance against the common enemy; the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire">Ottoman Turks</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMatthee2002177–179-2">[1]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBlow200992-3">[2]</ref> Dengiz Beg Rumlu, merchant by profession, was assigned to accompany de Gouvea as merchant-envoy with some 100 bales of raw silk.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMatthee2002177–179-2">[1]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBlow200992-3">[2]</ref></p>
<p>At the Spanish court of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_III_of_Spain">Philip III</ref> (r.1598–1621), where they arrived in 1611, a major misunderstanding arose; Dengiz Beg had sold more than half of the total bales of silk for his own profit.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMatthee2002177–179-2">[1]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFloodNecipoglu2017955-4">[3]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-6">[lower-alpha 2]</ref> De Gouvea, without any sort of compromise with the Iranian government, suddenly offered the remaining number of silk bales as a gift to the Spanish king, even though the Iranians had intended to sell them as a sample of the silk they intended to deliver in the future.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMatthee2002177–179-2">[1]</ref> De Gouvea and Dengiz secured a trade agreement with Philip III, but it proved to be of no value for the Spanish government never adopted it.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBlow200994-7">[5]</ref> They also urged for a blockade of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea">Red Sea</ref>, but they were reportedly "no more successful" in this than <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Shirley">Robert Shirley</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBlow200994-7">[5]</ref></p>
<p>Conform Abbas I's desire, at the Spanish court, Dengiz Beg Rumlu supported the elevation of de Gouvea to the rank of bishop of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrene,_Libya">Cyrene</ref> and Apostolic <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicar">vicar</ref> of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Armenians">Armenians</ref> of the royal capital of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isfahan">Isfahan</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMatthee2002177–179-2">[1]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBlow200994-7">[5]</ref></p>
<p>Dengiz Beg and de Gouvea set sail for Safavid Iran from <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisbon">Lisbon</ref> in March 1612 with gifts and presents from the Habsburg crown.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFloodNecipoglu2017964–965-8">[6]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBlow200994,_103-9">[7]</ref> Dengiz Beg received a coat of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_(armour)">mail</ref> and a specific sword which he himself had requested from Philip III.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFloodNecipoglu2017964-10">[8]</ref> He also received a gold chain, a gold sword, a portrat of Philip III decorated with numerous costly gems, as well as some <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_tack">horse trappings</ref> which he liked to have.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFloodNecipoglu2017964-10">[8]</ref></p>
<p>In the spring of 1613, Dengiz Beg appeared at the Iranian court.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBlow2009102-11">[9]</ref> Reportedly, as he went down on his knees to kiss the king's foot, Abbas kicked him and ordered for his execution.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBlow2009102-11">[9]</ref> It appears that king Abbas had appointed a person in Dengiz's suite to spy on him in Europe, for Abbas was already aware of Dengiz's wrongdoings before his presentation at court.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBlow2009102–103-12">[10]</ref> Amongst others, Dengiz Beg was accused of treating the members of his mission extremely bad; this had resulted in some of them converting to Christianity and staying in Europe.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBlow2009103-5">[4]</ref> Abbas' anger with Dengiz Beg was most likely increased by Philip III's meager responses and actions and for "reawakening" his dissatisfaction with the Portuguese occupation of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormuz_Island">Hormuz</ref>. When Abbas then also found out that the silk had been given to Philip III as a gift rather than being sold, he became furious.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBlow2009103-5">[4]</ref> When Abbas later received de Gouvea, he also discovered that Dengiz Beg had received nothing of equal value in return; the presents and goods were all a gift, and not payment for the silk; and they were, reportedly, not even nearly as costly as the bales of silk that de Gouvea had given to Philip III.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBlow2009-13">[11]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFloodNecipoglu2017964–965-8">[6]</ref></p>
<p>Dengiz Beg was executed in 1613.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMatthee2002177–179-2">[1]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEButler2012652-14">[12]</ref> It remains unclear what the precise reason was; it may be that his role in the "silk affair" proved to be the straw that broke the camel's back.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMatthee2002177–179-2">[1]</ref></p>
