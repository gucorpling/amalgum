<head>Jerome Anderson (football agent)</head>This article is about the association football sports agent. For the professional basketball player, see <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Anderson_(basketball)">Jerome Anderson (basketball)</ref>.
<p><hi rend="bold">Jerome Anderson</hi> was a London-based sports agent with <ref target="https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=2382220">Sport Entertainment and Media Group</ref> from 2001 until his retirement. Initially focused on the football world, he extended his reach into heavyweight boxing and was <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennox_Lewis">Lennox Lewis</ref>' agent for his bout against <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tyson">Mike Tyson</ref> that was described by <hi rend="italic">The Telegraph</hi> as one of “the moments of the decade.”<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-1">[1]</ref></p>
<p>Anderson had a number of football clients prior to his work with SEM and was the first agent to introduce foreign stars to the English Premier League, including <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Bergkamp">Dennis Bergkamp</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Overmars">Marc Overmars</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uwe_Rosler">Uwe Rosler</ref>. He represented nine of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.">Arsenal</ref>’s 1989 title-winning side and has represented over 200 professional footballers. Anderson has now retired from his position at SEM to focus on his other business interests. He was at the forefront of the establishment of the charity The David Rocastle Trust, which helps to benefit families and communities.</p>
<p>In February 2009, SEM formed a corporate partnership with Kentaro, a Swiss-based sports rights business who are among the major players in the international marketing of football television rights.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Rovers_owner_denies_Allardyce_sacked_over_transfer_row-2">[2]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-So_just_who_are_Kentaro_and_the_SEM_group?-3">[3]</ref></p>
<head>Early career and involvement at Arsenal</head>
<p>Anderson trained as a banker and worked as a currency trader and in insurance, before beginning his career as Jerome Anderson Management in association with players from <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.">Arsenal F.C.</ref>, whom he had supported since he was four and where he had been the stadium announcer.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Small_is_beautiful:_All_credit_to_the_lads,_at_the_end_of_the_day_our_value's_down_to_them-4">[4]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Agent_Anderson_the_man_behind_City_revolution-5">[5]</ref> Among his early clients were the Arsenal players <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Nicholas">Charlie Nicholas</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Agent_Anderson_the_man_behind_City_revolution-5">[5]</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Rocastle">David Rocastle</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Small_is_beautiful:_All_credit_to_the_lads,_at_the_end_of_the_day_our_value's_down_to_them-4">[4]</ref> "It became clear that players needed proper professional representation to ensure they were focused on success on the field," Anderson said.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Small_is_beautiful:_All_credit_to_the_lads,_at_the_end_of_the_day_our_value's_down_to_them-4">[4]</ref></p>
<p>SEM went on to represent, among others, the Arsenal players <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Adams_(footballer)">Tony Adams</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Wright">Ian Wright</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Bergkamp">Dennis Bergkamp</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Seaman">David Seaman</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Petit">Emmanuel Petit</ref>, and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thierry_Henry">Thierry Henry</ref>. Anderson formed a close working relationship with the Arsenal vice-chairman, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Dein">David Dein</ref>, whose son, Darren, worked for SEM.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Sam_Allardyce_sacking_puts_Premier_League_on_alert_over_Blackburn_Rovers_transfer_policy-6">[6]</ref></p>
<head>John Obi Mikel</head>
<p>In 2005 Anderson's SEM was involved in the controversial transfer of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Obi_Mikel">John Obi Mikel</ref> from <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FK_Lyn">FK Lyn</ref> in the Norwegian league to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.">Chelsea F.C.</ref> through their agent, John Shittu. Shittu reportedly persuaded Mikel's father to grant SEM power of attorney over his son and subsequently oversaw the player's transfer to the London club despite a move having seemingly been agreed to take the player to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United">Manchester United</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Teenager_caught_up_in_a_tug-of-war-7">[7]</ref></p>
<head>Manchester City</head>
<p>Anderson subsequently came to further attention for his influence at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.">Manchester City F.C.</ref>. Between £5 million and £7 million was reported to have been paid in commission to Anderson as part of the recruitment of eight new players in the weeks following the takeover of the club by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thaksin_Shinawatra">Thaksin Shinawatra</ref> in May 2007.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-£7M_Jerome's_a_City_Banker-8">[8]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Thaksin_cutting_his_agent_dependency-9">[9]</ref> Anderson advised Shinawatra on the takeover, introducing him to Keith Harris (whose firm, Seymour Pierce, handled the deal) and recommending as manager <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sven-Göran_Eriksson">Sven-Göran Eriksson</ref>, before his influence waned as the new owners balked at such payments and other figures –notable <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_Joorabchian">Kia Joorabchian</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pini_Zahavi">Pini Zahavi</ref>– became involved.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Agent_Anderson_the_man_behind_City_revolution-5">[5]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-How_an_agent_came_to_hold_so_much_power_at_Blackburn_Rovers-10">[10]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Thaksin_cutting_his_agent_dependency-9">[9]</ref> Anderson said: "There is no one else in the world who could have delivered what I did in three weeks. It was my idea to open it up to other agents, and whatever I was paid –and it wasn't as much as City say– they've had it back in spades."<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Thaksin_cutting_his_agent_dependency-9">[9]</ref></p>
<p>Thaksin Shinawatra was regarded by a number of human rights groups as being an "unfit person" to own a Premier League football club. He was eventually deposed as Chairman by the Manchester City Board and forced to sell 90% of his interest in the Club for £210m.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-11">[11]</ref> Manchester City's trading losses trebled during the full year in which Shinawatra was in control. The introduction of new capital by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan's Abu Dhabi United Group Investment &amp; Development Ltd saved the club after Shinawatra's assets were frozen as part of the international investigation into corruption carried out by the Thai authorities.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-12">[12]</ref></p>
<head>Blackburn Rovers</head>
<p>In 2010, Anderson worked for Crescendo Sports Limited (a company based in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunei">Brunei</ref>) providing consultancy services for <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venky's_(India)_Limited">Venkateshwara Hatcheries</ref> in respect of their prospective acquisition of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackburn_Rovers">Blackburn Rovers</ref>. After being a major advisor to Venky's during their successful takeover in November 2010, he continued to exert considerable influence on the club.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-How_an_agent_came_to_hold_so_much_power_at_Blackburn_Rovers-10">[10]</ref> After the Blackburn manager <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Allardyce">Sam Allardyce</ref> was sacked in December 2010, Blackburn were forced to deny that the dispute had been based on the club's transfer policy being set by the Kentaro sports agency, with whom Anderson's SEM were associated.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Rovers_owner_denies_Allardyce_sacked_over_transfer_row-2">[2]</ref> "Kentaro are our main consultants but Sam had the final call," Venky's chairwoman Anuradha Desai said.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Rovers_owner_denies_Allardyce_sacked_over_transfer_row-2">[2]</ref></p>
<p>The new manager at Blackburn was <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Kean">Steve Kean</ref>, who had been first-team coach under Allardyce. Kean was represented by Anderson,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Steve_Kean_finds_value_of_friends_in_high_places_at_Blackburn_Rovers-13">[13]</ref> who also introduced Kean's new assistant, the former Arsenal player, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Jensen">John Jensen</ref>, to the club.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-'Stranger'_Jensen_is_Kean's_No2-14">[14]</ref> When John Williams left Blackburn Rovers in February 2011 after 14 years as chairman, Anuradha Desai explained that the departure was in part due to the fact that he had "struggled to accept Jerome's role at the club".<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Mrs_Desai:_Why_John_Williams_left_Blackburn_Rovers-15">[15]</ref></p>
<p>In March 2011, when it was announced that Anderson's 21-year-old footballer son, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Anderson">Myles</ref>, had signed a precontract agreement with Blackburn, sources close to the agent insisted he had no day-to-day involvement at the club. This has been heavily disputed by Rovers fans and others who saw damning evidence of foul play. It was later revealed that Anderson had worked with agent Manuel Salamanca Ferrer to bring <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubén_Rochina">Rubén Rochina</ref> to Rovers for £400,000, with the agent's cut being £1.65m (the cut would normally be around £170,000 for such a deal).<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Agent_is_paid_£1.65m_in_deal_for_a_player_who_cost_£400,000-16">[16]</ref></p>
