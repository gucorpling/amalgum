<p>A series of bombs exploded early on Monday morning has killed at least 49 and wounded 260 more in <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Iraq">Iraq</ref>. </p>
<p>At 4:30AM local time (01:30 GMT), two truck bombs exploded in Khaznah, a village near <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosul">Mosul</ref>, the capital of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninawa%20Governorate">Ninawa Governorate</ref>. The village is <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia%20Islam">Shia</ref> dominated in a predominantly <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunni%20Islam">Sunni</ref> area. These bombs killed at least 28, wounded 130, and were so powerful that 30 houses were destroyed.</p>
<p>Later a sequence of bombs exploded in the capital <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad">Baghdad</ref> targeting, amongst others, construction workers and labourers gathering to find work. The current attacks are the most serious since American troops withdrew from Iraqi cities in late June and a lull in violence in July.</p>

<p>Japanese pop star <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noriko%20Sakai">Noriko Sakai</ref> was arrested on Saturday when she turned herself in after being missing since Monday. Sakai was reported missing by her mother in law after the arrest of her husband for the possession of illegal <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulant">stimulants</ref>. <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo%20Metropolitan%20Police%20Department">Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department</ref> investigators are reported to believe that Sakai did not plan her disappearance, but panicked over the media coverage that followed the authorities request for her to report to the police.</p>
<p>It had been feared that Sakai, who rose to fame as a teenage singer and actress, had <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide">harmed</ref> herself.</p>

<head id="Baby_P_killers_to_be_named_and_then_allowed_to_disappear">Baby P killers to be named and then allowed to disappear</head>
<p>Following the expiry of an <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal%20Evidence%20(Witness%20Anonymity)%20Act%202008">anonymity order</ref> the identity of the killers of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death%20of%20Baby%20P">Baby P</ref> can now be named by the British <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old%20media">mainstream media</ref>. Following the notoriety of the case in which Baby P was seen to have been failed by the authorities, a judge ordered that none of the three be named to protect Baby P's four siblings. However a weakness of the anonymity order was that the identities of the three could be found by anyone who searched for it online.</p>
<p>The nature of Baby P's death has led to fears for the safety of the three, and it is likely that they will be given new identities once they have served their sentences and then be allowed to disappear from the public gaze.</p>

<p>About a 1000 delegates from 180 countries are meeting in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonn">Bonn</ref>, Germany for a third round of climate talks. The talks are to negotiate the text of a protocol to succeed <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto%20Protocol">Kyoto</ref> which will be presented to the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United%20Nations%20Climate%20Change%20Conference%202009">Copenhagen Conference</ref> later this year. </p>
<p>Speaking at an other conference in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul">Seoul</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South%20Korea">South Korea</ref> UN Secretary-General <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ban%20Ki-moon">Ban Ki-moon</ref> said "If we fail to act, climate change will intensify droughts, floods and other natural disasters... Malnutrition will engulf large parts of the developing world. Tensions will worsen. Social unrest -- even violence -- could follow" </p>
<p>The United States <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global%20warming%20controversy">climate change sceptics</ref> under the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency%20of%20George%20W.%20Bush">Bush administration</ref> has now accepted the urgency of a cut in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse%20gas">greenhouse gases</ref>. However US demands to tie its own cuts to cuts by developing nations especially <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China">China</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India">India</ref> has been met with derision. "...to describe this country as a large emitter is absurd - there's no other word for it." said Chandrashekhar Dasgupta the chief Indian negotiator, pointing out that half the rural population does not have even a light bulb or gas ring.</p>
<p>The current talks are described as being informal, and are aimed at smoothing the progress of the Copenhagen round.</p>
