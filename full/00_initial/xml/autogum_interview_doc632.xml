<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN (Joseph Ford)</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">Does Molossia have its own flag, currency or national anthem?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">President Baugh:</hi>  Absolutely, what would a country be without those things? Our flag has three horizontal stripes, blue, white and green (from the top). The blue stands for the Molossian sky, almost always blue, the white stands for the nearby mountains, white with snow much of the year, and the green stands for the green of the desert foliage in the spring. It flies every day in front of Government House.</p>
<p>Our currency is the Valora, and comes in both paper and coin formats, the latter being poker chips, instead of traditional coins. Our national anthem is "Molossia, Nation in the Desert", with lyrics written by me and set to the Albanian national anthem. I'm sure they don't mind.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN (Joseph Ford)</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">What is the official language of Molossia?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">President Baugh:</hi> Our official language is English, but we borrow from Esperanto sometimes, such as for the name of our capital, "Espera" and our money the Valora. We have no problem borrowing from other languages, as well, and we also use the Deseret Alphabet as an alternate writing script.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN (Joseph Ford)</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">What is the governmental structure of Molossia?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">President Baugh:</hi> Well, officially, Molossia is a republic, complete with a constitution. Sadly, things are in such disarray over the border from us, that I had no choice but to suspend the constitution and declare martial law. It's unfortunate, but the security of my nation is paramount, and the best way to ensure that is to rule by decree. So far, no one has complained, and anyway, I'm a rather benevolent dictator.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN (Joseph Ford)</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">Does Molossia have its own military?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">President Baugh:</hi> Yes, we do, the mighty Molossian Navy. Yes, we have a Navy in the desert. Our Navy has been involved in several exploration expeditions during its three years of existence. We are quite proud of our Navy.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN (Joseph Ford)</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">The Molossian Navy has their own academy, which is open for all to join online. Tell us about that.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">President Baugh:</hi> Indeed, I opened the Naval Academy several years ago as the Molossian Military Academy, taking advantage of my strong military background. When I founded the Molossian Navy, it was natural to turn the Military Academy into and Naval Academy.  In the years before and since, the Academy has produced dozens of graduates. The Academy is free to all applicants, and includes lessons and tests on military leadership, tactics, seamanship and naval battles. Once an individual has taken all four tests successfully, he or she can purchase a certificate of completion, and can then purchase on honorary commission in the Molossian Navy. We offer honorary commissions in the rank of captain, commodore and admiral.</p>
