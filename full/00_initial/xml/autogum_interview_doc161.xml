<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">You say on your website that you are working on an idea for a new show. Can you tell us a bit more about that?</hi></p>
<p>Theres not much I can say about doing a new show apart from the fact that whatever I did I would insist on retaining my integrity. My shows have all been optimistic and upbeat which I would have thought the essential ingredients of any TV to take us through a recession. Don't think I could do the nasty vote -the -others off type show. I certainly wouldn't be happy adhering to the clicheed scripts so many celebs seem happy to stick to and you will never see Rico Daniels wearing a frock on the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul%20O%20Grady">Paul O Grady</ref> show. Seems a step too low for a bit of cash.</p>

<hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">When you go out looking for materials, presumably you never know what you're going to find. When you look at what's available, how do you come up with a vision of what you're going to make from it?</hi></p>
<p>The best work I do grows over time. I have hundreds of galvanised boxes full of "components". I like assembling the elements of a build to be like a piece of art. TV demands a faster pace than I normally like which was fun though at some point I would like people to see what can really be created with a bit of care and careful planning. </p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">You are also into a bit of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/axe%20throwing">axe throwing</ref>, I understand. Do you ever do this competitively?</hi></p>
<p>My axe throwing which has been more implied than seen was something that I started doing at "western" camps in <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Germany">Germany</ref>. It was organised as a competition there hitting a range of targets on marked posts. I use it now as a way of letting off steam. I also throw circular saw blades usually at a target I call WMD Tony. Chills you right out.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">As you rightly mentioned when you announced your new show concept, it is very hard to get a hold of money these days in any sizable amount - people are holding on to it. What effect has this got on salvaging - will it encourage it as people look for alternatives, or will the supply of cheap materials be decreased?</hi></p>
<p>I have always found an increase in the amount of stuff available in a recession. A lot more people turn to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do%20it%20yourself">DIY</ref>, ripping out salvageable stuff that a man such as myself could use. I have seen tons of good gear as Ive been going round London over the last fortnight. It broke my heart to leave it in the skips.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">((</hi><hi rend="bold">WN</hi><hi rend="bold">))</hi> <hi rend="bold">Between writing for Brit Chopper magazine and customizing your jeep, you clearly enjoy the open road. What do you look for in a vehicle? Given the chance to have any one ride you wanted, what would you be driving?</hi></p>
