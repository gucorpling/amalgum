<p><hi rend="bold">Henry Wemyss</hi> (died 1541) was a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prelate">prelate</ref> from the 16th century <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Scotland">Kingdom of Scotland</ref>. He appears in the sources in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishopric_of_Galloway">bishopric of Galloway</ref> for the first time in 1517, and rose to become <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Galloway">Bishop of Galloway</ref> in 1526, a position he held until his death in 1541.</p>
<head>Biography</head>
<head>Origin</head>
<p>He was said to have been the son of John Wemyss, fifth son of Sir John Wemyss of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wemyss_Castle">Wemyss</ref>, by a daughter of Sir John Arnot of Arnot (in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fife">Fife</ref>); if true, this would make him a relative of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Arnot">David Arnot</ref>, sometime <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Galloway">Bishop of Galloway</ref> who resigned that bishopric in Wemyss' favour;<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-1">[1]</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Keith_(historian)">Robert Keith</ref> thought he may have been related to King <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_V_of_Scotland">James V</ref>, as a brother,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-2">[2]</ref> but this was a mistake based on textual misreading (mispunctuating) which resulted in Henry's name being confused with that of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Stewart,_Earl_of_Moray">James Stewart, Earl of Moray</ref>, the King's actual brother.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-3">[3]</ref></p>
<head>Earlier career</head>
<p>Henry is found as the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official">Official</ref> of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_of_Galloway">diocese of Galloway</ref> on 8 February 1517, and again on 16 January 1522; the last known holder of this position occurred on 12 March 1512, so that Henry must have taken this position at some point between 1512 and 1517.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-4">[4]</ref> Henry was <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parson">parson</ref> of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parish_church">parish church</ref> of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auchterderran">Auchterderran</ref> (<hi rend="italic">Outherdekan</hi>), Fife, in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_of_St_Andrews">diocese of St Andrews</ref>, and is found to be <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archdeacon_of_Galloway">Archdeacon of Galloway</ref> on 9 December 1522; like his position as Official, it not known when he ascended the archdeaconry, and the last occurrence of a predecessor occurs on 9 November 1513.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-5">[5]</ref></p>

<p>Henry Wemyss received provision to the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishopric_of_Galloway">bishopric of Galloway</ref> (with the position of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_(religion)">Dean</ref> of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapel_Royal">Chapel Royal</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling">Stirling</ref>) when David Arnot resigned his bishopric on 23/4 January 1526; Arnot retained right of return upon any future vacancy and half of the revenue of the diocese.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-6">[6]</ref> Although Arnot also resigned his position as <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commendator_of_Tongland">Commendator of Tongland</ref> for, once again, a lifelong pension and with right of return on vacancy, Arnot may have effectively held on to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongland_Abbey">Tongland Abbey</ref> for a few more years; repeated crown nominations of Wemyss to Tongland failed, apparently because of Arnot, while William Stewart, a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(priest)">canon</ref> of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_Cathedral">Glasgow Cathedral</ref>, also got crown nomination until the Pope finally agreed to give Bishop Henry Wemyss <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongland_Abbey">Tongland Abbey</ref> <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_commendam">in commendam</ref></hi> in 1530, with Stewart resigning his rights.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-7">[7]</ref></p>
<p>The commend of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dundrennan_Abbey">Dundrennan Abbey</ref> came into Wemyss' possession after a crown nomination on 11 December 1529, to which he was admitted on 24 April 1530.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-8">[8]</ref> Henry also retained the Archdeaconry of Galloway after becoming bishop, at least until he resigned the position to Patrick Arnot on 11 February 1531.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-9">[9]</ref> Bishop Wemyss was a frequent attender of parliament, and his name occurs frequently as a witness to charters under the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Seal_of_Scotland">Great Seal of Scotland</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Dowden-373-10">[10]</ref> He appeared for the last time in the latter capacity on 14 March 1541.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Dowden-373-10">[10]</ref> He died soon after this date, and was certainly dead by 21 May.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-11">[11]</ref> On 25 May, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Durie">Andrew Durie</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbot_of_Melrose">Abbot of Melrose</ref>, was put in charge of the vacant temporalities of Galloway and Tongland; Durie indeed succeeded Wemyss to these positions later in the year.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-12">[12]</ref></p>
