<head>Life</head>
<p>Pietro Coppo was born in Venice and studied with <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Antonius_Coccius_Sabellicus">Marcus Antonius Coccius Sabellicus</ref>. He was also deeply influenced by the <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_History_(Pliny)">Natural History</ref></hi> by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliny_the_Elder">Pliny</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-1">[1]</ref> After a number of voyages across <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy">Italy</ref> and the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea">Mediterranean</ref> and a period of six years he spent on <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crete">Crete</ref>,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Kljajic-2">[2]</ref> in 1499 he moved to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izola">Izola</ref> due to his work duties as a municipal scribe, where he married Colotta di Ugo from a rich Izola family. He was active in the public life of the town, where he worked as a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notary">notary</ref>, and also represented it on several occasions before the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doge_of_Venice">Doge of Venice</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Primorci-3">[3]</ref></p>
<head>Works</head>
<head>De toto orbe</head>
<p>Coppo's major work was the description, accompanied by an <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas">atlas</ref> of 22 maps, of the entire known world, titled <hi rend="italic">De toto orbe</hi>. It was written in four volumes from 1518 until 1520 and also included the outline of the coast of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas">Americas</ref>, a military secret at the time,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Primorci-3">[3]</ref> but remained unpublished.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-4">[4]</ref> The two preserved samples of the work are kept in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna">Bologna</ref> (<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblioteca_comunale_dell'Archiginnasio">Biblioteca comunale dell'Archiginnasio</ref>) and in Paris (<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliothèque_nationale_de_France">Bibliothèque nationale de France</ref>).<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-5">[5]</ref></p>
<head>De Summa totius Orbis</head>
<p>From 1524 until 1526, Coppa prepared a shortened version of <hi rend="italic">De toto orbe</hi> under the title <hi rend="italic">De Summa totius Orbis</hi>. This work contained 15 systematically arranged woodcut maps, named <hi rend="italic">Tabulae</hi> ("tables"), to be published in a book, thus representing the first "modern" <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas">atlas</ref>, though this distinction is conventionally awarded to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Ortelius">Abraham Ortelius</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Mercator-6">[6]</ref> It has been preserved in three copies, kept in Venice, Paris and Piran. Only the Piran manuscript contains the maps.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-7">[7]</ref></p>
<head>Portolano</head>
<p>In 1528, he published the work <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portolano_(Coppo)">Portolano</ref></hi>, one of the first <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutter_(nautical)">rutters</ref> in the world. Although not preserved in entirety (probably due to frequent usage), its copies have been preserved in Piran, Parish and London (the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Museum">British Museum</ref>).<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Kljajic-2">[2]</ref></p>
<head>Del sito de l'Istria</head>
<p>In his description of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istria">Istria</ref> (<hi lang="it" rend="italic">Del sito de l'Istria</hi>; 1529, published in 1540, Venice), he published the first geographic description and a copy of the first regional map of Istria, produced in 1525 and already included in <hi rend="italic">De Summa totius Orbis</hi>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Kljajic-2">[2]</ref> Its copy inscribed in stone can now be seen in the Pietro Coppo Park in the center of the town of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izola">Izola</ref> in southwestern <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia">Slovenia</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-8">[8]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Kljajic-2">[2]</ref></p>
<head>Piran Codex</head>
<p>Two manuscripts of <hi rend="italic">De Summa totius Orbis</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Portolano</hi>, bound in a single text-block, together with printed woodcut maps, are kept in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergej_Mašera_Maritime_Museum">Sergej Mašera Maritime Museum</ref> in Piran. This is probably the most precious cartographic work kept in Slovenia and considered world-class cultural heritage. It is unique primarily because unlike other preserved Coppa's works, it contains 15 colorized systematically arranged woodcut maps.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-9">[9]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Mercator-6">[6]</ref></p>
