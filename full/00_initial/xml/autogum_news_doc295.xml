<p><ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Colombia">Colombia</ref> was faced with a nationwide electricity outage at 10:15 a.m. local time today. Traffic chaos and people trapped in elevators has been reported. Hospitals and airports continued operations, using their own backup generators.</p>
<p>Speaking on local radio, President <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvaro%20Uribe">Alvaro Uribe</ref> said, "It appears to have affected all of the country."</p>
<p>"The blackout was caused by a failure at an energy substation in northern Bogota. We do not know what type of failure it was," Manuel Maiguashca, vice minister of energy and mines, told reporters. Speculation that the outage was caused by left wing rebels was dismissed by officials.</p>
