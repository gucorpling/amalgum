<head>Early life and education</head>
<p>Miller studied <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry">Chemistry</ref> at the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Strathclyde">University of Strathclyde</ref> and graduated in 1997.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-:0-2">[2]</ref> She was an undergraduate exchange student at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_&amp;_Marshall_College">Franklin &amp; Marshall College</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-:0-2">[2]</ref> Miller joined <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durham_University">Durham University</ref> as a post graduate student, earning a PhD in 2000 under the supervision of Randal Richards.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-:0-2">[2]</ref> Miller worked on <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft_copolymer">graft copolymers</ref>, which included <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynorbornene">polynorbornene</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly(ethylene_oxide)">poly(ethylene oxide)</ref>, and studied their organisation at air-water interfaces.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-fphd-1">[1]</ref> After completing her doctorate, Miller moved to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hall_College">New Hall College</ref> at the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge">University of Cambridge</ref>, where she was appointed a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junior_Research_Fellow">Junior Research Fellow</ref> and she worked with <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athene_Donald">Athene Donald</ref> on <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellulose">cellulose</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-:1-3">[3]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-4">[4]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-5">[5]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-6">[6]</ref> She was inspired to have a career in research during this fellowship.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-7">[7]</ref></p>
<head>Research and career</head>
<p>Miller joined the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Manchester_Institute_of_Science_and_Technology">University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology</ref> (UMIST) in 2002.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-:2-8">[8]</ref> She was made a full Professor in 2014.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-:0-2">[2]</ref> She continued to investigate the behaviour of molecules at different interfaces, including the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air-liquid_interface_cell_culture">air-liquid</ref> and liquid-liquid interface. <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfactant">Surfactants</ref> and polymers can be used to promote or inhibit the crystallisation of small molecules, for example the use of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxy_group">hydroxyl</ref> based polymers in the crystallisation of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_cream">ice cream</ref>. To mimic how fish use macromolecules to stop their blood freezing, Miller combines <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifreeze">antifreeze</ref> proteins with ice crystals.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-:2-8">[8]</ref> In 2004 Miller established the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Manchester">University of Manchester</ref> Polymers &amp; Peptides Research Group.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-:1-3">[3]</ref> Here she works on the characterisation of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer">polymer</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopolymer">biopolymer</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide">peptides</ref>, using <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_scattering">neutron</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_scattering_techniques">x-ray scattering</ref>. The in-depth characterisation of these materials allows Miller to tailor them for specific applications.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-:2-8">[8]</ref></p>
<p>Miller also works in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomedical_engineering">biomedical engineering</ref>, creating <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space">three-dimensional</ref> scaffolds through the control of proteins and peptides.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-:2-8">[8]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-9">[9]</ref> She explores the relationship between <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoscopic_physics">mesoscopic</ref> structure, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materials_property">material properties</ref> and cell response.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-10">[10]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-11">[11]</ref> She has studied how proteins self-assemble, including what causes them to unfold and form fibril structures.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-12">[12]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-13">[13]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-14">[14]</ref> The morphology (<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_roughness">roughness</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porosity">porosity</ref>) and mechanical properties (such as <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young's_modulus">Young's modulus</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscosity">viscosity</ref>) can be controlled through self-assembly.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-:1-3">[3]</ref> The self-assembling peptides can be conjugated with polymers that are sensitive to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH">pH</ref> and temperature. Through the synthesis of short peptides with various <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid">amino acid sequences</ref> the Miller group are studying the self-assembly of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_sheet">Beta sheets</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-15">[15]</ref>  She has developed a biocompatible, biodegradable <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart">cardiac</ref> patch, created from a thick porous scaffold coated with a material that mimics the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_matrix">extracellular matrix</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-16">[16]</ref> She also studies the degradation mechanism of these materials.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-17">[17]</ref></p>
<p>Miller was awarded a small grant from the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Manchester">University of Manchester</ref> to develop the synthesis of peptide-based hydrogels.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-18">[18]</ref> The synthetic peptide hydrogels were so successful that she set up the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-out">spin-out</ref> company <hi rend="italic">PeptiGelDesign</hi>, a group which worked to commercialise <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogel">hydrogel</ref> technologies.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-:3-19">[19]</ref> Since 2008 <hi rend="italic">PeptiGelDesig</hi>n have raised over £6 million in funding.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-:3-19">[19]</ref> Recognising the reach and potential of <hi rend="italic">PeptiGelDesign,</hi> the company relaunched as <hi rend="italic">Manchester BIOGEL</hi> in 2018, continuing to offer peptide-based hydrogels amongst other biomaterials.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-:4-20">[20]</ref> The hydrogels can be used to improve the quality of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_toxicity">drug toxicity</ref> testing, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA">DNA</ref> sensing and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regenerative_medicine">regenerative medicine</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-:4-20">[20]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-21">[21]</ref></p>
