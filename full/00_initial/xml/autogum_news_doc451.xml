<head>Thousands march in anti-Brexit protest, London</head>
<p><hi rend="bold">Thursday, March 28, 2019</hi></p>
<p>Estimates by event organizers indicate roughly one million people marched in <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/London">London</ref> on Saturday during an anti-<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Brexit">Brexit</ref> ("British exit") march, protesting the pending exit of the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_Kingdom">United Kingdom</ref> from the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/European_Union">European Union</ref> (EU).</p>
<p>Protesters, carrying placards asking the government to revoke <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article%2050">Article 50</ref> — the EU treaty clause invoked by Brexit — and <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/European_Union">European Union</ref> flags, marched from <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyde%20Park%20Corner">Hyde Park Corner</ref> to Parliament. The mayor of London, <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Sadiq_Khan">Sadiq Khan</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Twitter">tweeted</ref>, "Here in London, thousands of people from across our city and country have come together with @peoplesvote-uk to send a clear message: Enough is enough - it's time to give the British public the final say on Brexit."</p>
<p>There were several speakers at the rally, including First Minister of <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Scotland">Scotland</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Nicola_Sturgeon">Nicola Sturgeon</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)">Labour</ref> MP (<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/UK_House_of_Commons">Member of Parliament</ref>) <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom%20Watson">Tom Watson</ref>, and Sadiq Khan. Tom Watson called Prime Minister <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Theresa_May">Theresa May</ref>'s proposed Brexit deal "lousy" and said he would only vote for it if the British people could also vote for or against it. Nicola Sturgeon said it was "the moment of maximum opportunity" for stopping a no-deal Brexit.</p>
<p>Some of the protesters <hi rend="italic">Wikinews</hi> interviewed said they had gone to "defend [their] children's right to live and work in Europe" and "secure [their own] right to work in the EU". One interviewee said people changed their minds and several said they wanted the politicians to stop ignoring them.</p>
<p>Not everyone agreed there should be another referendum. One MP told the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/BBC">BBC</ref>, "We know that 16 million people wanted to stay in the EU, and some of those would still like to stay in the EU, and within that quite a few would like to have another go and have another referendum — but it was always a minority".</p>
<p>In 2016, the United Kingdom held a referendum on whether to remain part of the European union, which it joined in 1973. About 52% of participating voters voted to leave and 48% to stay.</p>
