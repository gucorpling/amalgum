<head>A video on "Tapping" - A method that can be used to relieve anxiety, depression and trauma</head>

<p>I was taught this method a while back, it can be useful and what's great about it is it can also be used in just a few minutes. The concept is that it helps disrupt neural patterning, thoughts and feelings associated with trauma, anxiety, fear, depression. You may be able to find a therapist in your area who teaches it through a search of "psychotherapy tapping" and the name of your town. I just watched these two video showing people being taught tapping, one is a woman dealing with deep grief over the loss of a loved one - it was powerful, you could hear her voice change as she progressed and see her so much lighter at the end. NOT telling people to do it, NOT saying it's for everyone. But I think understanding that the brain actually gets in loops and that there are a variety of techniques to help "re-boot" those neural patterns is helpful. There's lots of other ways too - mediation, breath work, visualizations, even certain music and probably a dozen more. <ref target="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INZ5VdRQ10s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INZ5VdRQ10s</ref> <ref target="https://www.thetappingsolution.com/what-is-eft-tapping/">https://www.thetappingsolution.com/what-is-eft-tapping/</ref></p>

<p>Hi. I've studied and practiced hypnosis for over 30 years. Maybe I can give some insight. Read Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers , The Body Keeps the Score or any current research on mind body connection. Look up online the ACT test. Just a few simple questions and learn how adverse childhood experiences can effect your health later in life. Unresolved stress and trapped emotions can have a huge impact on your health. As for tapping, I looked into it. Tapping has nothing to do with energy meridians. That is a crock. The physical act of tapping will tie up the conscious mind and allow things to come out of the unconscious. But knowing where a problem comes from does not deal with the problem. Tapping when it was originally invented ended with a NLP technique where a hand was moved randomly in front of the eyes while the memory of what is causing the problem was kept in the mind. This was fairly effective. This ending to the tapping sequence became known as Rapid Eye Movement Desensitization therapy. When it became recognized as a therapy that had some effectiveness with PTSD it came under control of licensed psychologists. For an unlicensed person to do this now would be considered practising medicine without a license. It was removed from the tapping sequence thereby rendering tapping ineffective. </p>
