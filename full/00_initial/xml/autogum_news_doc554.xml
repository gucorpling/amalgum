<p>Roughly 300 protesters turned up yesterday for the return of <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Nigel_Farage">Nigel Farage</ref>, leader of the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/UK_Independence_Party">UK Independence Party</ref>, to <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Edinburgh">Edinburgh</ref> after last year's disastrous attempt at a press conference in a pub at the foot of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Canongate">The Canongate</ref>. Unseen by protesters or public, Farage is believed to have left the venue around 7:30pm.</p>
<p>Farage's last visit saw protesters leaving him <ref target="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/barracked">barracked</ref> in the bar by police, with several taxis refusing to take the party leader and <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Member_of_the_European_Parliament">Member of the European Parliament</ref> (MEP) for <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South%20East%20England%20(European%20Parliament%20constituency)">South East England</ref> to the airport.</p>

<p>Given the hostile reception on his last visit, far-right group <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britain%20First">Britain First</ref> garnered publicity earlier in the week with an apparent offer of "armoured vehicles" for Farage's visit. However, no support from ex-<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/British_National_Party">BNP</ref> councillor Paul Golding's political party, or the offered armoured vehicles, were in-evidence.</p>
<p>Despite attempts to keep the location secret, the Radical Independence Campaign began calling for protesters to turn up on Friday, at the city's <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh%20Corn%20Exchange">Corn Exchange</ref>, nearly a week before the event. Farage was already believed to be inside the building when <hi rend="italic">Wikinews</hi> arrived shortly after 4:30pm. At that time, five <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite%20truck">satellite trucks</ref> were present and New Market Road, running past the venue, was still open to traffic.</p>

 <figure><caption>Several speakers addressed the crowd from a 'scrum' immediately in-front of the building Image: <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Brian_McNeil">Brian McNeil</ref>.</caption></figure>
<p>Protesters began arriving en-masse closer to 5:30pm, with numbers peaking around an hour later. Police vans were moved to block the road; although, traffic to the venue was still being permitted for a wedding party with the misfortune to pick the same date as Farage's only visit to <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Scotland">Scotland</ref> during the current European Parliament election campaign.</p>
<p>Several speakers addressed the crowd protesting against UKIP being in Scotland, with the actual number of UKIP attendees inside, to hear Farage speak, estimated at around 50. One speaker, a schoolteacher, challenged the mainstream media's acceptance of UKIP's assertion the party is not racist, stating her primary school pupils were more-capable of identifying racism and would be pointing its presence out within UKIP were they present.</p>
<p>Although loud, the protest passed peacefully. Chants directed at UKIP included "Whose streets? Our streets! Whose city? Our city!", "Say it loud, say it clear: Refugees are welcome here!" Other taunts called UKIP "scum", urged people to "smash the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish%20Defence%20League">SDL</ref>" (<hi rend="italic">Scottish Defence League</hi>), and clearly labelled UKIP and its supporters as racist.</p>
