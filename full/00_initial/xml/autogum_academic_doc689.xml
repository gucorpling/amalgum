<head> 1. Introduction</head>
<p>
The answers for questions concerning social justice in collaborative or cooperative forms of education can be defined as largely untested and often self-referential. The core to these claims is the rhetoric that the networked nature of such practices can provide equal opportunities for all individuals to freely and openly share their ideas and participate in group activities (see, for example,). The research reporting on empirical data, such as studies illustrating the variety of identities among participants (e.g.,) or comparing the number of contributions across different cohorts of students (e.g.,), can provide only tangential support for these idealistic propositions. This potential for more egalitarian or democratic forms of engagements among people is accepted to be somehow actualised naturally within collaborative or cooperative forms of learning. This assumption is problematic because researchers in the field of education continue employing frameworks that cannot reflect the nuanced ways in which complexly interwoven forms of identifications (such as class, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and gender) operate to produce differentiated experiences across cohorts of students. There is an urgent need for a theoretical framework that does not limit equity with access or participation but focuses on the otherwise hidden ways in which group work can yield suboptimal outcomes. If networked learning is becoming more diverse and widened, research should critically examine the extent to which these claims can be substantiated in practice.  </p>

<p>This article aims to expand the current understandings of social justice in networked learning practices by challenging the ways in which being is conceptualised in communal settings. In specific, it provides a theoretical lens for going beyond a wide-spread speculation that networked learning practices inherently provide equal opportunities to participate, a speculation that has long hindered the development of critical frameworks and approaches in the theory of networked learning. By problematising the engagements, relations and connections among people in networked spaces, this article aims to generate a new research agenda in networked learning concerning social justice. </p>

<p>This, however, requires clarification of what networked learning is and how social justice is conceptualised before proceeding further with the conceptual analysis. Networked learning is an umbrella term for pedagogical approaches or applications where technology is utilised to connect learners, tutor(s), and resources to form a learning network. In networked learning, knowledge is distributed through and mediated by the participants of a community. Accordingly, learning is not an individual pursuit but a collective effort. It is a matter of engagement with others in a community. As a value-laden term, the concept of justice is a contextual decision about what is right or fair. At this point, it should be asserted that the difference between justice and equality (since, as it is argued above, research tends to employ the concept of equality when making claims on social justice). Equality refers to an arbitrary point of equilibrium: It is quantitative sameness or evenness. Justice, on the other hand, is a qualitative judgement on fairness. To determine what is socially just, therefore, is not limited with concerns whether there is an actual or perceived equality in a given situation, but includes judgements on whether the given situation is fair or not. </p>

<p>It is argued that if social justice is a concept that requires qualitative judgements about a given situation rather than quantified measurements, regressing or accumulating individuals and their experiences into measurable categories cannot account for the uniqueness of each individual neither can it explain how cultural differences play a role in networked learning activities. To understand how subjectivities are constructed, managed and negotiated within a community is needed.  </p>

<p>In what follows, one such framework is discussed in online education with respect to the principles of networked learning. First, the focus is needed on online selves to better understand the relation of identification to learning in networked spaces. Then, the current conceptualisations of being in online spaces are explored and the need for the concept of social absence is argued. Lastly, a discussion is made that the mediated experience in online spaces should be conceptualised in tandem with one’s social presence and social absence if online education is to be studied more rigorously and if claims of equity and justice are to be made in networked learning. </p>
