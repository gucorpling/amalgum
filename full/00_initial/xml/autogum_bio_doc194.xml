<head>Tan Khoen Swie</head>
This is a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_name">Chinese name</ref>; the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_surname">family name</ref> is <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chen_(surname)">Tan</ref>.
<p><hi rend="bold">Tan Khoen Swie</hi> (<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters">Chinese</ref>:陳坤瑞; <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin">pinyin</ref>:<hi rend="italic">Chén Kūnruì</hi>; 1883/1894–1953) was a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Indonesian">Chinese Indonesian</ref> publisher who, through the Tan Khoen Swie Publishing Company, published numerous books in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javanese_language">Javanese</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malay_language">Malay</ref>.</p>
<p>Born in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonogiri">Wonogiri</ref>, Tan took an early interest in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javanese_culture">Javanese culture</ref>, studying under Mas Ngabehi Mangoenwidjaja of Wonigiri and at the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunanate_of_Surakarta">Sunanate of Surakarta</ref>. After spending time at a Chinese publishing house in Surakarta, he moved to Kediri and established his own company, publishing at least 279 works, written by a variety of authors and on a wide range of subjects, before his death. Though his son continued the Tan Khoen Swie Publishing Company, it closed soon afterwards. </p>
<head>Early life</head>
<p>Tan was born in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonogiri">Wonogiri</ref>, then part of the Residency of Surakarta. Sources disagree as to the year of his birth. The newspaper <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kompas">Kompas</ref></hi> and the writers Sam Setyautama and Suma Mihardja give 1883,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTESawega2002-1">[1]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTESetyautamaMihardja2008363-2">[2]</ref> while the sinologist <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Suryadinata">Leo Suryadinata</ref> gives 1894.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTESuryadinata1995172-3">[3]</ref> As a child, Tan was interested in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javanese_culture">Javanese culture</ref>, and he would often visit the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunanate_of_Surakarta">palace</ref> in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surakarta">Surakarta</ref>. He also studied locally, under Mas Ngabehi Mangoenwidjaja.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTESuryadinata1995172-3">[3]</ref></p>
<p>While still in his youth, Tan moved to Surakarta and began working at the Sie Dhien publishing house.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTESuryadinata1995172-3">[3]</ref> He would later marry Lie Gien Nio; the couple had three children.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTESawega2002-1">[1]</ref> Tan maintained a personal appearance which was commonly remarked upon. Suryadinata likens Tan's long hair and moustache to those of a "modern day <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippie">hippie</ref>",<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTESuryadinata1995172-3">[3]</ref> while Ardus M. Sawega of <hi rend="italic">Kompas</hi> suggests that this hairstyle was intended as a form of resistance against the Dutch colonial government.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTESawega2002-1">[1]</ref></p>
<head>Publishing</head>
<p>Tan later moved to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kediri_Regency">Kediri</ref>, in eastern Java, and established his own company, the Boekhandel Tan Khoen Swie (Tan Khoen Swie Publishing Company).<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTESetyautamaMihardja2008363-2">[2]</ref> Through his company, Tan published works by a variety of writers, including <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranggawarsita">Ranggawarsita</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangkunegara_IV">Mangkunegara IV</ref>, Ki Padmosusastro, and Yosodipuro. Authors would often come to Kediri from their hometowns—some from as far away as <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cilacap">Cilacap</ref>—to meet their publisher. Tan would also publish books under his own name, though in a 2002 interview his great-grandson suggested that he did not write these works, but compiled text from a variety of anonymous sources.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTESawega2002-1">[1]</ref></p>
<p>Every year Tan would release a catalogue of his recent publications;<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTESuryadinata1995172-3">[3]</ref> Setyautama and Mihardja write that at least 279 books were released through the company. Tan's publications covered a wide variety of subject matter, including <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayang">wayang</ref></hi>, law, theology, philosophy, and agriculture. The works, which were generally not thick, were written in either Javanese or Malay.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTESawega2002-1">[1]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTESuryadinata1995172-3">[3]</ref></p>
<p>Tan's publications, which were outside of the colonial-government run <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balai_Pustaka">Balai Pustaka</ref> network, introduced the works of authors to wider audiences than possible in the traditional method of hand-copying manuscripts. Though printed publications in Javanese had been around since the mid-19th century, such works had remained relatively uncommon in Java, and the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javanese_language">Javanese language</ref> was still undergoing the transition from <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_literature">oral literature</ref> to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Written_literature">written literature</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTESawega2002-1">[1]</ref></p>

<head>Later life and death</head>
<p>Aside from publishing, Tan was active in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulcanization">vulcanization</ref> of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunlop_Tyres">Dunlop</ref>-brand tyres and owned the Soerabaia <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convenience_store">mini-market</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTESawega2002-1">[1]</ref> Among the Chinese community of Kediri, he was involved with the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiong_Hoa_Hwe_Koan">Tiong Hoa Hwe Koan</ref> and Hoa Chiao Tsing Nien Hui, and served as a teacher at the Hoe Lie Hiap Hwee school for girls.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTESetyautamaMihardja2008363-2">[2]</ref> Tan was also known as a mystic, constructing a cave in his yard for meditation.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTESuryadinata1995172-3">[3]</ref></p>
<p>Tan died in 1953; though his son Michael Tanzil (Tan Bian Liong) continued the publishing company, it folded soon after. Tan's family continued to live in the house in Kediri, located at 165 Dhoho street, into the 2000s.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTESawega2002-1">[1]</ref></p>
<head>Legacy</head>
<p>Sawega wrote that Tan's name remained inexorably linked with the popular literature of early 20th century Indonesia. However, owing to a lack of documentation of his publications, in 2002 the Kediri city government organized a team to research Tan's oeuvre and his life. A spokesman for the team stated that they intended to make Tan's former residence into a tourist attraction.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTESawega2002-1">[1]</ref></p>
