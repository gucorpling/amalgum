<head> 1. Introduction</head>
<p>
Zinc oxide has been applied in many fields; including gas sensors, photodiodes, lithium-ion batteries and particularly solar cells. ZnO can be easily fabricated into various morphologies (e.g., nanowires, nanorods, nanotubes, nanoflowers, nanosheets) on different substrates. Therefore, ZnO in different shapes and in composites is studied for various applications. Recently, some authors combined ZnO in heterostructure with CdS and studied its photocatalytic properties. ZnO in the form of thin film with CdS nanoparticles on the surface has been shown to be a high-performance material for photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue, while ZnO/CdS hierarchical composites have shown great photocatalytic H2-production performance. Wu et al. prepared ZnO hollow spheres and the hedgehog-like ZnO hollow spheres and studied their use as anodes for lithium-ion batteries, having good rate capacity, cycling performance, and high initial specific capacity. ZnO nanowires have prominent electron transport properties, which are beneficial for solar cell application. However, ZnO is not chemically stable and is prone to dissolution. One way to avoid this fact is to coat a chemically stable shell on ZnO nanowires. </p>

<p>On the other hand, nanostructured titanium dioxide is known as a material with notable physical and chemical properties, such as high photo-activity and environmental stability, as well as low cost synthesis. TiO2 exists in nature in three different crystalline phases: anatase, rutile, and brookite, but it was found that anatase (band gap ~3.2 eV) is more photo-active than other modifications. It is widely used for photovoltaic applications, primarily as an electron transport layer (ETL) in perovskite and dye sensitized solar cells, due to a suitable band gap for the acceptance of electrons from the active layer of solar cells. The studies aimed to improve the optical and transport properties of TiO2-based electron conduction layers, which are of considerable importance for the enhancement of photovoltaic performance. By a combination of the high reactivity of TiO2 and the large binding energy of ZnO, the process of electron transfer between the corresponding conduction and valence bands can be facilitated in the composite system. </p>

<p>In comparison to mesoporous thin films on transparent conductive oxide (TCO) operated as ETL in solar cells, 1-dimensional (1D) nanostructures on TCO substrates can provide a direct pathway for electron transport and offer open channels for filling with light absorbers and HTMs for solar cells. Moreover, oriented nanorod-like materials on TCO are known for their efficient charge separation and transport properties and are thus favorable for achieving good device performance. Therefore, growth of oriented nanorods (NRs) on TCO substrates has drawn extensive research interest in solar energy utilization in the past years. </p>

<p>Moreover, the utilization of the single-crystalline 1D nanostructures with preferred orientation for ETL decreases the number of grain boundaries that decrease conductivity, as was observed in studies on ZnO nanostructure. Thus, Wu et al. investigated rapidly synthesized ZnO nanowires for photodetector application and produced nanowires which consist of nanoparticles. They concluded that these nanowires have adsorption sites on the inter-granular surface, which can lead to the increased reactivity of these surfaces and, therefore, a low conductivity. Their finding is in accordance with old paper of Oktik where he stated that a large density of extrinsic electron traps, present at the grain boundaries due to oxygen chemisorption, results in a barrier to charge-carrier conduction at grain boundaries. Annealing in vacuum or in reducing atmosphere desorbs the oxygen and therefore decreases the grain boundary potential barrier and increases the effective charge-carrier concentration (and therefore the conductivity). Natsume and Sakata prepared ZnO films by sol–gel spin-coating and confirmed the grain boundary scattering effect due to thermionic emission. </p>
