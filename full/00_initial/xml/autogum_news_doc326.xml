<head>Election of new 7 wonders of the world: deadline approaching</head><p><hi rend="bold">Monday, June 25, 2007</hi></p>
<p>The New Open World Foundation will announce the results of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New%20Seven%20Wonders%20of%20the%20World">New Seven Wonders of the World</ref> election on July 7, 2007 (or 07.07.07). The ballot itself will close on midnight the day before. The Foundation proposes a revision of the ancient <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven%20Wonders%20of%20the%20World">Seven Wonders of the World</ref>, of which only the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramids%20of%20Giza">Great Pyramid of Giza</ref> still exist.</p>
<p>Among the 21 candidates left over after the previous election round ended on January 1, 2006, the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acropolis">Acropolis </ref> and the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya%20civilization">Maya</ref> archeological site of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chichen%20Itza">Chichen Itza</ref> were doing well in earlier rankings. A spokeswoman for the Foundation said earlier this month that the result is wide open.</p>
<p>The election ceremony will be held in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisbon">Lisbon</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Portugal">Portugal</ref>. Hollywood actress <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilary%20Swank">Hilary Swank</ref>, British actor <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben%20Kingsley">Sir Ben Kingsley</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bollywood">Bollywood </ref> actress <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipasha%20Basu">Bipasha Basu</ref> have been announced as hosts, astronaut <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil%20Armstrong">Neil Armstrong</ref> will be present, and performers will include <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer%20Lopez">Jennifer Lopez</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaka%20Khan">Chaka Khan</ref>.</p>

<p>Some in <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/India">India</ref> fear however that the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taj%20Mahal">Taj Mahal</ref> might not make the A-list. In the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihar">Bihar </ref> town of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muzaffarpur">Muzaffarpur</ref>, sex workers are asking people to cast their vote for the monument in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agra">Agra</ref>. "We are doing it in our own small way to promote the 17th century monument of love," said prostitute Shahnaj Bano. <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughal%20Empire">Mughal</ref> Emperor <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shah%20Jahan">Shah Jahan</ref> ordered the construction of the mausoleum when his favourite wife died. People of all walks of life have joined the campaign in India: for example, hundreds of lawyers in Rajkot collectively casted their vote to support the Taj in the world wonder poll.</p>
<p>India's Tourism and Culture Minister, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambika%20Soni">Ambika Soni</ref>, previously pitched in the campaign by personally voting for the Taj Mahal, but government officials confirmed that they did not officially support the initiative of the for-profit organisation. "The campaign is not backed by any government agency, though we feel it is good and in the interest of the tourism industry as a whole to promote the Taj Mahal," declared Sudhir Kumar, the Agra chief of the Indian government's tourism department, to the Indo-Asian News Service.</p>
<p>India is not the only country trying to get a monument elected. <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Brazil">Brazil</ref>'s soccer team for example, urged Brazilians to vote for <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ%20the%20Redeemer%20(statue)">Christ Redeemer</ref>, the statue in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</ref>.</p>
<head id="Criticism_on_methods">Criticism on methods</head>
<p>The campaign started in September 1999 with a website by <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Switzerland">Swiss</ref> businessman Bernard Weber. One year later, one million votes had already been cast, and today the total number of internet, text message and telephone votes has surpassed 50 million -possibly the largest global poll ever.</p>
<p>Earlier on in the elections, promotional campaigns have been able to severely influence the top seven. An e-mail chain letter in <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Turkey">Turkey</ref> caused the nation to set the voting record in February 2002. After the site had been noticed in <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/China">China</ref>, the country took the lead in weeks, according to the Foundation website.</p>
<p>The <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_Nations">United Nations</ref> Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO">UNESCO</ref>) in a press release on July 20 reaffirmed that it has no link with the initiative, which it says would reflect "only the opinions of those with access to the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Internet">internet</ref>". The Foundation 'Campaign Milestones page' however claims that "more than 25 percent of the world's population is now aware of the N7W campaign" after the media attention around the time the final round began on January 1, 2006. UNESCO also criticized the project's lack of scientific foundation, when compared to its own World Heritage Sites selection method.</p>
