At <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_University">Cambridge University</ref> he acquired a love of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_music_of_Ireland">Irish traditional music</ref>. His admiration for <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lawes">William Lawes</ref> led him to join a group called The Medieval Players (1981–1987). In 1983 they performed <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabelais">Rabelais's</ref> "<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gargantua">Gargantua</ref>" with actors, puppets and acrobats. Their version of medieval music was gutsy, compared to most early music consorts of the time. In 1987 he became a founder member of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dufay_Collective">Dufay Collective</ref>. He was also a member of the group "Afterhours" (1989–1995).</p>
<p>In 1989 Lewin spent several months in Cairo to study <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_violin">Arabic violin</ref> under Ashraf al Sarki.

<p><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Carnival_Band_(folk_group)">The Carnival Band</ref> evolved out of The Medieval Players. The combination of Giles Lewin, Andy Watts, Bill Badley and Jub dates from 1985. They have recorded as a backing band for <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maddy_Prior">Maddy Prior</ref>. Lewin joined up with Vivien Ellis, another member of the Dufay Collective and the Carnival Band to become the duo Alva in 1997, specialising in the music of the troubadours. The songs on "The Bells of Paradise" were first performed at the 2003 <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/York_Early_Music_Festival">York Early Music Festival</ref>. Alva also performed at St John's, Smith Square in 2001 as part of a live performance for BBC's "Late Junction".
