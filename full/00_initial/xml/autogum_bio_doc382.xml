<p>In 1595, Zaldívar was appointed <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargento_mayor">Sargento mayor</ref> by his uncle, Juan de Oñate, in their colonization of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico">New Mexico</ref> for the Spanish Crown.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-chipman-2">[2]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-hickerson-3">[3]</ref> They arrived in New Mexico in 1598.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-chipman-2">[2]</ref></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Buffalo hunting.</hi> Food and resources were scarce in the young colony of New Mexico. On September 15, 1598, Zaldivar and his guide, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jusepe_Gutierrez">Jusepe Gutierrez</ref>, led a group of 60 men onto the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Plains">Great Plains</ref> to determine whether <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bison">Bison</ref>, the American buffalo, could be domesticated.  Departing from <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pecos_Pueblo">Pecos Pueblo</ref>, Zaldivar journeyed 57 leagues eastward, about 250 kilometres (160mi), probably to the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_River">Canadian River</ref> valley. There he found huge herds of buffalo.  Zaldivar and his men constructed a large corral in which they attempted to capture several thousand buffalo.  The buffalo were recalcitrant and killed three horses and wounded 40 more.  Zaldivar then captured a number of buffalo calves, but all of them quickly died.  Failing in the attempt to domesticate buffalo, Zaldivar focused instead on hunting and returned to the Spanish settlements with 80 arobas, about 1,000 kilograms (2,200lb) of buffalo fat.  He proclaimed buffalo meat superior to the beef of Spanish cows. Zaldivar and his men arrived back at the Spanish settlements on November 8, 1598.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-4">[4]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-5">[5]</ref></p>
