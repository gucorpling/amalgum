<head>Avoid BMO InvestorLine</head>
<sp who="#kgalloway1">
<p>Here is my investor beware story. I get paid partially in equity that is dual listed in the US and Canada. I opened a BMO InvestorLine account because they will allow you to sell shares in either currency without a phone call. I wanted to transfer shares into my BMO account, so I called them first to ask what to do. They gave me the address and told me to just have the shares sent there and they would show up in my account so I could sell them. Everything went well until I tried to actually sell the shares and got an error saying I couldn’t. Thinking this was weird, I called in and asked what was up. They told me I needed a form filled out and stamped by a BMO branch. No problem I thought. The branch had no idea what to do with the form, but three hours and two trips to the branch later the had faxed it in and confirmed InvestorLine had received it. Not great but at least I’d know for next time. They said they would rush process it and it wouldn’t be longer than tomorrow. They also dropped on me that I could sell the shares but couldn’t withdraw the proceeds for 2 weeks because I might be laundering money. Waited a day, still the same error. I called in again to ask what was up. They didn’t know why I couldn’t trade but asked me to email the form in this time. I did that, they confirmed they got it and said they would fix it that day and call me when it was done. I received no call back. Next day, still the same error. Called in again. Was told the previous two people didn’t know what to do and I would get a call back in 15 minutes with a fix. The person from day two calls me, and says that actually they need the original form and that everything I had been told up to then was wrong. Fax and email isn’t valid according to them. Still can’t sell, it’s going to take days for the form to make it through the mail, and I just have to hope the market doesn’t move against me. How can they get away with giving me so much incorrect info and exposing me to so much market risk as a result?!? Avoid them, they have no idea what they are doing.</p>

<p>That's brutal. I think most brokers sell on multiple exchanges so I don't think you're locked into BMO. I know that people on this sub love questtrade but I'm not sure how their customer is. </p>
