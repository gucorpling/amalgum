<p>
<hi rend="bold">George Eld</hi> (died 1624) was a London printer of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobean_era">Jacobean era</ref>, who produced important works of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Renaissance_theatre">English Renaissance drama</ref> and literature, including key texts by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Jonson">Ben Jonson</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Marlowe">Christopher Marlowe</ref>, and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Middleton">Thomas Middleton</ref>.</p>
<p>Eld was the son of a carpenter from <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derbyshire">Derbyshire</ref>. He served an eight-year apprenticeship to bookseller Robert Bolton, starting in 1592, and became a "freeman" (a full member) of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worshipful_Company_of_Stationers_and_Newspaper_Makers">Stationers Company</ref> on 13 January 1600. He established himself in his own printing business in 1604, at the sign of the White Horse in Fleet Lane, by marrying the widow of not one but two master printers.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-1">[1]</ref> His shop featured two or perhaps three presses, and four compositors – a substantial operation for the time. Eld entered into a partnership with Miles Fletcher in 1617; Fletcher took over the business after Eld died of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubonic_plague">plague</ref> in 1624.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-2">[2]</ref></p>
<head>Printer</head>
<p>In Eld's historical era, most stationers concentrated on either printing or bookselling; and most publishing was done by the booksellers, who commissioned the printers to print their works. Eld was primarily a printer during his career, working on specific projects for specific booksellers.</p>
<p>In his two-decade career, Eld printed a wide variety of works; when the printer is identified on title pages only with initials, researchers have used Eld's characteristic title-page device, "two volutes with foliage," for supporting evidence. He is the "G. E." who printed <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Camden">William Camden</ref>'s <hi rend="italic">Remains of a Greater Work</hi> (1605) for Simon Waterson, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Selden">John Selden</ref>'s <hi rend="italic">The Duello</hi> (1610) for John Helme, and Peter Gosselin's <hi rend="italic">The State Mysteries of the Jesuits</hi> (1623) for Nicholas Bourne.</p>
<head>Thorpe</head>
<p>Eld worked regularly for <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Thorpe">Thomas Thorpe</ref>; the two produced more than twenty titles together. These included the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_quarto">first quartos</ref> of Jonson's <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sejanus_His_Fall">Sejanus</ref></hi> (1605), <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volpone">Volpone</ref></hi> (1606), and <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Masque_of_Blackness">The Masque of Blackness</ref></hi> and <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Masque_of_Beauty">The Masque of Beauty</ref></hi> (in one volume, 1608). They also issued <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Marston_(poet)">John Marston</ref>'s <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_You_Will">What You Will</ref></hi> (1607), and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Chapman">George Chapman</ref>'s <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Fools">All Fools</ref></hi> (1605) and <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conspiracy_and_Tragedy_of_Charles,_Duke_of_Byron">The Conspiracy and Tragedy of Charles, Duke of Byron</ref></hi> (1608).<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-3">[3]</ref></p>
<p>Thorpe and Eld were also involved in two "dubious publishing enterprises" – one, a failed attempt to print a work to which they did not have the rights, and the other, a successful such attempt of some work by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Coryat">Thomas Coryat</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-4">[4]</ref></p>
<head>Shakespeare</head>
<p>Thorpe and Eld's most significant project was the 1609 first edition of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare's_Sonnets">Shakespeare's Sonnets</ref>. In 1612, Thorpe and Eld also issued a work of modern Shakespearean controversy, the <hi rend="italic">Funeral Elegy</hi> that <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Foster_(professor)">Donald Foster</ref> proposed as a work by Shakespeare,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-5">[5]</ref> without convincing most scholars and critics.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-6">[6]</ref></p>
<p>More Shakespeare: Eld printed the 1609 quarto of <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troilus_and_Cressida">Troilus and Cressida</ref>,</hi> for Richard Bonian and Henry Walley. Some critics have complained that the text in this volume is so poor that it should be classed as a "<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_quarto">bad quarto</ref>;" how much blame for this should fall on Eld, and how much is due to a faulty manuscript source that Eld had to work with, is open to question. (Eld's <hi rend="italic">Sejanus</hi> text, in contrast, is excellently printed.) Eld has also been identified as the printer of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Smethwick">John Smethwick</ref>'s third quarto of <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet">Hamlet</ref></hi> (<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1611_in_literature">1611 in literature</ref>).<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-7">[7]</ref></p>
<head>Others</head>
<p>Eld also printed the 1609 <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_quarto">second quarto</ref> of Marlowe's <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tragical_History_of_Doctor_Faustus">Doctor Faustus</ref></hi> for John Wright. And for <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Aspley">William Aspley</ref>, he printed one of the most controversial plays of the period, <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastward_Hoe">Eastward Ho</ref></hi> (three editions, 1605).</p>

<head>Publisher</head>
<p>Like some printers of his generation – <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Field_(printer)">Richard Field</ref> is a good example – Eld also published work on his own authority. He was active in drama here too:</p>
<list type="unordered"><item>Eld printed and published both Q1 and Q2 of <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Revenger's_Tragedy">The Revenger's Tragedy</ref></hi> (1607 and 1608). The play is now generally attributed to Middleton.</item>
<item>Also, Middleton's <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Trick_to_Catch_the_Old_One">A Trick to Catch the Old One</ref>,</hi> again the first two quartos (both 1608). A printer who published usually had to arrange for a bookseller to sell the work in question; the title page of Q2 of <hi rend="italic">A Trick</hi> specifies that the book is to be "sold by Henry Rocket." Yet when the third edition of <hi rend="italic">A Trick</hi> appeared in 1616, Eld was no longer the publisher; he merely printed the volume for bookseller Thomas Langley.</item>
<item><hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Puritan">The Puritan</ref>,</hi> one of the plays of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare_Apocrypha">Shakespeare Apocrypha</ref>, was published by Eld in 1607. Another play now generally assigned to Middleton, Eld attributed it to "W. S."</item>
<item>Eld published <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northward_Ho">Northward Ho</ref>,</hi> by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Dekker_(poet)">Thomas Dekker</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Webster">John Webster</ref>, in 1607.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-9">[9]</ref></item></list>
<p>Eld published beyond the confines of Jacobean drama as well, with works like <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Healey_(translator)">John Healey</ref>'s 1610 translation of <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_civitate_Dei">The City of God</ref></hi> by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo">St. Augustine</ref>. (That volume bore a dedication to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Herbert,_3rd_Earl_of_Pembroke">William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke</ref>, signed by Thorpe.) In 1622 he issued a volume of satires by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Taylor_(poet)">John Taylor the Water Poet</ref> called <hi rend="italic">The Water Cormorant His Complaint</hi>. He published the types of religious books that were so common in his era, like Bishop <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gervase_Babington">Gervase Babington</ref>'s <hi rend="italic">Works, Containing Comfortable Notes on the Five Books of Moses</hi> (1615).  And inevitably, Eld published and printed many now-obscure works by forgotten authors. The title page of his 1606 edition of Robert Pricket's <hi rend="italic">Time's Anatomy</hi> bears the inscription "to be sold by John Hodgets" – another demonstration of the printer/publisher's need for a retail outlet for his products.</p>
<head>Grimeston</head>
<p>In 1607, Eld printed and published <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Grimeston">Edward Grimeston</ref>'s <hi rend="italic">A General Inventory of the History of France,</hi> the book that provided Chapman source material for his tragedies on then-recent French history (including the Byron plays cited above). Eld followed this with several other large histories by Grimeston, partnering with fellow stationers Adam Islip, M. Flesher, and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Stansby">William Stansby</ref>: <hi rend="italic">A General History of the Netherlands</hi> (A. Islip and G. Eld, 1609), <hi rend="italic">The General History of Spain</hi> (A. Islip and G. Eld, 1612), <hi rend="italic">The General History of the Magnificent State of Venice</hi> (G. Eld and W. Stansby, 1612), and <hi rend="italic">A General History of France</hi> (G. Eld and M. Flesher, 1624).</p>
