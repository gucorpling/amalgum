<head>Peter Short (printer)</head><p>
<hi rend="bold">Peter Short</hi> (died 1603) was a London printer of the later <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabethan_era">Elizabethan era</ref>. He printed several first editions and early texts of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare">Shakespeare's</ref> works.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-1">[1]</ref></p>
<p>Short became a "freeman" (full member) of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worshipful_Company_of_Stationers_and_Newspaper_Makers">Stationers Company</ref> on 1 March 1589, and operated his own business from that year until his death; he was partnered with Richard Yardley until 1593. His shop was at the sign of the star on Bread Street Hill. About a third of his titles involved translations from <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin">Latin</ref> or contemporary European languages.  Short began publishing music in 1597; he issued <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Morley">Thomas Morley</ref>'s <hi rend="italic">A Plaine and Easy Introduction</hi> and both <hi rend="italic">Canzonets</hi>, Dowland's <hi rend="italic">First book of Songs</hi>, Holborne's <hi rend="italic">Cittharn School</hi>, and Hunnis's <hi rend="italic">Seven Sobs</hi>. Short used type which was passed on and used by his successors (Humphrey Lownes, James Young).<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-2">[2]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-3">[3]</ref></p>
<p>In an era when the functions of publisher and printer were often largely (though not entirely) separate, Short was primarily a printer and only secondarily a publisher; he printed just over 170 works in his career, and the publishers of about 100 are known.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-4">[4]</ref> Short likely published a good portion of the others himself.</p>
<p>Apart from Shakespeare's works, Short's most important printing tasks were: the famous <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1600_in_literature">1600</ref> first edition of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gilbert_(astronomer)">William Gilbert</ref>'s <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Magnete">De Magnete</ref>;</hi> the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1601_in_literature">1601</ref> edition of the <hi rend="italic">Annals</hi> of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stow">John Stow</ref>; and the completion of the fifth edition (<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1597_in_literature">1597</ref>) of the <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxe's_Book_of_Martyrs">Acts and Monuments, or Book of Martyrs</ref></hi> of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Foxe">John Foxe</ref>. He also printed the first edition (1600) of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Marlowe">Marlowe's</ref> translation of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Annaeus_Lucanus">Lucan</ref>'s <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharsalia">Pharsalia</ref></hi> for <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Thorpe">Thomas Thorpe</ref>.</p>
<p>Regarding Shakespeare, Short printed:</p>
<list type="unordered"><item>The <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_quarto">first quarto</ref> of <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VI,_Part_3">Henry VI, Part 3</ref></hi> (1595), for publisher Thomas Millington.

<item>The second edition of <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rape_of_Lucrece">The Rape of Lucrece</ref></hi> (1598), for John Harrison. This was the first edition of that poem in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_size">octavo</ref> rather than quarto format (O1).</item>
<item>The fifth edition of <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_and_Adonis_(Shakespeare_poem)">Venus and Adonis</ref></hi> (1599), for William Leake; the third octavo edition (O3).</item></list>
<p>For <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuthbert_Burby">Cuthbert Burby</ref>, Short printed <hi rend="italic">Palladis Tamia</hi> (<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1598_in_literature">1598</ref>) by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Meres">Francis Meres</ref>, a book that contains an important early reference to Shakespeare and a list of his plays performed up to 1598.</p>
<p>Short printed a few non-Shakespearean play texts as well:</p>
<list type="unordered"><item>For Burby, Short printed Q1 and Q2 of <hi rend="italic">The Taming of a Shrew</hi> (1594, 1596), the early alternative version of Shakespeare's <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Taming_of_the_Shrew">The Shrew</ref>.</hi></item>

<item>And for William Holme, Short printed one of the three editions of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Jonson">Jonson's</ref> <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Every_Man_Out_of_His_Humour">Every Man Out of His Humour</ref></hi> that appeared in a single year, 1600.</item></list>
<p>Short's connection with the Shakespeare canon has led scholars to study his printed output and learn details of the workings of his shop, including the compositors he employed.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-5">[5]</ref></p>
<p>After his 1603 death, Short's widow continued his business; she married Humphrey Lownes, another member of the Stationers Company, in 1604.</p>
