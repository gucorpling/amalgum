<p>Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrggggghhhhhh Got dumped again today. "You're fun and quirky but I want to be in a relationship with someone who can support me so that I don't fall destitute if I lose my job. It will be years before you finish your degree and don't see why you chose such an intensive course when you've struggled time and time again in the past" Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fucking fuck it all to fucking hell. (This the same week where I finally got my diagnosis roflmfao) I wasn't even that sure about her anyway and learning how much of a materialistic classist she is (along with her bizzare use of destitute) meant the relationship wasn't right for me. On all fronts, I'm better off without her. But still, I really fucking hate rejection. It will pass (the rejection anyway - the chronic underachievement, that remains to be seen) but right now, I need to put distance between myself and my feelings. Sorry for pointless rant but thanks for reading all the same. edit;- Am currently in the process of "distancing myself from my feelings" and am typically loathe to communicate with anybody while I'm conducting same. Nevertheless, this thread might be gone by the time I wake up at which point, I'll be hungover and uncommunicative in any case... Thank you all so much for your support (even MGTOW guy - I appreciated the chuckle but you still got a downvote from me I'm afraid). There are absolutely better people out there for me and while I'm a bit skeptical about meeting someone I truly "click" with (neurotypicals struggle enough with this one), it isn't a forlorn hope. As I alluded to in OP, the rejection bit is what stings the most but it's only a sting and stings dissipate in time. The experience hasn't shaken my confidence in myself nor has it affected my feelings towards other people in general. It just sucks right now, that's all. As for denigrating the ex, I suspect many of you may be correct but I'm not a fan of putting those who've spurned me down. Rest assured, she's a million miles from one of my pedestals but she's still a human being with flaws and shit. Professionally, she's a fantastic person who does great work and I hope she has the greatest of successes in her field because she truly makes positive impacts. Personally, her viewpoint on how relationships are supposed to function are wildly different to mine. Ultimately, I am better off without her (although I dare say she'd struggle to meet anyone as awesome as me again!). I genuinely appreciate the sentiments from you guys but honestly, it isn't necessary. While I'm going to be indifferent to her life from hereon in, she isn't an evil person. In truth, I wonder if it's one of the pitfalls of a working class person getting with an upper-middle class person but that's another matter entirely. Again, you are all brilliant. Thank you so much! I hope you all have fantastic weekends :)</p>

<p>Oh wow, what an utterly gross and shameless thing to say to someone as your reason for dumping them. Makes her look so bad. She doesn’t seem too concerned about exposing herself to be a parasite. I would almost feel obligated to send it to future bfs as a warning. Don’t take this personally people get dumped for all different reasons all the time. it’s not that common to find the right person and if it was it wouldn’t be special. Shitty relationships with shitty people gotta end somehow right ?</p>
