<p><hi rend="bold">GT:</hi>  What's the interpretation of that, translation of that mean? Casa particular. Like a rooming house?</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">DS:  Like a rooming house. Exactly.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">GT:</hi>  Or like a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bed%20and%20breakfast">Bed and Breakfast</ref>?</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">DS:  That's probably the best analogy. Staying at those the money goes more to the people. The other thing they tell you when you go to Cuba is to bring aspirin and all these things that are in short supply there. The people who run these Bed and Breakfasts, if you will, make out with all the stuff the tourists give them to be dispersed in their communities. I went to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador">Ecuador</ref>. I went camping in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon%20basin">Amazon</ref>. These are the places that interest me now. Do you find it similar in your own travels to really seek out things underneath, to pull up rocks and try and find places off the beaten path. Going to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbuktu">Timbuktu</ref> or wherever. Do you have a travel philosophy?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">GT:</hi>  Well since we're talking about Cuba, it was only four weeks in 1982 in which I traveled in Cuba to baseball towns. My idea often is to go to places with the announced notion of dealing with almost inconsequential parts of society. In China it was women's soccer. In Cuba, when I went first in '82, it was the idea of writing about sports fans and baseball games. The idea was to get me out of Havana. The only way I was going to get freedom, certainly nothing political. But if you're writing about baseball fans in Cuba, it means you can go to towns, sit in the stands....</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">DS:  And talk to the people.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">GT:</hi>  The people, how they get there, how they're dressed, how they behave and really observe a lot of people because the town, four or five baseball towns. They're big. And you can travel around the country. ‘Where are you going?' ‘We're going to the baseball game.' You always can explain yourself. And I was very impressed in '82. When I went back, I was writing a story I published called "Ali in Havana."  It's in a collection of mine called <hi rend="italic">The Gay Talese Reader</hi>, but it was published in Esquire in ‘96. Since you mentioned medical supplies, I went back to accompany <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammed%20Ali">Muhammed Ali</ref> on a private jet that left Miami for Havana. He and about twenty people were on that plane able to circumvent the embargo because he was on a humanitarian mission, or at least convinced the government authorities in Washington he was. He got clearance because of who he is. And he took medical supplies down. But he, himself, was so sick with Parkinson's. At the time, I didn't realize how unable to communicate I would be with him because I couldn't hear him. He didn't make any sense. But that didn't matter because I don't really write Q&amp;A kind of stuff anyway. Just hanging around with him was fine. But I was able to see a lot of the Cuban people. I was able to go to the medical facilities, hospitals and clinics to see nurses, see doctors, get a look at the interior of the medical quarters of the doctors and how the patients were dressed and what kind of equipment was around in a medical sense. I was very impressed by the resources of the people. Despite the attempts by such hostile nations as the U.S. toward Cuba, despite the embargo and all the other restraints and restrictions, to say nothing of the assassination attempts on Castro himself, people were very strong and, as you suggested, it's a very egalitarian society and I was with a lot of black people who were part of the contingent of Ali.</p>
