<head>Lucy A. Mallory</head>
<p><hi rend="bold">Lucy A. Mallory</hi> (c. 1843 or 1856—September 4, 1920) was an American writer, publisher, editor, and spiritualist.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTETolstoy2018411-1">[1]</ref> She was also a "<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_suffrage_in_the_United_States">suffragist</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarian">vegetarian</ref>, and devotee of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysical">metaphysical</ref> experiences". <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Tolstoy">Leo Tolstoy</ref> was so influenced by Mallory's magazine, the monthly spiritualist,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBennion1990142-2">[2]</ref> <hi rend="italic">The World's Advance Thought</hi>,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-iapsop-3">[3]</ref> that he called her the "greatest woman in America".<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPrinceSchaffer201734-4">[4]</ref></p>
<p>Mallory was editor and publisher of <hi rend="italic">The World's Advance Thought and the Universal Republic</hi> — two periodicals printed under one cover — published for more than thirty years.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEArmstrong191968-5">[5]</ref></p>
<head>Early years</head>
<p>Lucy A.

He was one of the first European settlers at a time when the country was an unbroken wilderness. Her mother, Minerva Kellogg Rose,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBennion1990142-2">[2]</ref> died in giving birth to Lucy. Mallory was reared among <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States">Native Americans</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWillardLivermore1893491-8">[8]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTELogan1912874-12">[11]</ref></p>
<head>Career</head>
<p>On June 24, 1860, she married <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rufus_Mallory">Rufus Mallory</ref>,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDavis1910187-13">[12]</ref> who afterwards <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_Representatives_from_Oregon">represented Oregon in Congress</ref>, and who was later one of the most successful lawyers in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Northwest">Pacific Northwest</ref>, and was the senior member of the extensive law firm to which Senator <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_N._Dolph">Joseph N. Dolph</ref> belonged. She accompanied her husband to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.">Washington, D.C.</ref>, after which they returned to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salem,_Oregon">Salem, Oregon</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPrinceSchaffer201734-4">[4]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWillardLivermore1893491-8">[8]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTELogan1912874-12">[11]</ref></p>
<p>In 1874, the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_racial_discrimination_in_Oregon">old slavery prejudice was so strong in Oregon</ref> that some forty-five <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American">African American</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulatto">mulatto</ref> children were prevented from attending the Salem public schools and kept from all chance of acquiring an education, as no Caucasian teachers would condescend to teach them. A public fund was set apart for them, but no one came forward to labor for it. Mallory volunteered to instruct the children, in the face of sneers and ridicule. Her course shamed the people into a sense of duty, and within three years, friction and opposition ended, and the children were admitted into the public schools and classes. Mallory, having no immediate use for the public money which she drew for her work, let it remain in the bank.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPrinceSchaffer201734-4">[4]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWillardLivermore1893491-8">[8]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTELogan1912874-12">[11]</ref></p>
<p>In 1886, she used the fund for the purchase of a printing plant, and soon after, started her monthly magazine, the <hi rend="italic">World's Advanced Thought</hi>, with Judge Horatio N. Maguire for assistant editor. After Maguire retired from editorial connection, on account of the pressure of other business affairs, he still contributed to its pages, while Mallory, who was always the proprietor, had full control. Her magazine circulated among advanced thinkers and workers. Tolstoy subscribed to it.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWillardLivermore1893491-8">[8]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTELogan1912874-12">[11]</ref></p>
<p>Mallory established and maintained the first free reading room in Portland. For thirty years, it was open to all who would enter it. In it were many rare books of spiritualism and philosophy, as well as periodicals, not easily obtainable elsewhere. Mallory, with her All World Soul Communion hour, to be observed around the world, was the pioneer in the "going into the Silence" idea, collectively. Many <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Thought">New Thought</ref> groups have since practised this method of attaining unity of thought. In addition to her reading room and periodicals, Mallory kept parlors open for meetings held twice or three times a week. Often these were addressed by speakers of world reputation, but oftener, those with unusual ideas spoke there as the one place in the city where they could utter their thoughts in a friendly and hospitable atmosphere. Many tried their speaking powers here for the first time. <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Towne">Elizabeth Towne</ref>, publisher of <hi rend="italic">Nautilus Magazine</hi>, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holyoke,_Massachusetts">Holyoke, Massachusetts</ref>, was one of these.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEArmstrong191968-5">[5]</ref> Prince &amp; Schaffer (2017) described Mallory as an "anarchist creative" with her cultural club, the Association of Artists and Authors.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPrinceSchaffer201734-4">[4]</ref> Mallory was always a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarian">vegetarian</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWillardLivermore1893491-8">[8]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTELogan1912874-12">[11]</ref></p>
