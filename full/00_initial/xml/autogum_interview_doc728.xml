<head>Wikinews interviews Brian Moore, Socialist Party USA presidential candidate</head><p><hi rend="bold">Sunday, March 30, 2008</hi></p>
<p>While nearly all cover of the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/2008_United_States_presidential_election">2008 Presidential election</ref> has focused on the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(US)">Democratic</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(US)">Republican</ref> candidates, the race for the White House also includes independents and third party candidates. These parties represent a variety of views that may not be acknowledged by the major party platforms.</p>
<p>As a non-partisan news source, <hi rend="italic">Wikinews</hi> has impartially reached out to these candidates, who are looking to become the 43rd person elected to serve their nation from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW. Wikinews' own <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/User:TUFKAAP">Patrick Mannion</ref> corresponded with the Socialist Party USA nominee and candidate, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian%20Moore%20(politician)">Brian Moore</ref> via e-mail.</p>
<head id="Interview">Interview</head>
<list type="unordered"><item><hi rend="bold">Why do you want to be President?</hi></item></list>
<p><hi rend="bold">Moore:</hi> Because the two party political system, and our capitalistic economic system, are not addressing nor are they resolving the problems domestically nor internationally.  I believe we need candidates of courage and vision to address issues in a forthright and alternative way, and no one so far, does that through the systems and solutions that they offer.</p>
<p>I also want to represent the working man and woman, the common man, and the poor, and bring equality and fairness and respect to them, which does not exist now under our systems and society.</p>
<list type="unordered"><item><hi rend="bold">Have you ever run for political office before?</hi></item></list>
<p><hi rend="bold">Moore:</hi> Yes, I ran for city council and mayor in <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Washington,_DC">Washington</ref> in the 1980's and 1990's; and I ran for the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/U.S._Congress">U.S. Congress</ref>  and the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/U.S._Senate">U.S. Senate</ref> in <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Florida">Florida</ref> in 2002, 2004 and 2006 respectively.</p>
<list type="unordered"><item><hi rend="bold">Have you ever been a member of a political party, other than the one you're currently in?</hi></item></list>
<p><hi rend="bold">Moore:</hi> Yes, I was a member of the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(US)">Democratic Party</ref>, the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Citizens_Party_(United_States,_1980s)">Citizens Party</ref>, the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Reform_Party_(US)">Reform Party</ref> and the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist%20Party">Socialist Party</ref>.  I also was an <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent%20(politician)">Independent</ref> for a long period of time.</p>
<list type="unordered"><item><hi rend="bold">Have you ever campaigned for another political candidate?</hi></item></list>
<p><hi rend="bold">Moore:</hi> Yes, from 1967 through 1984 and in the 1990's and early 2000's I campaigned for congressmen, senators, governors and presidents in <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/California">California</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Utah">Utah</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/New_Mexico">New Mexico</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/New_Jersey">New Jersey</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Wisconsin">Wisconsin</ref>, <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Maryland">Maryland</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Washington,_DC">Washington</ref>.  I have collected signatures on petitions, raised money, held fundraisers, parties, meetings, signs, attended meetings, etc for two dozen candidates over a 30-year period. I only decided to run as a candidate myself at the age of 41, after campaigning for the first 17 years for other candidates.  After becoming a candidate in 1984, I still campaigned for others in my off years up to 2004.</p>
<list type="unordered"><item><hi rend="bold">What is your current job?</hi></item></list>
<p><hi rend="bold">Moore:</hi> I am semi-retired at 64 (will be 65 in June, 2008), but am presently looking for work again, despite my presidential candidacy, because my younger wife recently lost her banking job with regard to home loans and mortgages.  Since I have a graduate degree, it may be easier for me to regain employment than she, who worked her way up through the banking industry for 25 years without attending college.</p>
