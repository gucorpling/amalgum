<p>Celebrations of the Bicentennial in <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Pichilemu">Pichilemu</ref> started earlier this month. On September 2, two thousand people lined up in a formation to create the message "Viva Chile Bicentenario Cardenal Caro" on Pichilemu beach "Las Terrazas". The message was used to create a postal stamp to be released worldwide. The event was promoted by the Government of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardenal%20Caro%20Province">Cardenal Caro Province</ref>.</p>
<p>Private schools in the city, such as <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Colegio_Preciosa_Sangre,_Pichilemu">Colegio Preciosa Sangre</ref>, prepared events specially for their students. On Thursday, "Fonda Don Vicente Nario" was opened on Preciosa Sangre. Several games were performed there on that morning, including "el emboque", "ponerle la cola al burro" (to put the tail to the donkey), and others.</p>
