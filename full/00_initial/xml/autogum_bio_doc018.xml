<head>Career</head>
<p>In 1958, Frank joined Smith, Barney and Company. He chose to accept their offer because they had a highly ranked research department. After completing the required formal training program, Frank joined the research department to work with Bill Grant on the pharmaceutical and chemical industries. He soon proposed splitting the two areas, and became Wall Street’s first industry analyst dedicated to pharmaceuticals. In 1962, he shifted focus to the life sciences industries, dealing with medical devices, diagnostics companies, and  healthcare services.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Ubiquitous-12">[12]</ref>  He held the positions of co-leader of research, vice president, and director at Smith, Barney.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Top100-5">[5]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Ubiquitous-12">[12]</ref></p>
<p>In October 1969, Frank left Smith Barney and joined <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehman_Brothers">Lehman Brothers</ref>, the first person from outside the organization to join it at the level of partner. Leaving research and analysis, he shifted to investment banking, handling capital investment and mergers and acquisitions. Frank is credited with creating original and at times unprecedented structures that have connected innovative early-stage research-oriented companies with larger development and market-oriented  pharmaceutical corporations.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Ubiquitous-12">[12]</ref></p>
<p>In 1978, Frank led a team at Lehman Brothers, handling <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humana">Humana</ref>'s acquisition of American Medicorp. The team included <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Catherine_Tanner">Mary Catherine Tanner</ref>, a recent graduate from <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University">Harvard University</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Ubiquitous-12">[12]</ref> Frank convinced her to join his team at Lehman. Ten years later, on October 15, 1988, they were married.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Wedding-3">[3]</ref>

It has been described by Frank as a "strategy of convergence".<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Morrill-13">[13]</ref></p>
