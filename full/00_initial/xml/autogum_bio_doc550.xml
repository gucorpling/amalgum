She was also married to John Warre of Chipleigh (Chipley Park, Somerset), second son of Sir Richard Warre of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hestercombe_House">Hestercombe</ref>. </p>
<p>Margaret Seymour, Lady Wadham (died 1520), second wife to Sir Nicholas Wadham and also his distant cousin, was a sister of Sir <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Seymour_(1474–1536)">John Seymour (1474–1536)</ref> of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wulfhall">Wulfhall</ref>, married to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margery_Wentworth">Margery Wentworth</ref>, parents to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Jane_Seymour">Queen Jane Seymour</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Seymour,_1st_Duke_of_Somerset">Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset</ref>; and thus grandparents to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Edward_VI_of_England">King Edward VI (1547–1553)</ref>. Margaret Seymour died in 1520, whilst she and Sir Nicholas were still resident at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carisbrooke_Castle">Carisbrooke Castle</ref> where he was governor, and there is a fine monument to her memory in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Mary's_Church,_Carisbrooke">St. Mary's Church, Carisbrooke</ref> on the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Wight">Isle of Wight</ref>. They had three children:</p>
<list type="unordered"><item>Nicholas Wadham, who died as a baby, in 1508. His monumental chrysom brass is in St Peter's Church, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilton">Ilton</ref> Somerset, where he lies buried beneath the arms of Wadham... and angel wings of Seymour.</item>
<item>Katherine Wadham, and</item>
<item>Jane Wadham, first cousins to Queen Jane Seymour and Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset. Both Wadham women became reluctant nuns at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romsey_Abbey">Romsey Abbey</ref>;<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-13">[13]</ref> both appear to have married after the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Monasteries">dissolution</ref> of the abbey in 1539.</item></list>
<p>Thirdly, Sir Nicholas married Isabel Baynham, daughter of Thomas Baynham of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearwell">Clearwell</ref>, Gloucestershire, widow of Sir <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giles_Brugge,_6th_Baron_Chandos">Giles Brydges (died 1511)</ref> of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coberley">Coberley</ref>, Gloucestershire.</p>
<p>He married lastly, Joan Lyte (died 1557), a daughter of Richard Lyte of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lytes_Cary">Lytes Cary</ref> Somerset, now maintained by the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Trust">National Trust</ref> (NT), the widow of William Walton of Barton St David.

<p>There were apparently no children by his third and fourth marriages<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-14">[14]</ref> although his will, written in 1539, leaves "to my son Nicholas, my third best horse" and a hundred pounds.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-15">[15]</ref> Given that his son Nicholas by Margaret Seymour died as a baby and was buried at <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilton">Ilton</ref> in 1508, this remains something of a mystery.</p>
