<head>Biography</head>
<p>Prior to the first English settlement on Roanoke Island, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Amadas">Philip Amadas</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Barlowe">Arthur Barlowe</ref> explored the area (April 27, 1584) on behalf of Raleigh, who had received an English charter to establish a colony a month earlier. During their expedition, Barlowe took detailed notes relating to conflicts and rivalries between different groups of Native Americans.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-2">[2]</ref> In one account, Wingina explained his own tribal history, in relation to a neighboring tribe at the mouth of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuse_River">Neuse River</ref>, the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neusiok">Neusiok</ref>, referred to as the "Neiosioke" by Barlowe. According to Wingina, the Secotans endured years of warfare with the Neiosioke, and "some years earlier," he met with the Neiosioke king, in an effort to ensure a "permanent coexistence." The two leaders arranged a feast between the two groups. An unspecified number of Secotan men and 30 women attended a feast in the town of Neiosioke. The Neiosioke ambushed the Secotans at the feast, and by the time fighting ended, the Neiosioke had "slewn them every one, reserving the women and children only."<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-3">[3]</ref></p>
<p>In conveying this "inter-tribal" history to Barlowe, Wingina saw an opportunity to advance the interest of the Secotans. Wingina and his people attempted on several occasions to convince the English to join them in devising a surprise attack against the Neiosioke. The Englishmen, uncertain of "whether their perswasion be to the ende they may be revenged of their enemies, or for the love they beare to us," declined to help the Secotans wage war against their rivals. Instead, the English established a trusting relationship with the Secotans, exemplified by the willingness of two Secotan chiefs, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manteo_(Croatan)">Manteo</ref> and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanchese_(chief)">Wanchese</ref>, to accompany Amadas and Barlowe back to England.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-4">[4]</ref></p>
<p>Wingina was decapitated by one of Raleigh's men, Edward Nugent, in the summer of 1586 .</p>
<head>Legacy</head>
<list type="unordered"><item>Raleigh's 1584 expedition recorded the name of the regional king (Wingina) and reported to Queen <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_I">Elizabeth I</ref> that he ruled over a land known as <hi rend="italic">Wingandacoa</hi>.  She was probably influenced by this report to modify the name of the colony to "<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia">Virginia</ref>", in part alluding to her status as the "Virgin Queen." It is the oldest surviving English place-name in the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">United States</ref> not wholly borrowed from a Native American word, and the fourth oldest surviving English place name, though it is Latin in form.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-5">[5]</ref> However, on Raleigh's subsequent voyage to the area, he recorded that <hi rend="italic">Wingandacoa</hi>, the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Algonquian">Carolina Algonquian</ref> word the English had heard upon his first arrival in 1584, means "What good clothes you wear!" and was not the native name of Wingina's country.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-6">[6]</ref></item>
