<p>According to an official for <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World%20Food%20Programme">World Food Programme</ref> (WFP), North Korea has admitted that the country faces food shortages and needs help. WFP is appealing to donor countries to step up aid, and to the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United%20Nations">UN</ref> to keep food aid outside of the nuclear debate. Food donations dropped dramatically after North Korea carried out its <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006%20North%20Korean%20nuclear%20test">nuclear test bombing</ref>. North Korea's shortage may be approaching 20% of what it needs to feed its people.</p>
