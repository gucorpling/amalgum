<head>Early life, education and early career</head>
<p>Driver was born in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebulon,_North_Carolina">Zebulon</ref>, North Carolina,<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-ourstage-3">[3]</ref> where he grew up on a farm. Driver has stated that "I wanted to play music for as long as I can remember. I guess around 1999 it hit me that [making music] is what I wanted to do. I never really turned back, and I never really had a back up plan." He started a rock band in high school, before moving to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raleigh,_North_Carolina">Raleigh</ref>, North Carolina, to attend <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_University">North Carolina University</ref>.</p>
<p>While a student he studied classical vocals and guitar.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-carrboro-4">[4]</ref> He also played in a number of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_hardcore">post-hardcore</ref> punk bands, which in both 2007 and 2009 were featured on the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vans_Warped_Tour">Vans Warped Tour</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-nickdrivermtv-1">[1]</ref></p>
<head>Music career</head>
<head><hi rend="italic">Warm Is Your Color</hi> (2010)</head>
<p>After playing heavy rock styles for close to a decade, Driver began writing music in a primarily acoustic style. His debut solo LP <hi rend="italic">Warm Is Your Color</hi> was self-released on January 1, 2010. He toured the United States in support of the album, which had a top ten song hit on <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius_XM">Sirius XM</ref>'s <hi rend="italic">The Coffeehouse</hi>, titled "Let's Stay Together."<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-nickdrivermtv-1">[1]</ref></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Wildy's World</hi> gave <hi rend="italic">Warm Is Your Color</hi> a positive review and 3/5 stars, calling it an "adroit turn" and stating that "turning to word-heavy light acoustic pop (ala <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Mraz">Jason Mraz</ref>) and balladry, Driver looks to bring the energy of punk to the finesse and precision of pop music". The review praised the creativity of several songs in particular, but criticized others for not suiting Driver's style. "The more up-tempo acoustic pop songs work very well for Driver, whereas the slow ballads find Driver losing energy, focus and sound."<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-wildys-2">[2]</ref> <hi rend="italic">Music Spectrum</hi> also compared Driver's style to Mraz, and stated, "Aside from the Mraz comparison, I also hear what's called <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedwood">Speedwood</ref> by the group Lost &amp; Found. What they mean are some hard acoustic guitar lines—kind of a punk energy to folk music. Driver displays this on 'Young Beautiful,' with the guitar accentuated by <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congas">congas</ref>."<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-mrazstyle-5">[5]</ref></p>

<p>Driver uses few effects in his solo material, and mostly relies on acoustic instruments.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-hardee-9">[9]</ref> While he incorporates the stylings of multiple genres, much of his music has an "<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americana_music">Americana</ref>, singer-songwriter feel".<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-carrboro-4">[4]</ref></p>

Driver has also cited poets such as <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvia_Plath">Sylvia Plath</ref> as influences on his lyrics, stating "She was intense.
