<head>Life</head>
<p>Nothing is known about the date or place of Justynian Szczytt's birth, nor his education and youth.</p>
<p>He was a servant of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnat">magnat</ref> <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapieha_family">Sapieha family</ref> for many years, particularly of <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paweł_Jan_Sapieha">Paweł Jan Sapieha</ref> and his son <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedykt_Paweł_Sapieha">Benedykt Paweł Sapieha</ref>. He administered property in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czereje">Czereje</ref> in their names from 1667 to 1669.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Haratym564-5">[5]</ref> By 22 June 1666, he had become Polotsk's vice-<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voivode">voivode</ref> (<hi rend="italic">podwojewodzi</hi>, literally: under-voivode).<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Haratym564-5">[5]</ref> In 1667, Szczytt was elected for the first time as a member of the <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sejm_walny">sejm walny</ref></hi> (parliament) of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish–Lithuanian_Commonwealth">Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth</ref> as a representative of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Połock_Voivodeship">Połock Voivodeship</ref>.

<p>Szczytt was member of parliament during the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_sejm">election sejm</ref> of 1669, which elevated <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michał_Korybut_Wiśniowiecki">Michał Korybut Wiśniowiecki</ref> to the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Polish_monarchs">Polish throne</ref>. According to family tradition, Szczytt saw that people were giving new king an ordinary-looking <hi rend="italic"><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szabla">szabla</ref></hi>. He gave the king his own very ornamental sabre. Eventually the <hi rend="italic">szabla</hi> was returned to Szczytt, and it remained a family heirloom until the 1880s.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Żychliński362-6">[6]</ref></p>
<p>Also in 1669, Szczytt was a member of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronation_sejm">coronation sejm</ref>. He tried to stop the proceedings of parliament for an unknown reason on 25 October 1669, but the following day he retracted his objection on the condition that the Połock Voivodeship be exempt from taxes for a period of six years.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Haratym564-5">[5]</ref></p>
<p>By 29 July 1670, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Kazimierz_Sapieha_the_Younger">Kazimierz Jan Sapieha</ref>, Połock's new voivode, named Szczytt the new <hi rend="italic">podwojewodzi</hi>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Haratym564-5">[5]</ref> Historians believe Sapieha did so in exchange for Szczytt's property in <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisna,_Poland">Lisna</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Haratym564-5">[5]</ref> Also in 1670, Szczytt was a judge of the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_Tribunal">Lithuanian Tribunal</ref>. In June 1670, on behalf of the Sapieha family, he accused <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikołaj_Ciechanowiecki">Mikołaj Ciechanowiecki</ref>, Marshall of the Tribunal, of several crimes, including being elected illegally. Then Szczytt left <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilno">Wilno</ref> and paralysed the Tribunal for some time. Eventually, the Tribunal won the support the magnate <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac_family">Pac family</ref> and Szczytt was <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exile">banished</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Haratym564-5">[5]</ref></p>

He became known as <hi rend="italic">sprawiedliwy Szczyt</hi> ("Justice Szczytt").<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Żychliński362-6">[6]</ref></p>
<p>During <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Sejm">election Sejm</ref> of 1674 he voted for <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_III_Sobieski">Jan III Sobieski</ref>.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Haratym564-5">[5]</ref><ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Żychliński362-6">[6]</ref> In 1677 Szczytt brought the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conventual_Franciscans">Franciscan Brothers</ref> to <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prozaroki">Prozaroki</ref>, where he built them a cloister and church.<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Haratym564-5">[5]</ref></p>
<p>Justynian Szczytt died in 1677<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Haratym564-5">[5]</ref> (although Teodor Żychliński states that Szczytt died about 1681<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Żychliński362-6">[6]</ref>).
