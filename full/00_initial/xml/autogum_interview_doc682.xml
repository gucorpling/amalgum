<p><hi rend="bold">DS:  What do you think is the greatest threat to humanity?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">SB:</hi>  The lack of regard for life as being sacred I think would be my biggest threat to humanity.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">DS:  What is the <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/culture%20of%20life">culture of life</ref>?  How would you describe that phrase?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">SB:</hi>  It's seeing all life, at all places, at all stages as beautiful and unique, sacred, a child of a loving God.  To me that's what a culture of life is, and us having walked away from that, we've had millions of abortions here, hundreds of millions around the world, people that should be here but are not.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">DS:  Bobby Schindler, <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry%20Schiavo">Terry Schiavo</ref>'s brother, endorsed your candidacy by saying that "Sam Brownback is the pro-life conservative we can trust to stand for all life, regardless of political calculations."  Do you think the <ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Death_penalty">death penalty</ref> detracts from the culture of life?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">SB:</hi>  I do, and that's why I am not a supporter of a death penalty, other than in cases where we cannot protect the society and have other lives at stake.  But again, I understand people who support the death penalty saying, "This is different," whether it's an innocent human life or somebody that's committed a heinous crime.  In trying to move forward with a culture of life, I think we need to try to do that in every setting, including the use of the death penalty by the State.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">DS:  A common question I've asked in my interviews is about the Iraq War and how it has affected someone as a person.  People often proffer their opinion on the war, but they don't really talk much about how it has affected them personally, perhaps in their world view.  The writer <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay%20Talese">Gay Talese</ref> insisted the war has not affected him at all. "I wish it had," he said.  Talese thinks there's a problem with Americans not sacrificing enough, and he argued that we need <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conscription">conscription</ref>.  Do you think we need conscription, if not to support the manpower of the war, to make Americans more involved with the wars that we are fighting?</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">SB:</hi>  Absolutely not.  I'm absolutely opposed to conscription.  The military opposes conscription; they want a <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteer%20military">voluntary force</ref> that signs up to be a part of the military, not people that are forced into it.  And I don't think that's a necessarily right way to look at it, as far as that we need to feel more of the pain of the conflict.  We're getting close to four thousand young <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties%20of%20the%20Iraq%20War">people that we've lost</ref>.  I think a lot of people know individuals personally that have been touched by this war in that most difficult way.  I think it's impacted a lot of people in very strong and profound ways.</p>
