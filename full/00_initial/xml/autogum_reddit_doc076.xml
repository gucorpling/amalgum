<head>Cons of Fate Core</head>
<sp who="#WillSmithsBrother">
<p>Hey everyone, I started playing RPG’s (after being interested for over 20 years) about 5 years ago. I’ve played under quite a few different systems, and I’ve DM’d under DnD 5e and Fate Core. Now here’s the thing. I LOVE FATE. I love aspects, I love fudge dice, I love fats points, I love creating an advantage, I love pretty much everything about it. Some of the friends I’ve played with also love Fate. I do however have one friend that has only played two campaigns DM’d by me under 5e (that he loved) and I’ve been trying to convince him to play Fate with the me and some others. After looking at the rule book he is not very interested in trying it out, saying it’s not his style and wants to play 5e. I don’t want to force him to play something he doesn’t want to play, but I do want to see if I can tweak Fate to something he’d like a bit more before giving up on getting him to play. The problem is, I love Fate so much, I fail to see what it doesn’t do better than any other system. So that’s why I’m here. I’m hoping to probe the minds of all you out there with great experience, because I know you’ll be able to point out the weak points of Fate that my Fanboy eyes can’t make out alone. Thanks for your time :) Edit: Wow I got a lot more responses than I expected. Thank you guys so much for all the good points. A lot of these comments showed me reasons that my friends TTRPGing style don’t match up well with Fate. I was hoping to tweak Fate to fit his playstyle more, but instead I’ll try and find a system that all the players are interested in. If possible 🙏🏼. Thanks again for your time and well thought out responses.</p>

<p>I love narratives in tabletop rpg. I love narrative tension over mechanical challenge, and adore freedom to create. Yet I still ended up hating FATE. </p>
<p>This is because FATE needs to stick to a certain type of play. It needs to decide if it’s an action-oriented or social-oriented game. The mechanics are too barebones, and too easily exploitable or imbalancable. I consider crippling depression a major character flaw, and something like selfishness to be a minor character flaw, while someone else might consider selfishness a major character flaw and a character with crippling depression unplayable. </p>
<p>The mechanics leave a basic, generic nothing where players never have to think to solve problems. The only concrete mechanic are Skills, which leaves practically nothing for character customization. </p>
<p>A system that works way better is Open Legend. It can be narrative oriented, but has just enough customization options that every character really feels unique and conflict has actual tension behind it. </p>
<p>Another bad thing about FATE is that they take a DND-amount of pages to describe their barebones rules system. Learn to be concise.</p>
