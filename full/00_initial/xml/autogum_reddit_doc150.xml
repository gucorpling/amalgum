<head>Advice wanted for dealing with GF's insane mother</head>
<sp who="#vel0city0verdrive">
<p>My GF and I are in our sophomore year of college and have been dating for almost 6 months now. This is both of our first LTR and to me, at least, we have been navigating it well. However, the relationship has caused me more stress and guilt than happiness, and the worst part is because it is from her mother. I knew she didn't like me from the beginning because I'm 19 and she is 20 even though we are in the same class. My GF was really nervous about telling her mom about being in a relationship (I'll get to why later) and although I tried to encourage her since before Thanksgiving to tell her family, she wouldn't until mid-December (after we have been dating since early August.) Her mom, expectedly, went off on her for not saying anything and guilt-tripped her. The more our relationship went on, the more frustrating I seemed to notice about her mother such as  <hi rend="bold"> Her never telling anyone back home/at school about our relationship. This drives me crazy because if our relationship doesn't work out, no one in her life other than the mother will even know it happened, like we didn't even exist. </hi>  Her mom asking questions about me constantly, and not very accepting of my honest answers I tried not to become too bothered about this, but my GF told me her mom wanted to speak to me before they went home for Spring Break (which is now) in private. This took place Thursday, and she grilled me the entire time, asking me so many questions and telling me things like:  <hi rend="bold"> I'm not good enough for her spiritually (her mom is insanely religious) </hi>  We don't have enough in common  <hi rend="bold"> I may have pushed her into a relationship </hi>  She told me she never talked about sex/relationships to my GF (homeschooled of course) because "parenting is hard." (pissed me off more than anything) Last night, I told my GF about the talk we had, and she didn't apologize for her mother's actions or anything, all she said was "I don't know what to say," after I poured out my heart to her. This really hurt me, but I'm used to it as it is the usual answer when I tell her about something I'm going through, as I usually go through friends/parents when I have problems instead. I never post on forums but I'm desperate for advice on what to do because I still care for her greatly, but I'm becoming more on edge every day and I'm fully aware we are in an unhealthy relationship. Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>You need to tell your gf you want to keep seeing her, but not her mom. You are not at the stage in a relationship her mom needs to be in your face asking probing questions. Also you might try to suggest that therapy might help her navigate all her relationships in a healthy way, since her mom admitted skipping that part. Tell her you never want her to feel pressured by you, and that it's ok to communicate what she is comfortable with and what she would like to explore. Is your gf very religious? If so beware of the if you date hold hands kiss your ARE getting married mentality. Make sure YOU are using birth control since she might be afraid to get it for herself. But remember it isn't your responsibility to hang around and fix her if you aren't enjoying the relationship.</p>
