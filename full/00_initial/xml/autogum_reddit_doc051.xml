<p>Here’s some advice. Free of charge. I’m going to help you save your game. Granted ultimate team is just a mode in the game but I don’t see people spending real cash money on EASHL. So HUT is your meal ticket when it comes to the NHL franchise. I’ve thought long and hard about this post, mainly while I’m at work bored out of my mind, and figured this needed to be said. Probably a week or so too late. Maybe a month or so too late. But here it is. Some small tips and some larger tips but tips nonetheless. Here’s your solution.  <hi rend="bold">Saving 18</hi>  Well it’s no secret this year is a mess. On our end and their end. They BS’d us about lowering overalls so there wouldn’t be so many 99s and here we are. Every card is a 99 and if not “iT’s uSeLeSs”. We abused the slider glitch. It takes two. So now let’s work to fix it. I think 18 is salvageable. Maybe the gameplay (puck pickups etc) can’t be saved or fixed but I’m willing to bet EA has taken quite the hit in the pocketbook in the latter months of this game cycle with all the players calling it quits for the year. I’m a “lifer”. I play the game the whole length of the year. Good or bad. Sucks for me right? But I’m EA’s target demographic. 18-34 male with a couple bucks to spare on packs from time to time. So listen up. Allegedly there’s supposed to be “500 new legends” in the game next year. According to speculation based on the pre game survey sent out by EA. Well why not dip into the pot and release 1 or 2 of these new legends this year. Bet your ass if they decided to release two MSP 99s such as Peter Forsberg and Teemu Selänne there would be plenty of “retired” players coming back. At least for a bit. Maybe 1 or 2 more a month later. It’s not that difficult.  <hi rend="bold">Fixing 19</hi>   <hi rend="bold">SETS</hi>  The sets this year have been weak. Let’s be honest. Why do we need a Getzlaf and Malkin MSP when they’re both already 99s. And the Duncan Keith shit. Cmon. To me, personally, sets are the funnest part of the game. Because the players in the sets are generally retired older players and players that don’t have cards. If it were up to me I would have some kind of trade in set like the flashback master that runs like an upgrade set. Constantly having new players added and currently players having adjusted overalls. For example. 92 legend Bure to upgrade to a 93 you need X amount of carbons to upgrade to a 94 you need to complete X amount of upgrade challenges plus X amount of carbons and so on. I mean seriously just let us have attainable useful versions of cards throughout the year because I would really love a Cam Neely that’s not a god damn 90. Especially since 90 overall cards were obsolete a month into the game.  <hi rend="bold">DRAFT CHAMPIONS</hi>  For the love of god can we make draft champions great again? Ok maybe it never was but you get the drift. Who even plays DC? Maybe people do but I don’t. Because I think it’s a waste of my time. Now if there was a way upgrade my players or earn USEFUL players I’d play. It’s not a hard concept to grasp. Nix the challenges (or maybe release a few basic ones to get you started) and make DC a mode that is utilized. Better rewards. More coins per win/loss. Ability to win cards with say 100 wins or something along those lines. And then that card be upgraded every 100 more wins or such. We’re 8 months into 18 and the reward is still an 85 overall card. I could be wrong but that’s because I DONT PLAY DC. Why? Why play? Give me a legitimate reason to play DC. It could be sooo cool and fun but nope. It’s useless. You have a gem here. DO SOMETHING WITH IT!!!!  <hi rend="bold">SMALL BUT HELPFUL FIXES</hi>  I’ll keep this short because I’ve rambled enough. - Positional captions in the team interface. Just show me who the freakin center is and who the winger/forward is. Don’t make me guess anymore. Simplify that shit. Cmon - For the love of god if I have 99 Getzlaf out there on the PK or 4 on 4 with another forward who is a LW or RW WHY ISNT HE TAKING THE DRAW?! OMFG that’s the simplest shit ever. It’s almost disrespectful to the players that you do that crap to use. How hard is it to have the center take the faceoffs?!? He’s the center ffs! - If I buy a jersey or logo, under the item options tab, why the hell cant I make it active? Why do I have to go through all these other menus and steps to make the jersey my main jersey. THATS WHY I BOUGHT IT! To use it!! - the ability to deactivate a player from my roster when I want to sell him or offer in a trade. It’s just annoying to have to go back and take him out of my lineup and then go back to the post to AH screen or go back and offer the trade. It’s another simple small thing that would make our lives just the slightest bit easier on this game. I’m sure I’m missing things but the main points have gotten across. The game is salvageable there just need to be some EFFORT put in. EA is losing their hardcore player base and that’s a problem. For all of us. No players means no game in the future. I’m hopeful 19 turns out better than 18 but I guess only time will tell. Any other thoughts? I know EA is lurking 👀 (no names but we know you’re here) </p>
