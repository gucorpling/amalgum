In
collaboration
with
Bramptonians
,
we
must
ensure
that
the
recreation
aspects
are
well
considered
through
parks
,
recreation
centers
,
and
cultural
programs
.
</p>
<p>
The
city
must
remain
safe
,
secure
,
clean
,
lively
and
vibrant
at
all
time
.

Q
:
</hi>
The
Rose
Theatre
recently
launched
.
What
are
your
thoughts
on
this
facility
?
Have
you
had
a
chance
to
tour
it
yet
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
A
:
</hi>
The
Rose
Theatre
is
the
sort
of
actions
that
I
would
encourage
as
city
councilor
.
Of
course
beyond
this
sort
of
infrastructure
,
we
must
always
seek
and
keep
in
mind
the
wellbeing
of
our
population
.
The
culture
sense
that
the
Rose
brings
is
certainly
part
of
the
wellbeing
of
Bramptonians
.
However
,
we
must
ensure
that
each
of
us
in
the
city
can
really
have
a
stake
of
that
well-being
.
</p>
<p>
I
have
toured
the
facility
and
enjoyed
with
my
daughter
a
kid
show
and
was
also
in
the
crowd
few
days
ago
for
a
splendid
comedy
show
.
Rose
Theatre
is
definitely
the
way
to
go
.
But
we
must
notice
how
long
it
took
to
the
previous
council
chamber
to
offer
to
this
city
what
it
really
deserves
.
That
must
be
said
loudly
.
</p>
<p>
We
need
to
diversify
actions
that
would
ensure
that
each
Bramptonian
actually
have
something
to
cherish
,
make
him
comfortable
to
live
and
raise
his
children
in
Brampton
.
I
do
believe
that
the
downtown
core
of
Brampton
is
missing
many
other
things
.
There
is
a
clear
urban
development
missing
;
as
far
as
I
am
concerned
,
the
Rose
Theatre
must
be
the
beginning
of
a
long
development
program
of
our
downtown
.
I
would
make
sure
,
as
city
councilor
that
we
continue
in
this
path
with
more
depth
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Q
:
</hi>
The
province
has
strongly
encouraged
the
development
of
high-density
residences
near
the
downtown
.
Do
these
buildings
fit
in
with
your
vision
of
the
downtown
?
How
much
say
should
other
levels
of
government
have
in
urban
planning
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
A
:
</hi>
The
good
thing
materializes
by
the
new
Rose
Theatre
must
not
be
the
only
downtown
development
action
.
Our
downtown
must
be
revitalized
and
the
high-density
residences
and
precisely
the
high
rise
condominium
buildings
must
be
the
next
steps
.
Downtown
Brampton
must
be
the
center
of
the
city
and
the
biggest
center
of
attraction
in
many
ways
.
Today
we
are
really
millions
miles
away
of
that
vision
.
</p>
<p>
As
city
councilor
along
with
Bramptonians
and
all
levels
of
government
I
would
deeply
work
to
revive
our
downtown
core
.
High
rise
and
high
density
residences
are
definitely
part
of
my
vision
and
Brampton
must
be
before
2010
well
into
it
in
order
to
fully
fit
in
this
twenty
first
century
.

<hi rend="bold">
Q
:
</hi>
How
do
you
feel
about
Brampton
's
rate
of
expansion
?
Council
recently
capped
the
annual
amount
of
new
development
;
do
you
agree
completely
with
this
decision
,
would
you
have
slowed
development
even
further
,
or
not
have
imposed
a
cap
at
all
?
