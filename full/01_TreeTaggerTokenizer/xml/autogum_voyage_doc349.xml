Fort

's
on
the
edge
of
<ref target="http://www.lake-victoria.net">
Uganda
’s
equatorial
rainforest
</ref>
.
It
's
an
enchanting
land
full
of
lakes
,
grasslands
,
marshes
and
forests
on
the
lower
slopes
of
the
Rwenzori
Mountains
in
western
Uganda
.
</p>
<p>
There
are
many
wonderful
lodges
within
Kibale
forest
where
you
can
spend
a
night
or
two
in
a
tree
house
experiencing
the
sounds
of
the
forest
's
inhabitants
including
8
species
of
monkey

<p>
Visit
<ref target="http://ugandawildlife.org/explore-our-parks/parks-by-name-a-z/queen-elizabeth-national-park">
Queen
Elizabeth
National
Park
</ref>
which
is
less
than
an
hour
's
drive
from
Fort
Portal
on
the
way
to
Mbarara
.
The
wide
bio-diversity
of
habitats
means
that
Queen
Elizabeth
National
Park
contains
the
most
astonishing
number
of
species
-
almost
100
types
of
mammal
and
606
different
birds
!
The
Kazinga
Channel
alone
is
said
to
contain
the
world
's
largest
concentration
of
hippos
,
but
interestingly
enough
not
many
crocodiles
!
Other
wildlife
includes
warthogs
,
buffalo
,
rare
aquatic
sitatunga
antelope
,
giant
forest
hog
,
beautifully
horned
Uganda
kob
,
topi
,
waterbuck
,
elephant
and
leopard
.
</p>
<p>
This
is
a
wonderful
national
park
,
sometimes
dubbed
'
the
Pearl
of
Africa
or
Switzerland
of
Africa
'
.
Quite
simply
this
fertile
equatorial
area
is
especially
scenic
,
with
two
lakes
connected
by
a
channel
overlooked
by
a
high
peninsula
.
You
will
also
find
volcanic
craters
,
grassy
plains
and
tropical
forest
.
As
a
result
it
has
one
of
the
highest
biodiversity
ratings
in
the
world
.
Hunting
exhibits
such
as
stuffed
lions
,
leopard
skins
,
deer
heads
and
elephants
tusks
may
still
be
found
adorning
some
hotels
and
lodges
,
but
the
emphasis
is
certainly
more
on
shooting
with
a
camera
these
days
.
Many
of
Uganda
's
safaris
were
poached
out
in
the
past
,
especially
elephants
,
but
now
the
area
is
protected
and
elephants
numbers
are
boosted
by
those
entering
the
park
from
the
Congo
,
where
poaching
is
still
a
problem
.
</p>
<p>
There
is
also
a
really
funny
statue
of
Sir
Gerald
Portal
on
the
main
road
of
the
town
.
Yes
,
he
does
have
a
gun
in
his
pocket

yes

he
is

you

just

and
you
'll

Fort
Portal
is
famous
for
its
tea
.
This
area
is
gifted
by
nature
with
a
cool
climate
which
ensures
a
relatively
slow
plant
growth
rate
.
This
naturally
makes
the
tea
a
high
grown
,
high
quality
tea
.
</p>
<p>
The
consumption
of
this
tea
is
associated
with
many
health
benefits
.
These
include
anti-allergy
,
anti-oxidation
,
anti-hypertension
,
anti-viral
,
anti-obese
,
anti-cancer
,
anti-bacterial
,
enzyme
inhibition
and
many
other
human
health
problems
.
You
can
buy
the
tea
in
any
local
shop
or
even
better
visit
one
of
Fort
Portal
's
tea
plantations
.

There

they

But
go
