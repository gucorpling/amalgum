The
study
has
employed
a
similar
empirical
model
as
the
one
that
studied
the
association
between
climate
change
and
infectious
diseases
.
The
present
study
has
extended
the
framework
by
associating
climate
change
,
air
pollution
(
PM2.5
)
,
and
socio-economic
variables
causing
neonates
deaths
due
to
acute
respiratory
infection
.
This
study
has
used
panel
data
of
12
Asian
countries
from
2000
to
2017
.
The
empirical
model
is
mentioned
below
:
(

)
where
<hi rend="italic">
M
</hi>
denotes
the
number
of
neonates
deaths
due
to
acute
respiratory
infection
,
<hi rend="italic">
CV
</hi>
signifies
the
climate
variables
(
application
of
mean
temperature
as
a
proxy
for
<hi rend="italic">
CV
</hi>
)
and
air
pollution
(
PM2.5
)
,
while
<hi rend="italic">
D
</hi>
signifies
socio-economic
variables
,
i.
e.
,
income
,
education
,
and
population
density
.
The
socio-economic
determinants
have
been
added
in
the
model
to
check
the
rationality
of
the
results
.
We
describe
the
climate
variables
(
air
pollution
and
temperature
)
as
non-linear
.
The
objective
behind
introducing
the
climate
variables
in
quadratic
form
is
to
determine
the
number
of
neonatal
deaths
caused
by
respiratory
disease
patients
as
non-linear
in
climate
variables
or
otherwise
.
The
study
has
estimated
a
static
model
where
the
current
number
of
neonates
’
deaths
is
not
dependent
upon
the
previous
year
number
of
deaths
.
The
motive
behind
using
the
static
model
is
that
the
data
available
are
annual
.
Thus
,
the
static
model
is
expressed
as
:
(

)
The
study
employs
the
panel
dataset
method
to
evaluate
the
effects
of
air
pollution
(
PM2.5
)
and
climate
change
(
temperature
)
on
the
neonate
deaths
due
to
acute
respiratory
infection
.
It
is
important
to
state
here
that
the
present
data
structure
does
not
permit
to
analyze
the
random
effects
.
According
to
,
the
fixed-effect
model
is
a
suitable
specification
if
the
analysis
is
focused
on
a
given
number
(
N
)
of
units
so
that
statistical
inference
is
conditional
on
the
particular
set
of
(
N
)
unities
,
which
in
our
case
,
are
12
countries
highly
vulnerable
to
climate
change
(
N
=
12
)
.
On
the
other
hand
,
random-effect
models
require
the
assumption
of
uncorrelated
explanatory
variables
and
a
time-invariant
unobservable
component
of
the
model
,
which
is
assumed
to
be
random
(
for
example
,
)
.
In
other
words
,
the
random
effect
model
would
require
that
units
were
selected
randomly
from
a
large
number
of
possibilities
,
as
is
the
case
when
the
units
are
individuals
or
households
.
The
static
model
is
elaborated
below
as
:
(

The
study
uses
a
panel
dataset
where
each
variable
in
Equation
(

refers
to
country
<hi rend="italic">

</hi>
at
time
<hi rend="italic">
t
</hi>
,
while
<hi rend="italic">
D
</hi>
<hi rend="italic">

</hi>
in
Equation
(

)
denotes
socio-economic
factors
(
Gross
Domestic
Product
(
GDP
)
as
a
measure
of
income
,
education
level
,
and
population
density
)
,
PM2.5
refers
to
air
pollution
(
mean
annual
exposure
(
micrograms
per
cubic
meter
)
)
,
<hi rend="italic">

</hi>
<hi rend="italic">

is
used
as
a
proxy
for
climate
change
,
and
ε
<hi rend="italic">

</hi>
is
the
error
term
.
The
study
measures
the
neonatal
deaths
due
to
acute
respiratory
infections
per
1000
inhabitants
as
the
dependent
variable
with
reference
to
retrieved
data
from
United
Nation
International
Emergency
Fund
(
UNICEF
)
database
.
The
data
for
other
variables
,
like
temperature
(
yearly
average
of
monthly
mean
temperature
of
respective
countries
)
,
GDP
per
capita
(
as
a
proxy
for
national
income
)
,
secondary
school
enrollment
(
as
a
proxy
for
national
educational
level
)
,
and
population
density
(
people
per
sq
.
km
of
land
area
)
are
retrieved
from
the
World
Bank
dataset
