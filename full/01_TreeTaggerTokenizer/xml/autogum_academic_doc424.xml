Population-Sensitive
POI
Categories
</head>
<p>
The
PSP
categories
were
selected
by
spatial
association
rule
mining
(
see
Section
3.1
)
,
which
has
a
strong
spatial
association
with
the
population
hotspots
extracted
from
Easygo
heat
map
data
.
The
two
parameters
of
the
spatial
association
rules
between
the
POI
categories
and
the
population
hotspots
are
shown
in
Table
3
.
Various
categories
had
significant
differences
in
the
support
and
confidence
of
the
association
rule
between
the
population
hotspots
and
the
POI
categories
.
A
total
of
3092
hotspots
were
extracted
to
establish
the
two-dimensional
association
rules
between
population
hotspots
and
POI
records
.
The
minimum
support
(
min_sup
)
and
minimum
confidence
(
min_conf
)
values
were
determined
to
analyze
the
relationship
between
the
number
of
association
rules
and
different
min_sup
and
min_conf
values
.
</p>
<p>
The
number
of
association
rules
corresponding
to
the
different
min_sup
and
min_conf
values
showed
obvious
regularity
(
<figure>
Figure
3
</figure>
)
.
With
increasing
min_sup
and
min_conf
values
,
the
number
of
rules
decreased
.
By
analyzing
the
support
values
and
confidence
values
,
it
was
that
some
association
rules
contained
certain
categories
of
POIs
,
such
as
catering
and
corporation
,
that
had
high
support
but
low
confidence
.
This
was
because
many
of
those
POIs
had
a
low
proportion
of
spatial
association
rules
with
population
aggregation
points
,
which
means
that
those
association
rules
were
important
but
not
accurate
.
Other
rules
,
such
as
the
rules
containing
financial
services
and
scientific
research
and
technical
services
,
had
high
confident
and
low
support
.
Those
categories
of
POIs
were
more
likely
to
have
association
rules
with
population
gathering
points
,
but
the
number
was
small
,
which
means
that
those
association
rules
were
accurate
but
not
important
.
To
obtain
sufficient
association
rules
that
were
important
and
improve
the
accuracy
,
the
values
of
min_sup
and
min_conf
should
be
set
to
be
as
large
as
possible
and
to
obtain
as
many
rules
as
possible
at
the
same
time
.
In
this
study
,
the
value
of
min_sup
was
set
to
27,450
and
the
value
of
min_conf
was
set
to
0.0019
,
which
is
the
abscissa
of
inflection
points
of

Finally
,
four
categories
were
selected
as
PSPs
,
including
residential
community
,
wholesale
and
retail
,
education
services
,
and
resident
services
.
The
PSPs
accounted
for
only
52
%
of
the
total
POI
records
.
This
means
that
the
other
48
%
were
PIPs
that
would
have
inevitably
introduced
noise
into
the
dasymetric
model
if
all
POIs
were
used
.
</p>
<p>
The
residential
community
contained
POIs
representing
residential
buildings
,
apartments
,
and
hotels
,
where
people
lived
and
gathered
.
Wholesale
and
retail
,
education
service
,
and
resident
service
were
the
three
categories
of
POI
that
were
most
relevant
to
people
â€™s
daily
life
,
and
they
were
also
the
attraction
factors
for
residents
.
Therefore
,
all
the
PSP
categories
selected
through
the
spatial
association
rule
mining
were
closely
related
to
the
spatial
distribution
of
the
population
and
can
be
used
in
dasymetric
mapping
.

Population
Map
from
the
PSP-Driven
Model
</head>
<p>
A
RF-based
dasymetric
model
was
built
with
all
the
covariates
described
in
Section
3.2
.
This
model
was
used
to
downscale
the
log-transformed
population
density
in
each
county
.
The
fine-grained
population
map
was
built
by
back-transforming
the
result
of
the
dasymetric
model
.
</p>
<p>
<figure>
Figure
4
</figure>
shows
the
value
of
%IncMSE
for
each
covariate
in
the
RF
model
.
The
importance
of
covariates
to
the
PSPs
was
significantly
higher
than
those
of
most
other
the
covariates
,
which
shows
that
PSP
had
a
great
impact
on
the
accuracy
of
the
dasymetric
mapping
.
In
addition
to
the
covariates
related
to
the
PSPs
,
the
distance
to
the
nearest
build-up
area
,
DEM
and
NTL
also
has
a
large
impact
on
the
dasymetric
modelling
.
This
result
is
consistent
with
those
of
previous
studies
.
</p>
<p>
The
fine-gridded
population
map
at
a
100-m
spatial
scale
in
the
experiment
showed
visually
satisfactory
results
(
<figure>
Figure

)
.
<figure>
Figure

</figure>
a
shows
the
population
distribution
map
generated
by
the
PSP-driven
dasymetric
model
proposed
in
Section
3.2
.
As
a
comparison
,
the
WorldPop
(
<figure>
Figure

</figure>
b
)
and
the
LandScan
(
<figure>
Figure
5
</figure>
c
)
datasets
from
the
same
region
were
also
shown
.
Generally
,
the
distributions
of
the
population
from
three
datasets
were
similar
and
agreed
with
the
actual
topography
.
The
population
of
the
plains
and
urban
areas
in
the
southeast
was
significantly
higher
than
those
in
the
mountains
and
grasslands
in
the
northwest
.
The
population
was
concentrated
in
the
two
municipalities
of
Beijing
and
Tianjin
and
aggregated
in
second-tier
cities
such
as
Shijiazhuang
and
Tangshan
,
which
is
consistent
with
the
actual
population
distribution
.
Nevertheless
,
the
results
from
the
proposed
methods
also
highlight
the
population
gradient
around
small
towns
and
villages
.
