Golden
Week
is
avoided
by
many
international
travelers
because
of
the
challenges
of
navigating
crowded
transportation
and
attractions
.
The
busiest
days
are
May
3
,
when
many
people
leave
the
major
cities
,
and
May
5
and
6
,
when
they
returning
home
.
From
2019
,
the
government
has
proposed
to
extend
Golden
Week
to
include
April
30
and
May
1
to
mark
the
expected
abdication
of
the
Emperor
and
the
subsequent
succession
.
This
would
make
travel
impacts
harder
to
predict
.
</p>
<p>
Most
offices
in
Japan
close
during
Golden
Week
,
some
up
to
10
days
.
Make
sure
you
have
enough
cash
on
you
as
you
might
have
a
hard
time
withdrawing
money
.

or
azalea
flowers
,

or
cultural

Visit
Tokyo
</head>
<p>
Many
Tokyoites
vacation
elsewhere
during
Golden
Week
,
so
you
'll
have
shorter
waits
and
fewer
crowds
at
Tokyo
’s
restaurants
,
parks
,
museums
,
and
other
attractions
.
A
Hawaiian
festival
takes
place
in
Tokyo
during
Golden
Week
,
and
there
is
the
Spring
Grand
Festival
at
the
Meiji
Shrine

The
weather
is
typically
mild
during

outdoor
temperatures

However
,
flower
parks
may
be
crowded
with
people
going
to
see
the
azaleas
,
wisteria
,
and
tulips
.
