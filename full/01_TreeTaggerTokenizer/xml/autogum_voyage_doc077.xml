Ramat
Gan
</hi>
(
Hebrew
:
<hi rend="italic">
רמת
גן
</hi>
)
(
Translation
:
<hi rend="italic">
Garden
heights
</hi>
)
is
a
city
in
<ref target="Israel">
Israel
</ref>
,
to
the
immediate
east
of
<ref target="Tel%20Aviv">
Tel
Aviv
</ref>
,
which
almost
acts
as
an
extension
of
it
.
Ramat
Gan
is
an
eclectic
town
famous
for
many
things
totally
unrelated
to
each
other
,
including
diamonds
,
football
,
malls
,
chocolates
,
Iraqi
restaurants
,
a
religious
university
,
and
an
open-space
African
safari
with
lions
.
Small
green
public
gardens
are
plentiful
and
all
streets
are
tree-lined
.
</p>
<head>
Understand
</head>
<p>
Ramat
Gan
was
founded
in
1921
as
a
<hi rend="italic">
moshav
</hi>
(
a
communal
farming
community
)
.
Over
time
the
population
grew
as
Tel
Aviv
sprawled
,
and
today
the
population
exceeds
135,000
.
</p>
<p>
Northwest
Ramat
Gan
features
a
cluster
of
sparkling
skyscrapers
,
which
,
at
night
,
impresses
you
with
a
magnificent
Manhattan-style
skyline
.
There
,
you
will
find
the
tallest
building
in
Israel
(
75
floors
)
,
right
next
to
the
two
skyscrapers
comprising
of
the
diamond
stock
exchange
.
This
area
,
called
the
Boursa
,
turns
at
night
into
a
sleazy
collection
of
brothels
and
illegal
casinos
.
</p>
<p>
The
rest
of
the
city
,
just
like
its
name
,
is
residential
with
green
gardens
here
and
there
.
Some
embassies
(
including
the
EU
delegation
)
are
located
here
,
instead
of
Tel
Aviv
.
A
lot
of
political
wheeling
and
dealing
goes
on
at
the
Ramat
Gan
Sheraton
City
Towers
,
which
is
a
preferred
hang
out
for
Likud
Party
primaries
conferences
.
</p>
<p>
In
the
northeast
,
you
will
find
the
first
successful
shopping
mall
in
Israel
(
Kanyon
Ayalon
)
surrounded
by
huge
outlet
stores
.
Next
to
it
are
a
shooting
range
(
&quot;
mitvach
&quot;
)
,
the
biggest
soccer
stadium
in
the
country
,
and
the
Ramat
Gan
National
Park
.
</p>
<p>
On
the
southeast
side
of
town
is
Bar
Ilan
University
,
which
combines
university
studies
with
an
orientation
towards
the
religious
Jewish
community
.
</p>
<p>
Ramat
Gan
is
also
associated
with
chocolates
,
as
those
passing
by
the
&quot;
Elite
&quot;
factory
on
Jabotinski
Road
would
catch
sweet
whiffs
of
chocolate
in
the
blending
.
</p>
<p>
Last
but
not
least
,
Ramat
Gan
is
known
as
Baghdad
Town
.
Most
Jewish
immigrants
from
Iraq
settled
here
in
the
1950s
and
made
Ramat
Gan
their
home
.
As
a
result
,
many
Iraqi
restaurants
can
be
found
here
.

it
