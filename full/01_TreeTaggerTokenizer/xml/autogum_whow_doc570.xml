a
Dog
's
Pedigree
</head>
<p>
If
you
're
the
proud
owner
of
a
pedigreed
dog
,
it
's
important
to
understand
all
of
the
detailed
information
found
on
its
certificate
.
And
if
you
're
thinking
about
buying
a
dog
from
a
breeder
,
you
'll
want
to
see
its
pedigree
and
verify
the
information
found
on
it
.
The
dog
's
official
name
,
show
titles
,
and
registration
number
are
commonly
found
on
its
pedigree
.
The
document
will
also
list
similar
information
for
the
dog
's
ancestors
.
It
is
increasingly
common
for
them
to
also
include
DNA
and
health
identification
,
so
make
sure
to
check
the
certificate
for
this
information
,
too
.

Find
the
dog
's
registered
name
and
birth
date
.
The
dog
's
official
name
,
as
recorded
by
a
kennel
or
other
organization
,
will
definitely
appear
on
the
pedigree
.
Usually
it
will
appear
as
the
first
name
on
the
left
or
right
corner
,
along
with
the
date
of
birth
.

Identify
the
dog
's
ancestors
.
Most
of
the
time
,
the
names
of
the
dog
's
parents
will
be
just
to
the
right
.
A
pedigree
should
list
the
names
of
both
the
dam
(
mother
)
and
sire
(
father
)
.
Depending
on
the
pedigree
,
you
may
also
see
the
dog
's
grandparents
farther
to
the
right
,
then
the
great-grandparents
,
and
so
on
.

A
proper
pedigree
should
list
the
official
names
of
all
of
the
ancestors
.
Depending
upon
the
pedigree
report
and
the
known
ancestry
,
this
could
go
back
for
just
3
or
4
generations

or
may

several

Determine
whether
your
dog
has
been
inbred
,
line-bred
,
or
outcrossed
.
Pay
attention
to
the
names
of
the
dog
and
its
ancestors
.
If
you
see
repeated
names
,
it
is
a
sign
that
the
ancestors
were
closely
related
.
Breeders
maintain
and
perfect
the
characteristics
associated
with
particular
breeds
by
carefully
selecting
which
dogs
to
mate
.

Inbreeding
means
that
very
closely
related
dogs
have
mated
,
such
as
a
son
and
mother
,
father
and
daughter
,
or
brother
and
sister
.
</item>
<item>
Linebreeding
means
that
a
dog
's
sire
and
dam
have
a
close
ancestor
in
common
.
</item>
<item>
Out
crossing
occurs
when
there
are
no
common
ancestors
in
3
to
4
generations
.
</item>
<item>
Breeders
and
owners
often
highly

Check
for
DNA
numbers
.
Since
DNA
testing
has
become
easier
and
more
widespread
,
it
is
increasingly
common
for
numbers
identifying
a
dog
's
genetic
makeup
to
appear
on
a
pedigree
.
If
these
are
available
,
they
should
be
found
next
to
the
dog
's
name
.
<figure rend="Read a Dog's Pedigree Step 4 Version 3.jpg">

<item>
Each
dog
whose
DNA
has
been
officially
tested
and
registered
(
with
a
kennel
,
for
example
)
will
have
an
identifying
number
.
</item>

<item>
Study
the
stud
book
numbers
.
A
pedigree
may
also
list
when
a
dog
was
bred
,
and
which
of
the
dam
's
litters
the
dog
comes
from
.
These
are
known
as
stud
book
numbers
.
If
you
pay
attention
to
the
dam
's
birth
date
,
you
can
also
determine
how
old
she
was
when
she
had
the
litter
.
<figure rend="Read a Dog's Pedigree Step 5 Version 3.jpg">

For
example
,
if
the
dog
's
pedigree
lists
a
stud
book
date
of
2/2016
,
and
the
dam
's
date
of
birth
is
5/2013
,
you
can
determine
that
she
was
not
quite
3
years
old
when
she
had
the

Look
for
show
records
.
If
the
dog
or
its
ancestors
were
awarded
in
any
notable
competitions
,
these
will
probably
be
listed
on
the
pedigree
along
with
each
dog
's
name
.
These
may
simply
be
recorded
as
a
series
of
abbreviations

For

Decode
any
title
abbreviations

Many
breeds
can
be
awarded
special
titles
that
recognize
highly
desirable
traits
.
These
can
vary
from
breed
to
breed
,
and
can
be
difficult
to
interpret
unless
you
are
very
familiar
with
the
breed
.
Just
ask
the
breeder
or
kennel
association
to
explain
if
you
are
n't
sure
what
the
titles
mean
.

Study
any
health

Thanks
to
DNA

careful
breeding
records
,
pedigrees
can
include
information
about
any
health
issues
that
are
a
concern
for
a
dog
's
breed
.
This
information
can
include
whether
or
not
a
dog

its
ancestors
have
been
tested
for
genetic
diseases
that
are
known
to

Verify

Pedigrees
contain
quite
a
bit
of
information
that
can
determine
a
dog
's
value
,
eligibility
for
competitions
,
etc.
Certification
from
a
recognized
kennel
association
,
such
as
the
AKC
(
American
Kennel

helps
prove
that
the
pedigree

If

you
will
need
these

Keep

it

number
identifying
the

Contact
the
association
and
ask
to
cross-check
the
number
.
They
may
also
be
able
to
confirm
other
information

on

that

can

Do
n't
be
alarmed
by
a
conditional
registration
.
Some
pedigrees
may
be
marked
as
“
conditional
”
if
DNA
information
shows
there
is
an
unknown
ancestor
.
This
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
the
dog
cannot
be
considered
purebred
.
The
kennel
association
may
also
allow
the
conditional
status
to
be
removed
after
a
certain
number
of
generations
.

Check

Not
