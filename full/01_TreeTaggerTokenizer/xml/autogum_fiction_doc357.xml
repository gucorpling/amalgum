This
time
of
Levi
West
's
unwelcome
visitation
was
indeed
a
time
of
bitter
trouble
and
tribulation
to
poor
Hiram
White
.
Money
was
of
very
different
value
in
those
days
than
it
is
now
,
and
five
hundred
pounds
was
in
its
way
a
good
round
lump
--
in
Sussex
County
it
was
almost
a
fortune
.
It
was
a
desperate
struggle
for
Hiram
to
raise
the
amount
of
his
father
's
bequest
to
his
stepbrother
.
Squire
Hall
,
as
may
have
been
gathered
,
had
a
very
warm
and
friendly
feeling
for
Hiram
,
believing
in
him
when
all
others
disbelieved
;
nevertheless
,
in
the
matter
of
money
the
old
man
was
as
hard
and
as
cold
as
adamant
.
He
would
,
he
said
,
do
all
he
could
to
help
Hiram
,
but
that
five
hundred
pounds
must
and
should
be
raised
--
Hiram
must
release
his
security
bond
.
He
would
loan
him
,
he
said
,
three
hundred
pounds
,
taking
a
mortgage
upon
the
mill
.
He
would
have
lent
him
four
hundred
but
that
there
was
already
a
first
mortgage
of
one
hundred
pounds
upon
it
,
and
he
would
not
dare
to
put
more
than
three
hundred
more
atop
of
that
.
</p>
<p>
Hiram
had
a
considerable
quantity
of
wheat
which
he
had
bought
upon
speculation
and
which
was
then
lying
idle
in
a
Philadelphia
storehouse
.
This
he
had
sold
at
public
sale
and
at
a
very
great
sacrifice
;
he
realized
barely
one
hundred
pounds
upon
it
.
The
financial
horizon
looked
very
black
to
him
;
nevertheless
,
Levi
's
five
hundred
pounds
was
raised
,
and
paid
into
Squire
Hall
's
hands
,
and
Squire
Hall
released
Hiram
's
bond
.
</p>
<p>
The
business
was
finally
closed
on
one
cold
,
gray
afternoon
in
the
early
part
of
December
.
As
Hiram
tore
his
bond
across
and
then
tore
it
across
again
and
again
,
Squire
Hall
pushed
back
the
papers
upon
his
desk
and
cocked
his
feet
upon
its
slanting
top
.
&quot;
Hiram
,
&quot;
said
he
,
abruptly
,
&quot;
Hiram
,
do
you
know
that
Levi
West
is
forever
hanging
around
Billy
Martin
's
house
,
after
that
pretty
daughter
of
his
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
So
long
a
space
of
silence
followed
the
speech
that
the
Squire
began
to
think
that
Hiram
might
not
have
heard
him
.
But
Hiram
had
heard
.
&quot;
No
,
&quot;
said
he
,
&quot;
I
did
n't
know
it
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Well
,
he
is
,
&quot;
said
Squire
Hall
.
&quot;
It
's
the
talk
of
the
whole
neighborhood
.
The
talk
's
pretty
bad
,
too
.
D'ye
know
that
they
say
that
she
was
away
from
home
three
days
last
week
,
nobody
knew
where
?
The
fellow
's
turned
her
head
with
his
sailor
's
yarns
and
his
traveler
's
lies
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Hiram
said
not
a
word
,
but
he
sat
looking
at
the
other
in
stolid
silence
.
&quot;
That
stepbrother
of
yours
,
&quot;
continued
the
old
Squire
presently
,
&quot;
is
a
rascal
--
he
is
a
rascal
,
Hiram
,
and
I
mis-doubt
he
's
something
worse
.
I
hear
he
's
been
seen
in
some
queer
places
and
with
queer
company
of
late
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
He
stopped
again
,
and
still
Hiram
said
nothing
.
&quot;
And
look'ee
,
Hiram
,
&quot;
the
old
man
resumed
,
suddenly
,
&quot;
I
do
hear
that
you
be
courtin
'
the
girl
,
too
;
is
that
so
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Yes
,
&quot;
said
Hiram
,
&quot;
I
'm
courtin
'
her
,
too
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Tut
!
tut
!
&quot;
said
the
Squire
,
&quot;
that
's
a
pity
,
Hiram
.
I
'm
afraid
your
cakes
are
dough
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
After
he
had
left
the
Squire
's
office
,
Hiram
stood
for
a
while
in
the
street
,
bareheaded
,
his
hat
in
his
hand
,
staring
unwinkingly
down
at
the
ground
at
his
feet
,
with
stupidly
drooping
lips
and
lackluster
eyes
.
Presently
he
raised
his
hand
and
began
slowly
smoothing
down
the
sandy
shock
of
hair
upon
his
forehead
.
At
last
he
aroused
himself
with
a
shake
,
looked
dully
up
and
down
the
street
,
and
then
,
putting
on
his
hat
,
turned
and
walked
slowly
and
heavily
away
.
</p>
<p>
The
early
dusk
of
the
cloudy
winter
evening
was
settling
fast
,
for
the
sky
was
leaden
and
threatening
.
At
the
outskirts
of
the
town
Hiram
stopped
again
and
again
stood
for
a
while
in
brooding
thought
.
Then
,
finally
,
he
turned
slowly
,
not
the
way
that
led
homeward
,
but
taking
the
road
that
led
between
the
bare
and
withered
fields
and
crooked
fences
toward
Billy
Martin
's
.
</p>
<p>
It
would
be
hard
to
say
just
what
it
was
that
led
Hiram
to
seek
Billy
Martin
's
house
at
that
time
of
day
--
whether
it
was
fate
or
ill
fortune
.
He
could
not
have
chosen
a
more
opportune
time
to
confirm
his
own
undoing
.
What
he
saw
was
the
very
worst
that
his
heart
feared
.
</p>
<p>
Along
the
road
,
at
a
little
distance
from
the
house
,
was
a
mock-orange
hedge
,
now
bare
,
naked
,
leafless
.
As
Hiram
drew
near
he
heard
footsteps
approaching
and
low
voices
.
He
drew
back
into
the
fence
corner
and
there
stood
,
half
sheltered
by
the
stark
network
of
twigs
.
Two
figures
passed
slowly
along
the
gray
of
the
roadway
in
the
gloaming
.
One
was
his
stepbrother
,
the
other
was
Sally
Martin
.
Levi
's
arm
was
around
her
,
he
was
whispering
into
her
ear
,
and
her
head
rested
upon
his
shoulder
.
</p>
<p>
Hiram
stood
as
still
,
as
breathless
,
as
cold
as
ice
.
They
stopped
upon
the
side
of
the
road
just
beyond
where
he
stood
.
Hiram
's
eyes
never
left
them
.
There
for
some
time
they
talked
together
in
low
voices
,
their
words
now
and
then
reaching
the
ears
of
that
silent
,
breathless
listener
.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly
there
came
the
clattering
of
an
opening
door
,
and
then
Betty
Martin
's
voice
broke
the
silence
,
harshly
,
shrilly
:
&quot;
Sal
!
--
Sal
!
--
Sally
Martin
!
You
,
Sally
Martin
!
Come
in
yere
.
Where
be
ye
?
