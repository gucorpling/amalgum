I
'm
going
to
shit
on

finale

mostly
because
I

the

Complaints
:
1
.
The
evil
giant
demon
just
gets
one-shotted
by
the
kandurian
dagger
.
They
did
n't
test
the
mettle
of
man
,
they
tested
the
&quot;
metal
&quot;
of
that
damn
dagger
!
Who
cares
?
2
.
Revived
Kelly
has
no
Kelly-esque
lines
.
3
.
The
little
girl
Pablo
talks
to
is
completely
insignificant
;
we
already
like
Pablo
!
It
's
the
series
finale
,
why
are
you
awkwardly
introducing
us
to
Pablo
's
caring
nature
like
it
's
his
introduction
?
4
.
The
deadite
fights
in
the
sewer
and
basement
are
obligatory
and
joyless
.
Come
on
,
I
want
to
see
a
corpse
's
entrails
pull
Ash
's
head
up
into
it
's
butt
!
I
want
to
see
a
demon
baby
trapped
inside
a
fat
decapitated
Swedish
lady
by
two
bowling
balls
!
5
.
The
Mad
Max
future
ending
for
Ash
is
,
in
fact
,
kind
of
decent
.
Riding
off
into
the
sunset
is
the
correct
ending
,
and
they
did
an
okay
job
of
it
.
Still
mad
it
's
over
,
though
.
6
.
The
dark
ones
are
never
fleshed
out
in
any
way
,
and
have
virtually
no
screentime
or
backstory
.
They
just
kill
Ruby
,
our
nuanced
,
complicated
,
series-long
BBEG
.
Then
they
summon
a
handful
of
deadites
and
one
giant
monster
that
can
be
one-shot
by
a
weapon
they
already
know
that
Ash
has
!
Conspiracy
theory
:
the
dark
ones
are
actually
pro-human
.
7
.
Ash
'
newfound
nobility
is
awkward
at
best
.
It
's
not
out
of
character
,
it
's
just
lazily
written
.
8
.
God
dammit
I
love
this
show
please
make
more
.
Ash
can
retire
,
he
's
earned
it
.
But
the
ghostbeaters
have
to
persevere
!

I
also
hated
the
ending
,
but
not
for
the
same
reasons
.
Lazily
written
is
an
excellent
diagnosis
.
</p>
<p>
What
they
did
to
Kelly
's
character
was
particularly
annoying
.
She
wakes
up
from
death
and
<hi rend="bold">
apologizes
</hi>
to
Ash
for
not
being
the
badass
he
is
.
I
lost
count
of
the
number
of
times
she
bailed
him
out
of
trouble
in
past
seasons
,
and
not
defeating
Ruby
single-handed
was
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
(
Ash
could
n't
do
it
,
either
)
.
Totally
killed
my
respect
for
the
character
,
and
the
pointless
bit
with
her
shooting
deadites
in
anger
two
minutes
later
did
n't
revive
it
.
</p>
<p>
I
had
a
hard
time
believing
that
Ash
's
daughter
and
friends
,
who
stood
by
him
through
so
much
(
including
his
epic
thoughtlessness
and
stupidity
)
would
just
let
themselves
be
herded
into
a
truck
like
so
many
refugees
,
leaving
him
alone
to
the
fight
.
The
tank
stuff
was
funny
,
and
in
the
spirit
of
the
show
,
but
it
was
awfully
convenient
that
it
just
happened
to
be
there
.
Ash
defeating
the
Big
Evil
with
a
little
help
from
his
friends
would
not
have
diminished
the
character
(
not
much
there
to
diminish
in
the
first
place
)
and
would
have
been
more
satisfying
.
</p>
<p>
I
suppose
the
makers
were
hedging
their
bets
by
doing
this
,
and
having
the
other
characters
intact
implies
that
something
may
come
of
all
the
fan
bitching
for
more
.
However
,
I
believe
Bruce
Campbell
when
he
says
he
wants
out
.
Better
to
go
before
he
trades
in
the
boomstick
for
a
walking
stick
.
</p>
<p>
I
hated
the
Mad
Max
ending
at
first
,
on
the
principle
that
they
should
not
leave
us
wanting
more
when
we
know
that
we
're
not
getting
more
.
But
it
is
easy
to
reconcile
with
a
true
ending
.
Ash
died
,
and
he
went
to
Ash
Heaven
.
Boobs
,
bullets
,
hot
wheels
and
an
enemy
to
fight
;
what
else
would
it
look
like
?
I
'm
actually
kind
of
happy
for
him
.
