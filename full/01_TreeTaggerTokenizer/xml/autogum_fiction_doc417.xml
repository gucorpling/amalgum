IT
is
furthermore
remarkable
that
though
the
two
stories
are
distinct
—
my
own
,
as
it
were
,
and
this
other
—
they
equally
began
,
in
a
manner
,
the
first
night
of
my
acquaintance
with
Frank
Saltram
,
the
night
I
came
back
from
Wimbledon
so
agitated
with
a
new
sense
of
life
that
,
in
London
,
for
the
very
thrill
of
it
,
I
could
only
walk
home
.
Walking
and
swinging
my
stick
,
I
overtook
,
at
Buckingham
Gate
,
George
Gravener
,
and
George
Gravener
’s
story
may
be
said
to
have
begun
with
my
making
him
,
as
our
paths
lay
together
,
come
home
with
me
for
a
talk
.
I
duly
remember
,
let
me
parenthesise
,
that
it
was
still
more
that
of
another
person
,
and
also
that
several
years
were
to
elapse
before
it
was
to
extend
to
a
second
chapter
.
I
had
much
to
say
to
him
,
none
the
less
,
about
my
visit
to
the
Mulvilles
,
whom
he
more
indifferently
knew
,
and
I
was
at
any
rate
so
amusing
that
for
long
afterwards
he
never
encountered
me
without
asking
for
news
of
the
old
man
of
the
sea
.
I
had
n’t
said
Mr.
Saltram
was
old
,
and
it
was
to
be
seen
that
he
was
of
an
age
to
outweather
George
Gravener
.
I
had
at
that
time
a
lodging
in
Ebury
Street
,
and
Gravener
was
staying
at
his
brother
’s
empty
house
in
Eaton
Square
.
At
Cambridge
,
five
years
before
,
even
in
our
devastating
set
,
his
intellectual
power
had
seemed
to
me
almost
awful
.
Some
one
had
once
asked
me
privately
,
with
blanched
cheeks
,
what
it
was
then
that
after
all
such
a
mind
as
that
left
standing
.
“
It
leaves
itself
!
”
I
could
recollect
devoutly
replying
.
I
could
smile
at
present
for
this
remembrance
,
since
before
we
got
to
Ebury
Street
I
was
struck
with
the
fact
that
,
save
in
the
sense
of
being
well
set
up
on
his
legs
,
George
Gravener
had
actually
ceased
to
tower
.
The
universe
he
laid
low
had
somehow
bloomed
again
—
the
usual
eminences
were
visible
.
I
wondered
whether
he
had
lost
his
humour
,
or
only
,
dreadful
thought
,
had
never
had
any
—
not
even
when
I
had
fancied
him
most
Aristophanesque
.
What
was
the
need
of
appealing
to
laughter
,
however
,
I
could
enviously
enquire
,
where
you
might
appeal
so
confidently
to
measurement
?
Mr.
Saltram
’s
queer
figure
,
his
thick
nose
and
hanging
lip
,
were
fresh
to
me
:
in
the
light
of
my
old
friend
’s
fine
cold
symmetry
they
presented
mere
success
in
amusing
as
the
refuge
of
conscious
ugliness
.
Already
,
at
hungry
twenty-six
,
Gravener
looked
as
blank
and
parliamentary
as
if
he
were
fifty
and
popular
.
In
my
scrap
of
a
residence
—
he
had
a
worldling
’s
eye
for
its
futile
conveniences
,
but
never
a
comrade
’s
joke
—
I
sounded
Frank
Saltram
in
his
ears
;
a
circumstance
I
mention
in
order
to
note
that
even
then
I
was
surprised
at
his
impatience
of
my
enlivenment
.
As
he
had
never
before
heard
of
the
personage
it
took
indeed
the
form
of
impatience
of
the
preposterous
Mulvilles
,
his
relation
to
whom
,
like
mine
,
had
had
its
origin
in
an
early
,
a
childish
intimacy
with
the
young
Adelaide
,
the
fruit
of
multiplied
ties
in
the
previous
generation
.
When
she
married
Kent
Mulville
,
who
was
older
than
Gravener
and
I
and
much
more
amiable
,
I
gained
a
friend
,
but
Gravener
practically
lost
one
.
We
reacted
in
different
ways
from
the
form
taken
by
what
he
called
their
deplorable
social
action
—
the
form
(
the
term
was
also
his
)
of
nasty
second-rate
gush
.
I
may
have
held
in
my
‘
for
intérieur
’
that
the
good
people
at
Wimbledon
were
beautiful
fools
,
but
when
he
sniffed
at
them
I
could
n’t
help
taking
the
opposite
line
,
for
I
already
felt
that
even
should
we
happen
to
agree
it
would
always
be
for
reasons
that
differed
.
It
came
home
to
me
that
he
was
admirably
British
as
,
without
so
much
as
a
sociable
sneer
at
my
bookbinder
,
he
turned
away
from
the
serried
rows
of
my
little
French
library
.
</p>
<p>
“
Of
course
I
’ve
never
seen
the
fellow
,
but
it
’s
clear
enough
he
’s
a
humbug
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Clear
‘
enough
’
is
just
what
it
is
n’t
,
”
I
replied
;
“
if
it
only
were
!
”
That
ejaculation
on
my
part
must
have
been
the
beginning
of
what
was
to
be
later
a
long
ache
for
final
frivolous
rest
.
Gravener
was
profound
enough
to
remark
after
a
moment
that
in
the
first
place
he
could
n’t
be
anything
but
a
Dissenter
,
and
when
I
answered
that
the
very
note
of
his
fascination
was
his
extraordinary
speculative
breadth
my
friend
retorted
that
there
was
no
cad
like
your
cultivated
cad
,
and
that
I
might
depend
upon
discovering
—
since
I
had
had
the
levity
not
already
to
have
enquired
—
that
my
shining
light
proceeded
,
a
generation
back
,
from
a
Methodist
cheesemonger
.
I
confess
I
was
struck
with
his
insistence
,
and
I
said
,
after
reflexion
:
“
It
may
be
—
I
admit
it
may
be
;
but
why
on
earth
are
you
so
sure
?
”
—
asking
the
question
mainly
to
lay
him
the
trap
of
saying
that
it
was
because
the
poor
man
did
n’t
dress
for
dinner
.
He
took
an
instant
to
circumvent
my
trap
and
come
blandly
out
the
other
side
.
</p>
<p>
“
Because
the
Kent
Mulvilles
have
invented
him
.
They
’ve
an
infallible
hand
for
frauds
.
All
their
geese
are
swans
.
They
were
born
to
be
duped
,
they
like
it
,
they
cry
for
it
,
they
do
n’t
know
anything
from
anything
,
and
they
disgust
one
—
luckily
perhaps
!
—
with
Christian
charity
.
”
His
vehemence
was
doubtless
an
accident
,
but
it
might
have
been
a
strange
foreknowledge
.
I
forget
what
protest
I
dropped
;
it
was
at
any
rate
something
that
led
him
to
go
on
after
a
moment
:
“
I
only
ask
one
thing
—
it
’s
perfectly
simple
.
Is
a
man
,
in
a
given
case
,
a
real
gentleman
?
