Ozma
's
Prisoner
</head>
<p>
The
boy
was
so
bewildered
by
this
calamity
that
he
made
no
resistance
at
all
.
He
knew
very
well
he
was
guilty
,
but
it
surprised
him
that
Ozma
also
knew
it
.
He
wondered
how
she
had
found
out
so
soon
that
he
had
picked
the
six-leaved
clover
.
He
handed
his
basket
to
Scraps
and
said
:
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Keep
that
,
until
I
get
out
of
prison
.
If
I
never
get
out
,
take
it
to
the
Crooked
Magician
,
to
whom
it
belongs
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
Shaggy
Man
had
been
gazing
earnestly
in
the
boy
's
face
,
uncertain
whether
to
defend
him
or
not
;
but
something
he
read
in
Ojo
's
expression
made
him
draw
back
and
refuse
to
interfere
to
save
him
.
The
Shaggy
Man
was
greatly
surprised
and
grieved
,
but
he
knew
that
Ozma
never
made
mistakes
and
so
Ojo
must
really
have
broken
the
Law
of
Oz
.
</p>
<p>
The
Soldier
with
the
Green
Whiskers
now
led
them
all
through
the
gate
and
into
a
little
room
built
in
the
wall
.
Here
sat
a
jolly
little
man
,
richly
dressed
in
green
and
having
around
his
neck
a
heavy
gold
chain
to
which
a
number
of
great
golden
keys
were
attached
.
This
was
the
Guardian
of
the
Gate
and
at
the
moment
they
entered
his
room
he
was
playing
a
tune
upon
a
mouth-organ
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Listen
!
&quot;
he
said
,
holding
up
his
hand
for
silence
.
&quot;
I
've
just
composed
a
tune
called
'
The
Speckled
Alligator
.
'
It
's
in
patch-time
,
which
is
much
superior
to
rag-time
,
and
I
've
composed
it
in
honor
of
the
Patchwork
Girl
,
who
has
just
arrived
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
How
did
you
know
I
had
arrived
?
&quot;
asked
Scraps
,
much
interested
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
It
's
my
business
to
know
who
's
coming
,
for
I
'm
the
Guardian
of
the
Gate
.
Keep
quiet
while
I
play
you
'
The
Speckled
Alligator
.
'
&quot;
</p>
<p>
It
was
n't
a
very
bad
tune
,
nor
a
very
good
one
,
but
all
listened
respectfully
while
he
shut
his
eyes
and
swayed
his
head
from
side
to
side
and
blew
the
notes
from
the
little
instrument
.
When
it
was
all
over
the
Soldier
with
the
Green
Whiskers
said
:
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Guardian
,
I
have
here
a
prisoner
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Good
gracious
!
A
prisoner
?
&quot;
cried
the
little
man
,
jumping
up
from
his
chair
.
&quot;
Which
one
?
Not
the
Shaggy
Man
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
No
;
this
boy
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Ah
;
I
hope
his
fault
is
as
small
as
himself
,
&quot;
said
the
Guardian
of
the
Gate
.
&quot;
But
what
can
he
have
done
,
and
what
made
him
do
it
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Ca
n't
say
,
&quot;
replied
the
soldier
.
&quot;
All
I
know
is
that
he
has
broken
the
Law
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
But
no
one
ever
does
that
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Then
he
must
be
innocent
,
and
soon
will
be
released
.
I
hope
you
are
right
,
Guardian
.
Just
now
I
am
ordered
to
take
him
to
prison
.
Get
me
a
prisoner
's
robe
from
your
Official
Wardrobe
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
Guardian
unlocked
a
closet
and
took
from
it
a
white
robe
,
which
the
soldier
threw
over
Ojo
.
It
covered
him
from
head
to
foot
,
but
had
two
holes
just
in
front
of
his
eyes
,
so
he
could
see
where
to
go
.
In
this
attire
the
boy
presented
a
very
quaint
appearance
.
</p>
<p>
As
the
Guardian
unlocked
a
gate
leading
from
his
room
into
the
streets
of
the
Emerald
City
,
the
Shaggy
Man
said
to
Scraps
:
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
think
I
shall
take
you
directly
to
Dorothy
,
as
the
Scarecrow
advised
,
and
the
Glass
Cat
and
the
Woozy
may
come
with
us
.
Ojo
must
go
to
prison
with
the
Soldier
with
the
Green
Whiskers
,
but
he
will
be
well
treated
and
you
need
not
worry
about
him
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
What
will
they
do
with
him
?
&quot;
asked
Scraps
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
That
I
cannot
tell
.
Since
I
came
to
the
Land
of
Oz
no
one
has
ever
been
arrested
or
imprisoned
--
until
Ojo
broke
the
Law
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Seems
to
me
that
girl
Ruler
of
yours
is
making
a
big
fuss
over
nothing
,
&quot;
remarked
Scraps
,
tossing
her
yarn
hair
out
of
her
eyes
with
a
jerk
of
her
patched
head
.
&quot;
I
do
n't
know
what
Ojo
has
done
,
but
it
could
n't
be
anything
very
bad
,
for
you
and
I
were
with
him
all
the
time
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
Shaggy
Man
made
no
reply
to
this
speech
and
presently
the
Patchwork
Girl
forgot
all
about
Ojo
in
her
admiration
of
the
wonderful
city
she
had
entered
.
</p>
<p>
They
soon
separated
from
the
Munchkin
boy
,
who
was
led
by
the
Soldier
with
the
Green
Whiskers
down
a
side
street
toward
the
prison
.
Ojo
felt
very
miserable
and
greatly
ashamed
of
himself
,
but
he
was
beginning
to
grow
angry
because
he
was
treated
in
such
a
disgraceful
manner
.
Instead
of
entering
the
splendid
Emerald
City
as
a
respectable
traveler
who
was
entitled
to
a
welcome
and
to
hospitality
,
he
was
being
brought
in
as
a
criminal
,
handcuffed
and
in
a
robe
that
told
all
he
met
of
his
deep
disgrace
.
</p>
<p>
Ojo
was
by
nature
gentle
and
affectionate
and
if
he
had
disobeyed
the
Law
of
Oz
it
was
to
restore
his
dear
Unc
Nunkie
to
life
.
His
fault
was
more
thoughtless
than
wicked
,
but
that
did
not
alter
the
fact
that
he
had
committed
a
fault
.
At
first
he
had
felt
sorrow
and
remorse
,
but
the
more
he
thought
about
the
unjust
treatment
he
had
received
--
unjust
merely
because
he
considered
it
so
--
the
more
he
resented
his
arrest
,
blaming
Ozma
for
making
foolish
laws
and
then
punishing
folks
who
broke
them
.
Only
a
six-leaved
clover
!
A
tiny
green
plant
growing
neglected
and
trampled
under
foot
.
What
harm
could
there
be
in
picking
it
?
Ojo
began
to
think
Ozma
must
be
a
very
bad
and
oppressive
Ruler
for
such
a
lovely
fairyland
as
Oz
.
The
Shaggy
Man
said
the
people
loved
her
;
but
how
could
they
?
