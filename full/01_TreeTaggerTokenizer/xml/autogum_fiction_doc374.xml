I
looked
at
the
man
awhile
in
solid
astonishment
;
then
I
says
—
</head>
<p>
“
Now
,
I
hope
you
do
n’t
take
it
as
an
offence
,
for
I
do
n’t
mean
any
,
but
really
,
for
a
man
that
has
been
in
the
Kingdom
as
long
as
I
reckon
you
have
,
you
do
seem
to
know
powerful
little
about
its
customs
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Its
customs
!
”
says
he
.
“
Heaven
is
a
large
place
,
good
friend
.
Large
empires
have
many
and
diverse
customs
.
Even
small
dominions
have
,
as
you
doubtless
know
by
what
you
have
seen
of
the
matter
on
a
small
scale
in
the
Wart
.
How
can
you
imagine
I
could
ever
learn
the
varied
customs
of
the
countless
kingdoms
of
heaven
?
It
makes
my
head
ache
to
think
of
it
.
I
know
the
customs
that
prevail
in
those
portions
inhabited
by
peoples
that
are
appointed
to
enter
by
my
own
gate
—
and
hark
ye
,
that
is
quite
enough
knowledge
for
one
individual
to
try
to
pack
into
his
head
in
the
thirty-seven
millions
of
years
I
have
devoted
night
and
day
to
that
study
.
But
the
idea
of
learning
the
customs
of
the
whole
appalling
expanse
of
heaven
—
O
man
,
how
insanely
you
talk
!
Now
I
do
n’t
doubt
that
this
odd
costume
you
talk
about
is
the
fashion
in
that
district
of
heaven
you
belong
to
,
but
you
wo
n’t
be
conspicuous
in
this
section
without
it
.
”
</p>
<p>
I
felt
all
right
,
if
that
was
the
case
,
so
I
bade
him
good-day
and
left
.
All
day
I
walked
towards
the
far
end
of
a
prodigious
hall
of
the
office
,
hoping
to
come
out
into
heaven
any
moment
,
but
it
was
a
mistake
.
That
hall
was
built
on
the
general
heavenly
plan
—
it
naturally
could
n’t
be
small
.
At
last
I
got
so
tired
I
could
n’t
go
any
farther
;
so
I
sat
down
to
rest
,
and
begun
to
tackle
the
queerest
sort
of
strangers
and
ask
for
information
,
but
I
did
n’t
get
any
;
they
could
n’t
understand
my
language
,
and
I
could
not
understand
theirs
.
I
got
dreadfully
lonesome
.
I
was
so
down-hearted
and
homesick
I
wished
a
hundred
times
I
never
had
died
.
I
turned
back
,
of
course
.
About
noon
next
day
,
I
got
back
at
last
and
was
on
hand
at
the
booking-office
once
more
.
Says
I
to
the
head
clerk
—
</p>
<p>
“
I
begin
to
see
that
a
man
’s
got
to
be
in
his
own
Heaven
to
be
happy
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Perfectly
correct
,
”
says
he
.
“
Did
you
imagine
the
same
heaven
would
suit
all
sorts
of
men
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Well
,
I
had
that
idea
—
but
I
see
the
foolishness
of
it
.
Which
way
am
I
to
go
to
get
to
my
district
?
”
</p>
<p>
He
called
the
under
clerk
that
had
examined
the
map
,
and
he
gave
me
general
directions
.
I
thanked
him
and
started
;
but
he
says
—
</p>
<p>
“
Wait
a
minute
;
it
is
millions
of
leagues
from
here
.
Go
outside
and
stand
on
that
red
wishing-carpet
;
shut
your
eyes
,
hold
your
breath
,
and
wish
yourself
there
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
’m
much
obliged
,
”
says
I
;
“
why
did
n’t
you
dart
me
through
when
I
first
arrived
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
We
have
a
good
deal
to
think
of
here
;
it
was
your
place
to
think
of
it
and
ask
for
it
.
Good-by
;
we
probably
sha’
n’t
see
you
in
this
region
for
a
thousand
centuries
or
so
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
In
that
case
,
<hi rend="italic">
o
revoor
</hi>
,
”
says
I.
</p>
<p>
I
hopped
onto
the
carpet
and
held
my
breath
and
shut
my
eyes
and
wished
I
was
in
the
booking-office
of
my
own
section
.
The
very
next
instant
a
voice
I
knew
sung
out
in
a
business
kind
of
a
way
—
</p>
<p>
“
A
harp
and
a
hymn-book
,
pair
of
wings
and
a
halo
,
size
13
,
for
Cap’n
Eli
Stormfield
,
of
San
Francisco
!
—
make
him
out
a
clean
bill
of
health
,
and
let
him
in
.
”
</p>
<p>
I
opened
my
eyes
.
Sure
enough
,
it
was
a
Pi
Ute
Injun
I
used
to
know
in
Tulare
County
;
mighty
good
fellow
—
I
remembered
being
at
his
funeral
,
which
consisted
of
him
being
burnt
and
the
other
Injuns
gauming
their
faces
with
his
ashes
and
howling
like
wildcats
.
He
was
powerful
glad
to
see
me
,
and
you
may
make
up
your
mind
I
was
just
as
glad
to
see
him
,
and
feel
that
I
was
in
the
right
kind
of
a
heaven
at
last
.
</p>
<p>
Just
as
far
as
your
eye
could
reach
,
there
was
swarms
of
clerks
,
running
and
bustling
around
,
tricking
out
thousands
of
Yanks
and
Mexicans
and
English
and
Arabs
,
and
all
sorts
of
people
in
their
new
outfits
;
and
when
they
gave
me
my
kit
and
I
put
on
my
halo
and
took
a
look
in
the
glass
,
I
could
have
jumped
over
a
house
for
joy
,
I
was
so
happy
.
“
Now
<hi rend="italic">
this
</hi>
is
something
like
!
”
says
I.
“
Now
,
”
says
I
,
“
I
’m
all
right
—
show
me
a
cloud
.
”
</p>
<p>
Inside
of
fifteen
minutes
I
was
a
mile
on
my
way
towards
the
cloud-banks
and
about
a
million
people
along
with
me
.
Most
of
us
tried
to
fly
,
but
some
got
crippled
and
nobody
made
a
success
of
it
.
So
we
concluded
to
walk
,
for
the
present
,
till
we
had
had
some
wing
practice
.
</p>
<p>
We
begun
to
meet
swarms
of
folks
who
were
coming
back
.
Some
had
harps
and
nothing
else
;
some
had
hymn-books
and
nothing
else
;
some
had
nothing
at
all
;
all
of
them
looked
meek
and
uncomfortable
;
one
young
fellow
had
n’t
anything
left
but
his
halo
,
and
he
was
carrying
that
in
his
hand
;
all
of
a
sudden
he
offered
it
to
me
and
says
—
