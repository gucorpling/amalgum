Introduction
</head>
<p>
Influenza
A
virus
(
IAV
)
,
a
member
of
the
Orthomyxoviridae
family
,
is
a
negative-sense
,
single-stranded
,
enveloped
,
segmented
RNA
virus
.
IAV
usually
infects
epithelial
cells
of
the
upper
and
lower
respiratory
tracts
,
including
the
nasal
mucosa
,
trachea
,
and
lungs
,
with
no
evident
symptoms
during
the
early
phase
of
infection
.
Once
an
influenza
virus
invasion
occurs
,
innate
immunity
is
activated
,
and
interferons
are
secreted
by
host
cells
to
limit
the
early
viral
proliferation
.
Then
,
adaptive
immunity
is
activated
by
other
cytokines
produced
during
viral
infection
.
However
,
in
some
cases
,
highly
pathogenic
influenza
viruses
induce
cytokine
storms
,
a
consequence
of
excessive
production
of
cytokines
and
interferon
,
resulting
in
infections
and
even
death
.
</p>
<p>
To
facilitate
virus
replication
in
the
host
cells
,
IAV
has
evolved
strategies
to
block
the
innate
and
adaptive
immune
responses
of
the
host
cells
and
seize
organelles
from
host
cells
to
synthesize
a
large
number
of
metabolites
required
for
viral
reproduction
,
as
well
as
energy
for
the
packaging
of
the
virus
.
Enveloped
,
non-enveloped
,
DNA
and
RNA
viruses
share
lipid
metabolites
in
their
replication
cycles
to
induce
the
formation
of
new
cytoplasmic
membrane
structures
,
which
contribute
to
the
replication
and
packaging
of
the
viral
genome
.
Lipid
metabolism
also
can
block
the
innate
immune
response
of
host
cells
to
ensure
the
large-scale
replication
of
the
virus
.
Therefore
,
IAV
infection
is
linked
closely
to
metabolism
,
and
the
proliferation
of
the
virus
also
is
inseparable
from
the
host
metabolism
.
This
changing
trend
in
small
molecule
metabolites
may
serve
as
a
characterization
of
host
–
pathogen
interactions
to
monitor
immune
status
.
</p>
<p>
Although
significant
progress
has
been
made
toward
an
anti-influenza
virus
drug
discovery
,
including
M2
ion
channel
blockers
,
neuraminidase
inhibitors
,
and
polymerase
inhibitors
,
challenges
posed
by
drug
toxicity
and
viruses
with
genetic
resistance
remain
a
serious
problem
.
Previous
research
demonstrated
the
metabolic
effects
of
influenza
virus
infection
in
Madin
–
Darby
canine
kidney
(
MDCK
)
cells
,
displaying
the
intra-
and
extra-cellular
metabolite
profiling
upon
IAV
infection
.
Little
is
known
,
however
,
about
the
systemic
metabolic
dynamics
during
the
early
stage
of
virus
infection
.
During
our
study
,
we
analyze
changes
in
metabolism
upon
influenza
virus
infection
in
human
cells
during
the
first
infectious
cycle
via
metabolomics
.
Early
metabolite
analysis
will
throw
new
light
on
the
activation
of
the
innate
immune
metabolism
.
We
believe
that
the
results
of
this
work
will
elucidate
the
activation
of
innate
immunity
to
viral
infection
from
the
perspective
of
the
host
and
provide
new
control
strategies
for
the
development
of
novel
drugs
and
the
treatment
and
prevention
of
influenza
virus
infection
.
