Introduction
</head>
<p>
With
the
development
of
the
economy
and
improvements
in
quality
of
life
,
the
demand
for
energy
is
increasing
.
Meanwhile
,
the
exploitation
and
utilization
of
irreproducible
fossil
fuels
worldwide
has
made
energy
crises
,
environmental
pollution
,
and
global
warming
increasingly
prominent
.
Thus
,
there
is
an
urgent
need
to
seek
a
renewable
and
clean
energy
source
as
an
alternative
.
To
date
,
hydrogen
energy
has
been
regarded
as
an
ideal
alternative
energy
source
because
of
the
clean
byproduct
(
i.
e.
,
water
vapor
)
produced
from
its
reaction
with
oxygen
and
the
varieties
of
production
methods
.
Among
the
various
production
methods
,
the
photobiological
hydrogen
production
of
microorganisms
is
considered
to
be
an
important
potential
method
,
since
hydrogen
production
processes
are
operated
at
ambient
temperatures
and
pressures
.
</p>
<p>
The
photobiological
hydrogen
production
processes
of
microorganisms
can
be
classified
as
follows
:
<list>
<item>
Photolysis
of
water
using
algae
and
cyanobacteria
.
For
green
algae
,
the
electrons
are
derived
from
water
under
the
light
and
used
to
reduce
protons
,
to
produce
a
hydrogen
molecule
with
hydrogenase
enzymes
in
a
hydrogen
production
process
.
However
,
for
cyanobacteria
and
blue-green
algae
,
the
electrons
from
the
photolysis
process
of
water
are
first
converted
into
organic
molecules
.
Then
,
these
organic
molecules
are
degraded
and
the
electrons
are
used
by
the
hydrogenase
and/or
nitrogenase
enzymes
to
produce
hydrogen
.
</item>
<item>
Photodecomposition
of
organic
compounds
by
photosynthetic
bacteria
.
For
hydrogen
production
of
photosynthetic
bacteria
,
the
electrons
are
derived
from
external
organic
medium
of
photosynthetic
bacteria
in
photo-fermentation
and
are
used
by
nitrogenase
to
generate
H2
.
</item>
</list>
</p>
<p>
In
the
processes
of
photobiological
hydrogen
production
of
cyanobacteria
,
levels
of
around
30
%
O2
in
the
mixed
gases
with
H2
is
dangerous
for
the
system
.
In
addition
,
the
processes
of
hydrogen
production
of
photosynthetic
bacteria
cause
water
pollution
and
CO2
emissions
.
In
photobiological
H2
production
system
of
green
algae
,
hydrogenase
is
particularly
sensitive
to
O2
.
Melis
et
al.
showed
that
pure
hydrogen
production
can
be
achieved
by
Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii
under
sulfur
deprivation
.
This
means
that
the
oxygen
inhibition
of
hydrogenase
and
the
danger
of
gases
mixed
with
H2
and
O2
can
be
avoided
.
In
fact
,
the
photobiological
H2
production
process
of
C.
reinhardtii
can
generally
be
divided
into
three
phases
.
In
the
first
phase
,
C.
reinhardtii
grows
through
ordinary
photosynthesis
.
In
the
second
phase
,
C.
reinhardtii
is
cultured
in
a
sulfur-deprived
medium
,
and
O2
production
is
slowed
down
.
In
the
third
phase
,
the
anaerobic
state
of
cells
is
achieved
by
sulfur
deprivation
,
and
cells
produce
pure
hydrogen
.
Until
now
,
the
Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii
has
been
regarded
as
a
potential
best
candidate
for
photobiological
hydrogen
production
,
because
of
its
abilities
to
absorb
CO2
and
large
photosynthetic
efficiency
,
which
are
larger
than
higher
plants
(
e.
g.
,
tree
or
sugar
cane
)
.
Moreover
,
the
hydrogen
production
of
C.
reinhardtii
has
been
studied
extensively
,
and
this
means
that
mass
data
experimental
data
,
radiation
characteristics
and
characteristic
parameters
of
the
photobiological
H2
production
model
can
be
used
as
a
reference
.
Therefore
,
the
investigation
of
C.
reinhardtii
CC125
,
commonly
used
in
H2
production
,
was
chosen
to
theoretically
study
the
photobiological
hydrogen
production
process
of
the
photobioreactors
in
the
present
work
.
</p>
<p>
Photobioreactors
(
PBR
)
are
enclosures
used
to
cultivate
microorganisms
that
utilize
light
as
their
energy
source
for
their
growth
and
subsequent
product
formation
.
Recently
,
numerous
numerical
simulations
of
the
H2
production
process
in
the
PBR
have
been
studied
extensively
for
optimizing
the
design
,
operation
,
and
performance
of
the
PBRs
.
Aiba
simulated
the
distribution
and
absorptance
of
light
intensity
of
a
one-dimensional
plane-parallel
photobioreactor
with
microalgae
Rhodopseudomonas
spheroides
.
Berberoglu
and
Pilon
investigated
the
effect
of
a
mixed
culture
with
C.
reinhardtii
CC125
and
R.
sphearoides
ATCC
49419
on
the
conversion
efficiency
of
solar
energy
to
hydrogen
energy
and
hydrogen
productivity
in
plane-parallel
PBR
.
Murphy
and
Berberoglu
calculated
the
productivity
of
a
C.
reinhardtii
wild
strain
and
transformant
tla1
in
plane-parallel
PBRs
coupling
the
light
transfer
model
with
photosynthetic
rate
model
.
In
addition
,
the
local
specific
and
total
oxygen
production
as
a
function
of
optical
thickness
at
different
incident
irradiances
was
calculated
in
plane-parallel
PBRs
.
Wheaton
and
Krishnamoorthy
simulated
light
transfer
coupled
with
fluid
hydrodynamics
in
an
air-lift
tubular
photobioreactor
illuminated
from
inside
by
fluorescent
lamps
.
Slegers
et
al.
simulated
outdoor
vertical
flat-plate
PBRs
containing
Phaeodactylum
tricornutum
or
Thalassiosira
pseudonana
of
continuous
culture
.
Moreover
,
the
effect
of
PBR
thickness
and
biomass
concentration
on
the
volumetric
productivity
has
been
studied
.
Pruvost
et
al.
simulated
outdoor
inclined
rectangular
PBR
illuminated
by
solar
irradiance
with
cyanobacterium
Arthrospira
platensis
of
continuous
cultivation
,
and
the
calculation
of
the
areal
biomass
productivity
per
unit
surface
area
is
based
on
light
transfer
model
and
growth
kinetics
model
.
Lee
et
al.
demonstrated
that
it
is
necessary
to
optimize
light
intensity
,
cell
density
,
and
the
optical
thickness
of
the
PBR
for
maximizing
microalgal
productivity
for
a
given
microalgae
species
in
the
process
of
design
and
operation
of
PBR
.
Moreover
,
they
obtained
qualitative
guidelines
from
experimental
studies
.
Zhang
et
al.
investigated
the
effect
of
solar
irradiation
,
microalgae
concentration
and
bubbles
scattering
on
photobiological
hydrogen
production
in
the
close
plane-parallel
PBRs
.
