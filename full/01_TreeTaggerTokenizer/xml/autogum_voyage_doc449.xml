Imagine
200
years
ago
,
walking
all
around
the
tropical
Colombian
swamp
and
forests
searching
for
a
way
towards
the
sea
,
to
be
free
of
corrupt
civilizations
and
to
start
your
own
.
To
discover
a
river
and
a
beautiful
and
fertile
land
.
Tired
of
traveling
you
decide
that
this
is
the
place
where
you
want
to
settle
and
raise
a
family
.
</p>
<p>
This
happened
to
Jose
Arcadio
Buendía
and
his
wife
Ursula
in
Gabriel
Garcia
Marquez
’s
masterpiece
<hi rend="italic">
100
Years
of
Solitude
</hi>
when
those
free
souls
with
their
friends
founded
Macondo
,
the
imaginary
town
that
&quot;
does
not
exist
&quot;
.

the
world
,
Macondo
’s
entrance
is
still
invisible
