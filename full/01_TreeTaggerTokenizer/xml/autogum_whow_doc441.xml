Become
an
Apartment
Building
Superintendent
</head>
<p>
An
apartment
building
superintendent
is
in
charge
of
the
overall
maintenance
of
the
building
.
The
superintendent
takes
care
of
routine
maintenance
,
keeps
the
public
areas
clean
,
handles
minor
repairs
and
is
in
charge
of
hiring
and
supervising
outside
contractors
brought
in
for
bigger
jobs
he
ca
n't
handle
.
The
superintendent
often
gets
the
free
use
of
an
apartment
complete
with
utilities
.
Many
often
get
a
salary
on
top
of
this
although
typically
it
is
not
a
large
sum
.
Many
apartment
building
owners
prefer
to
hire
couples
as
their
apartment
managers
,
especially
for
larger
buildings
,
but
there
is
no
reason
a
single
person
would
not
be
hired
as
long
as
this
person
has
the
proper
training
and
background
.

<list type="ordered">
<item>
Educate
yourself
.
You
need
a
minimum
of
a
high
school
diploma
as
well
as
a
working
knowledge
of
mechanical
and
electrical
maintenance
.
This
training
is
often
offered
at
vocational
training
schools
or
through
community
colleges
.
Some
colleges
offer
degrees
in
property
management
,
and
building
owners
will
often
choose
the
college
graduate
over
others
with
less
formal
training
.

Hone
your
people
skills
.
An
apartment
superintendent
needs
to
work
with
many
people
from
all
walks
of
life
.
The
superintendent
must
be
diplomatic
,
but
able
to
settle
disputes
between
tenants
so
both
parties
are
satisfied
and
coordinate
repair
work
schedules
to
the
best
advantage
of
the
tenants
while
still
providing
the
contractor
with
adequate
access
to
the
job
site
.

<list type="unordered">
<item>
Serving
an
apprenticeship
with
a
professional
janitorial
service
company
can
be
invaluable
experience
,
especially
when
working
in
a
very
large
apartment
building
.
The
professionals
have
worked
for
years
in
time-management
research
to
allow
them
to
complete
the
largest
amount
of
work
in
the
shortest
amount
of
time
.
</item>
<item>
When
making
your
resume
,
try
to
get
personal
references
that
emphasize
your
honesty
and
dependability
.
These
could
come
from
your
former
employer
or
perhaps
the
leader
of
your
church
.
Building
owners
often
give
their
apartment
superintendents
access
to
bank
accounts
with
huge
sums
of
money
going
through
them
in
the
form
of
rents
and
payouts
to
outside
contractors
.

considered
as
part
of
your
earnings
.
