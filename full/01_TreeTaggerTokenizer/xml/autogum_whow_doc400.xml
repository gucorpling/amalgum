Pattachitra
</head>
<p>
Considering
the
medium
,
the
paintings
of
Odisha
can
be
divided
into
three
categories
:

on
cloth
or
canvas
is
known
as
'
Patta
Chitra
'
;
paintings
on
walls
is
called
'
Bhitti
Chitra
'
;
and
painting
on
palm
leaf
,
where
art
is
engraved
with
a
sharply
pointed
slender
piece
of
metal
,
namely
'
Lekhani
'
,
is
called
'
TalaPatra
Chitra
'
or
'
Pothi
Chitra
'
.
Pattachitra
represents
a
vigorous
style
of
dexterous
play
of
bold
lines
and
bright
hues
which
is
quite
captivating
to
the
eye
.

Prepare
the
canvas
.
The
process
of
painting
Pattachitra
begins
with
the
preparation
of
the
canvas
.
Traditionally
,
cotton
canvas
was
used
,
but
now
most
of
the
Chitrakaras
(
artists
of
Odisha
)
use
silk
cloths
since
they
are
much
softer
than
the
cotton
.
<list type="unordered">

the
cloth
in
a
solution
of
crushed
imli
seeds
and
water
for
4-5
days
.
</item>
<item>
Dry
the
cloth
in
the
sunlight
.
</item>

both
sides
of
the
cloth
with
a
paste
of

Prepare
the
colours
.
The
artists
create
a
variety
of
colors
from
natural
elements
,
though
nowadays
,
synthetic
primary
colors
are
used
to
produce
a
set
of
secondary
and
tertiary
colors
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
A
white
colour
is
prepared
by
grinding
mollusk
and
conch
shells
.
</item>
<item>
A
stone
called
Haritala
is
used
for
yellow
.
</item>
<item>
Blue
is
prepared
from
indigo
.
</item>
<item>
Black

Draw
borders
along
the
four
sides
of
the
canvas
.
Bordering
a
canvas
gives
a
perfect
look
to
the
entire
art
.
Border
may
contain
two
or
three
lines
according
to
their
size
.
Later
,
the
border
can
obtain
a
colorful
appearance
through
the
detailed
work
of
the
artist
.

Draw
outlines
of
the
figures
with
pencil
.
The
typical
name
of
this
procedure
is
called
'
Tipanā
'
(
ଟିପଣା
)
,
which
implies
the
process
of
making
a
well-defined
skeletal
sketch
on
the
canvas

Start
filling
in
the
hues
.
Coloring
the
Pattachitra
accommodates
various
steps
.
<list type="unordered">

The
first
step
is
'
Hingula
Banaka'(ହିଙ୍ଗୁଳା
ବନକ
)
,
which
means
filling
in
red
since
traditionally
red
is
used
for

colours

'
(

ଲାଗି
)
.
It
involves
the
coloring
of

features
to
the
Pattachitra
.

If
you
are
a
beginner
you
do
n't
need
to
be
worried
about
the
above
method
of
preparation
of
colors
.
You
can
simply
buy
synthetic
colors
available
at
a
market
and
you
can
get
different
shades
of
colors
by
mixing
those
primary
colors
with
each
other
.
For

,
a
combination
of
red
and
white
