<p>
In
Haldimand-Norfolk
,
the
three
hottest
topics
in
this
election
are
the
impasse
over
land
claims
in
Caledonia
,
the
state
of
agriculture
and
food
policy
,
and
health
care
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Land
Claims
</hi>
</p>
<p>
I
will
make
the
impasse
in
Caledonia
a
cabinet
priority
.
This
dispute
is
a
federal
problem
that
requires
a
federal
response
.
Negotiations
must
happen
with
frequency
,
and
I
will
ensure
that
interim
targets
are
established
and
met
within
a
timeline
.
I
will
do
more
to
ensure
this
dispute
is
resolved
,
and
ensure
that
the
Federal
,
Provincial
and
local
governments
work
together
with
Police
Services
to
resolve
this
impasse
in
a
timely
manner
.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Agriculture
and
Food
Policy
</hi>
</p>
<p>
We
need
a
food
policy
that
puts
Canadian
farmers
first
.
I
will
fight
for
a
national
food
strategy
that
prioritizes
Canadian
farming
by
promoting
local
agriculture
,
food
safety
and
food
security
.
Canadians
should
be
encouraged
to
buy
local
food
stuffs
,
however
,
we
have
to
ensure
they
are
protected
from
food-born
illnesses
.
The
government
must
do
more
to
support
farmers
and
to
keep
our
food
supply
safe
.
</p>
<p>
I
believe
in
the
wheat
board
and
support
supply
management
.
Farm
programs
should
be
simplified
and
made
transparent
.
The
Conservative
government
has
marginalized
the
farming
communities
it
claims
to
represent
.
We
need
concrete
support
for
our
farmers
and
a
real
solution
for
tobacco
producers
,
not
more
politics
and
posturing
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Health
Care
</hi>
</p>
<p>
Families
in
Haldimand-Norfolk
deserve
quality
health
care
.
As
a
medical
doctor
,
I
understand
the
challenges
facing
our
communities
,
including
a
lack
of
physicians
,
long
wait
times
and
spiraling
drug
costs
.
The
size
of
your
bank
account
should
not
be
the
determinant
of
the
quality
of
care
you
receive
.
We
will
continue
to
fight
to
ensure
that
the
future
of
health
care
does
not
follow
this
course
.
Our
health
care
system
should
remain
publicly-funded
and
properly
funded
.
</p>
<p>
All
patients
have
a
fundamental
right
to
receive
access
to
timely
care
for
necessary
medical
services
.
It
is
unacceptable
that
too
many
Canadians
are
without
a
family
physician
.
Wait
times
in
emergency
rooms
or
for
important
diagnoses
are
too
long
because
there
are
n't
enough
nurses
or
other
medical
professionals
to
keep
up
with
the
increasing
needs
.
With
an
aging
population
we
need
a
plan
to
ensure
greater
access
to
health
care
professionals
.
I
will
work
hard
to
attract
new
doctors
and
bring
better
health
services
to
our
communities
.
I
will
support
the
Liberal
Doctors
and
Nurses
Fund
,
which
will
invest
$
420
million
to
ensure
all
Canadians
have
access
to
a
medical
professional
.
I
will
also
work
to
ensure
that
the
goals
of
the
National
Pharmaceuticals
Strategy
are
achieved
,
namely
catastrophic
drug
coverage
.
</p>

<hi rend="bold">
Are
there
any
misconceptions
about
you
,
your
leader
,
or
your
party
and
platform
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
I
think
there
are
several
misconceptions
about
Stéphane
Dion
.
He
is
a
strong
,
thoughtful
leader
who
is
genuine
in
his
desire
to
serve
the
best
interests
of
Canadians
.
Throughout
the
Liberal
leadership
campaign
,
his
integrity
was
never
questioned
.
