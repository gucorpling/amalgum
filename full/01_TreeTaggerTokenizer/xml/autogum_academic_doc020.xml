Introduction
</head>
<p>
Phenotypic
plasticity
and
local
adaptation
are
two
major
mechanisms
of
response
to
dynamic
environmental
conditions
.
These
mechanisms
appear
under
different
population
parameters
and
selection
regimes
.
In
changing
environments
,
phenotypic
plasticity
allows
organisms
to
conserve
their
genotypes
and
still
produce
alternative
phenotypes
,
in
contrast
to
local
adaptations
that
incorporate
changes
at
the
genetic
level
producing
long-lasting
phenotypes
and
resulting
in
higher
fitness
in
home
habitats
.
In
theory
,
locally
adapted
traits
are
established
via
strong
natural
selection
—
even
under
conditions
of
high
gene
flow
between
locally
and
non-locally
adapted
populations
.
In
this
situation
,
natural
selection
should
also
favour
prezygotic
isolation
mechanisms
to
prevent
mating
between
the
populations
,
in
doing
so
,
this
process
can
result
in
adaptive
speciation
(
sensu
Dieckman
et
al.
)
,
which
has
been
demonstrated
for
various
groups
of
organisms
.
</p>
<p>
Traditionally
,
phenotypic
plasticity
has
been
considered
a
force
counteracting
speciation
because
it
buffers
the
effect
of
natural
selection
on
plastic
traits
.
However
,
modern
research
demonstrates
that
—
by
reinforcing
the
survival
of
organisms
under
varying
environmental
conditions
—
phenotypic
plasticity
exposes
other
traits
to
natural
selection
that
are
related
but
not
directly
involved
in
a
given
plastic
response
(
plastic
acclimatization
)
.
This
way
,
plastic
acclimatization
serves
as
a
key
initial
step
towards
the
evolutionary
divergence
of
other
traits
and
characters
.
Furthermore
,
some
plastic
responses
are
heritable
,
and
if
subject
to
selection
can
evolve
via
genetic
adaptation
(
i.
e.
,
genetic
accommodation
)
.
</p>
<p>
Amphibians
constitute
particularly
good
models
to
study
the
role
of
plasticity
in
evolution
.
They
offer
numerous
examples
of
plasticity
,
and
are
known
for
their
variability
with
regards
to
behavior
,
morphology
,
physiology
,
and
life
history
.
The
aquatic
larvae
of
amphibians
are
of
particular
interest
because
many
of
the
easily
measurable
morphological
traits
(
such
as
size
,
weight
,
and
gill
length
)
are
plastic
and
related
to
metamorphosis
and
fitness
.
A
well-established
natural
system
for
evolutionary-ecological
research
is
the
European
fire
salamander
(
<hi rend="italic">
Salamandra
salamandra
</hi>
)
;
larvae
of
this
species
are
capable
of
living
in
a
variety
of
environments
(
streams
,
ponds
,
and
underground
springs
)
by
changing
their
behavior
and
growth
rate
to
the
environmental
conditions
.
In
Central
Europe
,
<hi rend="italic">
S.
salamandra
</hi>
larvae
typically
develop
in
small
primary
streams
until
metamorphosis
,
but
females
of
some
populations
are
known
to
deposit
their
larva
in
ephemeral
water
bodies
,
such
as
small
ponds
or
ditches
,
and
sometimes
even
in
underground
springs
.
Both
habitat
types
are
ecologically
different
in
many
biotic
and
abiotic
aspects
,
including
water
dynamics
,
temperature
regime
,
food
availability
,
and
intraspecific
competition
;
for
instance
,
ponds
tend
to
have
lower
oxygen
content
and
higher
temperatures
than
streams
.
One
area
where
this
kind
of
differential
habitat
use
has
been
intensively
studied
is
the
range
of
the
Ville
forest
in
the
West
of
Germany
,
with
a
special
focus
on
the
Kottenforst
near
Bonn
.
The
Kottenforst
represents
a
continuous
old
broad-leaf
forest
with
streams
and
rain-filled
bomb
craters
,
in
which
adult
salamanders
can
move
freely
and
females
deposit
their
larvae
into
small
water
bodies
(
streams
or
ponds
)
,
in
which
the
latter
develop
until
metamorphosis
is
completed
.
The
adaptation
to
different
larval
habitat
conditions
has
promoted
the
adaptive
divergence
of
the
ancestral
local
population
into
two
genetically
differentiated
subpopulations
,
thus
potentially
representing
a
case
of
early
stage
ecological
speciation
.
</p>
<p>
In
order
to
better
study
acclimatization
and
adaptation
,
a
<hi rend="italic">
S.
salamandra
</hi>
specific
microarray
chip
was
designed
to
estimate
gene
expression
in
different
ecological
contexts
.
A
previous
study
integrating
results
from
gene
expression
in
Kottenforst
larvae
under
common
environmental
conditions
revealed
that
the
differential
gene
expression
observed
is
mainly
driven
by
transcriptional
plasticity
rather
than
local
adaptation
.
However
,
this
was
a
laboratory-based
study
that
focused
on
the
effect
of
temperature
and
did
not
inform
about
the
degree
of
plasticity
in
nature
;
it
remains
necessary
to
determine
whether
the
patterns
observed
explain
the
variance
observed
in
nature
,
or
if
other
ecological
parameters
besides
thermal
adaptation
drive
the
observed
patterns
.
</p>
<p>
In
this
study
,
we
performed
a
reciprocal
transfer
experiment
of
larvae
between
stream
and
pond
habitats
in
the
Kottenforst
to
estimate
individual
performance
in
the
contrasting
environments
.
Reciprocal
transfer
experiments
—
also
known
as
transplant
experiments
—
are
experiments
in
which
individuals
are
translocated
from
their
native
or
original
habitat
to
a
new
or
ecologically
different
habitat
,
which
allows
the
testing
of
heritability
and
fixation
of
traits
in
the
natural
environment
.
The
aim
of
our
transplant
experiment
was
to
test
how
far
larvae
can
compensate
for
ecological
differences
between
the
two
habitats
.
The
performance
of
larvae
was
monitored
using
morphological
variables
and
gene
expression
.
Our
results
identify
candidate
genes
underlying
differential
habitat
adaptation
in
the
fire
salamander
system
,
and
illuminate
their
degree
of
plasticity
and
local
adaptation
.
