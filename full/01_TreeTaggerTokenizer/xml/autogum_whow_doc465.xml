Prune
Rhododendrons
</head>
<p>
Rhododendrons
are
beautiful
shrubs/trees
that
grow
in
almost
all
areas
of
the
world
.
They
are
great
for
landscaping
and
produce
beautiful
flowers
in
the
spring
and
summer
.
You
can
keep
your
rhododendrons
healthy
and
looking
the
way
you
want
them
to
by
pruning
in
your
style
and
at
the
right
time
of
year
.

Timing
Your
Pruning
</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Shear
your
rhododendrons
in
the
winter
when
you
are
doing
large
cuts
.
Winter
pruning
is
better
for
more
shocking
trims
because
the
plant
is
dormant
,
so
its
energy
is
not
in
its
leaves
or
flowers
.
Cutting
in
the
winter
is
the
best
way
to
ensure
that
your
plant
will
have
new
growth
after
you
prune
it
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Try
not
to
prune
during
a
freeze
.
If
you
cut
your
plant
and
the
cut
branches
get
frozen
,
the
severe
cold
may
damage
or
shock
the
plant
.

<item>
Encourage
new
flowers
by
pruning
right
after
a
bloom
.
If
you
are
just
cleaning
up
your
rhododendron
or
wanting
to
ensure
that
your
plant
gets
new
flowers
next
season
,
you
can
prune
right
after
your
rhododendron
is
finished
blooming
.
This
will
be
in
late
spring
or
early
summer
,
or
whenever
you
notice
its
flowers
dying
and
no
new
ones
starting
to
grow
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
You
can
cut
flowers
off
your
rhododendron
in
the
middle
of
spring
when
they
are
at
their
peak
to
get
a
beautiful
bouquet
of
flowers
.
This
will
not
hurt
your
plant
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Prune
before
the
blooming
season
to
reduce
the
amount
of
flowers
.
You
can
prune
in
early
spring
or
late
winter
to
discourage
your
plant
from
producing
as
many
flowers
,
and
encourage
it
to
put
its
energy
into
growing
new
branches
and
leaves
.
You
should
do
this
if
you
want
your
rhododendron
to
grow
larger
or
taller
.

Rhododendrons
are
known
for
their
beautiful
flowers
,
so
you
may
want
to
see
your
plant
with
its
flowers
before
you
decide
to
take
some
away

Choosing
a
Pruning
Style
</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Cut
off
dead
wood
and
flowers
for
a
low-maintenance
prune
.
The
easiest
style
of
pruning
is
trimming
off
any
dead
or
dying
parts
of
your
rhododendron
with
pruning
shears
.
Dead
leaves
will
look
yellow
or
brown
,
and
dead
branches
will
be
crispy
and
snap
easily
.
Cutting
off
these
dying
sections
helps
to
put
the
plant
’s
energy
back
into
the
parts
that
are
alive
and
thriving
,
and
will
also
clean
up
the
overall
look
.
Pruning
like
this
only
needs
to
be
done
once
a
year
,
or
whenever
you
notice
your
rhododendron
needs
it
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Pruning
only
the
dead
parts
of
your
plant
will
also
help
promote
a
more
natural
,
less
landscaped
look
for
your
rhododendron
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Prune
a
shape
into
your
plant
when
you
are
trying
to
control
its
growth
.
You
can
encourage
your
rhododendron
to
grow
in
a
certain
direction
or
area
by
cutting
back
the
parts
you
want
to
be
smaller
,
and
leaving
the
parts
you
want
to
be
larger
.
This
is
helpful
when
your
rhododendron
is
near
your
house
,
or
when
you
are
trying
to
keep
a
more
uniformed
look
.
This
type
of
pruning
only
needs
to
be
done
once
a
year
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Rhododendrons
will
only
conform
to
a
shape
to
a
certain
extent
.
They
have
broad
leaves
and
longer
branches
,
so
they
may
not
ever
look
completely
uniform
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Trim
it
down
to
above
the
ground
for
a
new
look
.
This
pruning
method
is
a
reset
for
your
plant
.
You
should
choose
this
method
if
your
rhododendron
is
messy
looking
or
overgrown
and
you
want
it
to
try
growing
again
.
Most
species
of
rhododendrons
will
be
able
to
survive
this
method
of
pruning
,
but
a
few
cannot
,
so
it
is
worth
researching
your
specific
type
before
using
this
method
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Some
healthy
rhododendrons
can
even
be
cut
down
to
above
the
ground
,
but
it
’s
recommended
that
you
try
first
to
see
if
your
plant
will
survive
.
</item>
<item>
You
should
not
use
this
method
if
your
rhododendron
is
sick
or
especially
old
,
because
it
is
more
likely
to
be
shocked
and
not
revive
after
such
a
harsh
cut
.

Trimming
Your
Plant
</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Decide
what
tool
you
need
for
your
rhododendron
size
.
Older
and
more
established
rhododendrons
may
need
a
chainsaw
to
cut
through
the
large
woody
branches
,
especially
toward
the
middle
of
the
plant
.
Hand
saws
and
pruning
shears
are
helpful
for
smaller
,
less
established
branches
,
or
when
you
are
cutting
less
of
the
rhododendron
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Tools
can
break
or
become
dangerous
when
used
improperly
.
You
should
always
read
the
manual
and
operating
instructions
of
any
tool
before
you
use
it
.
</item>
<item>
Ask
for
professional
help
if
you
need
it
.
Large
,
tree-like
rhododendrons
can
sometimes
require
an
expert
to
take
care
of
them
.
You
can
check
with
your
local
landscaping
company
to
see
if
they
offer
the
services
you
need
.

Cut
branches
in
straight
,
even
strokes
.
Try
to
avoid
bending
or
breaking
the
branches
of
your
rhododendron
.
Instead
,
use
your
tool
to
cut
the
branches
evenly
and
in
straight
lines
.
This
will
cause
less
damage
to
your
plant
,
and
will
lessen
the
chances
of
it
going
into
shock
or
dying
.
You
can
make
your
cuts
on
any
part
of
the
branch
,
unless
you
are
trying
to
avoid
flowers
,
in
which
case
you
only
need
to
look
out
for
buds
or
flowering
parts
of
your
plant
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Place
a
tarp
beneath
the
area
you
are
cutting
for
an
easier
cleanup
of
branches
and
leaves
.
</item>
<item>
It
might
be
easier
to
break
off
the
dead
branches
,
which
will
not
hurt
your
plant
,
since
they
are
already
dead
.
</item>

</item>
<item>
Clean
up
any
excess
branches
and
leaves
that
fall
on
the
ground
.
You
’ll
want
to
tidy
up
the
space
you
have
been
working
in
once
you
are
done
pruning
.
This
will
keep
your
rhododendron
looking
neat
and
your
yard
looking
organized
.
This
step
is
optional
,
but
it
is
essential
if
you
want
your
yard
to
look
well-kept
.

If
your
city
has
a

debris
bin
