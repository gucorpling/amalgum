A
TERRIBLE
LOSS
</head>
<p>
There
could
be
no
doubt
of
the
fact
:
Princess
Ozma
,
the
lovely
girl
ruler
of
the
Fairyland
of
Oz
,
was
lost
.
She
had
completely
disappeared
.
Not
one
of
her
subjects
--
not
even
her
closest
friends
--
knew
what
had
become
of
her
.
It
was
Dorothy
who
first
discovered
it
.
Dorothy
was
a
little
Kansas
girl
who
had
come
to
the
Land
of
Oz
to
live
and
had
been
given
a
delightful
suite
of
rooms
in
Ozma
's
royal
palace
just
because
Ozma
loved
Dorothy
and
wanted
her
to
live
as
near
her
as
possible
so
the
two
girls
might
be
much
together
.
</p>
<p>
Dorothy
was
not
the
only
girl
from
the
outside
world
who
had
been
welcomed
to
Oz
and
lived
in
the
royal
palace
.
There
was
another
named
Betsy
Bobbin
,
whose
adventures
had
led
her
to
seek
refuge
with
Ozma
,
and
still
another
named
Trot
,
who
had
been
invited
,
together
with
her
faithful
companion
Cap'n
Bill
,
to
make
her
home
in
this
wonderful
fairyland
.
The
three
girls
all
had
rooms
in
the
palace
and
were
great
chums
;
but
Dorothy
was
the
dearest
friend
of
their
gracious
Ruler
and
only
she
at
any
hour
dared
to
seek
Ozma
in
her
royal
apartments
.
For
Dorothy
had
lived
in
Oz
much
longer
than
the
other
girls
and
had
been
made
a
Princess
of
the
realm
.
</p>
<p>
Betsy
was
a
year
older
than
Dorothy
and
Trot
was
a
year
younger
,
yet
the
three
were
near
enough
of
an
age
to
become
great
playmates
and
to
have
nice
times
together
.
It
was
while
the
three
were
talking
together
one
morning
in
Dorothy
's
room
that
Betsy
proposed
they
make
a
journey
into
the
Munchkin
Country
,
which
was
one
of
the
four
great
countries
of
the
Land
of
Oz
ruled
by
Ozma
.
&quot;
I
've
never
been
there
yet
,
&quot;
said
Betsy
Bobbin
,
&quot;
but
the
Scarecrow
once
told
me
it
is
the
prettiest
country
in
all
Oz
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
'd
like
to
go
,
too
,
&quot;
added
Trot
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
All
right
,
&quot;
said
Dorothy
.
&quot;
I
'll
go
and
ask
Ozma
.
Perhaps
she
will
let
us
take
the
Sawhorse
and
the
Red
Wagon
,
which
would
be
much
nicer
for
us
than
having
to
walk
all
the
way
.
This
Land
of
Oz
is
a
pretty
big
place
when
you
get
to
all
the
edges
of
it
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
So
she
jumped
up
and
went
along
the
halls
of
the
splendid
palace
until
she
came
to
the
royal
suite
,
which
filled
all
the
front
of
the
second
floor
.
In
a
little
waiting
room
sat
Ozma
's
maid
,
Jellia
Jamb
,
who
was
busily
sewing
.
&quot;
Is
Ozma
up
yet
?
&quot;
inquired
Dorothy
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
do
n't
know
,
my
dear
,
&quot;
replied
Jellia
.
&quot;
I
have
n't
heard
a
word
from
her
this
morning
.
She
has
n't
even
called
for
her
bath
or
her
breakfast
,
and
it
is
far
past
her
usual
time
for
them
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
That
's
strange
!
&quot;
exclaimed
the
little
girl
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Yes
,
&quot;
agreed
the
maid
,
&quot;
but
of
course
no
harm
could
have
happened
to
her
.
No
one
can
die
or
be
killed
in
the
Land
of
Oz
,
and
Ozma
is
herself
a
powerful
fairy
,
and
she
has
no
enemies
so
far
as
we
know
.
Therefore
I
am
not
at
all
worried
about
her
,
though
I
must
admit
her
silence
is
unusual
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Perhaps
,
&quot;
said
Dorothy
thoughtfully
,
&quot;
she
has
overslept
.
Or
she
may
be
reading
or
working
out
some
new
sort
of
magic
to
do
good
to
her
people
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Any
of
these
things
may
be
true
,
&quot;
replied
Jellia
Jamb
,
&quot;
so
I
have
n't
dared
disturb
our
royal
mistress
.
You
,
however
,
are
a
privileged
character
,
Princess
,
and
I
am
sure
that
Ozma
would
n't
mind
at
all
if
you
went
in
to
see
her
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Of
course
not
,
&quot;
said
Dorothy
,
and
opening
the
door
of
the
outer
chamber
,
she
went
in
.
All
was
still
here
.
She
walked
into
another
room
,
which
was
Ozma
's
boudoir
,
and
then
,
pushing
back
a
heavy
drapery
richly
broidered
with
threads
of
pure
gold
,
the
girl
entered
the
sleeping-room
of
the
fairy
Ruler
of
Oz
.
The
bed
of
ivory
and
gold
was
vacant
;
the
room
was
vacant
;
not
a
trace
of
Ozma
was
to
be
found
.
</p>
<p>
Very
much
surprised
,
yet
still
with
no
fear
that
anything
had
happened
to
her
friend
,
Dorothy
returned
through
the
boudoir
to
the
other
rooms
of
the
suite
.
She
went
into
the
music
room
,
the
library
,
the
laboratory
,
the
bath
,
the
wardrobe
,
and
even
into
the
great
throne
room
,
which
adjoined
the
royal
suite
,
but
in
none
of
these
places
could
she
find
Ozma
.
</p>
<p>
So
she
returned
to
the
anteroom
where
she
had
left
the
maid
,
Jellia
Jamb
,
and
said
:
</p>
<p>
&quot;
She
is
n't
in
her
rooms
now
,
so
she
must
have
gone
out
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
do
n't
understand
how
she
could
do
that
without
my
seeing
her
,
&quot;
replied
Jellia
,
&quot;
unless
she
made
herself
invisible
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
She
is
n't
there
,
anyhow
,
&quot;
declared
Dorothy
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Then
let
us
go
find
her
,
&quot;
suggested
the
maid
,
who
appeared
to
be
a
little
uneasy
.
So
they
went
into
the
corridors
,
and
there
Dorothy
almost
stumbled
over
a
queer
girl
who
was
dancing
lightly
along
the
passage
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Stop
a
minute
,
Scraps
!
&quot;
she
called
,
&quot;
Have
you
seen
Ozma
this
morning
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Not
I
!
&quot;
replied
the
queer
girl
,
dancing
nearer
.
&quot;
I
lost
both
my
eyes
in
a
tussle
with
the
Woozy
last
night
,
for
the
creature
scraped
'
em
both
off
my
face
with
his
square
paws
.
So
I
put
the
eyes
in
my
pocket
,
and
this
morning
Button-Bright
led
me
to
Aunt
Em
,
who
sewed
'
em
on
again
.
So
I
've
seen
nothing
at
all
today
,
except
during
the
last
five
minutes
.
So
of
course
I
have
n't
seen
Ozma
.
&quot;
