In
2016
,
22
y.
o
,
undrafted
,
Fred
VanVleet
signed
a
2
year
deal
with
just
$50k
guaranteed
.
He
played
less
than
300
minutes
in
the
NBA
last
year
with
a
blend
of
encouraging
and
discouraging
play/stats
.
He
was
assigned
and
recalled
from
the
D-League
16
times
.
FVV
's
improvement
this
year
is
incredible
.

This
is
n't
any
deep
diving
analysis
,
it
's
laid
out
very
clearly
per
<ref target="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/v/vanvlfr01.html">
FVV
's
bball-ref.com
page
</ref>
.
I
just
thought
it
was
worth
saying
,
because
I
had
no
idea
the
extent
of
the
beginning
of
his
career
.
Like
most
I
knew
FVV
was
an
undrafted
fringe
player
last
year
from
those
exciting
Shockers
(
*WuShockers
?
*
)
teams
with
that
other
guy
on
the
Knicks
.
But
I
doubt
everyone
knows
exactly
how
unlikely
his
story
really
is
.
I
've
never
seen
a
player
assigned
and
recalled
from
the
G-League
so
many
times
in
just
5
months
.
Obviously
rookies
are
expected
to
improve
,
but
increasing
his
eFG
by
more
than
10
percentage
points
is
incredible
(
not
to
mention
it
's
with
more
than
twice
as
many
shots
)
and
other
huge
improvements
in
basically
every
other
stat
as
well
.
Doing
this
all
while
being
a
significant
contributor
as
a
rotational
piece
on
a
contender
playing
in
meaningful
games
is
noteworthy
too
.

He
had
a
92
grade
from
ESPN
as
a
high
schooler
,
he
was
the
best
recruit
that
year
from
IL
,
but
that
was
a
very
weak
year
for
Illinois
basketball
prospects
(
no
Jabari
Parker
,
Derrick
Rose
,
Anthony
Davis
,
Jahlil
Okafor
,
Shaun
Livingston-type
players
that
year
)
.
He
's
from
Rockford
which
is
n't
the
best
place
in
the
world
(
depending
on
what
part
of
Rockford
)
,
but
it
's
not
the
worst
either
.
Rockford
has
n't
produced
any
significant
players
(
the
only
other
4
basketball
players
born
in
Rockford
all
lasted
1-2
season
in
the
NBA
)
.
FVV
went
on
to
have
an
illustrious
4
year
career
at
Wichita
State
filled
with
several
huge
moments
:
final
four
appearance
,
undefeated
regular
season
(
third
most
D-1
wins
all
time
)
,
team
first
triple-double
,
etc.
FVV
's
time
with
Wi~~t~~chita
State
was
arguably
the
best
in
their
history
,
9
NCAA
Tournament
wins
in
his
4
years
there
,
and
only
1
win
in
the
2
years
since
he
's
graduated
.

How
exactly
did
he
improve
?
I
thought
he
was
a
great
college
player
with
a
game
that
would
translate
to
the
NBA
since
he
was
a
smart
player
that
made
good
decisions
,
always
controlled
the
game
,
and
hit
timely
shots
.
Did
seem
a
little
meaty
though
.
Did
he
improve
athleticism
and
or
shooting
?
Serious
question
.
I
have
n't
followed
him
closely
.
