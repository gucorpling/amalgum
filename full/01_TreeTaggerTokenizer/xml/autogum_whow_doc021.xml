Get
Music
Rights
</head>
<p>
In
order
to
use
someone
else
's
music
in
a
film
,
video
,
or
other
public
presentation
,
you
need
to
acquire
the
legal
right
to
use
the
music
.
If
you
want
to
use
someone
else
’s
music
in
a
film
,
video
,
presentation
or
other
public
context
,
you
need
to
buy
music
rights
to
do
so
,
if
the
music
is
n’t
currently
in
the
public
domain
.
This
can
be
a
complicated
task
because
of
the
range
of
rights
options
and
because
most
music
has
multiple
parties
with
rights
.
However
,
if
you
take
the
process
one
step
at
a
time
,
you
’ll
be
able
to
get
the
rights
you
need
.

Figure
out
what
rights
you
need
.
There
are
two
different
licenses
you
need
before
you
can
use
a
piece
of
music
:
the
synchronization
license
and
the
master
use
license
.
Each
license
confers
different
rights
to
the
holder
,
but
both
are
necessary
to
use
a
piece
of
music
,
for
example
,
in
a
film
.
<figure rend="Buy Music Rights Step 2 Version 2.jpg">

<item>
The
synchronization
license
grants
the
right
to
pair
a
piece
of
music
with
your
visual
image
.
</item>
<item>
The
master
use
license
grants
the
right
to
reproduce
a
specific
recording
of
the
piece
in
your
work
.
</item>

<item>
Determine
whether
the
music
is
in
the
public
domain
.
In
the
United
States
,
any
song
or
musical
work
published
in
or
before
1922
is
in
the
public
domain
.
In
most
other
countries
,
music
enters
the
public
domain
70
years
after
the
author
's
death
.
If
a
piece
of
music
is
in
the
public
domain
,
no
one
owns
the
composition
,
so
you
can
freely
perform
or
record
it
.

<list type="unordered">
<item>
Remember
,
although
a
composition
is
may
be
in
the
public
domain
,
no
sound
recordings
are
public
domain
in
the
United
States
.
Thus
,
although
the
nursery
rhyme
&quot;
Baa
Baa
Black
Sheep
&quot;
dates
back
to
1765
,
you
will
still
need
permission
to
use
an
artist
's
recording
of
the
song
.

Identify
whose
permission
you
need
.
You
need
to
get
the
synchronization
license
from
the
copyright
owner
.
The
copyright
owner
is
typically
the
publisher
.
You
must
get
the
master
use
license
from
the
person
or
entity
that
owns
the
specific
recording
you
want
to
use
.
This
is
usually
the
record
label
.

If
you
have
a
physical
copy
of
the
album
,
consult
the
liner
notes
to
find
the
names
of
the
publisher
and
the
record
label
.
If
the
music
is
independently
published
,
you
may
only
need
the
artist
's
permission
to
use
the
song
.
</item>

There
are
three
main
performing
rights
organizations
in
the
U.S.
that
represent
publishers
in
the
collection
or
royalties
:
ASCAP
,
BMI
,
and
SESAC
.
These
organizations
may
be
able
to
direct
you
to
the
publishers
and
labels
from
whom
you
will
need
to
ask
permission
.

Contact
the
owners
.
To
use
a
recorded
piece
of
music
,
you
will
typically
need
to
get
permission
both
from
the
owner
of
the
composition
and
the
owner
of
the
recording
you
want
to
use
.
You
will
need
to
request
permission
and
possibly
negotiate
a
price
with
both
holders
of
those
owners
.
Once
you
have
identified
the
person
or
entity
from
whom
you
need
to
request
permission
,
call
or
write
a
letter
.

Writing
a
letter
is
a
more
personal
approach
,
and
might
be
more
effective
if
you
are
requesting
permission
to
use
the
music
for
free
.

in

Negotiate
the
price
.
The
purchase
price
for
the
rights
you
want
will
depend
upon
your
intended
use
.
If
your
intended
use
is
charitable
,
or
if
you
want
to
use
a
song
by
a
self-publishing
artist
who
wants
more
exposure
,
you
may
be
able
to
acquire
some
rights
for
free
.
Typically
,
the
owner
will
set
a
fee
based
upon
the
song
you
want
and
your
intended
use
,
and
you
will
have
the
opportunity
to
try
to
negotiate
a
price
that
fits
your
budget
