First-Order
Element
as
a
Basic
Part
of
the
Network
</head>
<p>
In
the
first
phase
of
the
research
,
the
first-order
analog
element
was
selected
as
the
fundamental
network
component
.
It
was
characterized
by
two
outputs
:
low-pass
and
high-pass
.
This
can
be
described
by
the
following
system
of
equations
:
(

)
where
:
<list>
<item>
<hi rend="italic">

</hi>
(
<hi rend="italic">

</hi>

—

<hi rend="italic">

</hi>
(

)
—
high-pass
output
signal
;
</item>
<item>
<hi rend="italic">
y
</hi>
(
<hi rend="italic">
t
</hi>
)
—
low-pass

</item>

defines
the

frequency

</item>
<item>

</hi>
—
time

(
defines
the
upper

of
the
low-pass
frequency
)
;
</item>

—
function

;
</item>
<item>
<hi rend="italic">

</hi>
(
<hi rend="italic">

</hi>
)
—
function

;
</item>
<item>
<hi rend="italic">

<p>
The
results
of
the
preceding
research
have
shown
that
filters
with
time-varying
parameters
work
undoubtedly
better
in
the
time
domain
than
filters
with
time-invariant
parameters
.
The
quality
of
their
operation
is
determined
by
the
time
after
which
the
error
value
of
the
output
signal
is
no
greater
than
the
assumed
accuracy
,
<hi rend="italic">
α
.
</hi>
Replacing
the
time
constant
with
the
time
function
and
the
gain
coefficient
with
the
gain
function
significantly
shortens
the
duration
of
the
transient
state
without
changing
the
filters
properties
in
the
frequency
domain
.
</p>
<p>
The
functions
of
the
gain
factor
and
the
time
constant
are
described
as
follows
:
(
2
)
(
3
)
where
<hi rend="italic">
hT
</hi>
(
<hi rend="italic">
t
</hi>
)
and
<hi rend="italic">
hk
</hi>
(
<hi rend="italic">
t
</hi>
)
are
the
step
responses
of
the
second
order
element
with
time-invariant
parameters
.
</p>
<p>
The
function
varying
the
parameters
allows
for
the
creation
of
the
time
function
of
the
time
constant
and
the
gain
function
,
where
parameters
and
are
a
multiplication
of
their
value
change
.
Both
functions
have
to
obtain
the
value
specified
in
the
spectral
assumptions
in
time
no
longer
than
the
duration
of
the
transient
state
.
The
easiest
way
to
accomplish
this
requirement
is
to
set
the
value
of
damping
factor
<hi rend="italic">
β
</hi>
between
.
The
damping
factor
is
responsible
for
suppressing
oscillation
,
with
higher
values
making
it
work
better
.
The
function
varying
the
parameters
used
in
the
paper
generated
a
step
response
of
the
second-order
inertial
element
.
This
form
was
accepted
due
to
previously
conducted
studies
and
its
current
state
of
art
in
the
field
.
</p>
<p>
In
order
to
transform
the
continuous-time
system
model
mentioned
above
to
the
discrete-time
system
,
the
bilinear
transform
was
used
.
The
bilinear
transformation
maps
the
s-plane
(
Laplace
transform
)
to
the
z-plane
(
Z
transformations
)
.
Although
this
transformation
is
non-linear
,
it
is
useful
considering
that
it
maps
the
entire
s-plane
axis
to
the
z-plane
unit
circle
.
After
specifying
the
requirements
for
the
designed
digital
filter
,
using
the
applicable
mapping
,
the
proper
equation
forms
were
obtained
.
Obtained
equation
:
(
4
)
where
the
low-pass
filter
coefficients
are
:
and
the
high-pass
filter
are
:
</p>
<p>
The
next
step
was
to
implement
prepared
elements
and
connect
them
into
the
network
.
Simulations
were
carried
out
in
order
to
analyze
operation
of
the
network
,
its
speed
,
and
its
effectiveness
.
