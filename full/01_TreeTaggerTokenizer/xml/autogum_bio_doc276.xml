</p>
<p>
In

,
Patterson
requested
grants
to
own
land
on
the
island
,
and
he
and
his
brother
,

On

,
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privy_Council_of_the_United_Kingdom">
British

Council
</ref>
declared
St.

a
colony
with
its
own

,
separating
it
from

.
Patterson
was
appointed
the
island
's
first
Governor
on
19
July
1769
and
arrived
on
the
island
on
30
August
1770
.
</p>
<p>
Soon
after
taking
the
Oath
of
Office
in
September
1770
,
Patterson
had
already
formed
an
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Council_(Canada)">
Executive
Council
</ref>
,
and
one
of
his
and
the
council
's
first
ordinances
was
to
enforce
the
payment
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quit-Rent">
Quit-Rent
</ref>
.
</p>
<p>
Following
the
first
Assembly
elections
in
1773
,
Patterson
acquired
over
100,000
acres
(
400km2
)
of
land
from
proprietors
who
had
failed
to
pay
their
quit-rent
.
The
land
was
to
be
sold
off
.
The
former
proprietors
wrote
to
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_government">
British
government
</ref>
asking
that
their
land
be
returned
,
and
when
this
failed
,
they
asked
that
Patterson
be
removed
from
office
.
This
was
to
the
first
of
several
incidents
which
would
cause
tension
between
the
British
government
and
Governor
Patterson
.
</p>
<p>
Soon
after
the
petitions
were
sorted
through
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England">
England
</ref>
,
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State">
Secretary
of
State
</ref>
from
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_government">
British

</ref>
wrote
to
Patterson
,
on
24
July
1783
,
ordering
him
to
present
a
bill
to
the
Assembly
,
one
which
Patterson
was
told
he
had
to
support
.
The
bill
was
for
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annulment">
annulment
</ref>
of
the
land
sales
.
Going
against
the
British
government
,
Patterson
opposed
the
bill
and
managed
to
receive
a
majority
from
the
Executive
Council
,
supporting
his
decision
.
</p>
<p>
The
British
government
retaliated
by
removing
Walter
Patterson
from
office
,
on
17
June
1786
.
He
officially
left
office
on
4
November
.
</p>
<p>
In
1789
,
Patterson
returned
to
England
where
he
died
nine
years
later
.
</p>
<p>
The
issue
of
absentee
landowners
and
quit-rent
in
Prince
Edward
Island
would
not
be
resolved
until
the
passage
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_Purchase_Act_(1875)">

in
