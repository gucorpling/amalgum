Introduction
</head>
<p>
Health
monitoring
is
a
diverse
subject
since
it
covers
biological
systems
as
well
as
physical
systems
.
Biological
systems
are
usually
associated
with
the
monitoring
of
human
health
,
whether
it
is
related
to
diagnosis
of
diseases
,
monitoring
of
daily
activities
,
or
vital
signs
.
On
the
other
hand
,
physical
systems
health
monitoring
is
associated
with
checking
physical
systems
,
such
as
structures
and
rotary
or
linear
displacement
machines
.
Structural
health
is
related
to
checking
vibration
,
cracks
,
or
fatigues
of
materials
in
buildings
,
aircrafts
,
or
pipes
.
</p>
<p>
Due
to
the
development
of
handheld-device
technologies
,
processing
power
,
and
sensory
accuracy
,
the
penetration
into
the
biomedical
field
has
received
intense
interest
,
which
has
led
to
the
development
of
new
sensors
and
signal
processing
algorithms
in
the
field
.
However
,
there
is
still
a
need
to
integrate
different
systems
and
technologies
such
that
real-time
detection
and
diagnosis
can
be
made
available
to
all
people
to
meet
the
demand
and
requisites
of
the
world
health
monitoring
systems
.
</p>
<p>
On
the
other
hand
,
advances
in
technology
,
such
as
high-resolution
cameras
,
optical
sensors
,
drones
,
and
robotics
,
have
evolved
the
generation
of
intelligent
monitoring
systems
for
physical
system
health
monitoring
.
Infrastructure
health
monitoring
systems
can
monitor
vibration
in
buildings
,
displacement
,
rotation
,
stress/strain
,
cracks/spalling
,
and
defects
either
directly
or
remotely
.
Structural
health
traditionally
is
monitored
using
conventional
sensors
with
data
acquisition
,
transmission
,
and
information
processing
to
assess
the
structure
’s
health
check
.
Recently
,
smart
sensors
with
embedded
microprocessors
and
wireless
communication
are
being
used
,
in
addition
to
fibre
optic
sensor
technology
and
automated
low-cost
photogrammetry
for
flexible
structure
monitoring
.
Furthermore
,
non-destructive
testing
equipment
,
such
as
eddy
current
equipment
in
pipes
and
aircraft
bodies
,
have
also
evolved
to
become
more
accurate
and
reliable
due
to
the
developments
of
intelligent
signal
processing
systems
.
</p>
<p>
On-line
monitoring
systems
have
also
been
used
to
monitor
rotary
and
displacement
machines
.
The
utilisation
of
vibration-based
sensors
in
addition
to
image
and
wireless
communication
of
smart
devices
,
and
the
use
of
programmable
and
web
connected
applications
are
the
base
for
the
next-generation
measurement
technology
of
structural
health
monitoring
.
The
abundance
of
handheld
smartphones
with
an
easily
programmable
framework
has
helped
in
modifying
the
relevant
software
to
acquire
data
using
embedded
sensors
.
And
in
addition
,
noncontact
sensors
,
such
as
unmanned
aerial
vehicles
(
drones
)
and
mobile
sensors
,
to
acquire
structural
data
.
The
state-of-the-art
methods
have
been
presented
in
a
detailed
literature
review
of
the
recent
applications
of
smartphones
,
unmanned
aerial
vehicles
(
UAVs
)
,
cameras
,
and
robotic
sensors
used
for
structural
condition
monitoring
and
maintenance
.
</p>
<p>
The
acquired
data
needs
to
be
filtered
,
processed
,
and
classified
using
the
latest
developments
in
Artificial
Intelligence
(
AI
)
,
such
as
deep
learning
and
signal
processing
algorithms
like
Wavelets
transforms
(
WL
)
and
Empirical
Mode
Decomposition
(
EMD
)
.
Such
algorithms
are
computationally
intensive
and
require
high
speed
computing
.
This
has
caused
no
major
hurdle
as
the
developments
and
advances
in
computing
has
fulfilled
this
requirement
,
such
as
the
use
of
GPUs
,
computer
clusters
,
edge
computing
,
and
cloud
applications
.
Many
systems
now
reside
on
the
cloud
,
which
only
requires
access
via
the
internet
,
providing
sophisticated
algorithm
and
high-speed
processing
power
.
