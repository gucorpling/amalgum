</item>
<item>
First
we
have
to
work
with
the
motors
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
First
take
the
red
wire
,
cut
half
of
it
and
connect
it
to
the
positive

the
other
.
</item>
<item>
Do
the
same
for
the
blue
wire
and
negative
sides

Tips
</head>
<list type="unordered">
<item>
To
make
your
robot
wireless
you
could
use
batteries
a
power
source
.
*
You
could
use
the
5
meter
wire
between
the
USB
wire
and
the
paper
clips
to
increase
the
movement
length
.

<list type="unordered">
<item>
Please
check
the
internet
to
confirm
every
step
mentioned
in
this
article
and
then
start
building
it
.
*The
robot
may
get
extremely
hot
during
the
running
time
because
of
some
fault
or
wrong
wiring
.
So
I
kindly
beg
my
readers
to
make
the
robot
properly
and
check
every
step
on
the
internet
before
testing
.
