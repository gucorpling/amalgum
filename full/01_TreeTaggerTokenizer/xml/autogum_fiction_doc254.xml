Song
</head>
<p>
In
every
heart
to
find
a
Slave
,
In
every
Soul
to
fix
his
reign
,
In
bonds
to
lead
the
wise
and
brave
,
And
make
the
Captives
kiss
his
chain
,
Such
is
the
power
of
Love
,
and
Oh
!
I
grieve
so
well
Love
's
power
to
know
.
</p>
<p>
In
sighs
to
pass
the
live-long
day
,
To
taste
a
short
and
broken
sleep
,
For
one
dear
Object
far
away
,
All
others
scorned
,
to
watch
and
weep
,
Such
are
the
pains
of
Love
,
and
Oh
!
I
grieve
so
well
Love
's
pains
to
know
!
</p>
<p>
To
read
consent
in
virgin
eyes
,
To
press
the
lip
ne'er
prest
till
then
To
hear
the
sigh
of
transport
rise
,
And
kiss
,
and
kiss
,
and
kiss
again
,
Such
are
thy
pleasures
,
Love
,
But
Oh
!
When
shall
my
heart
thy
pleasures
know
?
</p>
<head>
Chorus
</head>
<p>
Now
hush
,
my
Lyre
!
My
voice
be
still
!
Sleep
,
gentle
Maid
!
May
fond
desire
With
amorous
thoughts
thy
visions
fill
,
Though
still
my
voice
,
and
hushed
my
Lyre
.
</p>
<p>
The
Music
ceased
:
The
Performers
dispersed
,
and
silence
prevailed
through
the
Street
.
Antonia
quitted
the
window
with
regret
:
She
as
usual
recommended
herself
to
the
protection
of
St.
Rosolia
,
said
her
accustomed
prayers
,
and
retired
to
bed
.
Sleep
was
not
long
absent
,
and
his
presence
relieved
her
from
her
terrors
and
inquietude
.
</p>
<p>
It
was
almost
two
o'clock
before
the
lustful
Monk
ventured
to
bend
his
steps
towards
Antonia
's
dwelling
.
It
has
been
already
mentioned
that
the
Abbey
was
at
no
great
distance
from
the
Strada
di
San
Iago
.
He
reached
the
House
unobserved
.
Here
He
stopped
,
and
hesitated
for
a
moment
.
He
reflected
on
the
enormity
of
the
crime
,
the
consequences
of
a
discovery
,
and
the
probability
,
after
what
had
passed
,
of
Elvira
's
suspecting
him
to
be
her
Daughter
's
Ravisher
:
On
the
other
hand
it
was
suggested
that
She
could
do
no
more
than
suspect
;
that
no
proofs
of
his
guilt
could
be
produced
;
that
it
would
seem
impossible
for
the
rape
to
have
been
committed
without
Antonia
's
knowing
when
,
where
,
or
by
whom
;
and
finally
,
He
believed
that
his
fame
was
too
firmly
established
to
be
shaken
by
the
unsupported
accusations
of
two
unknown
Women
.
This
latter
argument
was
perfectly
false
:
He
knew
not
how
uncertain
is
the
air
of
popular
applause
,
and
that
a
moment
suffices
to
make
him
today
the
detestation
of
the
world
,
who
yesterday
was
its
Idol
.
The
result
of
the
Monk
's
deliberations
was
that
He
should
proceed
in
his
enterprize
.
He
ascended
the
steps
leading
to
the
House
.
No
sooner
did
He
touch
the
door
with
the
silver
Myrtle
,
than
it
flew
open
,
and
presented
him
with
a
free
passage
.
He
entered
,
and
the
door
closed
after
him
of
its
own
accord
.
</p>
<p>
Guided
by
the
moonbeams
,
He
proceeded
up
the
Staircase
with
slow
and
cautious
steps
.
He
looked
round
him
every
moment
with
apprehension
and
anxiety
.
He
saw
a
Spy
in
every
shadow
,
and
heard
a
voice
in
every
murmur
of
the
night
breeze
.
Consciousness
of
the
guilty
business
on
which
He
was
employed
appalled
his
heart
,
and
rendered
it
more
timid
than
a
Woman
's
.
Yet
still
He
proceeded
.
He
reached
the
door
of
Antonia
's
chamber
.
He
stopped
,
and
listened
.
All
was
hushed
within
.
The
total
silence
persuaded
him
that
his
intended
Victim
was
retired
to
rest
,
and
He
ventured
to
lift
up
the
Latch
.
The
door
was
fastened
,
and
resisted
his
efforts
:
But
no
sooner
was
it
touched
by
the
Talisman
,
than
the
Bolt
flew
back
.
The
Ravisher
stept
on
,
and
found
himself
in
the
chamber
,
where
slept
the
innocent
Girl
,
unconscious
how
dangerous
a
Visitor
was
drawing
near
her
Couch
.
The
door
closed
after
him
,
and
the
Bolt
shot
again
into
its
fastening
.
</p>
<p>
Ambrosio
advanced
with
precaution
.
He
took
care
that
not
a
board
should
creak
under
his
foot
,
and
held
in
his
breath
as
He
approached
the
Bed
.
His
first
attention
was
to
perform
the
magic
ceremony
,
as
Matilda
had
charged
him
:
He
breathed
thrice
upon
the
silver
Myrtle
,
pronounced
over
it
Antonia
's
name
,
and
laid
it
upon
her
pillow
.
The
effects
which
it
had
already
produced
permitted
not
his
doubting
its
success
in
prolonging
the
slumbers
of
his
devoted
Mistress
.
No
sooner
was
the
enchantment
performed
than
He
considered
her
to
be
absolutely
in
his
power
,
and
his
eyes
flamed
with
lust
and
impatience
.
He
now
ventured
to
cast
a
glance
upon
the
sleeping
Beauty
.
A
single
Lamp
,
burning
before
the
Statue
of
St.
Rosolia
,
shed
a
faint
light
through
the
room
,
and
permitted
him
to
examine
all
the
charms
of
the
lovely
Object
before
him
.
The
heat
of
the
weather
had
obliged
her
to
throw
off
part
of
the
Bed-cloathes
:
Those
which
still
covered
her
,
Ambrosio
's
insolent
hand
hastened
to
remove
.
She
lay
with
her
cheek
reclining
upon
one
ivory
arm
;
The
Other
rested
on
the
side
of
the
Bed
with
graceful
indolence
.
A
few
tresses
of
her
hair
had
escaped
from
beneath
the
Muslin
which
confined
the
rest
,
and
fell
carelessly
over
her
bosom
,
as
it
heaved
with
slow
and
regular
suspiration
.
The
warm
air
had
spread
her
cheek
with
higher
colour
than
usual
.
A
smile
inexpressibly
sweet
played
round
her
ripe
and
coral
lips
,
from
which
every
now
and
then
escaped
a
gentle
sigh
or
an
half-pronounced
sentence
.
An
air
of
enchanting
innocence
and
candour
pervaded
her
whole
form
;
and
there
was
a
sort
of
modesty
in
her
very
nakedness
which
added
fresh
stings
to
the
desires
of
the
lustful
Monk
.
