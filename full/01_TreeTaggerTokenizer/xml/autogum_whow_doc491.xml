Up
Your
Basics
</head>
<p>
If
you
have
a
wardrobe
full
of
basics
,
good
for
you
.
You
've
got
the
hard
part
down
.
Now
,
you
just
need
to
figure
out
how
to
dress
up
those
looks
when
you
need
to
.
You
probably
already
have
what
you
need
in
your
wardrobe
to
create
dressier
looks
,
such
as
suit
jackets
or
cardigans
.
Accessories
also
are
key
to
creating
more
sophisticated
looks
,
which
you
probably
already
have
on
hand
.

Consider
getting
your
basics
tailored
.
If
you
have
a
limited
wardrobe
,
making
sure
your
clothes
fit
really
well
can
make
them
seem
dressier
.
It
can
be
cheaper
to
take
well-made
clothes
you
already
have
to
a
local
tailor
than
to
buy
a
higher
class
,
better
fitting
wardrobe
.

Add
a
jacket
to
dress
up
a
shirt
.
One
simple
way
to
dress
up
a
shirt
is
to
pair
it
with
a
suit
jacket
.
This
simple
step
makes
a
plain
button-up
shirt
or
even
a
nice
t-shirt
into
a
dressed-up
outfit
that
you
can
wear
to
work
or
even
for
a
night
out
on
the
town
.

Similarly
,
adding
a
skirt
or
nice
pants
to
a
blouse
will
create
a
dressier
look
.

Put
on
a
cardigan
for
a
more
sophisticated
look
.
A
cardigan
wo
n't
solve
all
your
wardrobe
problems
.
However
,
adding
a
cardigan
over
a
classic
black
tank
,
for
instance
,
can
make
the
look
much
dressier
.
Button
at
least
a
few
of
the
buttons
for
a
classier
look
.

Use
a
belt
.
A
belt
can
act
solely
as
an
accessory
,
but
it
can
also
help
you
change
up
the
look
of
your
wardrobe
.
For
instance
,
you
can
wear
a
skinny
belt
over
a
tight-fitting
suit
jacket
or
add
one
on
top
of
a
dress
to
create
a
waistline
.
Doing
so
can
make
your
look
more
polished
and
put-together
.

For
guys
,
a
belt
can
help
tie
a
look
together
,
so
pick
one
that
is
classic
and
sophisticated
,
such
as
a
leather
belt
in
black
or
brown
.

Choose
statement
jewelry
.
One
easy
way
to
dress
up
basic
pieces
is
to
choose
jewelry
that
adds
a
pop
of
color
to
your
outfit
.
You
could
try
a
big
chunky
necklace
in
a
bright
color
,
for
instance
,
to
dress
up
a
plain
top
.
Alternatively
,
you
could
pick
some
sparkly
earrings
to
make
a
statement
with
a
dress
.

Bangle
bracelets
or
dainty
metallic
bracelets
can
also
elevate
an
outfit
,
depending
on
the
occasion
.

For
a
guy
,
consider
adding
a
snazzy
tie
clip
or
a
fancy
watch
.

<item>
Pick
a
scarf
to
add
pizzazz
.
In
the
winter
,
a
thick
blanket
scarf
can
turn
a
boring
outfit
into
something
much
more
interesting
and
sophisticated
.
Try
plaid
with
neutrals
or
a
soft
grey
to
break
up
a
black
outfit
.
In
the
summer
,
a
lightweight
shimmery
scarf
can
add
a
touch
of
interest
.

In
the
winter
,
you
can
also
add
fancy
gloves
for
a
dressier
outdoor
outfit
.
</item>
<item>
For
guys
,
a
well-made
classic
wool
scarf
can
add
sophistication
,
while
a
tie
in
a
subtle
pattern
can
add
a
bit
of
flair
.

Add
a
well-made
handbag
.
A
well-made
handbag
can
make
any
outfit
dressier
.
If
you
pick
something
that
fits
the
style
of
what
you
're
wearing
,
it
can
elevate
the
outfit
.
The
opposite
is
also
true
.
If
you
wear
the
same
sloppy
handbag
with
every
outfit
,
it
can
bring
it
down
.
You
do
n't
need
hundreds
of
bags
,
but
try
having
two
or
three
nice
bags
that
go
with
most
of
your
outfits
.

You
do
n't
have
to
spend
a
fortune
on
a
name-brand
bag
.
However
,
spending
a
little
bit
more
than
you
normally
would
will
give
you
a
bag
that
will
last
longer
.
Look
for
good
materials
,
a
nice
lining
,
and
well-made
seams
.
</item>
<item>
Choose
at
least
one
bag
that
can
add
some
color
to
your
wardrobe
,
and
pick
another
for
its
ability
to
blend
in
well
(
think
:
neutral
or
black
)
.

For
a
guy
,
pick
a
stylish
bag
that
will
go
with
most
of
your
looks
.
Leather
is
a
classic
choice
,
and
you
can
get
an
upscale
messenger
bag
or
more
classic
briefcase
.

Wear
a
classy
shoe
.
Having
a
few
stylish
shoes
on
hand
is
a
great
way
to
dress
up
your
wardrobe
.
For
instance
,
a
pair
of
classy
heels
(
such
as
black
stilettos
)
can
take
a
suit
up
a
level
.
Similarly
,
a
pair
of
leather
boots
can
turn
an
average
dress
into
something
dressier
and
edgier
.
A
pair
of
wing-tipped
shoes
can
turn
an
average
suit
into
something
much
snazzier
.

Once
you
find
shoes
you
love
(
that
are
of
decent
quality
)
,
consider
getting
them
resoled
when
they
wear
out
.
You
'll
give
them
a
new
life
!

Do
n't
go
overboard
.
While
it
can
be
tempting
to
add
a
big
necklace
,
big
sparkly
earrings
,
a
large
scarf
,
and
a
bright
watch
,
adding
too
much
can
push
your
outfit
over
the
edge
.
Aim
for
one
large
statement
piece
,
and
keep
your
other
accessories
more
subdued
.

The
same
goes
for
guys
.
If
you
wear
a
flashy
tie
,
lighten
up
on
the
fancy
jewelry
and
vice
versa
.
