CHAPTER
XXIV
</head>
<p>
FROM
the
rescue
of
Lord
Southery
my
story
bears
me
mercilessly
on
to
other
things
.
I
may
not
tarry
,
as
more
leisurely
penmen
,
to
round
my
incidents
;
they
were
not
of
my
choosing
.
I
may
not
pause
to
make
you
better
acquainted
with
the
figure
of
my
drama
;
its
scheme
is
none
of
mine
.
Often
enough
,
in
those
days
,
I
found
a
fitness
in
the
lines
of
Omar
:
</p>
<p>
We
are
no
other
than
a
moving
show
Of
Magic
Shadow-shapes
that
come
and
go
Round
with
the
Sun-illumined
Lantern
held
In
Midnight
by
the
Master
of
the
Show
.
</p>
<p>
But
&quot;
the
Master
of
the
Show
,
&quot;
in
this
case
,
was
Dr.
Fu-Manchu
!
</p>
<p>
I
have
been
asked
many
times
since
the
days
with
which
these
records
deal
:
Who
WAS
Dr.
Fu-Manchu
?
Let
me
confess
here
that
my
final
answer
must
be
postponed
.
I
can
only
indicate
,
at
this
place
,
the
trend
of
my
reasoning
,
and
leave
my
reader
to
form
whatever
conclusion
he
pleases
.
</p>
<p>
What
group
can
we
isolate
and
label
as
responsible
for
the
overthrow
of
the
Manchus
?
The
casual
student
of
modern
Chinese
history
will
reply
:
&quot;
Young
China
.
&quot;
This
is
unsatisfactory
.
What
do
we
mean
by
Young
China
?
In
my
own
hearing
Fu-Manchu
had
disclaimed
,
with
scorn
,
association
with
the
whole
of
that
movement
;
and
assuming
that
the
name
were
not
an
assumed
one
,
he
clearly
can
have
been
no
anti-Manchu
,
no
Republican
.
</p>
<p>
The
Chinese
Republican
is
of
the
mandarin
class
,
but
of
a
new
generation
which
veneers
its
Confucianism
with
Western
polish
.
These
youthful
and
unbalanced
reformers
,
in
conjunction
with
older
but
no
less
ill-balanced
provincial
politicians
,
may
be
said
to
represent
Young
China
.
Amid
such
turmoils
as
this
we
invariably
look
for
,
and
invariably
find
,
a
Third
Party
.
In
my
opinion
,
Dr.
Fu-Manchu
was
one
of
the
leaders
of
such
a
party
.
</p>
<p>
Another
question
often
put
to
me
was
:
Where
did
the
Doctor
hide
during
the
time
that
he
pursued
his
operations
in
London
?
This
is
more
susceptible
of
explanation
.
For
a
time
Nayland
Smith
supposed
,
as
I
did
myself
,
that
the
opium
den
adjacent
to
the
old
Ratcliff
Highway
was
the
Chinaman
's
base
of
operations
;
later
we
came
to
believe
that
the
mansion
near
Windsor
was
his
hiding-place
,
and
later
still
,
the
hulk
lying
off
the
downstream
flats
.
But
I
think
I
can
state
with
confidence
that
the
spot
which
he
had
chosen
for
his
home
was
neither
of
these
,
but
the
East
End
riverside
building
which
I
was
the
first
to
enter
.
Of
this
I
am
all
but
sure
;
for
the
reason
that
it
not
only
was
the
home
of
Fu-Manchu
,
of
Karamaneh
,
and
of
her
brother
,
Aziz
,
but
the
home
of
something
else
--
of
something
which
I
shall
speak
of
later
.
</p>
<p>
The
dreadful
tragedy
(
or
series
of
tragedies
)
which
attended
the
raid
upon
the
place
will
always
mark
in
my
memory
the
supreme
horror
of
a
horrible
case
.
Let
me
endeavor
to
explain
what
occurred
.
</p>
<p>
By
the
aid
of
Karamaneh
,
you
have
seen
how
we
had
located
the
whilom
warehouse
,
which
,
from
the
exterior
,
was
so
drab
and
dreary
,
but
which
within
was
a
place
of
wondrous
luxury
.
At
the
moment
selected
by
our
beautiful
accomplice
,
Inspector
Weymouth
and
a
body
of
detectives
entirely
surrounded
it
;
a
river
police
launch
lay
off
the
wharf
which
opened
from
it
on
the
river-side
;
and
this
upon
a
singularly
black
night
,
than
which
a
better
could
not
have
been
chosen
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
You
will
fulfill
your
promise
to
me
?
&quot;
said
Karamaneh
,
and
looked
up
into
my
face
.
</p>
<p>
She
was
enveloped
in
a
big
,
loose
cloak
,
and
from
the
shadow
of
the
hood
her
wonderful
eyes
gleamed
out
like
stars
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
What
do
you
wish
us
to
do
?
&quot;
asked
Nayland
Smith
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
You
--
and
Dr.
Petrie
,
&quot;
she
replied
swiftly
,
&quot;
must
enter
first
,
and
bring
out
Aziz
.
Until
he
is
safe
--
until
he
is
out
of
that
place
--
you
are
to
make
no
attempt
upon
--
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Upon
Dr.
Fu-Manchu
?
&quot;
interrupted
Weymouth
;
for
Karamaneh
hesitated
to
pronounce
the
dreaded
name
,
as
she
always
did
.
&quot;
But
how
can
we
be
sure
that
there
is
no
trap
laid
for
us
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
Scotland
Yard
man
did
not
entirely
share
my
confidence
in
the
integrity
of
this
Eastern
girl
whom
he
knew
to
have
been
a
creature
of
the
Chinaman
's
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Aziz
lies
in
the
private
room
,
&quot;
she
explained
eagerly
,
her
old
accent
more
noticeable
than
usual
.
&quot;
There
is
only
one
of
the
Burmese
men
in
the
house
,
and
he
--
he
dare
not
enter
without
orders
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
But
Fu-Manchu
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
We
have
nothing
to
fear
from
him
.
He
will
be
your
prisoner
within
ten
minutes
from
now
!
I
have
no
time
for
words
--
you
must
believe
!
&quot;
She
stamped
her
foot
impatiently
.
&quot;
And
the
dacoit
?
&quot;
snapped
Smith
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
He
also
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
think
perhaps
I
'd
better
come
in
,
too
,
&quot;
said
Weymouth
slowly
.
</p>
<p>
Karamaneh
shrugged
her
shoulders
with
quick
impatience
,
and
unlocked
the
door
in
the
high
brick
wall
which
divided
the
gloomy
,
evil-smelling
court
from
the
luxurious
apartments
of
Dr.
Fu-Manchu
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Make
no
noise
,
&quot;
she
warned
.
And
Smith
and
myself
followed
her
along
the
uncarpeted
passage
beyond
.
</p>
<p>
Inspector
Weymouth
,
with
a
final
word
of
instruction
to
his
second
in
command
,
brought
up
the
rear
.
The
door
was
reclosed
;
a
few
paces
farther
on
a
second
was
unlocked
.
Passing
through
a
small
room
,
unfurnished
,
a
farther
passage
led
us
to
a
balcony
.
The
transition
was
startling
.
