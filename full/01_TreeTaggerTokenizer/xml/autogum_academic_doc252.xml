Introduction
</head>
<p>
The
increasing
demands
for
manufacturing
accuracies
and
quality
control
due
to
the
rapid
development
of
nanotechnology
,
ultraprecision
machining
,
micro-
,
and
nanofabrications
,
etc.
and
the
requirements
for
precision
in
surface
finishing
in
different
technologies
such
as
additive
manufacturing
,
mechanical
parts
with
structured
surfaces
,
etc.
,
require
the
use
of
increasingly
sophisticated
measurement
systems
and
measurement
traceability
from
a
metrological
point
of
view
.

Calibration
provides
a
wide
range
of
information
about
microscope
performances
.
The
ever-increasing
demand
for
improved
surface
quality
and
tighter
geometric
tolerances
has
led
to
augmentations
in
the
investigations
of
manufacturing
technologies
.
Measurements
using
optical
microscopes
are
often
affected
by
common
path
noise
,
disturbance
in
light
source
and
ambient
lighting
,
etc.
,
which
cause
measurement
defects
and
outliers
,
as
well
as
attract
investigations
on
noisy
data
processing
.
The
need
for
standardization
is
becoming
ever
greater
as
the
range
of
capturing
three-dimensional
(
3D
)
information
of
microscope
techniques
continues
to
increase
.
For
optical
confocal
microscopes
,
the
Z-calibrations
at
nm
levels
are
typically
good
,
while
the
X-
and
Y-accuracies
are
often
left
,
without
further
notice
than
resolution
limits
of
the
optics
.
Among
the
investigations
of
lateral
calibrations
,
many
studies
focus
on
the
optical
system
.
For
example
,
H.
Ni
et
al.
proposed
a
new
method
to
achieve
structured
detection
using
a
spatial
light
modulator
,
which
modulates
the
Airy
disk
amplitude
distribution
according
to
the
detection
function
in
the
collection
arm
and
B.
Wang
et
al.
presented
confocal
microscopy
with
structured
detection
in
a
coherent
imaging
process
to
achieve
a
higher
resolution
with
a
comparably
large
pinhole
,
however
,
the
systematic
geometric
errors
which
adversely
affect
the
relative
position
and
orientation
between
measuring
probes
and
measurands
are
usually
neglected
.
B.
Daemi
et
al.
designed
a
comprehensive
verification
test
by
using
a
high
precision
metrology
method
based
on
subpixel
resolution
image
analysis
.
The
calibration
of
confocal
microscopes
usually
relies
on
traceable
standard
artefacts
,
which
are
commonly
made
up
of
regular
patterns
.

This
paper
describes
the
experimental
studies
based
on
the
kinematic
modeling
and
algorithms
for
the
correction
of
the
geometric
errors
developed
in
Part
I.
Section
2
and
Section
3
introduce
the
methodologies
for
experiments
and
uncertainty
evaluation
individually
.
Section
4
presents
the
experiment
on
a
dot
grid
target
for
correction
coefficients
determination
and
their
corresponding
uncertainty
evaluation
.
Section
5
implements
an
experiment
and
corrects
the
measured
data
with
determined
coefficients
,
comparing
the
residuals
with
respect
to
certified
values
before
and
after
corrections
.
Section
6
presents
the
conclusions
.
