Sydney
.
Two
Australia
wins
for
the
first
time
against
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Canada">
Canada
</ref>
.
In
the
team
's
52
–
50
win
against
Canada
you
scored
a
lay
up
with
sixteen
seconds
left
in
the
match

<p>
<hi rend="bold">

Carter
:
</hi>
I
did
!
That
was
pretty
memorable
actually
,
‘
cause
Canada
had
a
press
on
,
and
what
I
did
was
,
I
went
forward
and
then
went
back
,
and
they
did
n't
notice
me
sitting
behind
.
Except
Leisl
did
in
my
team
,
who
was
inbounding
the
ball
,
and
Leisl
hurled
a
big
pass
to
almost
half
way
to
me
,
which
I
ran
on
to
and
had
an
open
lay
up
.
And
the
Canadians
,
you
could
just
see
the
look
on
their
faces
as
Leisl
hurled
this
big
pass
,
thinking
&quot;
but
we
thought
we
had
them
all
trapped
&quot;
,
and
then
they
've
looked
and
seen
that
I
'm
already
over
half
way
waiting
for
this
pass
on
an
open
lay
up
.
Scariest
lay
up
I
've
ever
taken
,
mind
you
,
because
when
you
know
there
's
no
one
on
you
,
and
this
is
the
lay
up
that
could
win
the
game
,
it
's
like
:
&quot;
Do
n't
miss
this
!
Do
n't
miss
this
!
&quot;
And
I
just
thought
:
&quot;
Just
training
&quot;
Ping
!

You
were
knocked
down
and
you
tore
the
tendons
in
your
elbow
,
which
required
an
elbow
reconstruction
...
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Amanda

:
</hi>
Yes
.
And
multiple
surgeries
<hi rend="italic">
after

You
spent
eleven
weeks
on
a
CPM
machine
–
what
's
a
CPM
machine
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Amanda
Carter
:
</hi>
It
's
a
continuous
passive
movement
machine
.
You
know
what
they
use
for
the
footballers
after
they
've
had
a
knee
reconstruction
?
It
's
a
machine
that
moves
their
knee
up
and
down
so
it
does
n't
stiffen
.
And
they
start
with
just
a
little
bit
of
movement
following
the
surgery
and
they
're
supposed
to
get
up
to
about
90
degrees
before
they
go
home
.
There
was
only
one
or
two
elbow
machines
in
the
country
,
so
they
flew
one
in
from
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Queensland">
Queensland
</ref>
for
me
to
use
,
to
try
and
get
my
arm
moving
.
