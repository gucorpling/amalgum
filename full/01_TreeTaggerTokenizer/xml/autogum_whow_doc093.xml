Disassemble
,
Transport
,
and
Reassemble
a
PC
</head>
<p>
Moving
in
itself
can
be
an
overwhelming
endeavor
...
add
a
home
computer
to
the
mix
and
things
can
get
frustrating
.

Steps
</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Turn
the
computer
off
,
including
all
power
strips
.
Shut
your
computer
down
first
from
software
(
Start
Menu-&gt;Shut
Down
,
or
issue
&quot;
halt
&quot;
from
a
root
terminal
in
Linux
)
,
turn
off
the
power
strip
,
and
unplug
it
from
the
wall
.
If
you
have
an
uninterruptible
power
supply
,
disconnect
that
too
.
When
you
're
done
,
there
should
be
no
connect
between
your
hardware
and
any
power
source
.
Most
towers
have
a
small
light
somewhere
that
will
go
off
when
you
have
disconnected
its
power
cable
.
This
is
an
important
step
because
some
ports
can
be
damaged
by
unplugging
them
while
power
remains
.

Make
a
diagram
of
the
cabling
between
parts
,
and
draw
out
the
ports
on
each
.
The
point
here
is
not
photorealism
but
rather
to
know
later
that
there
's
a
cable
from
the
second
port
over
on
the
monitor
to
the
second
port
down
on
the
tower
.
So
trace
each
of
your
cables
,
figure
out
what
it
plugs
into
,
and
where
.
<figure rend="Disassemble, Transport, and Reassemble a PC Step 2.jpg">

<item>
Label
your
cables
.
I
like
to
wrap
masking
tape
around
the
cable
so
that
a
big
long
strip
hangs
off
,
and
then
double
that
over
to
make
a
tag
.
Label
where
each
end
of
the
cable
goes
.
Some
cables
cannot
be
reversed
(
for
example
,
your
camera
's
USB
cable
probably
has
a
big
end
for
the
computer
and
a
smaller
end
for
the
camera
)
.
<figure rend="Disassemble, Transport, and Reassemble a PC Step 3.jpg">

</item>
<item>
Unplug
all
the
cables
.
If
possible
,
unplug
them
at
both
ends
;
if
a
cable
is
wrenched
in
a
detachable
port
during
shipping
,
the
port
might
be
ruined
.
Either
loop
them
in
figure-eights
secured
with
a
zip
or
twist
tie
in
the
middle
,
or
in
a
circle
as
if
around
an
invisible
spool
,
secured
by
wrapping
one
end
in
a
spiral
around
the
curve
of
the
loop
.

Tape
the
cables
to
their
peripherals
.
If
you
look
at
your
cabling
diagram
,
you
'll
notice
that
just
about
everything
has
a
three-pronged
power
cable
into
the
wall
or
power
strip
,
and
an
odder-looking
data
cable
into
the
tower
.
So
the
tower
is
at
the
center
and
everything
else
is
at
the
periphery
,
hence
the
name
peripherals
to
refer
collectively
to
monitor
,
keyboard
,
etc.
Taping
each
cable
to
its
peripheral
prevents
them
from
getting
lost
or
mixed
up
.
Power
cables
in
particular
can
look
alike
.

Move
everything
over
.
If
you
can
get
it
all
driven
to
the
destination
,
make
sure
everything
is
secured
.
At
the
very
least
,
wedge
the
tower
in
the
passenger-side
footwell
rather
than
letting
it
rattle
around
in
the
trunk
,
and
put
the
monitor
in
a
box
so
nothing
stabs
into
the
screen
.
If
you
need
to
ship
it
,
consult
your
shipper
of
choice
about
appropriate
packing
protocol
.
Your
own
homebrew
methods
may
be
either
subpar
,
or
unacceptable
for
insurance
purposes
(
and
if
you
ship
a
computer
,
you
<hi rend="italic">
need
</hi>
insurance
)
.

Reverse
the
disassembly
.
The
very
cautious
will
want
to
plug
cables
in
at
the
less
expensive
end
first
.
Once
in
a
blue
moon
,
even
when
neither
end
is
connected
to
a
power
source
,
a
spark
will
jump
,
and
when
that
happens
it
could
burn
stuff
out
.
Besides
which
,
the
less
expensive
end
is
almost
always
the
peripheral
,
so
this
also
means
only
one
trip
under
the
desk
.

Plug
in
the
power
cables
.
Always
leave
power
to
last
.
Note
that
only
your
monitor
and
tower
should
plug
into
the
UPS
--
-additional
peripherals
will
reduce
its
discharge
time
dramatically
.

Most
jack
plugs
are
now
color-coded
along
with
the
outlet
on
the
back
of
the
computer
hard
drive
.
If
it
is
n't
,
however
,
a
small
picture
on
the
back
of
your
hard
drive
should
indicate
whether
the
outlet
belongs
to
the
mouse
,
keyboard
,
etc.

Using
a
variety
of
multicolored

pens
will
make
the
task
of
re-assembling
quick
and
easy
