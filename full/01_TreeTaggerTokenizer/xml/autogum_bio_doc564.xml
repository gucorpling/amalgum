of

Henry
VIII
</ref>
(
1509-1547
)
.
After
a
dispute
with
his
priest
over
his
infant
son
's
funeral
,
Hunne
sought
to
use
the
English
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law">
common
law
</ref>
courts
to
challenge
the
church
's
authority
.
In
response
,
church
officials
arrested
him
for
trial
in
an
ecclesiastical
court
on
the
capital
charge
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heresy">

</ref>
.
</p>
<p>
In
December
1514
,
while
awaiting
trial
,
Hunne
was
found
dead
in
his
cell
,
and
murder
by
church
officials
was
suspected
.
His
death
caused
widespread
anger
against
the
clergy
,
and
months
of
political
and
religious
turmoil
followed
.

Life
</head>
<p>
In
March
1511
,
Hunne
refused
to
pay
the
standard
mortuary
fee
,
the
baby
's
christening
robe
,
to
the
rector
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mary_Matfelon">

,
Thomas
Dryffeld
,
after
the
funeral
of
his
dead
five-week-old
son
called
Stephen
.
The
matter
was
not
pursued
by
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church">
Church
</ref>
until
Hunne
and
a
friend
challenged
the
rector
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Michael,_Cornhill">
St
Michael
Cornhill
</ref>
over
the
title
to
a
tenement
in
November
1511
.
Hunne
was
then
sued
by
the
rector
of
St
Mary
Matfelon
for
the
mortuary
fee
and
appeared
in
the
ecclesiastical
Court
of
Audience
,
presided
over
by

,
chancellor

Archbishop

in

The
court
found
in
favour
of
the
rector
.
</p>
<p>
On
27
December
1512
,
Hunne
attended
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vespers">

</ref>
at
the
same
church
and
the
priest
refused
to
proceed
with
the
service
until
Hunne
left
.

to
the
account
of
Hunne
in

the
priest
shouted
&quot;
Hunne
,
thou
art
accursed
and
standest
accursed
!
&quot;
,
meaning
by
this
that
Hunne
had
been
excommunicated
by
the
ecclesiastical
court
.
Hunne
responded
in
January
1513
by
suing
the
priest
for
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slander">
slander
</ref>
claiming
his
character
and
business
had
been
ruined
by
the
priest
's
accusation
.
He
also
counteracted
with
a
<hi rend="italic">
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praemunire">

</ref>
</hi>
charge
against
the
church
court
in
which
he
had
been
arraigned
and
argued
that
its
authority
derived
from
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_legate">

legate
</ref>
and
therefore
was
a
foreign

</p>
<p>
The
London
clergy
responded
by
again
charging
Hunne
,
this
time
for
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heresy">
heresy
</ref>
.
Hunne
was
then
sent
to
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lollards'_Tower">

'

</ref>
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_St_Paul's_Cathedral">

after

uncovered

with

</p>
<p>
Hunne
was
found
hanging
in
his
cell
on
4
December
1514
,
and
the
circumstances
were
suspicious
.
There
was
widespread
anger
against
the
clergy
among
the
populace
of
the
City
of
London
.
</p>
<p>
The
Church
went
ahead
with
Hunne
's
heresy
trial
in
spite
of
his
death
,
and
he
was
duly
condemned
.
His
corpse
was
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_by_burning">
burned
at
the
stake
</ref>
on
20
December
.
</p>
<p>
Hunne
's
accusers
claimed
that
he
had
committed
suicide
,
but
they
could
not
convince
the
coroner
's
jury
,
which
in
February
1515
,
charged
Horsey
,
chancellor
to
the
Bishop
of
London
,
and
two
other
church
officials
with
Hunne
's
murder
.
</p>
<p>
The
political
and
religious
crisis
continued
to
grow
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_FitzJames">
Bishop
FitzJames
of
London
</ref>
wrote
to
the
King
's
Chancellor
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Wolsey">
Archbishop
Wolsey
</ref>
,
asking
him
to
persuade
the
King
to
prevent
Horsey
being
put
on
trial
.
He
said
that
Horsey
would
not
get
a
fair
trial
because
of
the
strength
of
public
feeling
,
which
had
built
up
against
the
Church
:
&quot;
...
if
my
chancellor
be
tried
by
any
twelve
men
in
London
,
they
be
so
maliciously
set
in
favor
of
heretical
depravity
that
they
will
cast
and
condemn
my
clerk
though
he
be
as
innocent
as
Abel
.
&quot;
The
king
eventually
intervened
to
stifle
the
situation
.
</p>
<p>
Horsey
was
kept
in
prison
until
the
anger
in
London
abated
.
Then
he
was
brought
before
a
civil
court
,
but
King
Henry
had
ordered
his
attorney
general
to
see
that
the
case
was
dismissed
on
the
grounds
of
insufficient
evidence
.
Horsey
went
free
,
but
the
public
anger
was
acerbated
by
his
release
,
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_England">
Parliament
</ref>
became
more
and
more
involved
.
</p>
<p>
To
calm
the
situation
,
Wolsey
went
before
Parliament
and
on
his
knees
made
an
apology
to
them
on
behalf
of
the
clergy
.
Wolsey
's
real
aim
,
however
,
was
to
get
Parliament
to
agree
to
the
case
being
tried
in
Rome
.
Then
,
the
king
intervened
,
rejecting
Wolsey
's
proposal
and
stating
that
the
sovereign
of
the
realm
had
previously
made
his
decision
and
that
no
one
had
a
right
to
overrule
his
decision
but
God
himself
.
</p>
<p>
Wolsey
later
fined
Horsey
and
expelled
him
160
miles
from
the
capital
.
Horsey
lived
out
the
rest
of
his
life
in
great
poverty
.
</p>
<head>
Aftermath
</head>
<p>
In
1515
,
as
a
result
of
this
affair
,
Parliament
debated
whether
to
approve
a
bill
to
restore
to
Hunne
's
children
the
property
that
had
been
forfeited
when
their
father
was
found
,
posthumously
,
guilty
of
heresy
.
The
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_House_of_Commons">
House
of
Commons
</ref>
petitioned
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VIII_of_England">

to

on

and
an
attempt
was
made
to
extend

against

</ref>
.
None
of
the
proposed

was
enacted
.

<p>
Foxe
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Foxe-1">

recounted
Hunne
's
case
as
evidence
of

of

ecclesiastical
courts
on
the

of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Reformation">
