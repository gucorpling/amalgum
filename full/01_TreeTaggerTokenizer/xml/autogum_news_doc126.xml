Five
of
the
six
defendants
accused
of
manslaughter
over
the
2006
fire
on
board
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Egypt">
Egyptian
</ref>
ferry
<hi rend="italic">
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV%20al%20Salam%20Boccaccio%2098">

</ref>
</hi>
have
been
cleared
of
all
charges
.
The
February
3
fire
and
subsequent
sinking
killed
1,034
of
around
1,400
passengers
.
</p>
<p>
Mamdouh
Ismail
,
owner
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El%20Salam%20Maritime%20Transport">
al-Salam
company
</ref>
,
his
son
and
three
company
executives
were
all
cleared
of
manslaughter
.
Ismail
is
a
member
of
parliament
directly
appointed
by
the
president
,
and
both
he
,
his
son
and
another
of
the
executives
were
tried
<hi rend="italic">
in
absentia
</hi>
as
they
have
left
the
country
.
They
had
all
been
charged
with
manslaughter
stemming
from
safety
violations
on
the
ship
.
</p>
<p>
Convicted
was
Salaheddin
Gomaa
,
captain
of
nearby
ferry
<hi rend="italic">
Saint
Catherine
</hi>
.
He
was
jailed
for
six
months
after
the
court
found
he
did
not
come
to
the
stricken
<hi rend="italic">
al-Salam
98
'
</hi>
s
aid
.
It
found
he
&quot;
did
not
do
his
duty
by
failing
to
go
to
the
rescue
of
victims
,
&quot;
and
that
he
failed
to
show
any
compassion
.

The
ship
went
down
in
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%20Sea">
Red
Sea
</ref>
near
Egyptian
port
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safaga">

</ref>
,
where
the
trial
was
held
,
having
departed
earlier
from
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia">
Saudi
Arabia
</ref>
'
s
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaba">

</ref>
port
.
A
parliamentary
report
balmed
the
disaster
's
scale
on
the
owners
,
as
well
as
the
government
and
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Panama">
Panama
</ref>
,
the
state
where
the
ship
was
registered
.
The
report
said
al-Salam
had
kept
operating
the
ship
&quot;
despite
serious
defects
&quot;
with
her
,
and
that
the
government
had
&quot;
failed
to
manage
the
crisis
adequately
&quot;
in
the
following
days
.
</p>
<p>
It
was
found
that
the
36-year-old
<hi rend="italic">
al-Salam
98
'
</hi>
s
safety
documents
were
forged
,
that
the
ship
's
extuinguishers
and
life
rafts
were
not
fit
for
purpose
and
that
there
were
an
inadequate
number
of
winches
to
lower
the
rafts
into
the
sea
.
However
,
the
elder
Ismail
had
put
the
blame
on
his
ferry
's
captain
,
who
he
claimed
wrongly
believed
the
crew
could
deal
with
the
fire
when
it
broke
out
.
The
captain
was
amongst
the
dead
.
</p>
<p>
Ismail
's
assets
were
frozen
and
a
travel
ban
was
imposed
on
him
following
the
disaster
,
but
both
were
lifted
later
that
year
after
he
paid
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian%20pound">
E£
</ref>
300,000,000
(
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United%20States%20Dollar">
US$
</ref>
57,000,000
)
into
a
victim
's
compensation
fund
.
Many
victims
were
poor
Egyptian
migrant
workers
,
and
some
were
bringing
home
savings
accumulated
over
months
or
years
.
</p>
<p>
The
Misdemeanor
Court
's
acquittal
of
all
except
Gomaa
—
who
was
fined
E£10,000
(
US$
1,887
)
—
met
with
anger
from
relatives
,
who
turned
out
<hi rend="italic">
en
masse
</hi>
to
hear
the
verdicts
.
One
man
told
<hi rend="italic">
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/al-Jazeera">
al-Jazeera
</ref>
</hi>
&quot;
The
day
of
the
accident
everybody
saw
that
the
ship
was
in
bad
shape
and
two
years
later
they
say
the
boat
was
in
good
shape
.
It
does
n't
make
sense
.
This
is
awful
.
My
wife
and
children
died
and
after
two
years
everyone
responsible
is
found
to
be
innocent
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Public
prosecutor
Abdel
Meguid
Mahmud
was
also
unhappy
with
the
result
.
In
a
statement
he
said
he
intends
to
appeal
the
verdict
and
demand
a
retrial
.
He
alleges
serious
&quot;
violations
in
documented
records
,
corruption
in
investigation
,
shortcomings
in
validatings
and
arbitrary
conclusions
,
&quot;
and
cites
these
as
his
reasons
for
a
retrial
.
