While
Tim
Berners-Lee
was
n't
enthusiastic
about
it
,
you
called
for
the
first
International
WWW
conference
.
How
did
those
conferences
shape
the
WWW
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Robert
Cailliau
</hi>
:
The
conferences
still
run
,
the
2007
one
was
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banff,%20Alberta">
Banff
</ref>
.
They
are
an
occasion
to
meet
and
work
very
hard
for
a
few
days
at
the
exchange
of
ideas
.
The
papers
of
the
presentations
are
published
in
well-known
academic
journals
.
That
incites
people
to
prepare
well
and
present
to
colleagues
.
Many
web
technologies
started
at
one
of
the
conferences
(
proxies
,
VRML
,
...
)
Working
groups
are
established
there
.
Because
many
want
to
go
but
can
do
so
only
when
funded
by
their
institute
or
company
,
it
often
means
they
have
to
present
a
paper
.
Vague
ideas
are
then
consolidated
and
cast
into
programming
code
,
which
otherwise
might
not
happen
.
</p>
<p>
In
addition
the
Conference
Committee
soon
convinced
the
Web
Consortium
to
hold
one
of
its
annual
meetings
in
conjunction
with
the
conference
.
I
am
no
longer
involved
with
this
,
but
at
least
during
the
years
1996
to
2004
this
synergy
was
present
and
a
track
of
the
conference
was
devoted
to
the
work
of
the
Consortium
.
Therefore
Tim
was
also
present
every
year
.
</p>
<p>
I
always
saw
the
Consortium
as
the
&quot;
church
&quot;
with
Tim
as
the
&quot;
pope
&quot;
.
In
the
Consortium
there
is
a
set
of
rules
for
arriving
at
decisions
after
which
everyone
has
to
abide
by
them
.
There
are
industrial
and
sometimes
political
stakes
.
</p>
<p>
The
Conferences
however
,
as
long
as
I
was
member
of
the
Committee
,
I
saw
as
the
&quot;
state
&quot;
of
&quot;
laymen
&quot;
;
you
had
freedom
of
expression
and
could
propose
the
most
wild
schemes
.
Between
church
and
state
I
prefer
a
complete
separation
.
</p>
<p>
That
did
not
mean
of
course
that
we
did
not
collaborate
closely
between
Consortium
and
Conference
Committee
:
there
always
was
a
delegate
of
the
Consortium
member
of
the
Committee
although
that
was
not
a
requirement
.
We
wanted
both
to
be
successful
.

Related
to
that
,
I
have
been
told
the
WWW
was
initially
to
run
on
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/micropayments">
micropayments
</ref>
.
Who
had
that
idea
,
and
why
do
you
believe
it
never
came
about
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Robert
Cailliau
</hi>
:
It
never
was
in
the
original
goals
to
use
micropayments
.
However
,
for
keynote
speaker
of
the
first
conference
(
May
1994
)
I
had
invited
David
Schaum
,
an
expert
in
digital
money
.
I
was
therefore
already
then
convinced
of
the
need
for
digital
money
:
payment
with
guaranteed
value
but
not
traceable
origin
.
We
still
do
not
have
anything
like
that
.
To
me
a
much
more
important
reason
to
introduce
digital
money
than
untraceability
is
a
free
market
for
information
.
</p>
<p>
The
ideas
of
digital
payments
were
targeting
sales
of
goods
and
payment
of
subscriptions
.
To
me
it
is
more
important
to
break
the
vicious
triangle
of
author-reader-advertiser
.
</p>
<p>
In
the
beginning
I
was
often
completely
misunderstood
.
There
were
even
newspaper
articles
that
led
to
hate-mail
through
incomprehension
.
