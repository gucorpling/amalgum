<p>
I
would
go
in
there
and
do
just
the
opposite
.
I
would
make
sure
that
was
separated
.
People
set
their
own
index
.
Make
it
open
.
Right
now
these
things
are
traded
secretly
.
Put
it
out
there
just
like
any
other
stock
exchange
,
and
make
sure
that
when
people
bet
money
that
they
got
the
resources
to
cover
it
one
way
or
the
other
.
I
mean
,
you
do
n't
let
people
go
to
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Las_Vegas">
Las
Vegas
</ref>
with
two
dollars
and
make
a
ten
dollar
bet
.
We
should
n't
let
these
people
do
it
either
,
especially
when
where
we
're
guaranteeing
it
.
But
Obama
is
and
the
man
is
weakening
for
Wall
Street
.

Do
you
believe
Obama
has
done
any
good
things
as
president
?

If
[
Obama
]
would
just
educate
the
people
like
I
could
,
he
would
get
people

he

:
Well
,
I
think
it
was
good
doing
away
with
do
n't
ask
,
do
n't
tell
.
I
think
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American%20Recovery%20and%20Reinvestment%20Act%20of%202009">
stimulus
</ref>
was
a
good
start
but
it
was
n't
very
effective
because
it
was
n't
enough
.
He
's
been
too
cautious
about
a
lot
of
things
.
He
tried
to
increase
the
taxes
on
the
very
well-to-do
.
The
top
one
fifth
own
94
percent
of
financial
wealth
in
this
country
.
They
were
saved
by
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troubled%20Asset%20Relief%20Program">
bailouts
</ref>
.
They
made
money
when
the
stock
market
went
down
to
six
thousand
so
they
could
invest
low
...
People
like
that
who
were
saved
and
benefited
by
these
trillion
dollar
bailouts
should
be
the
ones
paying
higher
tax
rates
now
,
but
Obama
has
n't
emphasized
that
point
.
He
has
not
instructed
people
.
He
is
n't
going
out
there
and
telling
people
the
stuff
I
'm
telling
you
.
If
he
would
just
educate
the
people
like
I
could
,
he
would
get
people
on
his
side
and
he
would
win
an
election
based
on
a
populist
economic
view
.
People
get
back
to
work
and
people
make
money
and
people
are
empowered
then
businesses
make
more
money
too
.
</p>
<p>
It
's
not
like
we
want
to
nationalize
resources
and
take
away
private
capital
.
We
just
want
to
work
with
feet
.
The
end
of
the
economy
is
the
betterment
of
the
people
and
not
just
the
accumulation
of
capital
and
casino
capitalism
.
It
's
not
that
.
You
know
it
's
the
betterment
of
people
.
Capitalism
is
a
means
to
an
end
.
It
's
not
the
ends
itself
.
Human
needs
are
not
cyclical
.
Economic
cycles
of
the
economy
can
be
cyclical
,
but
that
's
why
you
have
to
have
fair
taxes
,
an
interventionist
government
to
make
sure
that
society
works
for
the
people
and
Obama
's
not
doing
that
.
The
man
has
failed
.
