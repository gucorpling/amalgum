Nauru
's
Government
Information
Office
Director
Joanna
Olsson
appeared
to
be
unaware
that
the
new
visa
fee
had
yet
to
take
effect
,
writing
an
email
to
a
visa
applicant
about
the
new
fee
last
Tuesday
:
&quot;
Sorry
for
the
late
response
but
yes
we
are
granting
media
visas
.
The
fee
is
$
8000
per
visa
,
single
entry
valid
for
3
months
.
The
visa
fee
is
not
refundable
if
the
application
is
not
successful
.
&quot;
She
also
claimed
the
new
fee
had
been
implemented
&quot;
a
couple
[
of
]
months
ago

<p>
On
the
contrary
,
on
Thursday
during
a
meeting
,
Nauru
's
Principal
Immigration
Officer
Ernest
Stephen
said
the
price
change
was
&quot;
not
official
&quot;
and
the
price
rise
had
not
yet
passed
into
law
through
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament%20of%20Nauru">
Parliament
</ref>
.
Stephen
said
only
three
or
four
Nauru
media
visas
were
granted
last
year
.
</p>
<p>
A
member
of
Nauru
Opposition
Group
,
Mathew
Batsiua
,
claimed
the
move
was
an
oppression
of
journalistic
freedom
.
&quot;
They
[
the
Nauru
authorities
]
certainly
bully
our
local
media
in
terms
of
what
they
can
show
,
who
they
can
interview
,
and
this
is
another
illustration
of
that
kind
of
behaviour
in
terms
of
bullying
media
and
avoiding
accountability
.
...
This
hiking
up
of
fees
for
journalists
coming
in
to
Nauru
is
a
step
in
that
direction
,
and
we
think
that
it
's
the
wrong
move
and
we
're
certainly
opposing
it
.

<p>
The

[

harsh
,
with
little
