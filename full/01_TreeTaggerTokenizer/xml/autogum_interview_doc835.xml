When
does
a
symbol
become
historical
and
when
is
it
intrinsically
religious
?
For
instance
,
a
community
that
was
once
a
mission
and
they
have
had
a
large
cross
on
a
mountaintop
that
to
them
is
more
historical
marker
.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">

</hi>
That
’s
the
question
.
With
a
lot
of
legal
questions
—
and
since
you
are
a
lawyer
,
or
almost
a
lawyer
,
right
?

</hi>
It
is
what
a
lawyer
calls
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law
,
but
there
is
an
ultimate
legal
criterion
that
is
really
a
factual
question
.
That
’s
what
her
question
is
,
and
what
the
Court
now
asks
:
“
Would
a
reasonable
observer
who
is
familiar
with
the
overall
context
,
history
and
circumstances
,
see
that
as
promoting
a
religious
message
or
not
?
”
And
I
do
n’t
know
the
answer
to
that
;
it
all
depends
on
the
particular
facts
and
circumstances
.
The
way
you
describe
it
,
it
sounds
as
if
a
reasonable
observer
would
<hi rend="italic">
not
</hi>
see
it
as
a
promotion
of
religion
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
That
’s
always
the
problem
in
law
:
who
is
that
reasonable
observer
?
Someone
from
the
community
,
someone
who
has
just
moved
into
the
community
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
NS
:
</hi>
Exactly
!
You
get
that
in
a
lot
of
areas
of
law

David

I
think
another
one
that
my
students
in
my
free
speech
class
were
talking
about
yesterday
is
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obscenity#United_States_obscenity_law">
obscenity
</ref>
.
That
’s
defined
according
to
contemporary
community
standards
.
Is
it
patently
offensive
?
Does
it
appeal
to
the
<ref target="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/prurient">
prurient
</ref>
interest
in
sex
?
Does
it
have
serious
value
?
Reasonable
people
can
disagree
about
that
,
and
that
’s
what
our
jury
system
and
our
legal
system
are
for
,
and
there
are
some
cases
where
reasonable
people
will
disagree
,
no
doubt
about
it
.
But
I
think
the
principle
is
right
,
if
it
were
up
to
me
I
ca
n’t
think
of
a
better
way
to
try
to
maintain
fidelity
to
all
of
the
values
—
necessarily
there
’s
a
tension
when
the
government
is
trying
to
walk
this
neutral
line
.
It
goes
on
this
side
and
it
is
supporting
religion
,
which
is
improper
;
it
goes
to
that
side
and
it
is
oppressing
religion
,
which
is
improper
.

DS

Going
back
to
when
you
have
debated
religious
conservatives
and
they
make
the
charge
that
what
the
ACLU
is
working
toward
is
no
religion
in
schools
,
and
you
ca
n’t
have
a
prayer
group
,
do
you
think
there
is
a
conscious
motivation
to
misrepresent
what
you
have
done
and
want
,
or
is
it
a
misunderstanding
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
NS
:
</hi>
It
depends
upon
about
whom
you
are
speaking
.
For
some
people
it
is
a
definite
distortion
,
because
I
know
that
they
know
better
.
But
in
some
cases
it
is
literally
a
good
faith
misunderstanding
in
part
<hi rend="italic">
because
</hi>
of
the
deliberate
distortions
that
they
are
hearing
,
including
from
top
government
officials
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald%20Reagan">
Ronald
Reagan
</ref>
said
in
speeches
that
the
Supreme
Court
has
told
little
children
that
they
may
not
pray
.
Many
people
more
recently
,
including
[
former
]
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest%20Istook">
Congressman
Istook
</ref>
,
who
regularly
introduced
an
amendment
to
the
Constitution
to
,
as
he
says
,
“
Restore
prayer
and
religious
freedom
.
”
Every
couple
of
years
he
gives
a
speech
—
I
read
the
most
recent
version
—
in
which
he
says
the
Supreme
Court
has
“
removed
religion
from
the
public
square
!
”
Surely
you
’ve
heard
that
.
It
’s
ironic
when
you
compare
our
country
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion%20in%20Europe">
Western
European
countries
</ref>
;
they
think
religion
—
and
it
is
literally
true
—
that
religion
is
<hi rend="italic">
thriving
</hi>
in
the
public
square
here
in
a
way
that
is
off
the
charts
compared
to
other
developed
industrialized
nations
.
I
think
that
’s
wonderful
!
I
think
religion
has
been
a
very
positive
force
in
America
.
As
with
everything
,
there
is
a
good
and
a
bad
;
but
certainly
on
the
issues
I
care
about
,
religion
has
been
a
driving
force
behind
civil
rights
,
the
abolition
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American%20slavery">
slavery
</ref>
,
the
death
penalty
.
No
matter
what
the
religious
group
is
,
including
the
so-called
religious
right
—
which
in
some
contexts
will
attack
the
ACLU
,
and
in
others
work
very
closely
with
the
ACLU
.
Post
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11">
9/11
</ref>
we
worked
very
closely
with
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyllis%20Schlafly">
Phyllis
Schlafly
</ref>
’
s
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle%20Forum">
Eagle
Forum
</ref>
and
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American%20Family%20Association">
American
Family
Association
</ref>
,
and
others
,
who
are
very
traditional
conservatives
and
very
suspicious
of
federal
government
power
concentrated
in
the
executive
branch
.
Very
protective
of
individual
privacy
.
They
are
<hi rend="italic">
completely
</hi>
with
the
ACLU
in
opposing
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REAL%20ID%20Act">
Real
ID
</ref>
and
opposing
a
lot
of
the
post-9/11
dragnet
measures
.
And
let
’s
not
forget
that
the
free
exercise
of
religion
,
they
know
the
ACLU
is
in
their
corner
and
on
the
professional
level
we
work
together
,
lobbying
.
Years
ago
,
when
the
Supreme
Court
gutted
the
free
exercise
clause
of
the
First
Amendment
,
I
testified
in
Congress
in
support
of
something
called
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious%20Freedom%20Restoration%20Act">
Religious
Freedom
Restoration
Act
</ref>
that
<hi rend="italic">
every
</hi>
single
religious
denomination
under
the
sun
was
on
our
side
.
The
ACLU
was
the
spearhead
of
that
legislation
.
So
there
’s
a
difference
between
what
group
’s
professional
staff
members
are
doing
when
it
comes
to
Supreme
Court
arguments
and
Congressional
testimony
versus
what
their
fund
raising
letters
say
,
or
what
their
radio
programs
say
.
