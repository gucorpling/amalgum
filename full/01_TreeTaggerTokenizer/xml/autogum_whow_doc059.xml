Drive
an
Air
Bag
Equipped
Car
</head>
<p>
Beginning
in
the
1980s
,
vehicle
manufacturers
started
installing
air
bags
in
vehicle
steering
wheels
.
By
1998
,
passenger
vehicles
were
required
to
be
equipped
with
dual
air
bags
,
while
in
2001
,
the
National
Highway
Transportation
Safety
Administration
(
NHTSA
)
required
that
all
new
light
trucks
have
dual
air
bags
,
one
for
the
driver
and
one
installed
in
the
dashboard
for
the
passenger
.
Air
bags
are
also
located
in
the
vehicle
's
frame
just
above
each
door
.
The
force
of
an
accidental
collision
trips
an
Airbag
sensor
,
which
activates
a
sodium
azide
fuse
.
As
the
fuse
is
activated
,
it
triggers
the
Airbag
to
deploy
at
a
speed
of
200
kilometers
per
hour
(
124
miles
per
hour
)
.
Air
bags
deploy
quickly
,
increasing
the
risk
of
injury
or
potential
death
if
the
driver
is
positioned
too
closely
to
the
steering
wheel
.
Because
of
this
,
drivers
need
to
learn
how
to
drive
an
air-bag
equipped
car
.

The
letters
&quot;
S.R.S.
&quot;
stand
for
&quot;
supplementary
restraint
system
,
&quot;
which
means
the
Airbag
is
intended
to
be
used
along
with
your
car
's
seat
belts
.
Your
seat
belts
are
the
primary
restraint
system
protecting
you
in
an
accident
.
</item>
<item>
The
seat
belts
in
your
car
help
keep
you
positioned
safely
so
that
,
if
you
are
involved
in
a
collision
,
the
Airbag
wo
n't
injure
you
when
it
deploys
.
</item>
<item>
During
a
collision
,
a
sensor
in
the
vehicle
signals
the
Airbag
to
ignite
a
fuse
.
This
fuse
explodes
and
produces
nitrogen
gas
.
The
airbag
deploys
50
milliseconds
after
a
collision
severe
enough
to
warrant
Airbag
protection
.

The
air
bags
in
your
car
inflate
very
quickly
.
You
or
your
children
could
be
seriously
injured
or
killed
if
you
're
sitting
too
close
to
an
Airbag.
.
</item>

Push
the
driver
's
seat
back
far
enough
so
that
,
if
the
Airbag
deploys
,
you
are
n't
injured
by
the
force
of
deployment
.
You
should
have
at
least
10
inches
(
25.4
cm
)
of
space
between
you
and
the
airbag
if
it
deploys
.
</item>
<item>
Ask
passengers
to
push
the
front
passenger
seat
back
far
enough
so
they
wo
n't
be
injured
by
the
airbags
deployment
during
a
collision
.

Place
a
rear-facing
infant
car
seat
in
the
center
rear
set
so
the
baby
in
the
car
seat
is
at
a
distance
from
the
Airbag
and
the
force
of
a
potential
collision
.
</item>
<item>
Depending
on
the
laws
in
your
state
,
children
may
be
required
to
ride
in
the
back
seat
until
they
reach
a
certain
age
or
height
.
Because
of
their
small
size
,
a
deploying
Airbag
can
potentially
kill
a
child

Tips
</head>
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Air
bags
may
not
deploy
for
every
type
of
collision
.
Factors
such
as
what
you
collide
with
and
the
angle
of
collision
influence
whether
the
Airbag
will
deploy
.
</item>
<item>
There
is
no
way
to
avoid
an
unexpected
deployment
unless
you
know
your
car
has
been
recalled
due
to
of
faulty
air
bags
.
You
cannot
safely
test
air
bags
to
see
if
they
are
faulty
