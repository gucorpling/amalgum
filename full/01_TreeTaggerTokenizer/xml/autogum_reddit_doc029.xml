Choosing
a
health
insurance
package
for
the
first
time
.
</head>
<sp who="#alphadog3939">
<p>
Pretty
much
I
'm
new
to
all
of
this
,
and
am
looking
at
my
options
.
One
has
a
monthly
premium
of
around
$
85
,
on
top
of
the
deductible
of
$
6300
.
So
-
will
I
be
paying
the
deductible
regardless
?
Or
if
only
something
big
-
like
a
surgery
-
comes
up
?
I
'm
kinda
lost
on
choosing
which
one
to
go
with
as
there
are
a
bunch
of
packages
to
choose
from
-
some
with
no
deductibles
at
all
,
but
higher
premium
,
high
premium
,
low
deductible
,
etc.

Here
's
the
basics
of
health
insurance
.
</p>
<p>
You
will
pay
the
premium
every
month
.
If
you
do
n't
go
to
the
doctor
,
you
will
only
pay
the
premium
for
that
month
.
(
Preventative
care
*
is
included
in
the
premium
and
should
n't
cost
you
anything
more
than
the
premium
if
everything
is
billed
correctly
.
)
</p>
<p>
Something
happens
and
you
need
to
go
to
the
doctor
to
get
diagnosed
and
get
medicine
.
Maybe
you
have
a
UTI
,
a
fever
,
or
a
sore
throat
that
had
been
around
for
a
while
.
You
can
probably
get
this
handled
by
your
primary
care
physician
.
To
know
how
much
it
'll
cost
,
you
look
on
your
plan
summary
under
'
primary
care
physician
'
or
'
office
visit
'
.
It
'll
likely
say
something
like
$
50
co-pay
or
20
%
after
deductible
.
</p>
<p>
If
it
says
$
50
co-pay
,
your
visit
will
just
cost
you
$
50
or
less
.
(
This
is
in
addition
to
your
monthly
premium
.
All
costs
from
here
on
out
are
in
addition
to
your
monthly
premium
.
)
</p>
<p>
If
it
says
20
%
after
deductible
,
then
you
're
responsible
for
the
full
cost
of
the
visit
unless
you
've
met
your
deductible
.
If
you
've
met
your
deductible
,
you
're
only
responsible
for
20
%
of
the
cost
of
the
visit
.
</p>
<p>
There
's
also
something
called
an
out-of-pocket-max
(
oopm
)
.
This
is
the
maximum
you
'll
have
to
pay
for
medical
care
in
a
given
year
.
Most
plan
years
go
from
January
1
to
December
31
.
</p>
<p>
Let
's
say
something
big
happened
.
You
got
cancer
and
needed
surgery
,
chemo
,
and
radiation
.
Luckily
,
you
caught
everything
early
and
you
had
treatment
from
February
to
July
.
Cancer
is
expensive
,
so
you
reached
your
oopm
in
March
.
This
means
that
fever
and
sore
throat
you
get
in
October
is
covered
100
%
by
your
insurance
and
all
you
have
to
do
is
pay
your
monthly
premium
.
</p>
<p>
#Assuming
you
stay
in-network
and
have
medical
insurance
all
year
,
the
least
you
'll
spend
on
medical
care
is
your
monthly
premium
x
12
.
The
most
you
'll
spend
on
medical
care
is
your
monthly
premium
x
12
+
your
oopm
.
</p>
<p>
Preventative
care
*
</p>
<p>
Just
because
you
go
to
see
your
doctor
for
a
yearly
physical
,
does
n't
mean
that
everything
is
preventative
.
If
your
doctor
orders
blood
work
or
other
diagnostic
testing
,
the
testing
is
n't
preventative
.
If
your
doctor
gives
you
advice
or
consults
you
about
some
condition
,
your
visit
may
not
be
billed
as
preventative
care
.
It
's
ridiculous
,
but
it
happens
.
You
go
to
your
doctor
expecting
to
not
spend
anything
,
but
then
they
take
your
blood
pressure
,
notice
it
's
a
little
high
,
recommend
a
blood
test
or
a
consultation
with
a
different
doctor
,
you
trust
your
doctor
and
agree
only
to
find
out
that
the
extra
stuff
is
n't
covered
as
preventative
.
</p>
<p>
This
basically
happens
every
day
either
here
or
on
r
personalfinance
(
or
someone
does
n't
check
with
their
insurance
if
a
doctor
or
a
facility
is
in-network
)
and
there
is
very
little
you
can
do
to
not
pay
the
bill
.
