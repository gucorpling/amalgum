Why
are
you
running
for
political
office
,
why
at
the
federal
level
,
why
this
party
,
and
why
in
this
riding
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
I
am
running
for
federal
office
because
I
feel
that
is
where
I
have
the
most
to
offer
,
and
where
the
issues
that
affect
myself
and
my
friends
are
the
most
significant
.
I
have
chosen
to
run
for
the
NDP
because
not
only
is
this
a
party
of
strong
leadership
,
but
also
because
I
really
believe
in
the
messages
of
the
party
.
I
am
running
in
this
riding
because
it
is
where
I
live
and
play
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Previous
to
this
campaign
,
have
you
been
politically
involved
?
How
will
you
apply
your
previous
work/volunteer/life
experience
to
serving
your
constituents
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
I
have
been
politically
active
almost
my
entire
life
.
As
a
student
I
was
strongly
involved
in
FESFO(The
Francophone
Students
Federation
)
,
and
when
I
moved
to
this
area
I
became
involved
in
the
party
as
a
member
of
the
riding
association
executive
.
</p>
<p>
I
have
been
working
through
the
'
tech
burst
'
and
know
very
well
how
it
has
affect
the
people
of
this
riding
and
this
country
.
I
also
have
a
great
deal
of
experience
driving
for
what
is
right
.
I
have
been
referred
to
in
my
job
as
a
'
pitbull
'
because
I
do
n't
give
up
on
a
problem
or
issue
just
because
someone
says
that
there
is
no
easy
solution
.
Usually
the
most
difficult
solutions
are
also
the
most
effective
.
</p>
<p>
As
a
member
of
Toastmasters
I
have
learned
an
incredible
amount
about
speaking
,
sharing
information
,
working
as
part
of
a
team
,
and
providing
strong
leadership
to
my
peers
.
</p>
<p>
Through
my
work
as
a
Stage
Manager
for
musical
theater
I
have
learned
to
wear
many
hats
at
the
same
time
,
build
teams
,
friendships
,
and
strengthen
groups
to
achieve
very
complex
goals
</p>

As
you
campaign
around
your
riding
,
it
's
likely
that
some
issues
are
mentioned
more
often
by
voters
,
than
other
issues
.
What
would
you
say
are
the
three
hottest
topics
this
election
,
in
your
riding
?
What
would
you
and
your
party
do
to
address
these
issues
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
The
biggest
issue
around
this
riding
and
across
the
country
is
the
economy
.
We
see
the
'
economy
'
as
a
blanket
statement
,
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
,
for
myself
anyway
,
I
see
the
'
economy
'
as
being
a
question
of
whether
or
not
I
will
have
a
job
tomorrow
.
:
For
so
many
people
,
knowledge
workers
and
others
alike
,
knowing
that
one
might
be
out
of
work
tomorrow
causes
an
incredible
amount
of
stress
on
individuals
and
their
families
.
</p>
<p>
The
NDP
has
a
strong
plan
to
address
the
loss
of
jobs
in
this
country
,
and
I
personally
have
a
plan
to
move
our
technology
sector
forward
by
working
with
industry
leaders
,
and
community
members
.
Training
and
skills
advancement
is
the
only
way
that
we
as
Canadians
will
be
able
to
distinguish
ourselves
in
the
future
knowledge
economy
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Are
there
any
misconceptions
about
you
,
your
leader
,
or
your
party
and
platform
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
I
do
n't
know
about
any
misconceptions
about
myself
,
but
many
people
believe
that
the
NDP
does
n't
have
the
drive
or
skill
to
run
this
country
.
That
is
absolutely
false
.
We
have
the
depth
of
experience
and
passion
to
move
this
country
forward
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
There
are
more
ways
than
ever
to
get
your
message
out
,
from
the
traditional
campaign
fliers
and
lawn
signs
,
to
new
media
like
websites
,
Facebook
,
and
YouTube
.
The
tried-and-true
routes
get
the
message
out
to
the
masses
much
easier
,
but
digital
alternatives
are
much
more
measurable
in
how
many
are
seeing
or
interacting
with
your
campaign
.
What
seems
to
be
the
most
effective
,
from
your
experience
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
So
far
I
've
been
trying
just
about
everything
,
it
would
seem
that
web
pages
are
currently
the
way
to
go
.
I
have
received
many
comments
,
questions
,
and
kudos
by
people
because
they
have
seen
the
web
page
and
know
where
to
find
us
.
</p>
<p>
I
have
received
many
complaints
this
election
about
the
number
of
signs
throughout
the
community
and
that
brings
me
forward
to
question
where
exactly
this
will
lead
in
the
future
I
do
n't
know
.
Doing
away
with
campaign
signs
sounds
like
a
good
idea
to
me
since
they
seem
to
be
so
wasteful
.
</p>
<p>
In
this
campaign
we
are
experimenting
with
different
marketing
techniques
that
go
along
with
'
fliers
'
but
line
up
more
toward
a
marketing
campaign
.
Since
we
have
the
ability
and
technology
do
do
small
run
,
high
quality
documents
from
the
home
,
why
not
put
those
to
use
,
and
tailor
the
message
to
the
audience
.
