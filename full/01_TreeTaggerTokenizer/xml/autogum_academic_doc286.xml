Introduction
</head>
<p>
The
production
of
food
manufacturing
wastes
(
FMWs
)
is
potentially
damaging
to
the
environment
;
these
materials
,
if
not
properly
disposed
of
,
can
lead
to
the
release
of
greenhouse
gases
or
contaminate
soil
and
water
as
they
decay
.
Biotechnological
approaches
may
be
one
solution
to
utilize
these
materials
before
they
cause
damage
to
the
environment
.
</p>
<p>
In
Chile
,
three
important
waste
materials
generated
from
the
food
manufacturing
industry
are
olive-mill
solid
waste
(
OMSW
)
,
tomato
pomace
(
TP
)
,
and
grape
pomace
(
GP
)
.
OMSW
is
a
sub-product
of
olive
oil
production
by
two-phase
centrifugation
.
It
is
composed
of
a
liquid
fraction
also
known
as
“
alpechin
”
and
a
semisolid
residue
known
as
“
alperujo
”
.
The
chemical
characterization
of
“
alperujo
”
reveals
a
high
moisture
content
,
slightly
acidic
pH
,
and
high
content
of
organic
matter
,
mainly
consisting
of
lignin
,
hemicellulose
,
and
cellulose
.
Furthermore
,
“
alperujo
”
contains
lipids
and
water-soluble
polyphenols
.
TP
is
a
sub-product
of
tomato
processing
which
mainly
consists
of
peels
and
seeds
and
is
composed
of
lignocellulosic
material
,
proteins
,
minerals
,
and
lipids
.
GP
is
a
sub-product
of
grape
processing
,
mainly
composed
of
lignocellulosic
residues
,
glucan
,
alcohol
,
phenols
,
and
flavonoids
.
</p>
<p>
One
of
the
simplest
strategies
for
disposal
of
these
FMWs
is
biodegradation
through
enzymatic
attack
.
FMWs
are
mainly
composed
of
lignocellulose
,
of
which
cellulose
is
the
major
component
(
20
–
50
%
<hi rend="italic">
w/w
</hi>
)
.
In
nature
,
a
wide
range
of
microorganisms
can
use
cellulose
as
a
carbon
and
energy
source
.
To
accomplish
this
,
fungi
and
bacteria
secrete
extracellular
enzymes
able
to
degrade
this
complex
polymer
.
Cellulose
is
hydrolyzed
by
three
different
classes
of
enzymes
:
endo-β-1,4-D-glucanases
(
EC
3.2.1.4
)
,
which
hydrolyze
internal
β-1,4-glucosidic
linkages
,
1,4-β-D-glucan
cellobiohydrolases
(
EC
3.2.1.91
)
,
which
cleave
off
cellulose
fragments
from
the
cellulose
chain
ends
,
generating
the
cellobiose
disaccharide
and
β-D-glucosidases
(
EC
3.2.1.21
)
,
which
use
cellobiose
hydrolysis
to
generate
glucose
.
</p>
<p>
Cellulases
have
been
applied
in
many
different
industries
,
such
as
food
,
textiles
,
pulp
,
paper
and
wastewater
treatment
of
residue
effluents
.
However
,
one
of
the
most
significant
current
applications
is
in
bioethanol
production
from
lignocellulosic
materials
.
Bioethanol
is
considered
a
fuel
alternative
for
reducing
the
dependence
on
crude
oil
.
The
majority
of
bioethanol
produced
globally
is
made
from
biomass
containing
starch
(
from
corn
)
or
sucrose
(
from
molasses
or
cane
juice
)
.
However
,
bioethanol
can
also
be
made
from
non-edible
lignocellulosic
biomass
like
wood
or
agricultural
residues
.
</p>
<p>
Generally
,
the
production
of
bioethanol
from
lignocellulosic
biomass
requires
several
steps
:
pretreatment
,
enzymatic
hydrolysis
to
monomers
(
also
called
saccharification
)
,
fermentation
,
distillation
,
and
dehydration
.
The
pretreatment
phase
can
be
performed
using
several
different
processes
,
such
as
concentrated
acid
hydrolysis
,
dilute
acid
hydrolysis
,
alkali
treatment
,
sodium
sulfite
treatment
,
and
steam
explosion
,
among
others
.
The
objective
of
the
pretreatment
is
to
remove
lignin
and
improve
the
access
of
the
enzymes
to
the
cell
wall
carbohydrates
(
mainly
cellulose
)
to
obtain
fermentable
sugars
.
The
next
step
is
saccharification
,
in
which
cellulases
,
typically
from
<hi rend="italic">
Trichoderma
</hi>
spp.
,
are
applied
to
produce
fermentable
monomer
sugars
from
polysaccharides
,
primarily
cellulose
.
After
saccharification
,
sugar
monomers
can
be
fermented
to
ethanol
,
typically
with
<hi rend="italic">
Saccharomyces
</hi>
spp.
,
resulting
in
concentrations
of
40
–
50
g/L
.
</p>
<p>
Almost
all
commercially
available
lignocellulolytic
enzymes
needed
for
the
hydrolysis
step
are
produced
by
fermentation
with
the
ascomycete
<hi rend="italic">
Trichoderma
reesei
</hi>
.
However
,
the
purchase
of
this
enzymes
can
make
up
20
–
40
%
of
the
operating
costs
in
a
lignocellulosic
biomass-based
biorefinery
.
Accordingly
,
enzyme
cost
is
a
major
determinant
of
the
viability
of
commercial-scale
production
of
bioethanol
.
Onsite
production
of
enzymes
using
low-value
substrates
could
be
an
option
to
make
a
bioethanol
facility
more
economical
.
In
addition
,
using
FMWs
materials
as
a
substrate
for
fungal
cellulases
production
would
make
the
biorefinery
more
environmentally
sustainable
.
</p>
<p>
In
order
to
improve
enzyme
performance
,
extensive
research
has
been
carried
out
on
the
cellulolytic
system
of
<hi rend="italic">
T.
reesei
</hi>
to
elucidate
the
enzymes
and
gene
regulation
involved
in
the
utilization
of
lignocellulosic
materials
.
Despite
this
,
enzyme
production
from
<hi rend="italic">
T.
reesei
</hi>
still
faces
two
major
bottlenecks
.
The
first
one
is
because
some
of
the
produced
enzymes
have
low
catalytic
activity
under
industrial
conditions
,
due
to
the
presence
of
high
concentrations
of
inhibitory
compounds
generated
from
the
degradation
of
carbohydrates
and
lignin
during
the
pretreatment
of
lignocellulosic
biomass
.
The
second
one
is
because
certain
key
enzymes
are
present
in
limited
amounts
.
Most
research
to
date
has
focused
on
overcoming
these
bottlenecks
by
improving
the
performance
of
<hi rend="italic">
T.
reesei
</hi>
secretion
systems
and
investigating
other
<hi rend="italic">
Trichoderma
</hi>
spp.
with
higher
secretion
potential
.
Few
studies
have
centered
on
evaluating
enzyme
production
using
less
expensive
lignocellulosic
raw
materials
.
Consequently
,
the
main
objective
of
this
research
was
to
study
the
use
of
FMWs
for
cellulases
production
using
an
isolated
fungal
strain
from
olive
stones
.
Production
of
cellulases
from
low-cost
residues
such
as
FMWS
,
could
support
future
on-site
production
of
cellulase
enzymes
from
locally
available
waste
materials
for
bioethanol
production
.
