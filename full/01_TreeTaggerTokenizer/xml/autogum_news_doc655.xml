On
Saturday
,
by
estimates
,
over
500,000
women
and
other
protesters
—
twice
the
figure
expected
by
organizers
—
marched
through
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Washington_D.C.">
Washington

</ref>
to
protest
the
inauguration
of
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">
Donald
Trump
</ref>
as
president
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_States">

</ref>
.
They
were
accompanied
by
hundreds
of
thousands
of
others
in
hundreds
of
sister
marches
in
cities
across
the
United
States
and
on
all
seven
continents
,
including

Though
different
publications
are
providing
different
figures
,
<hi rend="italic">
The
Independent
</hi>
reports
that
between
3.3
and
4.6
million
people
walked
and
carried
signs
,
750,000
in
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Los_Angeles">

575,000

in
Chicago
and
many
smaller
figures
in
other
cities
,
making
this
the
largest
protest
in
American
history
.
In
contrast
to
the
protests
on
the
day
of
the
inauguration
,
not
one
marcher
was
reported
arrested
in
Washington

.
</p>
<p>
At
the
march
,
women
,
men
and
children
chanted
slogans
like
&quot;
This
is
what
democracy
looks
like
!
&quot;
and
&quot;
Women
's
rights
are
human
rights
!
&quot;
and
carried

that

had
said
during

as

and
singer
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alicia%20Keys">

gave
speeches
,
only
a
fraction
of
the
demonstrators
were
close
enough
to
hear
them
.
</p>
<p>
The
idea
for
a
women
's
protest
to
the
election
of
Donald
Trump
is
credited
to
two
people
,
retired
attorney
Teresa
Shook
of
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Hawaii">

</ref>
and
fashion
designer
Bob
Bland
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn">
Brooklyn
</ref>
.
Both
women
posted
their
ideas
online
,
gaining
many
followers
before
the
movement
finally
merged
.
</p>
<p>
The
march
's
mission
statement
reads
,
in
part
,
&quot;
The
Women
's
March
on
Washington
will
send
a
bold
message
to
our
new
government
on
their
first
day
in
office
,
and
to
the
world
that
women
's
rights
are
human
rights
.
We
stand
together
,
recognizing
that
defending
the
most
marginalized
among
us
is
defending
all
of
us
.

For
me
,
the
agenda
is
clear
.
It
is
solidarity
.
It
is
saying
to
the
new
administration
that
misogyny
cannot
rule
.
Whether
reproductive
rights
,
equal
pay
for
equal
work
,
an
end
to
sexual
violence
,
women
in
combat
or
the
importance

we
are
here

we

;
we
will

The
march
did
focus
on
traditional
women
's
issues
such
as
reproductive
rights
but
also
addressed
issues
such

American
women
are
16
times
more
likely
to
be
killed
with
a
gun
than
in
other
high-income
countries
.
In
an
average
month
,
50
women
are
shot
to
death
by
a
current
or
former
partner
in
the
United
States
.
Approximately
4.5
million
American
women
have
been
threatened
with
guns
,
and
guns
are
the
weapon
of
choice
in
domestic
murders

A
healthy

is

&quot;
I
think
it
's
important
that
a
pro-life

voice
is
there

I
am
not

&quot;
I
am
going
to
join
in
solidarity[

]
and
to
be
honest
,
abortion
is
not
the
only
issue
I
'm
concerned
about
.
I
'm
concerned
about
the

I

concerned

things

The
following
day
,

responded

via

,
&quot;
Why
did
n't
these
people
vote
?
&quot;
and
&quot;
Peaceful
protests
are
a
hallmark
of
our
democracy
.
Even
if
I
do
n't
always
agree
,
I
recognize
the
rights
of
people
to
express
their
views
