In
and
Keep
Customers
</head>
<p>
The
first
step
to
any
successful
business
is
promotion
and
marketing
,
and
the
second
follow-up
step
is
retention
.
To
learn
how
to
bring
in
and
keep
customers
can
be
challenging
if
you
have
never
been
exposed
to
marketing
or
public
relations
.
By
following
a
few
easy
steps
,
however
,
you
should
be
able
to
not
only
boost
business
but
keep
it
steady
and/or
growing
as
well
.

Devote

Start
with
quality
customer
service
.
Be
polite
and
respectful
to
everyone
who
comes
in
your
door

and
treat
that
person
as
you
would
want
to
be
treated
.
</item>
<item>
Train
your
staff
not
only
how
to
be
polite
but
how
to
successfully
do
their
jobs
as
well

Being
nice
does
n't
sell
your
product
,
nor
does
it
help
your
staff
avoid
mistakes
.
Instead
,
that
comes
with
good
training
and
practice
