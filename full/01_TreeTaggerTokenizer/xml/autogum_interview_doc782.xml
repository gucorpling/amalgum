What
are
your
views
on
the
mixed
member
proportional
representation
(
MMP
)
referendum
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
Ontario
must
change
the
way
we
vote
.
FPTP
works
when
there
are
two
parties
.
We
have
n't
had
that
for
a
long
time
.
What
we
get
now
is
artificial
majorities
,
where
as
little
as
38
%
of
the
vote
gets
a
majority
of
the
seats
.
MMP
is
not
perfect
.
But
it
takes
the
best
aspects
of
FPTP
and
PR
,
and
combines
them
into
a
workable
system
that
will
better
serve
voters
.
Especially
voters
who
are
n't
happy
with
traditional
politicking
in
Ontario
.

What
role
,
if
any
,
does
&quot;
new
media
&quot;
play
in
your
campaign
,
and
the
campaign
of
your
party
?
(
websites
,
blogs
,
Facebook
,
YouTube
videos
,
etc
)
Do
you
view
it
as
beneficial
,
or
a
challenge
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
I
had
wanted
to
do
more
,
but
there
is
so
much
tradtional
politics
that
new
media
got
sidelined
a
little
.
I
did
get
a
couple
of
videos
filmed
,
and
they
are
posted
.
The
GPO
is
aggressively
pursuing
new
media
exposure
,
because
we
are
being
largely
ignored
by
big
media
.
Local
media
is
doing
a
much
better
job
,
but
big
papers
and
TV
have
left
us
out
of
the
discussion
.
It
is
largely
beneficial
,
since
our
focus
as
a
party
is
on
a
sustainable
future
,
and
that
appeals
to
younger
demographics
who
are
more
likely
to
pay
attention
to
new
media
.
It
is
,
however
,
a
challenge
.
The
Internet
is
a
really
big
place
,
and
you
have
to
be
loud
,
funny
or
interesting
to
be
noticed
.
&quot;
Hipness
&quot;
becomes
an
issue
the
way
charisma
did
when
TV
got
involved
,
and
the
well
orchestrated
soundbite
can
now
when
an
election
.
I
wish
it
was
different
,
that
ideas
would
carry
the
most
weight
,
but
ideas
can
be
spread
by
YouTube
and
Facebook
pretty
well
.

<hi rend="bold">
Of
the
decisions
made
by
Ontario
's
38th
Legislative
Assembly
,
which
was
the
most
beneficial
to
your
this
electoral
district
?
To
the
province
as
a
whole
?
Which
was
least
beneficial
,
or
even
harmful
,
to
your
this
riding
?
To
the
province
as
a
whole
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
The
best
decision
was
to
replace
lost
funding
for
health
care
and
education
.
We
've
taken
steps
that
will
help
repair
these
vital
social
services
.
More
must
be
done
,
but
immediate
funding
was
desperately
needed
.
This
helped
my
riding
and
every
other
riding
in
Ontario
.
The
worst
decision
was
to
not
close
the
coal
fired
generating
plants
.
They
are
responsible
for
about
a
quarter
of
Ontario
's
GHG
emissions
,
and
climate
change
is
going
to
cost
us
a
hell
of
a
lot
,
and
not
just
in
economic
terms
.
This
costs
all
Ontarians
,
even
those
not
born
yet
.
If
we
had
focussed
on
conservation
,
rather
than
nuclear
,
would
have
been
able
to
get
those
plants
shut
down
,
and
been
well
on
our
way
to
meeting
our
Kyoto
targets
.
