Introduction

<p>
The
seismic
resistance
of
civil
engineering
structures
,
especially
buildings
,
is
an
important
aspect
related
to
structural
safety
in
the
event
of
an
earthquake
.
Damages
to
building
structures
are
the
most
common
cause
of
fatalities
due
to
seismic
excitation
.
This
applies
to
structures
erected
with
different
technologies
.
</p>
<p>
Buildings
of
major
importance
,
such
as
hospitals
,
facilities
of
fire
brigades
or
crisis
management
centres
are
designed
in
accordance
with
the
applicable
standards
.
Methods
of
strengthening
these
structures
,
mainly
constructed
of
reinforced
concrete
or
steel
frame
(
for
example
using
the
fiber-reinforced
cementitious
composite
)
,
are
subjected
to
many
tests
,
including
experimental
and
numerical
ones
.
There
are
many
methods
of
retrofitting
masonry
structures
,
including
methods
for
strengthening
cracked
walls
using
high-strength
composite
materials
and
a
rigid
adhesive
with
low
deformability
.
The
concept
of
increasing
the
effectiveness
of
secondary
structural
elements
in
the
overall
seismic
behaviour
of
buildings
has
also
been
investigated
;
for
example
,
the
application
of
special
mechanical
connectors
interposed
at
the
interface
between
a
multi-storey
building
and
the
glazing
facade
.
The
results
of
the
study
indicate
that
,
once
the
input
parameters
of
the
connecting
devices
are
properly
designed
,
the
glazing
facade
may
work
as
an
effective
passive
control
system
for
the
primary
structure
.
</p>
<p>
An
increasing
number
of
newly
constructed
wooden
frame
buildings
has
also
been
recently
observed
.
The
technology
is
popular
both
in
rich
and
poor
countries
.
Properly
designed
wooden
structures
are
inherently
well
resistant
to
dynamic
loads
,
such
as
extreme
earthquakes
.
The
current
research
concerning
wooden
buildings
is
focused
,
among
others
,
on
forecasting
the
occurrence
of
damage
and
monitoring
the
critical
structural
elements
during
seismic
shocks
.
The
research
work
includes
both
experimental
investigations
,
including
the
shaking
table
tests
(
see
)
,
as
well
as
numerical
analyses
.
A
number
of
studies
have
been
focused
on
structural
connectors
,
anchor
connections
and
special
flat
bars
and
angles
,
the
use
of
which
results
in
stiffening
of
the
whole
structure
and
increasing
its
seismic
resistance
.
The
role
of
connections
,
with
the
lateral
deformation
of
the
light
walls
and
with
q-factor
,
has
also
been
investigated
(
for
example
,
see
)
.
</p>
<p>
In
addition
,
the
low
construction
cost
is
one
of
the
most
popular
and
well-known
advantages
of
wooden
buildings
.
This
is
due
to
the
relatively
good
availability
of
building
material
in
many
parts
of
the
world
and
ease
of
assembly
related
to
technical
aspects
(
heavy
equipment
is
not
required
)
,
as
well
as
assembly
time
and
good
usability
parameters
(
aesthetics
,
easy
repairs
and
modifications
,
good
climate
,
etc.
)
.
However
,
one
of
the
most
important
technological
elements
in
a
wooden
frame
is
the
application
and
proper
arrangement
of
thermal
insulation
.
Thermal
insulation
affects
the
lifespan
and
durability
of
the
building
,
and
defines
the
energy
class
.
Unlike
other
elements
of
a
wooden
frame
building
,
the
results
of
research
focused
on
thermal
insulation
are
relatively
limited
.
One
of
a
few
examples
concerns
a
study
on
the
seismic
efficiency
of
structural
insulated
panels
.
The
behaviour
of
wood-composite
laminated
frames
under
the
dynamic
loads
has
also
been
investigated
.
</p>
<p>
There
are
some
numerical
analyses
available
,
which
indicate
that
thermal
insulation
of
the
wooden
frame
building
can
substantially
affect
the
dynamic
resistance
of
the
whole
structure
(
for
example
,
see
)
.
The
results
of
these
analyses
show
that
using
polyurethane
foam
instead
of
mineral
wool
for
the
in-wall
insulation
of
a
wood-frame
building
leads
to
an
increase
in
the
rigidity
of
the
whole
structure
.
This
effect
is
obtained
mainly
due
to
full
connection
between
the
polyurethane
foam
and
the
surrounding
wooden
elements
,
and
a
lack
of
such
connection
in
the
case
of
mineral
wool
.
It
has
been
found
that
the
increase
in
the
rigidity
of
the
building
insulated
with
the
polyurethane
foam
leads
to
the
substantial
reduction
in
the
structural
response
under
different
seismic
excitations
.
It
should
be
added
that
,
in
construction
,
polyurethane
foam
is
known
only
as
an
insulation
material
.
It
turns
out
that
this
insulation
material
can
also
effectively
stiffen
the
whole
structure
and
improve
its
dynamic
resistance
substantially
.
However
,
the
results
of
the
numerical
analyses
described
in
have
to
be
verified
experimentally
.
</p>
<p>
Therefore
,
the
aim
of
the
present
study
is
to
show
the
results
of
experimental
tests
focused
on
the
dynamic
response
of
wall
panels
of
a
wooden
frame
building
with
thermal
isolation
made
of
traditional
mineral
wool
and
polyurethane
foam
.
Firstly
,
the
static
and
the
dynamic
mechanical
analysis
(
DMA
)
tests
were
conducted
so
as
to
determine
the
basic
thermomechanical
properties
of
the
analyzed
isolation
materials
.
Then
,
the
elements
of
exterior
walls
with
two
types
of
thermal
insulation
were
tested
under
harmonic
excitation
for
different
amplitudes
of
displacement
.
