It
seems
like
it
is
a
difficult
thing
to
argue
that
we
have
nuclear
arms
,
but
other
sovereign
nations
ca
n’t
have
them
.

DH

</hi>
Yeah
,
I
think
that
would
have
to
fall
under
the
category
of
the
real
world
.
You
do
n’t
want
to
have
countries
which
have
what
I
would
call
non-stable
leadership
,
or
anti-American
leadership
,
developing
the
means
to
kill
large
numbers
of
Americans
.
That
may
not
seem
fair
,
that
’s
not
Marquis
of
Queensbury
rules
,
but
it
’s
in
the
interest
of
the
United
States
.

Does
it
not
worry
you
that
governments
can
change
quickly
?
You
had
Shah
Pahlavi
,
who
was
very
pro-Western
for
a
long
time
,
overthrown
in
Iran
.
President
Musharraf
in
Pakistan
,
which
now
has
nuclear
weapons
,
is
also
unstable
with
his
hold
on
power
and
has
nuclear
capabilities
.
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DH
:
</hi>
Yes
,
but
I
think
in
both
those
cases
you
will
see
that
we
did
not
give
nuclear
weapons
capability
to
either
one
of
them
,
and
would
very
much
prefer
they
did
n’t
have
it
.
So
I
agree
with
you
,
but
I
want
to
remind
you
that
we
have
n’t
given
and
we
have
been
very
much
against
nuclear
proliferation
to
those
states
.

You
are
a
critic
of
the
United
Nations
and
it
would
seem
like
out
of
any
foreign
body
that
is
positioned
to
assume
global
leadership
on
this
issue
,
it
would
be
the
UN
.
Do
you
think
it
is
wise
to
take
an
antagonistic
view
of
that
body
when
it
seems
necessary
to
have
the
global
cooperation
it
embodies
?

</hi>
Well
,
I
’m
not
antagonistic
toward
the
United
Nations
as
much
as
I
am
realistic
about
the
United
Nations
.
I
think
the
United
Nations
is
good
,
as
I
have
said
,
for
inoculating
babies
and
for
operating
refugee
camps
and
refugee
centers
,
but
they
should
not
be
relied
upon
by
the
United
States
for
our
security
,
and
I
think
that
has
been
proven
time
and
time
again
.
So
the
United
States
needs
to
have
independently
the
means
for
maintaining
its
security
.

One

I

If
you

the
