Loving
a
baseball
team
is
having
to
put
up
with
the
imperfections
,
the
routine
of
what
kind
of
mood
is
it
going
to
be
today
.
It
does
n't
come
down
to
whether
we
are
going
to
win
or
lose
,
it
comes
down
to
:
is
the
player
going
to
perform
this
way
?
Or
,
is
the
pitcher
going
to
be
ambivalent
?
Am
I
even
going
to
have
enough
strength
to
watch
this
game
?
Am
I
going
to
wash
my
hands
?
Am
I
going
to
lay
in
bed
all
day
?
What
am
I
going
to
do
?
The
game
becomes
a
reflection
of
true
life
in
that
way
.

The
difference
is
that
you
know
what
to
expect
from
the
players
on
the
Mets
.
They
have
defined
roles
and
there
is
some
certitude
.
With
women
,
as
the
players
change
you
do
n't
know
what
they
are
going
to
do
;
whereas
in
baseball
the
players
have
roles
and
you
know
what
to
expect
of
them
.

It
's
a
dangerous
proposition
being
any
fan
,
but
particularly
a
Mets
fan
,
because
you
are
going
to
have
to
accept
you
will
fall
in
love
with
imperfection
.
When
you
fall
in
love
with
a
woman
,
you
are
accepting
them
for
all
their
flaws
,
those
elements
that
make
them
human
,
worts
and
all
.
And
I
accept
my
team
worts
and
all
.
They
have
given
me
a
great
deal
of
joy
,
a
great
deal
of
entertainment
,
exhilaration
,
and
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
pain
like
in
any
fan
.
This
is
n't
the
Brady
Bunch
,
this
is
n't
Leave
it
to
Beaver
.
Few
things
are
,
if
anything
.

You
were
the
recipient
of
the
1993
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen%20Ginsberg">
Allen
Ginsberg
</ref>
Poetry
Award
.
In
1996
I
met
Ginsberg
at
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naropa%20Institute">
Naropa
Institute
</ref>
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulder,%20Colorado">
Boulder
</ref>
.
I
asked
him
about
NAMBLA
,
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North%20American%20Man/Boy%20Love%20Association">
North
American
Man/Boy
Love
Association
</ref>
.
He
told
me
to
follow
him
into
the
bathroom
.
As
I
stood
there
he
peed
and
told
me
he
was
n't
for
having
sex
with
children
,
but
that
he
thought
that
age-of-consent
laws
were
outdated
,
that
he
knew
what
he
wanted
when
he
was
fifteen
and
that
he
thought
everyone
does
at
that
age
.
He
said
he
was
n't
for
sex
with
children
,
but
that
it
should
not
be
illegal
to
have
sex
at
that
age
.
When
you
accepted
the
Ginsberg
award
,
did
you
have
an
issue
with
some
of
his
political
stances
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
FM

</hi>
I
was
too
young
at
the
time
to
realize
what
he
thought
.
I
never
knew
what
went
on
behind
closed
doors
with
Allen
,
and
aside
from
meeting
him
a
few
times
,
I
never
knew
him
on
a
personal
level
.
I
accepted
the
nomination
,
like
young
people
do
each
year
,
because
of
his
poetry
,
not
because
of
his
politics
.
I
was
proud
.
That
is
what
the
award
was
designed
for
.
There
are
laws
in
this
country
for
a
reason
,
to
protect
children
and
to
protect
people
from
predators
.
Whether
Allen
was
a
predator
or
not
,
I
do
n't
have
any
idea
.
