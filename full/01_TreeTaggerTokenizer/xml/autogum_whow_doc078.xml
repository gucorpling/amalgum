Mirror
</head>
<p>
While
driving
a
car
,
it
is
important
to
keep
an
eye
on
all
the
traffic
around
you
.
This
will
help
you
to
know
what
drivers
around
you
are
doing
.
It
will
also
help
you
keep
track
of
when
it
is
safe
for
you
to
make
lane
changes
or
turns
.
In
order
to
keep
a
good
eye
on
the
road
around
you
,
you
will
need
to
adjust
the
rearview
mirror
inside
the
car
before
starting
to
drive
and
then
look
at
the
mirror
at
specific
times
while
driving
.

,
you
want
to
make
sure
that
your

is
in
the

Move
the
seat
forward
or

It

Make

With
your

buckled

you
will
be
in

If
you
adjust
your

Move
the
rearview
mirror
.
You
want
to
assure
that
you
can
see
the
traffic
behind
you
clearly
.
You
should
be
able
to
see
the
road
behind
you
,
with
the
horizon
line
and
a
bit
of
the
space
above
the
horizon
line
visible
as
well
.
To
be
able
to
do
this
,
make
sure
that
you
can
see
your
whole
rear
window
in
your
rearview
mirror
.
<figure rend="Use the Rear View Mirror Step 3 Version 2.jpg">

<list type="unordered">
<item>
To
adjust
the
mirror
simply
move
the
body
of
the
mirror
to
a
different
angle
.
The
mirror
should
move
easily
,
although
not
so
easily
that
it
falls
out
of
place
once
you
position
it
.
</item>
<item>
Do
n't
adjust
the
mirror
so
that
you
can
see
out
one
side
of
the
rear
window
more
than
another
.
This
will
only
limit
your
overall
vision
of
the
road
.
If
you
are
concerned
about
seeing
one
side
of
the
car
,
you
should
use
your
side
view
mirrors
for
that
.

Make
small
adjustments
while
stopped
.
If
you
feel
that
your
mirror
needs
additional
adjustment
after
you
start
driving
,
make
this
adjustment
while
stopped
.
It
can
be
a
hazard
to
adjust
the
mirror
while
in
motion
,
as
you
should
be
focused
on
your
driving
and
the
traffic
around
you
.

While
driving
,
the
vibration
of
the
vehicle
can
cause
the
position
of
the
rearview
mirror
to
change
.
Pay
attention
to
its
position
as
you
drive
and
adjust
it
as
needed
when
stopped
.

Adjust
your
mirror
every
time
you
drive
.
To
be
safe
,
take
the
time
to
adjust
the
rearview
mirror
before
every
drive
.
It
is
not
enough
to
rely
on
your
positioning
from
the
last
time
you
drove
.
You
may
have
been
sitting
in
a
slightly
different
position
or
someone
else
could
have
adjusted
the
mirror
without
you
knowing
.

Check
your
rearview
mirror
on
a
regular
basis
.
Even
if
you
are
just
driving
straight
ahead
on
an
open
highway
,
it
's
important
to
know
what
is
going
on
behind
you
.
This
means
you
should
be
looking
at
your
rearview
mirror
every
5-8
seconds
.

This
will

Look
in
your
rearview
mirror
before
adjusting
your
position
on
the
road
.
You
should
look
in
the
mirror
before
you
stop
or
start
,
pass
a
car
,
turn
,
switch
lanes
,
pull
over
,
or
make
any
other
adjustment
to
your
position
on
the
road

Basically
,
if
you
want
to
make
any
movements
,
other
than
straight
ahead
,
you
should
check
your
rearview

When
changing
lanes
,
you
use
a
combination
of
your
rearview
mirror
and
your
side
mirror
to
see
if
where
you
are
moving
is
clear
,
as
well
as
turning
around
to
see
if
there
is
anyone
in
your
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Set_Rear-View_Mirrors_to_Eliminate_Blind_Spots">
blind
spot

combination
of

Use
your
rearview
mirror
when
backing
up
.
The
rear-view
mirror
is
especially
important
when
you
are
moving
your
vehicle
in
reverse
.
The
mirror
will
help
you
to
know
the
course
is
clear
and
that
you
can
move
without
coming
into
contact
with
another
car
,
person
,
or
property
.

When
moving
in
reverse
,
it
is
also
important
to
rely
on
things
other
than
the
rear-view
mirror
.
Check
your
side
mirrors
and
turn
around
and
look
behind
the
car
with
your
own
eyes
in
order
to
assess
the
situation
.
After
all
,
it
is
always
better
to
be
safe
than
sorry

Look
at
your
rearview
mirror
when
navigating
heavy
or
irregular
traffic
.
The
rearview
mirror
can
give
you
a
lot
of
good
information
when
trying
to
get
through
a
stressful
and
busy
driving
situation
.
For
example
,
look
in
your
mirror
to
assess
whether
moving
in
reverse
will
help
you
get
out
of
a
tight
space
or
just
lock
you
into
an
even
more
tenuous
position
.

Look
before
you
make
a
quick
stop
if
you
can
.
Before
you
brake
hard
,
take
a
quick
second
to
assess
whether
any
cars
are
too
close
to
your
rear
end
to
stop
.
If
that
is
the
case
,
consider
adjusting
your
lane
or
your
braking
speed
if
you
can
.
If
you
ca
n't
,
then
knowing
a
car
behind
you
may
hit
you
will
give
you
a
second
to
brace
for
an
impact
.

If
you
are
looking
in
your
rearview
mirror
at
regular
intervals
already
,
you
may
already
have
a
good
idea
if
a
vehicle
is
close
behind
you
.
This
will
help
you
to
make
a
quick
judgement
about
the
following
distance
and
if
a
vehicle
will
have
time
to
stop
before
hitting
you
.

Being
good
at
judging
the
following
distance
of
vehicles
behind
you
should
help
you
adjust
your
braking
measures
in
order
to
prevent
a
rear-end
collision
from
happening

If
you
are
driving
at
night
,
you
might
want
to
use
the
anti-glare
function
of
your
rearview
mirror
.
This
will
help
to
reduce
the
light
from
headlights
behind
you
that
are
reflected
into
your
eyes
.
Use
the
tilt
function
of
the
mirror
to
switch
to
this
anti-glare
function
.
