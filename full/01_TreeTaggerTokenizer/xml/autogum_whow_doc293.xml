Tell
if
Something
Is
Gum
</head>
<p>
Often
,
people
everywhere
find
themselves
faced
with
a
deceptively
simple
question
:
is
this
gum
?
It
is
a
question
that
can
arise
anywhere
,
whether
it
be
on
the
bottom
of
your
shoe
,
the
handle
of
your
locker
at
school
,
or
even
in
your
hair
while
you
lie
in
bed
at
night
.
These
steps
will
provide
you
with
all
you
need
to
know
about
how
to
tell
if
something
is
gum
.

Do
n't
make
assumptions
.
Arrogance
has
been
the
downfall
of
many
otherwise
intelligent
people
--
do
n't
get
yourself
into
trouble
by
assuming
something
is
or
is
n't
gum
.
But
use
your
common
sense
.
Only
if
something
has
the
general
appearance
of
gum
do
these
instructions
become
necessary
.
Before
taking
any
risky
action
yourself
,
ask
a
friend
or
relative
to
help
determine
whether
what
you
're
dealing
with
is
gum
.
If
no
one
is
available
,
try
getting
a
pet
to
eat
the
substance
and
see
how
your
pet
reacts
.
If
you
've
tried
these
and
you
still
ca
n't
tell
,
proceed
to
Step
Two
.

Smell
it
.
Usually
,
the
aroma
of
a
substance
can
tell
you
whether
or
not
something
is
gum
.
If
it
smells
minty
,
sweet
,
or
,
even
sometimes
fruity
,
it
is
quite
possible
that
it
is
gum
.
However
,
this
is
not
a
definitive
test
.
While
most
things
that
are
not
gum
do
not
smell
like
gum
,
it
is
quite
possible
that
the
smell
has
simply
faded
.
In
fact
,
if
gum
is
particularly
old
,
it
could
have
no
smell
at
all
.
Do
not
be
ashamed
if
your
nose
is
insufficient
for
performing
this
test
;
John
Quincy
Adams
had
no
sense
of
smell
at
all
.
He
was
rarely
photographed
from
the
waist
down
for
this
very
reason
.
With
such
a
great
leader
for
an
example
,
there
is
no
reason
your
inability
to
smell
should
make
you
feel
inadequate
.
This
is
when
Step
Three
comes
into
play
.

Feel
it
.
If
the
substance
is
soft
and
malleable
,
yet
slightly
sticky
,
the
chances
of
it
being
gum
will
greatly
increase
.
But
be
careful
!
Remember
our
mantra
from
Step
One
:
guessing
makes
an
ass
out
of
you
and
me
.
Sometimes
,
Silly
Putty
will
have
these
same
properties
,
yet
it
is
still
not
gum
.
If
you
are
still
unsure
,
proceed
to
the
last
step
.
It
is
said
that
Harrison
Ford
used
this
test
on
the
set
of
his
classic
movie
&quot;
Air
Force
One
&quot;
in
a
particularly
trying
conundrum
of
whether
or
not
something
was
gum
.

Taste
it
.
Truly
,
this
is
the
final
test
of
whether
or
not
something
is
gum
.
There
is
no
denying
the
unmistakable
flavor
of
this
precious
sap
bestowed
upon
us
by
the
red-skinned
savages
of
early
America
(
the
scientific
name
of
the
tree
being
Manilkara
zapota
)
.
This
satisfying
and
occasionally
delicious
trial
will
put
to
rest
all
apprehensions
,
rumors
,
and
myths
surrounding
whether
or
not
something
is
gum
.
