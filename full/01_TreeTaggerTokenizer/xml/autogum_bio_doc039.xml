Paulides
attributes

After

the
topic

as
well
as
on
the

Paulides
has
said
North
America
Bigfoot
Search
was
instrumental
in
the
genesis
of
a
paper
published
in
2013
,
which
claimed
that
Bigfoot
was
real
:
&quot;
The
world
needs
to
understand
that
North
America
Bigfoot
Search
was
the
organizer
of
the
study
.
We
orchestrated
the
search
that
led
to
picking
Dr.
Ketchum
to
conduct
a
study
of
bigfoot
DNA
.
&quot;
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-9">
[

The
resulting
paper
documented
the
analysis
of
111
samples
of
hypothesized
Bigfoot
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA">

and
was
written

On

,
DNA

a
veterinary
laboratory
headed
by
Ketchum
,
issued
a
press
release
prior
to

that

confirmed
the
existence
of

Following
his
work
on
Bigfoot
,
Paulides
'
next
project
was
<hi rend="italic">
Missing

,
a
series
of
self-published
books
and
a
documentary
,
documenting
unsolved
cases
of
people
who
have
gone
missing
in
national
parks
and
elsewhere
.
</p>
<p>
According
to
Paulides
,
his
work
on
this
subject
began
when
he
was
doing
research
in
a
national
park
and
an
off-duty
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_ranger">
park
ranger
</ref>
found
him
and
expressed
concern
about
the
questionable
nature
of
some
of
the
missing
person
cases
which
occurred
in
the
parks
.
The
ranger
knew
Paulides
'
background
and
requested
for
him
to
research
the
issue
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-14">
[

</ref>
Paulides
obliged
,
and
asserts
that
he
uncovered
multiple
lines
of
evidence
suggesting
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
park
service
in
failing
to
locate
the
missing
people
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-15">

He
broadened
his
investigation
to
include
missing
people
from
across
the
world
,
and
this
led
to
his
belief
that
he
has
uncovered
a
mysterious
series
of
worldwide
disappearances
,
which
defied
logical
and
conventional
explanations
.

As
of
2018
,
Paulides
has
written
eight
books
on
this
topic
.
According
to
<hi rend="italic">
A
Sobering
Coincidence
</hi>
,
he
does
not
yet
have
a
theory
on
what
is
causing
the
disappearances
,
although
he
indicates
that
the
&quot;
field
of
suspects
is
narrowing
.

Paulides
advised
his
readers
to
go

determine
who

He
concluded
that
the
allegedly
unusual
disappearances
represent
nothing
unusual
at
all
,
and
are
instead
best
explained
by
non-mysterious
causes
such
as
falling
or
sudden
health
crises
leading
to
a
lone
person
becoming
immobilized
off-trail
,
drowning
,
bear
(
or
other
animal
)
attack
,
environmental
exposure
,
or
even
deliberate
disappearance
.
After
analyzing
the
missing
person
data
,
Polich
concluded
that
these
cases
are
not
&quot;
outside
the
frequency
that
one
would
expect
,
or
that
there
is
anything
unexplainable
that
I
was
able
to
identify
.

in

not
