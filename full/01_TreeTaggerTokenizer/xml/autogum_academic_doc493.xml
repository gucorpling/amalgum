Here
,
we
describe
a
link
between
fructose
and
NO
levels
in
the
NTS
,
as
well
as
its
association
with
baroreflex
sensitivity
and
activation
of
the
CNS
.
Our
findings
showed
that
excessive
fructose
consumption
increased
BP
and
renal
SNA
,
decreased
NO
bioavailability
,
and
impaired
baroreflex
response
.
Excessive
fructose
intake
increased
serum
triglycerides
levels
and
induced
BP
elevation
by
stimulating
SNA
;
however
,
alleviation
of
hypertriglyceridemia
did
not
attenuate
sympathetic
activation
and
only
slightly
lowered
BP
.
It
was
suggested
that
,
mechanistically
,
SNA
played
a
role
in
modulating
changes
in
BP
due
to
increased
fructose
consumption
through
another
unknown
pathway
.
</p>
<p>
Epidemiological
studies
have
hinted
at
a
link
between
fructose
consumption
and
elevated
blood
pressure
.
Jalal
et
al.
reported
that
excess
dietary
fructose
(
≥74
g/day
)
in
the
form
of
added
sugar
was
associated
with
higher
BP
values
in
adults
in
the
United
States
who
did
not
have
a
history
of
hypertension
.
Similarly
,
a
study
of
4867
adolescents
found
that
SBP
rose
by
2
mmHg
following
the
intake
of
sugar-sweetened
beverages
from
the
lowest
to
the
highest
category
.
In
a
prospective
study
involving
adults
in
the
United
States
,
Chen
et
al.
found
that
intake
of
one
less
sugar-sweetened
beverage
per
day
was
associated
with
a
1.8
mmHg
reduction
in
SBP
and
a
1.1
mmHg
reduction
in
DBP
over
18
months
.
Some
animal
studies
showed
that
a
high-fructose
diet
was
associated
with
hypertriglyceridemia
,
hyperinsulinemia
,
impaired
glucose
tolerance
,
insulin
resistance
,
and
increased
BP
and
body
weight
.
However
,
these
adverse
effects
were
not
indicated
with
equivalent
calories
of
glucose
.
In
this
study
,
increased
fructose
intake
for
0
to
2
days
evoked
increases
in
BP
levels
,
and
the
high
BP
levels
were
maintained
until
day
7
(

)
.
</p>

The
great
increase
in
fructose
consumption
in
the
last
decades
leads
to
the
rapid
accumulation
of
triglyceride
in
the
Occidental
population
.
Tran
et
al.
reported
that
serum
norepinephrine
and
triglyceride
levels
are
significantly
increased
in
fructose-fed
hypertensive
rats
,
as
reflected
by
high
SNA
.
According
to
Tran
et
al.
,
hypertension
can
develop
in
rats
owing
to
excessive
fructose
consumption
,
and
the
developed
hypertension
can
be
treated
using
a
sympatholytic
agent
called
prazosin
,
which
blocks
the
α1-adrenoreceptors
.
Hypertension
inhibition
by
prazosin
did
not
reduce
the
level
of
triglyceride
in
serum
.
Consistent
with
this
previous
result
,
our
data
showed
that
the
use
of
a
DGAT1
inhibitor
for
inhibiting
serum
triglyceride
level
led
to
a
slight
decrease
in
BP
but
did
not
affect
SNA
(

.

The
baroreflex
system
is
an
important
mechanism
in
the
regulation
of
heart
rate
,
sympathetic
tone
,
and
consequently
BP
.
Impairment
of
baroreflex
sensitivity
is
involved
in
the
sympathoexcitatory
and
sympathoinhibitory
effects
of
metabolic
syndromes
.
A
previous
study
showed
that
hypertriglyceridemia
may
be
the
main
contributory
factor
associated
with
impaired
baroreflex
sensitivity
during
a
metabolic
syndrome
.
Soncrant
et
al.
reported
that
elevated
BP
was
increased
by
sympathoexcitation
in
20
%
fructose-induced
,
salt-sensitive
,
hypertensive
rats
.
It
has
been
shown
that
the
ingestion
of
fructose
altered
the
secretion
of
hormones
that
regulate
energy
balance
associated
with
increased
SNA
.
However
,
in
the
current
study
,
although
a
DGAT1
inhibitor
was
administered
orally
to
block
triglycerides
production
,
sympathoexcitation
was
not
inhibited
in
fructose-fed
rats
.
Dos
Santos
et
al
indicated
that
fructose
consumption
similarly
reduced
both
baroreflex
sensitivity
and
activity
.
Our
research
further
indicated
that
fructose
intake
may
reduce
NO
levels
in
the
NTS
and
cause
baroreflex
dysfunction
,
which
further
stimulates
SNA
and
induces
the
development
of
high
BP
(

and

)
.

Generally
,
anesthetics
affect
the
basal
levels
of
sympathetic
nerve
activity
to
regulate
blood
pressure
,
which
plays
an
important
role
in
controlling
cardiovascular
function
.
Sun
et
al.
indicated
that
anesthesia
attenuated
the
excitatory
response
of
RSNA
and
HR
to
anaphylactic
hypotension
,
while
these
excitatory
responses
were
attenuated
by
anesthetics
in
the
order
ketamine-xylazine
&gt;
urethane
=
pentobarbital
.
Bencze
et
al.
found
that
pentobarbital
anesthesia
had
a
modest
influence
on
the
BP
level
and
its
maintenance
by
the
above
vasoactive
systems
.
In
addition
,
anesthetics
may
inhibit
the
primary
area
in
the
baroreceptor
reflex
pathway
of
the
central
nervous
system
,
resulting
in
attenuation
of
the
baroreceptor
reflex
.
Therefore
,
sympathetic
nerve
activity
and
cardiovascular
function
may
be
affected
by
the
anesthetic
.
However
,
there
were
some
limitations
to
our
study
.
First
,
we
measured
BP
during
consciousness
,
whereas
RSNA
and
baroreflex
sensitivity
measurements
were
performed
under
the
anesthetic
.
Second
,
our
sample
size
was
relatively
small
and
the
study
used
nonparametric
methods
for
analysis
.
Third
,
the
fructose
group
was
used
as
the
control
group
only
on
day
0
.
