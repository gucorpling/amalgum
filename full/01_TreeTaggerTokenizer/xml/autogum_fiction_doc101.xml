THE
FEAST
OF
BELSHAZZAR
:
A
SEER
TO
TRANSLATE
</head>
<p>
Such
feelings
as
were
generated
in
Carrie
by
this
walk
put
her
in
an
exceedingly
receptive
mood
for
the
pathos
which
followed
in
the
play
.
The
actor
whom
they
had
gone
to
see
had
achieved
his
popularity
by
presenting
a
mellow
type
of
comedy
,
in
which
sufficient
sorrow
was
introduced
to
lend
contrast
and
relief
to
humour
.
For
Carrie
,
as
we
well
know
,
the
stage
had
a
great
attraction
.
She
had
never
forgotten
her
one
histrionic
achievement
in
Chicago
.
It
dwelt
in
her
mind
and
occupied
her
consciousness
during
many
long
afternoons
in
which
her
rocking-chair
and
her
latest
novel
contributed
the
only
pleasures
of
her
state
.
Never
could
she
witness
a
play
without
having
her
own
ability
vividly
brought
to
consciousness
.
Some
scenes
made
her
long
to
be
a
part
of
them
—
to
give
expression
to
the
feelings
which
she
,
in
the
place
of
the
character
represented
,
would
feel
.
Almost
invariably
she
would
carry
the
vivid
imaginations
away
with
her
and
brood
over
them
the
next
day
alone
.
She
lived
as
much
in
these
things
as
in
the
realities
which
made
up
her
daily
life
.
</p>
<p>
It
was
not
often
that
she
came
to
the
play
stirred
to
her
heart
’s
core
by
actualities
.
To-day
a
low
song
of
longing
had
been
set
singing
in
her
heart
by
the
finery
,
the
merriment
,
the
beauty
she
had
seen
.
Oh
,
these
women
who
had
passed
her
by
,
hundreds
and
hundreds
strong
,
who
were
they
?
Whence
came
the
rich
,
elegant
dresses
,
the
astonishingly
coloured
buttons
,
the
knick-knacks
of
silver
and
gold
?
Where
were
these
lovely
creatures
housed
?
Amid
what
elegancies
of
carved
furniture
,
decorated
walls
,
elaborate
tapestries
did
they
move
?
Where
were
their
rich
apartments
,
loaded
with
all
that
money
could
provide
?
In
what
stables
champed
these
sleek
,
nervous
horses
and
rested
the
gorgeous
carriages
?
Where
lounged
the
richly
groomed
footmen
?
Oh
,
the
mansions
,
the
lights
,
the
perfume
,
the
loaded
boudoirs
and
tables
!
New
York
must
be
filled
with
such
bowers
,
or
the
beautiful
,
insolent
,
supercilious
creatures
could
not
be
.
Some
hothouses
held
them
.
It
ached
her
to
know
that
she
was
not
one
of
them
—
that
,
alas
,
she
had
dreamed
a
dream
and
it
had
not
come
true
.
She
wondered
at
her
own
solitude
these
two
years
past
—
her
indifference
to
the
fact
that
she
had
never
achieved
what
she
had
expected
.
</p>
<p>
The
play
was
one
of
those
drawing-room
concoctions
in
which
charmingly
overdressed
ladies
and
gentlemen
suffer
the
pangs
of
love
and
jealousy
amid
gilded
surroundings
.
Such
bon-mots
are
ever
enticing
to
those
who
have
all
their
days
longed
for
such
material
surroundings
and
have
never
had
them
gratified
.
They
have
the
charm
of
showing
suffering
under
ideal
conditions
.
Who
would
not
grieve
upon
a
gilded
chair
?
Who
would
not
suffer
amid
perfumed
tapestries
,
cushioned
furniture
,
and
liveried
servants
?
Grief
under
such
circumstances
becomes
an
enticing
thing
.
Carrie
longed
to
be
of
it
.
She
wanted
to
take
her
sufferings
,
whatever
they
were
,
in
such
a
world
,
or
failing
that
,
at
least
to
simulate
them
under
such
charming
conditions
upon
the
stage
.
So
affected
was
her
mind
by
what
she
had
seen
,
that
the
play
now
seemed
an
extraordinarily
beautiful
thing
.
She
was
soon
lost
in
the
world
it
represented
,
and
wished
that
she
might
never
return
.
Between
the
acts
she
studied
the
galaxy
of
matinée
attendants
in
front
rows
and
boxes
,
and
conceived
a
new
idea
of
the
possibilities
of
New
York
.
She
was
sure
she
had
not
seen
it
all
—
that
the
city
was
one
whirl
of
pleasure
and
delight
.
</p>
<p>
Going
out
,
the
same
Broadway
taught
her
a
sharper
lesson
.
The
scene
she
had
witnessed
coming
down
was
now
augmented
and
at
its
height
.
Such
a
crush
of
finery
and
folly
she
had
never
seen
.
It
clinched
her
convictions
concerning
her
state
.
She
had
not
lived
,
could
not
lay
claim
to
having
lived
,
until
something
of
this
had
come
into
her
own
life
.
Women
were
spending
money
like
water
;
she
could
see
that
in
every
elegant
shop
she
passed
.
Flowers
,
candy
,
jewelry
,
seemed
the
principal
things
in
which
the
elegant
dames
were
interested
.
And
she
—
she
had
scarcely
enough
pin
money
to
indulge
in
such
outings
as
this
a
few
times
a
month
.
</p>
<p>
That
night
the
pretty
little
flat
seemed
a
commonplace
thing
.
It
was
not
what
the
rest
of
the
world
was
enjoying
.
She
saw
the
servant
working
at
dinner
with
an
indifferent
eye
.
In
her
mind
were
running
scenes
of
the
play
.
Particularly
she
remembered
one
beautiful
actress
—
the
sweetheart
who
had
been
wooed
and
won
.
The
grace
of
this
woman
had
won
Carrie
’s
heart
.
Her
dresses
had
been
all
that
art
could
suggest
,
her
sufferings
had
been
so
real
.
The
anguish
which
she
had
portrayed
Carrie
could
feel
.
It
was
done
as
she
was
sure
she
could
do
it
.
There
were
places
in
which
she
could
even
do
better
.
Hence
she
repeated
the
lines
to
herself
.
Oh
,
if
she
could
only
have
such
a
part
,
how
broad
would
be
her
life
!
She
,
too
,
could
act
appealingly
.
</p>
<p>
When
Hurstwood
came
,
Carrie
was
moody
.
She
was
sitting
,
rocking
and
thinking
,
and
did
not
care
to
have
her
enticing
imaginations
broken
in
upon
;
so
she
said
little
or
nothing
.
</p>
<p>
“
What
’s
the
matter
,
Carrie
?
”
said
Hurstwood
after
a
time
,
noticing
her
quiet
,
almost
moody
state
.
