Boston/Jamaica
Plain-Mission
Hill
</head>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Jamaica
Plain
</hi>
and
<hi rend="bold">
Mission
Hill
</hi>
are
two
distinct
neighborhoods
within
the
City
of
<ref target="Boston">
Boston
</ref>
.
They
are
grouped
together
here
due
to
their
shared
border
and
transit
options
.
Jamaica
Plain
—
or
&quot;
JP
&quot;
—
is
one
of
the
first
streetcar
suburbs
in
America
and
is
surrounded
by
<hi rend="italic">
many
</hi>
parks
.
JP
has
undergone
significant
urban
renewal
since
the
turn
of
the
century
,
with
scores
of
fine
shops
and
restaurants
.
North
of
JP
,
tiny
Mission
Hill
was
named
quite
literally
,
when
a
large
church
was
built
atop
a
hill
.
This
small
neighborhood
is
more
urban
feeling
and
has
a
high
student
population
.
</p>
<head>
Understand
</head>
<p>
Historically
,
both
neighborhoods
were
simple
farming
communities
within
<ref target="Boston/Roxbury">
Roxbury
</ref>
.
They
became
part
of
<ref target="Boston/Outer_Neighborhoods">
West
Roxbury
</ref>
during
the
mid-19th
century
for
a
time
,
before
finally
being
annexed
by
Boston
in
1874
.
Around
this
time
a
small
river
,
or
<hi rend="italic">
stony
brook
</hi>
,
flowed
along
what
is
today
the
Southwest
Corridor
.
Taking
advantage
of
the
available
hydropower
,
several
industries
sprang
up
along
the
route
,
most
notably
breweries
.
Residents
have
used
Centre
St
and
Huntington
Ave
for
almost
200
years
to
commute
between
these
factories
and
downtown
Boston
.
</p>
<p>
Possessing
a
wealth
of
green
space
and
many
transit
options
,
<hi rend="bold">
Jamaica
Plain
</hi>
is
very
desirable
among
Bostonians
.
The
old
brewery
buildings
have
been
remodeled
and
updated
,
while
ever
fancier
shops
and
restaurants
continue
to
open
for
business
.
But
JP
draws
its
real
strength
from
the
diversity
of
its
residents
.
A
strong
character
of
social
awareness
and
tolerance
has
mitigated
gentrifications
worst
effects
.
You
can
still
find
traditional
bodegas
mixed
in
with
the
upscale
brunch
spots
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Mission
Hill
</hi>
came
into
its
own
around
1870
,
after
the
construction
of
the
eponymous
Mission
Hill
Basilica
.
Built
and
paid
for
by
the
mostly
German
congregation
,
the
basilica
is
striking
and
can
be
seen
in
many
views
of
Boston
.
The
neighborhood
has
changed
drastically
over
the
years
.
Surrounded
by
hospitals
and
universities
,
it
plays
host
to
a
frequently
rotating
cast
of
young
people
.
And
the
area
affords
some
great
views
of
the
city
from
its
high
points
.
</p>
<head>
Neighborhoods
</head>
<p>
These
neighborhoods
are
listed
from
north
to
south
.
You
'll
find
these
larger
nodes
of
activity
to
be
separated
by
stretches
of
quieter
,
more
residential
areas
.
Think
of
the
area
like
a
wide
slice
of
residential
buildings
sandwiched
between
giant
parks
on
either
side
.

<hi rend="bold">
Brigham
Circle
:
</hi>
This
is
Mission
Hill
's
commercial
heart
.
Most
of
the
neighborhood
's
shops
and
restaurants
can
be
found
in
this
area
.
Named
after
the
nearby
Brigham
and
Women
's
Hospital
,
this
is
a
transitional
area
of
the
city
.
Head
north
or
&quot;
inbound
&quot;
to
enter
the
Longwood
Medical
neighborhood
in
<ref target="Boston/Fenway-Kenmore">
Fenway/Kenmore
</ref>
.
Head
south-east
on
Tremont
to
continue
along
Mission
Hill
,
passing
the
Basilica
and
eventually
entering
Roxbury
.
If
you
're
feeling
bold
,
head
up
Calumet
Street
and
try
to
bluff
your
way
into
a
house
party
.
Your
youth
and
a
little
red
cup
camouflage
is
all
you
'll
need
.

<hi rend="bold">
Hyde
Square
:
</hi>
One
of
Jamaica
Plain
's
commercial
districts
.
Consisting
of
a
tiny
rotary
and
a
bunch
of
fantastic
restaurants
and
bars
nearby
.
Later
,
head
east
down
Centre
Street
towards
Jackson
Square
to
experience
JP
's
&quot;
Latin
Quarter
&quot;
.
During
the
70s
and
80s
JP
was
a
largely
hispanic
area
,
and
this
section
of
town
still
reflects
that
today
.
</item>
<item>
<hi rend="bold">
The
Monument
:
</hi>
JP
's
biggest
and
busiest
commercial
zone
.
Heading
north
from
the
monument
along
Center
Street
affords
the
opportunity
for
great
people
watching
and
window
shopping
.
If
the
weather
's
cooperating
,
head
west
to
Jamaica
Pond
,
or
south-west
to
witness
the
amazing
Arnold
Arboretum
.
South
will
take
you
to
Forest
Hills
and
into
<ref target="Boston/Outer_Neighborhoods">
Roslindale
</ref>
,
and
east
will
take
you
to
Franklin
Park
in
Roxbury
.
</item>
</list>
<head>
By
public
transit
</head>
<p>
Taking
the
Orange
Line
and
walking
is
the
premiere
way
to
access
these
neighborhoods
.
<hi rend="bold">
Roxbury
Crossing
</hi>
serves
Mission
Hill
,
while
<hi rend="bold">
Jackson
Square
</hi>
,
<hi rend="bold">
Stony
Brook
</hi>
,
and
<hi rend="bold">
Green
</hi>
serve
Jamaica
Plain
.
Green
is
quite
popular
,
allowing
easy
access
to
the
main
shopping
district
in
one
direction
,
and
Franklin
Park
in
the
other
.
Use
<hi rend="bold">
Forest
Hills
</hi>
when
visiting
the
Arboretum
,
the
entrance
is
just
across
the
street
.
</p>
<p>
The
&quot;
E
&quot;
branch
of
the
Green
Line
trolley
is
another
great
way
into
Mission
Hill
.
<hi rend="bold">
Brigham
Circle
</hi>
is
the
last
stop
along
its
dedicated
right
of
way
,
while
<hi rend="bold">
Fenwood
Road
</hi>
,
<hi rend="bold">
Mission
Park
</hi>
,
and
<hi rend="bold">
Back
of
the
Hill
</hi>
are
all
street
level
stops
.
Watch
your
step
!
All
trolleys
turn
around
at
<hi rend="bold">
Heath
St
</hi>
,
the
terminus
of
the
E
branch
.
</p>
<p>
If
you
'd
like
to
walk
a
little
less
,
but
wait
a
little
more
,
use
the
<hi rend="bold">
#39
</hi>
bus
.
Starting
in
Copley
Square
in
the
<ref target="Boston/Back_Bay-Beacon_Hill">
Back
Bay
</ref>
,
these
big
buses
run
constantly
down
Huntington
Ave
following
the
path
of
the
E
trolley
.
Continuing
beyond
Heath
St
and
down
Centre
,
they
pass
in
front
of
every
shop
and
restaurant
in
JP
.
Fighting
traffic
,
they
eventually
make
it
to
Forest
Hills
station
.
From
Copley
to
Heath
Street
,
it
is
arguable
faster
than
the
E
branch
(
and
a
little
cheaper
)
,
but
they
come
less
frequently
.

<p>
The
Southwest
Corridor
Park
,
which
begins
at
Back
Bay
Station
,
stretches
all
the
way
to
Forest
Hills
.
It
's
one
of
the
best
bike
paths
in
the
city
.
It
's
also
great
for
novice
cyclists
,
as
the
path
is
completely
separated
from
cars
and
street
traffic
at
all
times
.
The
park
runs
above
and
alongside
the
Orange
Line
,
so
consider
biking
roughly
equivalent
to
taking
the
T.
There
are
places
to
lock
your
bike
at
all
stations
,
and
throughout
the
neighborhoods
.
Many
locals
use
bikes
here
,
so
you
'll
never
be
far
from
a
bike
shop
if
you
encounter
mechanical
issues
.
</p>
<head>
By
car
</head>
<p>
Like
most
other
areas
of
Boston
,
driving
in
these
neighborhoods
is
not
a
great
idea
.
Only
consider
driving
if
you
're
visiting
the
Arboretum
or
Franklin
Park
,
and
strongly
consider
the
T
even
then
.
Mission
Hill
borders
one
of
the
most
congested
areas
in
the
city
,
and
traffic
is
often
snarled
here
at
all
hours
.
In
Jamaica
Plain
,
the
main
thoroughfare
is
called
the
&quot;
Jamaicaway
&quot;
,
or
Jway
.
This
section
borders
the
Emerald
Necklace
and
can
be
particularly
challenging
for
out
of
town
drivers
.
Prepare
for
high
speeds
,
<hi rend="italic">
narrow
</hi>
winding
roads
,
and
a
series
of
busy
rotaries
along
this
four-lane
undivided
boulevard
.
