Reddit
really
helped
me
out
in
terms
of
preparing
for
this
freaking
exam
,
so
I
figured
I
'd
throw
my
two
cents
in
.
Background
:
top
20
MD
,
traditional
curriculum
,
4
weeks
dedicated
,
1x
Kaplan/UW\+flagged/incorrects
,
used
Zanki
throughout
MS2
(
95
%
matured
by
dedicated
)
,
250s
in
NBMEs
,
271/269
on
UWSA1/2
1
.
Zanki
is
gold
.
Keep
up
with
those
reviews
.
Make
your
own
cards
from
Qbank/NBME
incorrects
.
Use
image
occlusion
for
anatomy
--
spacial
memory
is
so
much
stronger
than
semantic
memory
.
2
.
Review
the
first
3
chapters
of
Pathoma
and
know
it
like
the
back
of
your
hand
(
esp
.
chemical
mediators
of
inflammation
,
stages/mediators
of
healing
)
3
.
Do
n’t
forget
public
health
.
Was
n’t
obvious
most
of
the
time
.
B&amp;B
is
good
review
as
he
goes
through
some
“
atypical
”
presentations
of
basic
concepts
4
.
It
was
a
mix
of
UW/NBME-style
questions
but
very
,
very
similar
to
NBME
17/18/19
as
well
as
the
Free
120
.
Definitely
do/review
those
,
in
addition
to
the
2
UW
self-assessments
.
5
.
Sketchy
was
PLENTY
for
the
micro/pharm
I
got
.
6
.
There
were
some
Step
2-style
questions
on
counseling
and
management
.
Not
sure
how
to
study
for
these
if
you
have
n't
hit
the
wards
yet
7
.
I
personally
did
n’t
get
a
ton
of
WTF
questions
.
Everything
was
either
in
FA
or
UW
8
.
You
will
get
auscultation
questions
where
they
will
give
you
no
clues
on
the
stem
9
.
Go
through
the
Rapid
Review
section
of
FA
(
better
yet
,
do
Groovernaculum
’s
Rapid
Review
Anki
deck
)
a
few
days
before
your
date
10
.
Do
n’t
forget
that
often
,
the
boards
wants
the
MOST
LIKELY/COMMON
answer
,
not
the
zebras
(
if
it
’s
a
zebra
,
it
’s
quite
obvious
,
for
example
,
prominent
occiput
=
Edwards
)
A
healthy
American
with
a
heart
murmur
probably
has
MVP
.
A
woman
with
heavy
periods
probably
has
von
Willebrand
.
Rapid
review
helped
a
lot
with
this
11
.
Yes
,
there
is
biochemistry
.
Quite
a
bit
of
it
.
Pathways
...
12
.
When
doing
NBMEs
,
get
used
to
taking
short
,
5-10
minute
breaks
between
the
blocks
.
Helps
with
stamina
13
.
Neuroanatomy
is
annoying
and
will
always
be
annoying
14
.
Wake
up
a
bit
earlier
the
day
before
so
you
’ll
be
able
to
fall
asleep
earlier
15
.
Trust
in
your
preparation
.
Trust
in
yourself
.
You
’ll
do
great

Thanks
for
the
write
up
!
Mind
sharing
your
class
rank
?
Do
you
think
focusing
on
keeping
up
with
zanki
reviews
ignoring
class
material
and
cramming
class
material
just
before
exams
is
a
solid
strategy
for
250+
?
