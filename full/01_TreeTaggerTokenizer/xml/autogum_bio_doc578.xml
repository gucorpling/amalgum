Background
</head>
<p>
Brita
was
born
the
eldest
daughter
of
two
Danish
nobles
,
statesman
Olov
(
or
Oluf
)
Axelsson
Tott
(
d.
1464
)
and
Karen
Jensdotter
Falk
(
born
1406
)
.
Her
family
was
one
of
the
most
powerful
in
Scandinavia
:
her
father
was
politically
influential
in
both
Sweden
and
Denmark
,
and
her
mother
was
the
heir
of
Vallø
.
She
was
related
to
the
Swedish
regent
consort
Lady
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingeborg_Tott">

</ref>
.
</p>
<p>
She
was
in
1442
married
to
the
Swedish
noble
councillor

Ehrengissle
Nilsson
the
Younger
Natt
och
Dag
</ref>
,
who
belonged
to
the
most
powerful
nobles
in
Sweden
.
Brita
was
commonly
known
as
&quot;
<hi rend="italic">
The
Lady
of
Hammersta
</hi>
&quot;
,
after
her
husband
's
property
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammersta">
Hammersta
</ref>
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Södermanland">

</ref>
.
She
received
great
estates
upon
her
wedding
.
She
had
no
children
.

Treason
</head>
<p>
During
the
war
between
Sweden
and
Denmark
(
1451
–
52
)
,
she
corresponded
with
the
enemies
of
king
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_VIII_of_Sweden">
Charles
VIII
of
Sweden
</ref>
and
became
involved
in
a
plot
against
the
king
.
During
the
war
,
her
spouse
was
governor
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Örebro">
Örebro
</ref>
.
When
the
Danes
invaded
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Västergötland">
Västergötland
</ref>
,
Brita
Olovsdotter
corresponded
with
them
and
informed
them
of
every
movement
of
the
Swedish
army
which
,
among
other
things
,
enabled
the
Danish
army
to
capture
the
fortress
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lödöse">
Lödöse
</ref>
and
avoid
being
cast
out
by
the
Swedish
army
.
</p>
<p>
For
this
,
she
was
put
on
trial
for
treason
against
the
crown
at
the
assembled
court
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm">
Stockholm
</ref>
of
1452
.
She
was
judged
guilty
of
high
treason
and
sentenced
to
be
burned
at
the
stake
.
The
sentence
was
then
changed
to
being
walled
alive
into
a
brick
wall
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalmar">
Kalmar
</ref>
.
In
reality
,
this
was
never
literally
realized
;
she
simply
spent
a
period
of
time
as
a
guest
in
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._John's_Priory,_Kalmar">
St.
John
's
Priory
,
Kalmar
</ref>
.
After
her
release
,
she
financed
the
paintings
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ösmo">
Ösmo
</ref>
Church
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Södermanland">

</ref>
as
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penance">

;
one
of
the
paintings
there
is
said
to
be
her

Forger
</head>
<p>
Brita
Olovsdotter
was
also
active
as
a
forger
,
and
acquired
large
amounts
of
money
by
the
forging
seals
of
both
living
and
dead
people
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend">
Legend
</ref>
say
that
there
was
so
many
of
them
,
that
at
one
occasion
,
the
secretary
of
her
spouse
was
to
have
thrown
an
abundance
of
them
in
the
water
stream
outside
Hammersta
manor
.
It
is
not
known
whether
the
stories
of
her
forgery
affairs
are
true
or
not
.
</p>
<p>
In
1479
,
she
was
put
on
trial
in
her
absence
in
Stockholm
for
forgery
and
judged
guilty
of
having
illegally
sold
her
estate
Vallö
to
the
Danish
crown
.
She
received
mercy
and
was
released
.
This
case
caused
a
change
in
the
law
:
in
1483
,
the
monarch
was
banned
from
receiving
noble
estates
with
a
specific
motivation
to
the
case
of
1479
.
</p>
<head>
Landowner
and
county
administrator
</head>
<p>
In
1469
,
she
became
a
widow
and
managed
the
estate
herself
.
The
following
years
was
spent
on
the
managing
of
her
large
estates
and
the
ownerships
over
them
which
,
due
to
their
size
,
was
a
question
debated
in
the
Swedish
council
.
Her
stepchildren
questioned
her
right
to
the
Swedish
estates
of
her
late
spouse
,
and
her
stepmother
,
her
father
's
widow
Anne
Present
,
questioned
her
right
to
the
Danish
estates
after
her
mother
.
She
had
the
support
of
her
powerful
uncles
,
<hi rend="italic">
Axelssönerna
</hi>
,
until
1475
.
In
1475
,
she
gave
Hammersta
to
the
church
and
left
Sweden
for
Denmark
,
and
was
given
support
by
the
Danish
king
.
</p>
<p>
In
1484
,
she
was
appointed
county
administrator
of
the
royal
estate
of
Dronningeholm
ved
Arresø
,
a
position
she
managed
until
1495
.
In
1495
,
she
left
Denmark
for
Sweden
,
where
she
spent
her
last
years
.
She
was
one
of
the
largest
landowners
in
Sweden
of
her
time
,
and
her
estates
played
a
part
in
politics
and
was
the
perhaps
well
known
court
cases
in
this
area
of
her
time
.
</p>
<p>
The
date
of
her
birth
and
death
is
unknown
,
but
she
was
still
alive
on
3
March
1498
.
In
her
will
,
she
left
the
estate
both
to
the
Swedish
regent
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sten_Sture_the_Elder">
Sten
Sture
the
Elder

(
there
are
indications
that
she
had

forced

and

which
aroused
great
confusion
