AS

:
I
did
video
recorded
interviews
with
several
Scientologists
â€“
they
did
n't
know
what
the
interviews
were
for
.
I
told
them
that
I
was
doing
a
project
,
had
some
questions
and
at
some
point
may
possibly
get
back
to
them
.
I
asked
them
questions
about
themselves
,
their
skills
,
where
they
stood
on
Scientology
training
and
counseling
,
etc.
I
then
weeded
out
the
ones
that
I
did
n't
think
would
be
appropriate
for
the
personal
staff
of
Tom
Cruise
and
for
those
who
seemed
promising
,
I
compiled
their
video
with
contact
information
and
sent
it
to
Shelly
Miscavige
.
She
would
forward
to
Andrea
(
TC
's
Assistant
at
the
time
)
any
she
thought
were
good
.
Andrea
would
then
contact
them
for
an
interview
directly
.
This
continued
until
they
had
Scientologists
selected
for
all
of
the
key
functions
of
the
Cruise
household
(
chef
,
nanny
,
Executive
Housekeeper
,
etc.
)
.
Up
to
that
point
,
several
of
those
functions
had
been
being
done
by
Sea
Org
members
(
the
specifics
on
this
are
covered
in
my
book
)
.
Once
they
were
hired
by
TC
,
they
reported
to
him
or
his
Assistant
for
their
work
assignments
,
not
to
the
Scientology
organization
to
my
knowledge
.

In
what
capacity
did
you
meet
these
Scientology
celebrities
?
Were
they
coming
in
for
Scientology
auditing
,
or
counseling
?
Did
they
receive
advice
and
assistance
in
some
form
with
their
professional
careers
?

:
While
I
was
working
on
the
project
to
build
Celebrity
Centre
International
in
Hollywood
,
I
was
often
in
the
President
's
office
of
the
Celebrity
Center
where
the
top
celebrities
often
would
come
.
That
's
how
I
met
most
of
them
.
They
would
come
into
Celebrity
Center
to
attend
a
course
,
to
go
in
for
a
counseling
session
or
to
bring
someone
new
in
to
introduce
them
to
Scientology
.
Celebrity
Centre
International
has
a
&quot;
career
counseling
&quot;
service
it
does
provide
and
some
celebrities
have
done
this
service
to
hopefully
help
them
to
do
better
in
their
careers
.

You
write
that
you
are
aware
of
situations
where
members
of
Scientology
hired
by
celebrities
as
assistants
or
security
staff
,
have
actually
reported
back
to
the
organization
through
a
Scientology
process
called
&quot;
Security
Checks
&quot;
,
with
revealing
information
about
those
celebrities
.
Did
any
of
these
celebrities
ever
find
out
such
a
tactic
was
being
used
to
uncover
information
about

If
so

what
