</hi>
I
think
so
.
I
think
that
's
a
general
philosophy
.
Federalism
.
I
do
n't
think
it
's
absolute
;
I
think
there
are
some
issues
in
which
the
country
as
a
nation
has
an

Because
of
what
I
just
told
you
.
I
think
that
states
rights
are
important
,
but
there
are
some
issues
in
which
the
nation
as
a
community
has
an
interest
,
and
of
course
the
Marriage
Act
,
one
of
the
fears
has
been
if
you
end
up
with
one
or
two
states
that
support
homosexual
marriage
,
what
you
'll
end
up
doing
is
producing
a
flow
of
people
going
to
a
particular
state
,
receiving
their
marriage
license
in
that
state
,
and
then
due
to
the
Full
Faith
and
Credit
Clause
of
the
Constitution
,
having
those
marriages
recognized
in
the
state
where
the
marriage
is
banned
.

Well
,
if
you
end
up
with
a
federal
act
that
prohibits
it
--
that
's
what
I
'm
saying
,
if
you
prohibit
it
on
a
national
basis
in
a
Constitutional
Amendment
or
on
a
federal
act
,
then
you
eliminate
the
process
of
having
one
or
two
states
generating
homosexual
marriages
and
then
demanding
they
be
recognized
under
the
Full
Faith
and
Credit
Clause
.
Do
you
understand
what
I
'm
saying
?
If
you
have
one
state
that
allows
it
,
then
you
have
a
recognition
requirement
of
the
other
states
.

But
did
n't

Massachusetts

<p>
<hi rend="bold">

What

your

I

So
do
you
no
longer
support
amending
the
Constitution
is
my
question
.
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DH
:
</hi>
No
,
I
think
it
has
still
yet
to
be
fully
decided
as
to
whether
a
few
states
can
at
some
point
basically
become
proliferators
,
if
you
will
,
of
non-traditional
marriage
.
Here
's
my
position
:
If
it
is
necessary
to
amend
the
Constitution
,
then
I
think
we
will
need
to
do
it
.
I
think
you
need
to
have
a
Defense
of
Marriage
on
a
uniform
basis
in
all
fifty
states
.
What
it
takes
,
in
terms
of
satsifying
the
federal
courts
to
do
that
,
should
be
done
.
So
if
it
is
required
that
it
is
necessary
to
have
an
amendment
to
the
Constitution
to
do
that
,
I
would
support
that
.
But
doing
what
it
takes
to
have
a
uniform
treatment
to
defend
traditional
marriage
across
all
the
states
.
