Protein
and
Peptide
Nanobiosensors
for
the
Early
Diagnosis
of
Diseases
</head>
<p>
A
pathological
process
at
an
early
stage
is
characterized
by
the
appearance
of
marker
proteins
at
very
low
(
10−15
M
and
lower
)
concentrations
in
blood
,
and
highly-sensitive
nanobiosensor
systems
are
required
to
detect
proteins
at
such
low
concentrations
.
Additionally
,
the
composition
of
biomolecules
gathering
at
a
surface
is
another
relevant
issue
,
given
the
dynamic
nature
of
disease
progression
.
With
respect
to
that
,
nano-biosensors
may
offer
increased
possibilities
for
the
early
diagnosis
of
diseases
.

Y.D.

that
the

an

(
made

near
the

In

The
bioelectrodes
modified
with
Pd-based
gNPs
have
lower
sensitivities
to
their

,
but
broader
linear

detection

higher

stabilities
than
unmodified

electrodes
.
Moreover
,
the
advantage
of
the
“

approach
is
the
rapid
growth
of
the
yeast
cells
with
a
high-yield
of
pure
gNPs
surrounded
by
organic
compounds

provides
the
anti-aggregative

can

for
the

an
enzyme
of
high
clinical
importance
,
especially
as
a
diagnostic
and
prognostic
marker
of
various
inflammatory
disorders
and
tumors
.
The
first
strategy
used
the
incorporation
of
a
PEGylated
sequence
with
a
dithiol
anchor
to
create
biorecognition
ligands
;
the

strategies
used

CALNN
)
selected
from
58
peptide
sequences
tested
for
their
high
stability
and
resistance
to
electrolyte-induced

NP
aggregation
.
DPP-IV/CD26
activity
using
the
three
approaches
was
detected
under
optimal
conditions
and
only
C/G-capped
AuNPs
showed
a
response
with
a
color
change
when
incubated
with
DPP-IV/CD26
.
C/G-capped
AuNPs
were
less
sensitive
than
the
monofunctionalized
systems
,
with
a
dynamic
range
of
10
–
30
U/L
but
with
very
high
stability
in
ionic
solutions
.
The
developed
biofunctionalized
assay
was
successfully
evaluated
by
gel
electrophoresis
,
zeta
potential
,
and
hydrodynamic
radius
measurements
and
tested
for
the
