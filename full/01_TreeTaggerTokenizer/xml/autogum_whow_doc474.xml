Prune
Yews
</head>
<p>
Yews
are
long-living
shrubs
that
come
in
a
variety
of
species
.
Selectively
pruning
yews
is
healthiest
for
the
shrub
,
and
it
requires
choosing
specific
branches
to
cut
.
Look
for
branches
that
are
sticking
out
or
that
are
blocking
sunlight
to
the
rest
of
the
plant
.
You
can
also
shear
yews
,
cutting
them
into
a
desired
shape
â€”
just
make
sure
the
entire
yew
has
access
to
sunlight
and
air
.

Pruning
Yews

<item>
Start
pruning
yews
in
late
March
or
early
April
.
This
is
right
before
new
growth
will
start
to
take
place
.
If
the
yews
are
growing
vigorously
,
you
may
need
to
prune
them
again
in
late
June
.

Avoid
pruning
yews
in
the
fall
,
as
this
will
make
them
more
vulnerable
to
winter
weather
.
</item>

Cut
out
diseased
,
dead
,
or
broken
branches
.
Look
for
shoots
that
have
broken
off
,
or
leaves
that
are
brown
and
dying
.
If
an
entire
branch
of
leaves
is
yellow
or
brown
,
use
hand
pruners
to
clip
the
entire
branch
off
.

You
can
cut
these
out
at
any
point
during
the
year
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Trim
off
any
shoots
that
are
clearly
sticking
out
.
New
growth
will
often
be
light
green
and
sticking
out
from
the
rest
of
the
plant
.
You
can
cut
these
off
using
hand
pruners
,
either
clipping
the
end
off
so
it
's
level
with
the
rest
of
the
yew
,
or
by
reaching
down
into
the
plant
and
cutting
right
where
2
branches
meet
.

Cutting
off
the
protruding
shoots
will
give
the
yew
a
shaped
and
clean-cut
look
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Remove
branches
to
bring
light
into
the
yew
.
It
's
important
for
all
of
the
leaves
and
branches
to
be
able
to
receive
sunlight
and
fresh
air
,
including
the
inner
ones
.
Select
longer
shoots
and
cut
them
off
deep
inside
the
shrub
using
a
hand
pruner
.
By
doing
this
all
over
the
plant
,
you
'll
open
up
the
middle
a
bit
so
that
it
can
be
healthy
as
well
.

Sometimes
yews
will
lean
outwards
with
the
upper
branches
blocking
the
sunlight
to
the
bottom
ones
.
If
this
is
the
case
,
trim
the
upper
branches
so
that
the
entire
plant
has
access
to
light
and
air
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Make
the
cut
where
the
branch
meets
another
branch
.
Once
you
've
chosen
the
shoot
you
're
going
to
cut
,
follow
it
down
into
the
yew
until
it
connects
to
another
branch
.
This
is
where
you
should
cut
it
using
hand
pruners
,
making
sure
the
cut
is
flush
against
the
attaching
branch
.

If
the
shrub
is
super
deep
,
you
can
use
long-handled
pruners
to
snip
off
the
branch
.

Wear
gloves
to
protect
your
hands
when
pruning
,
if
desired

Cut
the
yews
using
a
chainsaw
to
shape
them
in
a
particular
way
.
If
you
want
your
yews
in
a
specific
shape
,
as
opposed
to
their
natural
form
,
use
a
chainsaw
to
carefully
cut
off
branches
.
Be
cautious
when
using
the
chainsaw
and
go
slowly
.

While
yews
are
very
tolerant
of
heavy
cutting
,
make
sure
you
do
n't
cut
off
more
than
50
percent
of
the
plant
.
</item>
<item>
Since
this
is
n't
considered
pruning
for
the
health
of
the
plant
,
you
can
shear
yews
at
any
point
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Choose
a
shape
that
allows
sunlight
and
air
to
reach
the
whole
plant
.
While
you
can
pick
any
shape
you
want
,
yews
will
be
much
healthier
if
all
of
the
branches
and
leaves
have
access
to
sunlight
.
Cutting
your
yews
into
a
pyramid
or
similar
shape
is
a
good
choice
.

Use
pruning
shears
to
maintain
the
shape
of
the
yew
.
To
maintain
a
perfectly
shaped
yew
,
snip
off
new
growth
that
extends
past
the
desired
shape
using
hand
pruners
or
pruning
shears
.
You
can
clip
them
off
to
be
level
with
the
rest
of
the
plant
,
or
you
can
choose
to
create
air
pockets
by
removing
the
entire
section
of
the
branch
,
clipping
it
where
the
branch
meets
another
one
.
