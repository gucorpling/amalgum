Introduction
</head>
<p>
Nowadays
,
the
interest
of
having
a
digital
model
of
real-life
scenarios
is
increasing
.
This
model
can
be
used
to
update
and
track
the
behaviour
of
an
infrastructure
through
its
whole
life
cycle
.
In
the
railway
field
,
with
the
arrival
of
the
high-speed
train
and
the
high
request
for
its
maintenance
and
inspection
,
research
concerning
technical
and
technological
improvements
has
increased
.
One
of
the
main
concerns
of
the
railway
industry
is
the
irregularities
affecting
the
rail
track
layout
,
as
well
as
the
perfect
state
of
the
catenary
to
fulfil
the
requirements
of
gauge
,
among
others
.
These
elements
have
a
big
repercussion
in
the
security
of
the
whole
railway
system
.
Hence
,
railway
companies
invest
their
resources
for
the
optimal
inspection
and
maintenance
of
the
infrastructures
.
This
is
where
laser
scanning
systems
come
into
consideration
.
In
recent
years
,
the
applications
for
laser
scanning
technology
have
increased
.
Until
now
,
the
main
applications
involving
this
type
of
data
were
dimensional
control
,
3D
modelling
,
urban
planning
,
and
,
more
recently
,
BIM
(
building
information
modelling
)
.
The
main
characteristic
of
laser
scanners
is
their
capacity
for
obtaining
large
amounts
of
data
with
high
accuracy
in
a
short
period
of
time
.
Usually
,
this
information
was
processed
manually
or
semi-automatically
.
The
monotony
of
this
task
called
for
the
necessity
of
automatically
process
the
generated
three
dimensional
(
3D
)
point
clouds
.
</p>
<p>
This
work
arises
due
to
the
lack
of
specific
methods
for
classifying
and
inspecting
railway
point
clouds
,
and
especially
railway
power
lines
.
It
is
focused
on
the
automatic
classification
of
MLS
point
clouds
of
the
aerial
contact
line
system
from
railway
tunnels
,
and
its
later
inspection
.
The
aerial
contact
line
is
a
set
of
overhead
cables
on
top
of
the
railway
line
.
They
provide
electrical
supply
to
electric
trains
.
These
cables
are
placed
over
the
vehicle
’s
superior
gauge
limit
,
being
the
electrical
supply
provided
through
pantographs
.
The
system
is
composed
by
three
different
categories
of
cables
:
(
i
)
Contact
wire
,
from
which
the
pantograph
takes
the
power
for
the
train
;
(
ii
)
suspension
or
catenary
wire
,
which
resists
and
supports
the
catenary
weight
and
keeps
the
contact
wire
in
a
constant
height
;
and
(
iii
)
droppers
,
which
are
vertical
elements
that
help
to
maintain
the
contact
wire
in
that
constant
height
,
and
are
fixed
in
between
the
suspension
and
the
contact
wire
.
These
three
types
of
elements
are
hanged
over
the
train
’s
car
with
poles
or
cantilever
arms
.

wires
