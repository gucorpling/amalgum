With
a
population
of
about

it
is
the
4th
largest
city
in
the
State
.
Bendigo
is
about
140
km
(
105
miles
,
1½
hour
's
drive
)
north-north-west
of
<ref target="Melbourne">
Melbourne
</ref>
.
</p>
<p>
It
is
known
for
its
grand
Victorian
architecture
,
built
during
the
gold
rush
of
the
mid-19th
century
.

<p>
Bendigo
grew
to
a
bustling
town
after
gold
was
discovered
in
the
area
in
1851
.
The
wealth
of
this
period
resulted
in
the
construction
of
many
fine
public
and
commercial
buildings
in
the
city
centre
,
as
well
as
private
homes
in
the
surrounding
residential
areas
.
</p>
<p>
The
population
of
the
Greater
Bendigo
municipality
(
which
includes
much
rural
area
and
the
nearby
towns
of
Heathcote
and
Elmore
)
is
over
110,000
,
as
of
2016
.
Despite
this
it
retains
a
friendly
country
atmosphere
.
</p>
<p>
The
town
has
far
less
rain
than
Melbourne
due
to
its
position
to
the
north
of
the
Great
Dividing
Range
.
Summers
are
hot
and
dry
,
up
to
40
°C
or
more
on
some
days
.
Winters
tend
to
be
mild
;
with
lowest
temperatures
around
-5
°C
overnight
and
around
15
°C
during
the
day
.
</p>
<p>
Sheep
,
cattle
,
fruit
,
wine
and
cereal
crops
are
the
most
common
products
of
the
area
.
Gold
is
being
discovered
again
in
large
quantities
at
deeper
levels
in
the
old
mines
with
new
technology
.

History
</head>
<p>
Before
European
settlement
the
area
was
occupied
by
the
clans
of
the
Dja
Dja
Wurrung
people
.
They
were
regarded
by
other
tribes
as
being
a
superior
people
,
not
only
because
of
their
rich
hunting
grounds
but
because
from
their
area
came
a
greenstone
rock
for
their
stone
axes
.
Early
Europeans
described
the
Dja
Dja
Wrung
as
a
strong
,
physically
well-developed
people
and
not
belligerent
.
Nevertheless
the
early
years
of
European
settlement
in
the
Mount
Alexander
area
were
bloodied
by
many
clashes
between
intruder
and
dispossessed
.
</p>
<p>
Major
Mitchell
passed
through
the
area
in
1836
.
Following
his
discovery
,
the
first
squatters
arrived
in
1840
to
establish
vast
sheep
runs
.
Bendigo
Creek
was
part
of
the
Mount
Alexander
or
Ravenswood
sheep
run
.
</p>
<p>
It
is
generally
acknowledged
that
Mrs
John
Kennedy
and
Mrs
Patrick
Farrell
,
wives
of
workmen
on
the
Ravenswood
run
,
found
gold
at
‘
The
Rocks
’
-
now
an
identified
location
that
can
be
visited
at
the
junction
of
Bendigo
Creek
and
Maple
Street
.
</p>
<p>
The
first
‘
rush
’
took
place
in
November
1851
when
miners
at
Castlemaine
(
Forest
Creek
)
heard
of
the
new
discovery
.
Alluvial
gold
was
found
in
the
area
of
its
first
discovery
(
present
day
Golden
Square
)
and
then
the
miners
followed
the
gold
down
the
creek
to
what
is
now
Epsom
and
up
the
creek
to
the
present
suburb
of
Kangaroo
Flat
.
Further
discoveries
were
soon
made
in
the
tributary
creeks
at
Eaglehawk
and
Diamond
Hill
.
</p>
<p>
As
a
result
of
the
rush
of
people
to
the
area
,
the
Gold
Commissioner
’s
Office
,
the
Police
Barracks
and
the
courts
were
erected
on
Camp
Hill
,
now
the
present
Rosalind
Park
in
central
Bendigo
.
The
“
diggers
”
,
as
the
miners
were
called
,
numbered
as
high
as
thirty
thousand
and
came
from
all
over
the
world
;
from
England
,
Wales
,
Scotland
,
Ireland
–
along
with
Germans
,
Italians
,
Swiss
,
French
and
Americans
.
The
Chinese
population
reached
many
thousands
in
the
early
gold
rush
period
but
their
numbers
dropped
rapidly
as
the
nineteenth
century
progressed
.
</p>
<p>
Bendigo
quickly
grew
from
a
“
city
of
tents
”
to
become
a
substantial
city
with
great
public
buildings
.
The
first
hospital
was
built
in
1853
and
the
first
town
plan
was
developed
by
1854
.
A
municipality
emerged
and
the
first
Town
Hall
was
commissioned
in
1859
.
</p>
<p>
Bendigo
was
connected
to
Melbourne
by
telegraph
in
1857
and
it
was
from
here
that
the
first
message
reporting
the
deaths
of
Burke
and
Wills
was
sent
in
1861
.
Frequent
Cobb
&amp;
Co
coaches
ran
to
Melbourne
until
the
railway
reached
Bendigo
in
1862
.
</p>
<p>
In
the
following
decade
it
made
the
transition
from
small
mining
town
to
large
and
wealthy
city
,
and
becoming
established
as
a
key
centre
for
surrounding
settlements
.
</p>
<p>
Water
supply
was
always
a
problem
in
Bendigo
.
This
was
partly
solved
with
a
system
harnessing
the
waters
of
the
Coliban
River
,
designed
by
engineer
Joseph
Brady
.
Water
first
flowed
through
the
viaduct
in
1877
.
</p>
<p>
Architect
William
Charles
Vahland
left
a
major
mark
on
Bendigo
during
this
period
.
He
is
credited
as
innovating
what
was
the
most
popular
residential
design
of
the
period
,
low
cost
cottages
with
verandahs
decorated
in
iron
lace
which
became
a
popular
style
right
across
Victoria
.
He
transformed
the
Bendigo
Town
Hall
between
1878
to
1886
into
a
grand
building
and
designed
more
than
eighty
more
public
and
private
buildings
,
including
the
Alexandra
Fountain
,
the
Masonic
Temple
(
now
the
Capital
Theatre
)
and
the
Mechanics
Institute
and
School
of
Mines
(
now
the
Bendigo
Regional
Institute
of
TAFE
)
,
'
Fortuna
Villa
'
in
Golden
Square
,
(
which
was
the
home
of
'
Quartz
King
'
George
Lansell
)
,
the
Law
Courts
,
former
Post
Office
and
the
expanded
Shamrock
Hotel
in
Pall
Mall
.
</p>
<p>
A
tram
network
began
in
1890
and
was
used
for
public
transport
.
</p>

<p>
Bendigo
is
just
over
1½
hours
drive
north
of
Melbourne
on
the
Calder
Freeway
(
Highway
)
.
The
freeway
is
all
dual
carriageway
.

<p>
While
Bendigo
does
have
a
small
airport
,
it
will
likely
be
much
more
convenient
to
fly
into
Melbourne
.
From
there
,
hire
a
car
and
take
the
M79
(
Calder
Freeway
)
which
starts
just
by
the
airport
.
If
you
do
not
wish
to
drive
,
take
the
Skybus
into
Southern
Cross
Station
and
get
the
train
to
Bendigo
.
Alternatively
take
the
<ref target="http://www.bendigoairportservice.com.au/">
shuttle
</ref>
direct
to
Bendigo
from
the
airport
.
For
a
cheaper
option
,
catch
a
<ref target="http://ptv.vic.gov.au/route/view/8185">
479
</ref>
to
Sunbury
Station
and
get
the
train
to
Bendigo
.
</p>
<head>
By
train
</head>
<p>
Bendigo
is
served
by
trains
which
run
from
Melbourne
's
Southern
Cross
Station
into
the
south
of
Bendigo
.
These
usually
run
about
once
an
hour
.
The
journey
takes
approximately
two
hours
from
Melbourne
.
As
the
route
is
used
by
many
commuters
,
trains
may
be
more
crowded
in
the
early
morning
and
late
afternoon/early
evening
on
weekdays
.
From
the
station
,
most
of
the
CBD
is
within
walking
distance
.
Alternatively
buses
run
into
the
centre
of
the
city
and
other
parts
of
Bendigo
from
the
station
.
</p>
<p>
Vline
also
operates
a
coach
twice
daily
from

Adelaide

direct
to
Bendigo
.
