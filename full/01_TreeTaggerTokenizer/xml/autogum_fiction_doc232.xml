</p>
<p>
THE
SWEETHEART
OF
A
KING
.
</p>
<p>
The
scene
was
not
exactly
new
to
me
.
Moved
by
the
spirit
of
adventure
,
or
by
an
access
of
ennui
which
overtakes
me
at
times
,
I
had
several
times
visited
the
gaudy
establishment
of
Mercer
,
on
the
fashionable
side
of
Fifth
Avenue
in
the
Fifties
.
In
either
case
I
had
found
disappointment
;
where
the
stake
is
a
matter
of
indifference
there
can
be
no
excitement
;
and
besides
,
I
had
been
always
in
luck
.
</p>
<p>
But
on
this
occasion
I
had
a
real
purpose
before
me
,
though
not
an
important
one
,
and
I
surrendered
my
hat
and
coat
to
the
servant
at
the
door
with
a
feeling
of
satisfaction
.
</p>
<p>
At
the
entrance
to
the
main
room
I
met
Bob
Garforth
,
leaving
.
There
was
a
scowl
on
his
face
and
his
hand
trembled
as
he
held
it
forth
to
take
mine
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Harry
is
inside
.
What
a
rotten
hole
,
&quot;
said
he
,
and
passed
on
.
I
smiled
at
his
remark
--
it
was
being
whispered
about
that
Garforth
had
lost
a
quarter
of
a
million
at
Mercer
's
within
the
month
--
and
passed
inside
.
</p>
<p>
Gaudy
,
I
have
said
it
was
,
and
it
needs
no
other
word
.
Not
in
its
elements
,
but
in
their
arrangement
.
</p>
<p>
The
rugs
and
pictures
and
hangings
testified
to
the
taste
of
the
man
who
had
selected
them
;
but
they
were
abominably
disposed
,
and
there
were
too
many
of
them
.
</p>
<p>
The
room
,
which
was
unusually
large
,
held
two
or
three
leather
divans
,
an
English
buffet
,
and
many
easy
chairs
.
A
smoking-table
,
covered
,
stood
in
one
corner
.
</p>
<p>
Groups
of
men
were
gathered
about
each
of
the
three
roulette
wheels
ranged
along
the
farther
side
.
Through
a
door
to
the
left
could
be
seen
the
poker
tables
,
surrounded
by
grave
or
jocular
faces
.
Above
the
low
buzz
of
conversation
there
sounded
the
continual
droning
voices
of
the
croupiers
as
they
called
the
winning
numbers
,
and
an
occasional
exclamation
from
a
&quot;
customer
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
I
made
my
way
to
the
center
wheel
and
stood
at
the
rear
of
the
crowd
surrounding
it
.
</p>
<p>
The
ball
rolled
;
there
was
a
straining
of
necks
amid
an
intense
silence
;
then
,
as
the
little
pellet
wavered
and
finally
came
to
a
rest
in
the
hole
number
twenty-four
a
fervent
oath
of
disappointment
came
from
some
one
in
front
of
me
.
</p>
<p>
The
next
moment
,
rising
on
tiptoe
to
look
over
the
intervening
shoulders
,
I
found
myself
looking
into
the
white
face
of
my
younger
brother
Harry
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Paul
!
&quot;
he
exclaimed
,
turning
quickly
away
.
</p>
<p>
I
pushed
my
way
through
and
stood
at
his
side
.
There
was
no
sound
from
the
group
of
onlookers
;
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
if
they
hesitated
to
offend
Paul
Lamar
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
My
dear
boy
,
&quot;
said
I
,
&quot;
I
missed
you
at
dinner
.
And
though
this
may
occupy
your
mind
,
it
can
scarcely
fill
your
stomach
.
Have
n't
you
had
enough
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Harry
looked
at
me
.
His
face
was
horribly
pale
and
his
eyes
bloodshot
;
they
could
not
meet
mine
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
For
Heaven
's
sake
,
Paul
,
let
me
alone
,
&quot;
he
said
,
hardly
above
a
whisper
.
&quot;
I
have
lost
ninety
thousand
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
In
spite
of
myself
I
started
.
No
wonder
he
was
pale
!
And
yet
--
</p>
<p>
&quot;
That
's
nothing
,
&quot;
I
whispered
back
.
&quot;
But
you
are
making
a
show
of
yourself
.
Just
now
you
were
swearing
like
a
sailor
.
See
how
your
hand
trembles
!
You
were
not
made
for
this
,
Harry
;
it
makes
you
forget
that
you
're
a
gentleman
.
They
are
laughing
at
you
.
Come
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
But
I
say
I
have
lost
ninety
thousand
dollars
,
&quot;
said
the
boy
,
and
there
was
wildness
in
his
eye
.
&quot;
Let
me
alone
,
Paul
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
will
repay
you
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
No.
Let
me
alone
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Harry
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
say
no
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
His
mouth
was
drawn
tight
and
his
eyes
glared
sullenly
as
those
of
a
stubborn
child
.
Clearly
it
was
impossible
to
get
him
away
without
making
a
scene
,
which
was
unthinkable
.
For
a
moment
I
was
at
a
complete
loss
;
then
the
croupier
's
voice
sounded
suddenly
in
my
ear
:
</p>
<p>
&quot;
You
are
interrupting
us
,
sir
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
I
silenced
him
with
a
glance
and
turned
to
my
brother
,
having
decided
in
an
instant
on
the
only
possible
course
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Here
,
let
me
have
your
chair
.
I
will
get
it
back
for
you
.
Come
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
He
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
in
hesitation
,
then
rose
without
a
word
and
I
took
his
place
.
</p>
<p>
The
thing
was
tiresome
enough
,
but
how
could
I
have
avoided
it
?
The
blood
that
rushes
to
the
head
of
the
gambler
is
certainly
not
food
for
the
intellect
;
and
,
besides
,
I
was
forced
by
circumstances
into
an
heroic
attitude
--
and
nothing
is
more
distasteful
to
a
man
of
sense
.
But
I
had
a
task
before
me
;
if
a
man
lays
bricks
he
should
lay
them
well
;
and
I
do
not
deny
that
there
was
a
stirring
of
my
pulse
as
I
sat
down
.
