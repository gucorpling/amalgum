Get
Along
With
Roommates
in
Your
Apartment
</head>
<p>
Living
with
strangers
,
or
even
friends
,
can
be
challenging
–
especially
if
it
’s
your
first
time
living
away
from
home
.
While
you
can
introduce
a
‘
family
’
atmosphere
to
an
apartment
full
of
strangers
,
it
’s
important
to
realize
that
new
boundaries
apply
.

Respect
each
other
's
property
.
This
may
sound
basic
,
but
there
are
certain
liberties
people
can
take
with
their
own
family
that
they
ca
n’t
with
others
.
While
your
mother
had
an
open
pantry
and
your
siblings
did
n’t
mind
sharing
their
clothes
,
this
may
not
fly
in
an
apartment
arrangement
.
Some
people
are
guarded
of
their
possessions
,
and
rightly
so
.
Establish
the
boundaries
early
–
is
it
acceptable
to
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Persuade_Your_Best_Friend_to_Lend_You_Her_Clothes">
borrow
clothes
</ref>
,
browse
through
each
other
’s
music
collection
,
use
somebody
else
’s
personal
computer
,
etc.

Decide
whether
to
share
food
or
cook
separately
.
Communal
meals
or
dinner
for
one
?
There
are
advantages
to
both
strategies
.

Sharing
food
can
help
you
save
money
because
you
split
the
price
of
dietary
staples
.
However
,
if
you
are
n’t
a
large
eater
you
may
find
yourself
spending
above
your
weight
.
Also
,
settling
on
a
diet
that
everyone
agrees
upon
can
be
difficult
.
</item>
<item>
Cooking
for
yourself
can
be
more
convenient
because
you
only
have
to
please
yourself
.
If
your
roommates
have
boyfriends
or
girlfriends
who
often
hang
around
the
apartment
,
buying
your
own
groceries
wo
n’t
make
you
worry
that
you
’re
supporting
the
food
plan
of
a
‘
significant
other
’
.
Also
,
you
can
eat
on
your
own
time
schedule
and
purchase
whatever
food
you
want
regardless
of
others
’
budgets
.
That
’s
not
to
say
you
ca
n’t
share
certain
foods
though
.
Often
apartment
roommates
share
food
staples
such
as
milk
,
sugar
and
bread
.
If
you
run
out
of
something
,
it
’s
nice
to
have
an
understanding
with
your
roommates
that
you
’re
allowed
to
borrow
something
of
theirs
until
you
replenish
your
stock
.
If
you
all
cook
separately
,
and
at
different
times
,
you
might
consider
arranging
a
weekly
sit-down
meal
together
.
Dining
together
is
one
of
the
easiest
and
most
satisfying
ways
to
bring
people
closer
.

Clean
up
after
yourself
.
If
you
make
a
mess
do
n't
leave
it
for
someone
else
to
look
after
.

Take
your
turn
to
tidy
,
sweep
,
and
mop
the
common
areas
.
If
you
share
a
place
,
you
all
have
equal
responsibility
to
keep
it
clean
.

Make
sure
you
do
your
fair
share
of
household
chores
,
such
as
taking
out
the
trash
and
recycling
,
cleaning
the
washroom
,
and
emptying
the
fridge
of
rotting
food
.

Take
care
in
choosing
your
roommates
.
Living
with
friends
can
either
be
a
very
rewarding
experience
or
a
very
trying
experience
,
depending
on
your
relationship
history
.
Some
of
the
benefits
of
living
with
friends
include
knowing
whether
or
not
they
're
reliable
.
You
have
an
idea
of
their
financial
history
and
whether
you
can
trust
them
to
pay
the
apartment
rent
on
time
.
With
friends
,
you
’re
more
likely
to
have
common
interests
and
even
common
friends
,
which
can
make
your
apartment
more
welcoming
for
visitors
.
However
,
knowing
each
other
well
brings
higher
expectations
,
which
can
sometimes
lead
to
disappointment
.
Often
it
is
better
to
share
an
apartment
with
acquaintances
-
people
you
know
enough
to
trust
–
rather
than
close
friends
.
Seeing
each
other
every
day
might
grate
on
each
other
’s
nerves
and
a
once
strong
friendship
might
quickly
sour
.
You
might
also
find
your
friendship
suffers
because
you
stop
spending
time
together
outside
of
the
apartment
.
</item>
<item>
Trust
your
instincts
when
it
comes
to
living
with
strangers
.
This
type
of
living
arrangement
is
a
good
way
to
expand
your
social
network
,
and
it
also
grants
you
more
independence
to
do
your
own
thing
–
strangers
are
less
likely
to
worry
about
your
comings
and
goings
.
But
if
their
social
skills
or
integrity
are
questionable
,
choose
another
apartment
or
another
roommate
.
Ask
for
personal
references
before
making
a
final
decision
on
a
potential
roommate
.
