On

the

United

(
UN
)
released
its
first-ever
report
for
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Kashmir">

,
highlighting
several
incidents
of
alleged
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Human_rights">
human

</ref>
violations
in
the
last
two
years

of
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir">

The
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian%20Ministry%20of%20External%20Affairs">
Indian
Ministry
of
External
Affairs
</ref>
(
MEA
)
denounced
the
49-page
report
by
the
UN
Office
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High%20Commissioner%20for%20Human%20Rights">
High
Commissioner
for
Human
Rights
</ref>
,
calling
it
&quot;
selective
&quot;
,
&quot;
malicious
&quot;
and
&quot;
fallacious
&quot;
.
The
report
mentions
human
rights
violations
including
torture
,
enforced
disappearances
,
sexual
violations
,
administrative
detention
,
violations
on
the
right
to
health
and
education
,
lack
of
access
to
justice
and
arbitrary
arrests
and
detention
among
others
.

Zeid
Ra'ad
Al
Hussein

,
the
UN
High
Commissioner
for
Human
Rights
,
said
he
would
urge
the
UN
Human
Rights
Council
&quot;
to
consider
establishing
a
Commission
of
Inquiry
to
conduct
a
comprehensive
independent
international
investigation
into
allegations
of
human
rights
violation
in
Kashmir
&quot;
.
Hussein
was
not
granted
permission
,
by
either
India
or
Pakistan
,
to
visit
Kashmir
for
the
report
.
</p>
<p>
Per
the
report
,
Pakistan
was
asked
to
stop
&quot;
misuse
of
anti-terror
legislation
to
persecute
those
engaging
in
peaceful
political
and
civil
activities
and
those
who
express
dissent
.
&quot;
In
July
2016
,
Indian
security
forces
killed
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hizbul%20Mujahideen">
Hizbul
Mujahideen
</ref>
leader
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burhan%20Muzaffar%20Wani">
Burhan
Muzaffar
Wani
</ref>
,
which
led
to
protests
in
the
Kashmir
Valley
.
In
response
to
the
protests
,
Indian
security
forces
fired
metallic
pellets
,
and
their
activities
led
to
human
rights
violation
,
the
UN
report
read
.
It
also
accused
India
of
the
unlawful
killing
of
about
145
civilians
since
2016
.
The
report
asked
India
to
&quot;
fully
respect
the
right
of
self-determination
of
the
people
of
Kashmir
as
protected
under
international
law
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
MEA
issued
a
statement
which
read
:
&quot;
India
rejects
the
report
.
It
is
fallacious
,
tendentious
and
motivated
.
We
question
the
intent
in
bringing
out
such
a
report
.
It
is
a
selective
compilation
of
largely
unverified
information
.
It
is
overtly
prejudiced
and
seeks
to
build
a
false
narrative
.
&quot;
Per
the
constitution
of
Jammu
and
Kashmir
it
&quot;
is
and
shall
be
an
integral
part
of
the
Union
of
India
&quot;
while
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Pakistan">
Pakistan
's
constitution
</ref>
does
not
mention
Azad
Kashmir
or
Gilgit-Baltistan
in
its
territories
,
but
has
a
provision
for
relations
with
Pakistan
subject
to
Jammu
and
Kashmir
people
's
decision
to
acceede
to
Pakistan
.
The
MEA
added
in
their
statement
,
&quot;
Cross-border
terror
and
incitement
are
aimed
at
suppressing
the
will
of
the
people
of
Jammu
&amp;
Kashmir
,
disrupting
its
political
and
social
fabric
and
undermining
India
's
integrity
&quot;
.
</p>
<p>
Unlike
India
,
the
report
was
welcomed
by
Pakistan
.
In
a
press
release
,
the
Foreign
Office
said
Pakistan
&quot;
welcomes
the
proposal
by
the
UN
High
Commissioner
for
Human
Rights
to
establish
a
Commission
of
Inquiry
for
[
an
]
international
investigation
into
human
rights
violations
&quot;
in
Indian-held
Kashmir
.
</p>
<p>
Directing
towards
Indian
authorities
,
the
report
asked
to
&quot;
urgently
repeal
the
Armed
Forces
(
Jammu
and
Kashmir
)
Special
Powers
Act
,
1990
;
and
,
in
the
meantime
,
immediately
remove
the
requirement
for
prior
central
government
permission
to
prosecute
security
forces
personnel
accused
of
human
rights
violations
in
civilian
courts
&quot;
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
The
report
violates
India
's
sovereignty
and
territorial
integrity
.
The
entire
state
of
Jammu
and
Kashmir
is
an
integral
part
of
India
.
Pakistan
is
in
illegal
and
forcible
occupation
of
a
part
of
the
Indian
state
through
aggression
.
We
have
repeatedly
called
upon
Pakistan
to
vacate
the
occupied
territories
.
The
incorrect
description
of
Indian
territory
in
the
report
is
mischievous
,
misleading
and
unacceptable
.
There
are
no
entities
such
as
'
Azad
Jammu
and
Kashmir
'
and
'
Gilgit-Baltistan
'
&quot;
,
India
's
External
Affairs
ministry
said
in
their
statement
.

<p>
The
report
was
welcomed
by
some
activists
and
leaders
in
Kashmir
.
Jammu
and
Kashmir
human
rights
activist
Khurram
Parvez
welcomed
the
UN
report

People
of

thank
the
U.N.

</p>
<p>
The
Kashmir-conflict
between
India
and
Pakistan
has
led
to
two
wars
since
their
independence
in
1947
.
Between
1990
and
2017
,
there
have
been
about
69,820
militancy-related
incidents
in
Jammu
and
Kashmir
,
and
more
than
41
thousand
people
were
killed
.
In
2017
,
there
were
over
800
ceasefire
violations
along
the
heavily-militarised
Line
of
Control
in
Kashmir
between
India
and
Pakistan
.
