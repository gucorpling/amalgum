CO2
Sequestration
Options
</head>
<p>
There
are
various
studies
devoted
to
the
analysis
of
the
considered
sequestration
options
.
Singh
et
al.
analyzed
different
power
generation
options
(
coal
and
natural
gas
)
with
and
without
CCS
.
The
results
showed
that
despite
the
reduction
in
CO2
emissions
,
fossil-fuel-based
energy
generation
is
associated
with
other
negative
environmental
impacts
that
must
be
taken
into
account
.
Significant
reduction
in
CO2
emission
was
confirmed
by
Akash
et
al.
;
however
,
this
study
also
showed
that
the
use
of
CCS
in
power
generation
affects
construction
expenditure
,
and
consequently
,
the
cost
of
electricity
caused
by
the
lack
of
additional
economic
effects
.
Odenberger
et
al.
showed
that
various
CCS
options
(
offshore
and
onshore
storage
)
could
have
a
significant
impact
on
the
development
of
energy
in
Europe
in
the
coming
decades
.
However
,
it
is
noted
that
CCS
has
serious
competition
from
alternative
low
carbon
energy
generation
options
.
Moreover
,
Pihkola
et
al.
concluded
that
CO2
utilization
may
become
a
more
attractive
option
for
industry
,
despite
the
potential
for
CCS
to
take
a
certain
position
in
the
energy
strategy
of
Finland
.

An
analysis
of
the
current
CCUS-enhanced
oil
recovery
(
EOR
)
status
in
China
was
carried
out
by
Zhen
and
Lijiao
.
It
was
concluded
that
CCUS-EOR
is
the
optimal
CO2
sequestration
option
for
China
;
however
,
its
further
development
requires
careful
state
regulation
.
The
economic
assessment
of
CCUS-enhanced
coalbed
methane
(
ECBM
)
technology
was
carried
out
by
Yu
et
al.
.
The
authors
identified
key
factors
that
have
the
most
significant
impact
on
the
economic
efficiency
of
such
projects
.
An
approach
to
assessing
the
technical
and
economic
efficiency
of
CCUS-ECBM
projects
is
proposed
by
Kim
et
al.
.
The
results
showed
that
coalbed
methane
can
become
a
serious
competitor
to
a
natural
gas
.
An
assessment
of
the
efficiency
of
geothermal
energy
production
(
GEP
)
using
CCUS
was
carried
out
by
Buscheck
et
al.
.
However
,
because
of
the
early
stage
of
CCUS-GEP
development
,
further
research
in
this
area
is
required
to
confirm
the
economic
value
of
such
projects
.
</p>
<p>
Different
CCU
options
were
evaluated
by
Schlögl
et
al.
.
A
visible
emphasis
is
placed
on
the
need
to
improve
the
regulation
system
of
CO2-based
industries
,
which
is
also
confirmed
by
other
studies
.
The
business
model
for
power-to-methanol
(
combined
CCU
and
renewable
energy
technologies
)
projects
was
proposed
by
González-Aparicio
et
al.
.
Economic
assessment
showed
that
this
combination
may
become
a
so-called
“
win-win
”
solution
,
which
could
be
competitive
in
the
energy
market
.
The
study
by
Muthuraj
and
Mekonnen
showed
the
results
of
a
technology
readiness
level
assessment
for
CO2-based
co-polymers
and
polymers
blend
(
CCU
)
manufacturing
.
The
authors
noted
that
these
technologies
are
at
an
early
stage
of
development
;
however
,
in
the
near
future
they
could
be
used
in
many
areas
,
including
the
processing
of
plastic
wastes
.
Chauvy
et
al.
also
described
the
assessment
of
various
CCU
technology
readiness
levels
and
a
novel
method
for
selecting
optimal
short-
and
medium-term
CCU
options
.
</p>
<p>
Cuéllar-Franca
and
Azapagic
analyzed
27
studies
related
to
CCS
,
CCUS
,
and
CCU
to
compare
the
environmental
impact
of
each
option
.
The
authors
concluded
that
the
positive
global
warming
mitigation
potential
of
CCU
is
much
higher
than
CCS
and
CCUS
.
At
the
same
time
,
the
negative
environmental
impacts
of
CCS
and
CCUS
(
acidification
,
eutrophication
,
toxicity
potential
)
are
much
higher
compared
to
most
CCU
technologies
.
Zhang
et
al.
proposed
a
roadmap
for
the
implementation
of
various
CO2
sequestration
options
in
China
.
The
authors
concluded
that
the
most
effective
options
for
the
Chinese
economy
are
CCUS-EOR
and
onshore
saline
aquifers
.
The
study
by
Li
et
al.
was
also
devoted
to
China
and
showed
that
large-scale
deployment
of
sequestration
technologies
will
require
significant
improvements
in
regulatory
frameworks
.
</p>
<p>
Viebahn
et
al.
described
an
ecological
and
economic
assessment
of
CCS
(
offshore
and
onshore
)
and
CCUS-ECBM
development
potential
.
The
results
showed
that
the
success
of
sequestration
projects
significantly
depends
on
the
successful
experience
of
developed
countries
in
this
area
.
There
are
also
a
number
of
constraints
,
such
as
the
high
cost
of
technology
,
competition
from
renewable
energy
,
and
the
long-term
implementation
period
.
Another
study
by
the
same
authors
was
based
on
the
same
methodology
but
aimed
at
China
,
and
also
included
CCUS-EGR
and
CCUS-EOR
.
Key
factors
for
the
successful
deployment
of
such
projects
are
the
presence
of
state
support
,
as
well
as
improvement
of
the
methodology
for
assessing
CO2
storage
potential
.
The
relevance
of
such
studies
was
also
noted
by
Peck
et
al.
,
who
showed
a
number
of
decision
points
that
help
to
determine
optimal
methods
of
CO2-EOR
storage
capacity
estimation
.
The
valuation
of
CCS
and
CCUS
was
carried
out
by
Wilberforce
et
al.
.
The
results
showed
that
despite
the
significant
pace
of
development
,
as
well
as
government
support
,
such
projects
still
have
limited
competitiveness
in
the
energy
market
.
