<p>
I
have
always
been
dumb
to
what
is
impossible
.
So
I
just
figure
how
to
do
the
“
impossible
.
”
I
have
been
doing
this
all
my
life
!
I
am
61
.
I
was
born
with
cerebral
palsy
.
I
communicate
using
a
laser-pointer
and
a
board
of
letters
,
numbers
and
commonly-used
words
.
But
I
am
the
host
of
a
popular
public
access
TALK
show
.
Go
figure
it
!
So
now
I
am
setting
my
sights
,
as
president
,
on
eliminating
poverty
,
hunger
,
war
,
etc.
Impossible
,
eh
?
</p>
<p>
When
I
was
born
,
doctors
told
my
parents
that
I
had
no
intelligence
,
that
I
had
no
future
,
that
I
would
be
best
put
into
an
institution
and
be
forgotten
.
So
the
struggle
for
freedom
,
and
against
the
powers-that-be
has
been
my
life
.
And
it
has
been
a
continuous
struggle
,
struggling
with
schools
to
let
me
in
,
etc.
I
have
always
been
a
radical
.
But
that
became
obvious
when
I
was
18
and
invented
my
head
pointer
with
which
I
type
and
communicate…I
started
writing
political
columns
for
the
high
school
paper…as
well
as
putting
out
an
underground
paper
.
I
was
in
the
first
special
class
placed
on
a
regular
high
school
campus
so
that
the
disabled
students
could
be
in
regular
classes
and
be
a
part
of
campus
life
.
I
was
involved
in
the
civil
rights
and
anti-war
movements
.
This
was
1965…before
it
was
popular
to
be
against
the
Vietnam
War
.
In
the
school
paper
I
got
into
a
debate
with
a
GI
in
Vietnam
.
I
was
sat
down
and
told
that
,
because
of
my
political
philosophy
and
activities
,
I
was
hurting
the
chances
of
the
disabled
students
who
would
come
after
me
.
I
replied
that
the
goal
was
to
get
the
rights
for
the
disabled
[
and
for
all
people
]
to
be
complete
and
equal…and
that
included
the
right
to
be
political
.
I
would
not
surrender
that
,
or
any
other
,
right
.
</p>
<p>
So
I
started
doing
political
columns
for
underground
newspapers
,
joined
Students
for
Democratic
Society
.
Did
political
pranks…such
as
rolling
in
my
wheelchair
into
the
Marines
Recruiting
Office
to
join
,
offering
to
push
the
BUTTON
with
my
head
pointer
.
But
after
the
Kent
State
killings
,
I
switched
from
straight
politics
to
art
,
performance
,
and
community
building
as
my
tools
for
effecting
social
change
.
In
the
early
90s
I
and
five
other
performance
artists
were
targeted
by
Sen.
Jesse
Helms
in
what
is
commonly
seen
as
the
first
battle
of
the
cultural
wars
.
This
placed
me
in
a
great
position
to
fight
for
our
freedoms
!

<hi rend="bold">
What
is
your
current
job
?
What
skills
or
ideas
do
you
bring
from
this
position
,
or
previous
positions
,
that
will
benefit
the
Oval
Office
?

<p>
“
Artist
”
covers
a
lot
of
different
“
jobs”…and
“
performance
artist
”
is
even
vaguer
!
I
am
a
performance
artist
.
I
work
outside
boxes
,
using
improvisation
to
draw
people
into
the
state
of
community
where
they
can
reach
their
potential
.
This
is
what
I
will
do
as
President
.
