The
two
of
you
train
together
all
the
time
?
</p>
<p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Eric
Bickerton
:
</hi>
Pretty
well
,
yes
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Jessica
Gallagher
:
</hi>
Yes
,
everything
on
snow
basically
is
together
.
One
of
the
difficult
things
I
guess
is
we
have
to
have
that
100
per
cent
communication
and
trust
between
one
another
and
a
lot
of
the
female
skiers
on
the
circuit
,
their
guide
is
their
husband
.
That
's
kind
of
a
trust
relationship
.
Eric
does
say
that
at
times
it
feels
like
we
're
married
,
but
...
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Eric
Bickerton
:
</hi>
I
keep
checking
for
my
wallet
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Jessica
Gallagher
:
</hi>
...
it
's
always
about
constantly
trying
to
continue
to
build
that
relationship
so
that
eventually
I
just
...
You
put
your
life
in
his
hands
and
whatever
he
says
,
you
do
,
kind
of
thing
.

Of
the
two
sport
,
winter
sports
and
summer
sports
person
,
how
do
you
find
that
balance
between
one
sport
and
the
other
sport
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Jessica
Gallagher
:
</hi>
It
's
not
easy
.
Yeah
,
it
's
not
easy
at
all
.
Yesterday
was
my
first
day
on
snow
since
March
16
,
2010
.
And
that
was
mainly
because
of
the
build
up
obviously
for
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/2012_Summer_Paralympics">
London
</ref>
and
the
times
when
I
was
going
to
ski
I
was
injured
.
So
,
to
not
have
skied
for
that
long
is
obviously
a
huge
disadvantage
when
all
the
girls
have
been
racing
the
circuit
since
...
and
it
's
vice
versa
with
track
and
field
.
So
I
've
got
an
amazing
team
at
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Victoria,_Australia">
Victorian
</ref>
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian%20Institute%20of%20Sport">
Institute
of
Sport
</ref>
.
I
call
them
my
little
A
Team
of
strength
and
mission
coach
,
<ref target="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/physiotherapist">
physio
</ref>
,
<ref target="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/osteopath">
osteopath
</ref>
,
soft
tissue
therapist
,
sport
psychologist
,
dietician
.
Basically
everyone
has
expertise
in
the
area
and
we
come
together
and
having
meetings
and
plan
four
years
ahead
and
say
at
the
moment
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/2014_Winter_Paralympics">
Sochi
</ref>
'
s
the
goal
,
but
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/2016_Summer_Paralympics">
Rio
</ref>
'
s
still
in
the
back
of
the
head
,
and
knowing
my
body
so
well
now
that
I
've
done
both
sports
for
five
years
means
that
I
can
know
where
they
've
made
mistakes
,
and
I
know
where
things
have
gone
really
well
,
so
we
can
plan
ahead
for
that
and
prepare
so
that
the
things
that
did
go
wrong
wo
n't
happen
again
.
To
make
sure
that
I
get
to
each
competition
in
peak
tone
.

What
things
went
wrong
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Jessica
Gallagher
:
</hi>
Mainly
injuries
.
So
,
that
's
the
most
difficult
thing
with
doing
two
sports
.
Track
and
field
is
an
explosive
power
;
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/long%20jump">
long
jump
</ref>
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/javelin%20throw">
javelin
</ref>
are
over
four
to
six
seconds
of
maximum
effort
.
Ski
racing
,
you
are
on
a
course
,
for
a
minute
to
a
minute
and
a
half
,
so
it
's
a
speed
endurance
event
.
And
the
two
could
n't
be
further
apart
in
terms
of
the
capabilities
and
the
capacities
that
you
need
as
an
athlete
.
So
one
of
the
big
things
I
guess
,
after
the
Vancouver
campaign
,
being
in
ski
boots
for
so
long
,
I
had
lost
a
lot
of
muscle
from
my
calves
so
they
were
n't
actually
firing
properly
,
and
when
you
're
trying
to
run
and
jump
and
you
do
n't
have
half
of
your
leg
working
properly
it
makes
it
pretty
difficult
to
jump
a
good
distance
.
Those
kind
of
things
.
So
I
'm
skiing
now
but
when
I
'm
in
a
gym
doing
recovery
and
rehab
or
prehab
stuff
,
I
've
got
calf
raising
,
I
've
got
hamstring
exercises
because
I
know
they
're
the
weaker
areas
that
if
I
'm
not
working
on
at
the
moment
they
're
two
muscle
groups
that
do
n't
get
worked
during
ski
.
That
I
need
to
do
the
extra
stuff
on
the
side
so
that
when
I
transition
back
to
track
and
field
I
do
n't
have
any
soft
tissue
injuries
like
strains
because
of
the
fact
that
I
know
they
're
weaker
so
