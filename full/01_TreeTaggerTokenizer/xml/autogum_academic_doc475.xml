Introduction

<p>
Proteases
are
associated
with
many
signaling
biological
pathways
,
and
it
is
has
been
proven
that
the
number
of
diseases
like
cancer
,
HIV
,
infectious
diseases
,
and
diabetes
are
treated
by
inhibiting
proteases
.
Pharmaceutical
companies
develop
commercial
drugs
to
inhibit
aspartyl
proteases
,
serine
proteases
,
and
cysteine
proteases
.
Among
several
protease
inhibitors
,
serine
protease
inhibitors
received
significant
interest
in
various
applications
focused
mainly
in
therapeutics
.
Serine
protease
inhibitors
shown
in
Table
1
,
are
used
in
treating
diseases
like
immune-related
disorders
,
inflammatory
,
respiratory
,
AIDS
,
neurodegenerative
,
and
metabolic
disorders
.
</p>
<p>
Features
like
therapeutic
potential
,
good
binding
affinity
,
low
toxicity
,
and
quickly
cleavable
by
proteolytic
enzymes
,
make
cyclic
peptides
potential
future
therapeutics
.
Most
of
the
cyclic
peptides
approved
by
the
FDA
(
shown
in
Table
2
)
are
used
in
bacterial
and
fungal
infections
,
oncology
drugs
,
gastrointestinal
disorders
,
and
anemia
.
Recently
,
cyclic
peptides
were
proven
to
inhibit
HIV-1
protease
(
aspartyl
proteases
)
and
elastase
,
shedding
light
onto
the
use
of
cyclic
peptides
as
protease
inhibitors
.
</p>
<p>
Phage
display
technology
,
Incretin-based
cyclic
peptide
,
cyclic
peptides
from
mRNA
display
,
and
split-pool
synthesis
are
some
of
the
tools
used
to
develop
cyclic
peptide
compounds
.
Recently
computer-aided
drug
design
technologies
like
molecular
docking
simulations
are
applied
to
identify
,
design
rationally
(
called
as
de
novo
developed
)
,
and
develop
cyclic
peptide
ligand
as
leads
to
therapeutic
drug
targets
of
interest
.
Till
today
,
cyclic
peptides
as
therapeutics
in
regulating
glucose
metabolism
by
inhibiting
proteases
have
not
been
reported
for
the
treatment
of
diabetes
mellitus
.
</p>
<p>
In
Mexico
,
approximately
11.5
million
people
live
with
diabetes
mellitus
(
DM
)
,
which
is
the
main
leading
cause
of
acquired
blindness
,
non-traumatic
lower-limb
amputations
,
and
chronic
kidney
failure
diseases
.
Human
dipeptidyl
peptidase-4
(
DPP4
)
is
a
serine
protease
,
well
known
FDA-approved
therapeutic
drug
target
for
regulating
blood
glucose
metabolism
and
treating
diabetes
mellitus
.
Sitagliptin
,
Vildagliptin
,
Anagliptin
,
Saxagliptin
,
and
Alogliptin
are
the
main
clinically
used
chemicals
for
human
dipeptidyl
peptidase-4
(
DPP4
)
inhibition
despite
their
side
effects
as
pancreatitis
,
nausea
,
and
anemia
.
It
is
well
known
that
incretin
hormones
glucagon-like
peptide
1
(
GLP-1
)
and
glucose-dependent
insulinotropic
polypeptide
(
GIP
)
are
responsible
for
insulin
release
and
glucose
regulation
.
These
hormones
are
inactivated
by
a
serine
protease
human
dipeptidyl
peptidase-4
(
DPP4
)
.
Since
natural
cyclic
peptides
are
proven
to
inhibit
various
proteases
,
and
to
consider
the
beneficial
aspects
of
cyclic
peptides
in
comparison
to
small
chemicals
,
like
less
toxicity
,
no
accumulation
in
organs
,
and
rapid
degradation
of
peptides
,
we
hypothesized
that
cyclic
peptides
from
natural
sources
could
be
an
alternative
source
of
therapeutics
to
inhibit
serine
protease
DPP4
for
treatment
of
diabetes
mellitus
.
</p>
<p>
Among
various
naturally
occurring
cyclic
peptides
,
oxytocin
(
natural
cyclic
peptide
)
was
chosen
in
this
study
to
prove
our
hypothesis
that
,
cyclic
peptides
possess
serine
protease
inhibition
activity
,
and
specifically
inhibit
DPP4
.
To
demonstrate
our
hypothesis
,
activity
atlas
and
field-based
models
of
DPP4
inhibitors
from
natural
origin
were
utilized
to
elucidate
molecular
insights
of
oxytocin
peptide
into
DPP4
inhibition
.
In
addition
,
molecular
docking
simulations
were
used
to
understand
the
binding
poses
and
interacting
residues
responsible
for
inhibitory
activity
.
Also
,
the
stability
of
water
molecules
at
the
binding
site
of
oxytocin
was
studied
using
3D
reference
interaction
site
model
(
3D-RISM
)
to
gain
deep
insights
into
the
binding
of
the
cyclic
peptide
at
DPP4
druggable
region
.
Finally
,
fluorescence
assay
was
used
to
demonstrate
the
potential
role
of
oxytocin
as
a
DPP4
inhibitor
experimentally
.
