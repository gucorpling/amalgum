Wikinews
:
Does
the
&quot;
mensalão
&quot;
continue
?
<p>
Ricardo
Lobo
:
Not
in
the
exact
manner
it
was
managed
before
,
however
I
believe
that
it
still
exists
.
The
election
of
Aldo
[
Aldo
Rebelo
(
PCdoB
)
]
for
the
Presidency
of
Congress
is
an
example
.
</p>
Wikinews
:
Do
you
believe
Lula
did
know
about
the
mensalão
?
<p>
Ricardo
Lobo
:
Certainly
he
knew
and
he
is
part
of
the
ruling
and
creation
of
the
scheme
.
Otherwise
he
will
enter
to
History
as
the
most
ignorant
among
all
of
the
Brazilian
presidents
.
</p>
Wikinews
:
What
was
the
role
of
the
ex-minister
and
deputy
José
Dirceu
,
in
you
opinion
?
<p>
Ricardo
Lobo
:
Operator
,
chief
of
government
and
chief
of
its
strategies
.
He
and
Lula
created
the
scheme
of
&quot;
mensalão
&quot;
.
He
,
Lula
,
Hugo
Chávez
and
Fidel
Castro
created
a
scheme
to
turn
out
South
America
as
a
huge
continent
for
the
world-wide
left
.
The
first
step
was
Lula
in
Brazil
,
next
Evo
Morales
in
Bolivia
,
and
so
on
.
Jose
Dirceu
was
a
part
of
that
.
</p>
Wikinews
:
Do
you
think
that
the
corruption
scandal
will
end
&quot;
much
ado
about
nothing
&quot;
or
&quot;
pizza
&quot;
as
it
is
said
in
Brazil
?
<p>
Ricardo
Lobo
:
Actually
there
are
a
lot
of
&quot;
pizzas
&quot;
.
One
has
already
being
served
:
the
Vote
Buying
CPI
.
They
are
still
trying
to
serve
the
others
.
But
I
think
that
it
will
end
in
nothing
;
they
,
the
politicians
,
are
very
cooperative
with
each
other
.
</p>
<p>
Ricardo
Lobo
:
They
[
the
deputies
]
know
that
their
days
are
numbered
,
mainly
the
ones
from
big
cities
.
As
for
the
ones
from
provincial
and
small
cities
;
they
do
n't
even
know
what
a
computer
is
and
they
did
n't
realize
the
severity
of
the
problem
.
They
think
that
if
their
name
did
n't
appear
in
the
newspaper
,
their
names
are
not
in
any
place
.
Perhaps
I
'll
create
a
site
closer
to
the
elections
,
when
I
will
put
the
names
of
all
incompetent
ones
from
the
National
Congress
.
</p>
Wikinews
:
What
will
end
in
nothing
?
The
investigations
or
the
scandal
?
<p>
Ricardo
Lobo
:
The
investigations
will
continue
until
an
acceptable
limit
is
reached
by
the
major
parties
:
the
Workers
Party
and
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian%20Social%20Democracy%20Party">
Social
Democracy
Party
</ref>
.
Then
they
must
stop
when
it
is
&quot;
enough
&quot;
for
the
population
.

Wikinews
:
In
the
streets
,
how
do
ordinary
Brazilian
people
see
this
issue
?
<p>
Ricardo
Lobo
:
Everybody
is
disappointed
because
people
thought
that
everything
(
corruption
,
politicians
etc
)
would
change
.
And
it
really
changed
,
but
for
the
worse
.
The
amateur
behaviour
of
the
communications
team
of
President
Lula
contributed
very
much
to
this
also
;
it
lacked
professionalism
.
</p>
Wikinews
:
Are
the
people
who
live
in
Brasilia
too
upset
?
<p>
Ricardo
Lobo
:
Nobody
gets
very
upset
about
the
government
in
Brasilia
.
Most
of
the
town
population
works
for
the
federal
government
,
so
this
is
a
unique
city
,
really
.
And
it
is
beautiful
.
