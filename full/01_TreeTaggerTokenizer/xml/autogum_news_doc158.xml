<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic%20Republic%20News%20Agency">
IRNA
</ref>
news
agency
that
helicopters
were
unable
to

The
plane
took
off
at
about

on
Sunday
from
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Iran">
Iranian
</ref>
capital
,
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Tehran">
Tehran
</ref>
,
on
Aseman
Airlines
route
EP3704
to
Yasuj
,
in
the
southwest
of
the
country
.
It
vanished
from
controllers
'
radar
screens
at
about
8:52
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%20Time">
local
time
</ref>
,
0522UTC
,
and
there
were
reports
from
people
in
the
area
of
Samirom
,
about
14miles
(
22km
)
from
its
destination
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isfahan%20Province">
Isfahan
Province
</ref>
,
of
seeing
it
attempting
an
emergency
landing
in
a
pasture
and
of
hearing
the
crash
.
Hundreds
of
searchers
organized
by
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Red_Crescent">
Red
Crescent
</ref>
and
using
drones
and
dogs
combed
the
mountainous
terrain
but
were
hampered
by
windy
,
foggy
conditions
and
heavy
snow
.
The
search
had
to
be
suspended
on
Sunday
.
It
resumed
at
dawn
on
Monday
but
weather
then
forced
grounding
the
helicopters
.
At
one
point
on
Monday
local
officials
announced
searchers
had
found
the
wreckage
,
only
to
have
the
national
civil
aviation
agency
and
the
Red
Crescent
indicate
the
statement
had
been
premature
.
A
demonstration
was
reported
by
more
than
100people
outside
a
Dena
Kooh
government
office
,
demanding
resignations
.
</p>
<p>
The
plane
reportedly
had
a
crew
of
six
—
a
pilot
and
a
co-pilot
,
two
flight
attendants
,
and
two
security
guards
—
and
59
passengers
,
one
of
them
a
child
.
A
man
who
recounted
missing
the
flight
told
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabnak">
Tabnak
</ref>
news
site
&quot;
God
has
been
really
kind
to
me
&quot;
,
expressing
his
sadness
over
those
who
had
died
.
</p>
<p>
The
aircraft
was
24
years
old
.
Aseman
Airlines
,
Iran
's
third
largest
air
carrier
and
owned
by
the
national
civil
service
pension
foundation
,
said
it
had
been
in
storage
for
seven
years
before
recently
being
placed
in
operation
again
.
Iran
's
aircraft
are
aging
and
the
country
has
been
prevented
from
buying
spare
parts
by
international
sanctions
imposed
in
response
to
its
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear%20program%20of%20Iran">
nuclear
program
</ref>
.
Those
sanctions
were
to
be
lifted
under
an
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint%20Comprehensive%20Plan%20of%20Action">
agreement
from
2015
</ref>
,
and
Iranian
airlines
,
including
Aseman
,
have
ordered
new
planes
from
both
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Airbus">
Airbus
</ref>
and
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Boeing">
Boeing
</ref>
.
However
,
since
becoming
US
President
,
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">
Donald
Trump
</ref>
has
declined
to
recertify
the
agreement
.
</p>
<p>
There
have
been
a
number
of
serious
Iranian
air
accidents
in
modern
times
.
In
2011
,
at
least
77
people
died
when

during
an

.
</p>
<p>
The
pilot
in
the
current
crash
,
Captain
Hojjatallah
Foulad
,
successfully
landed
an
ATR
72
at
the
airport
in
Yasuj
in
2013
after
one
of
the
engines
failed
.
