<p>
At
the
entrance
to
the
street
the
wind
still
raged
and
the
road
was
thickly
covered
with
snow
,
but
well
within
the
village
it
was
calm
,
warm
,
and
cheerful
.
At
one
house
a
dog
was
barking
,
at
another
a
woman
,
covering
her
head
with
her
coat
,
came
running
from
somewhere
and
entered
the
door
of
a
hut
,
stopping
on
the
threshold
to
have
a
look
at
the
passing
sledge
.
In
the
middle
of
the
village
girls
could
be
heard
singing
.
</p>
<p>
Here
in
the
village
there
seemed
to
be
less
wind
and
snow
,
and
the
frost
was
less
keen
.
</p>
<p>
‘
Why
,
this
is
Grishkino
,
’
said
Vasili
Andreevich
.
</p>
<p>
‘
So
it
is
,
’
responded
Nikita
.
</p>
<p>
It
really
was
Grishkino
,
which
meant
that
they
had
gone
too
far
to
the
left
and
had
travelled
some
six
miles
,
not
quite
in
the
direction
they
aimed
at
,
but
towards
their
destination
for
all
that
.
</p>
<p>
From
Grishkino
to
Goryachkin
was
about
another
four
miles
.
</p>
<p>
In
the
middle
of
the
village
they
almost
ran
into
a
tall
man
walking
down
the
middle
of
the
street
.
</p>
<p>
‘
Who
are
you
?
’
shouted
the
man
,
stopping
the
horse
,
and
recognizing
Vasili
Anereevich
he
immediately
took
hold
of
the
shaft
,
went
along
it
hand
over
hand
till
he
reached
the
sledge
,
and
placed
himself
on
the
driver
’s
seat
.
</p>
<p>
He
was
Isay
,
a
peasant
of
Vasili
Andreevich
’s
acquaintance
,
and
well
known
as
the
principal
horse-thief
in
the
district
.
</p>
<p>
‘
Ah
,
Vasili
Andreevich
!
Where
are
you
off
to
?
’
said
Isay
,
enveloping
Nikita
in
the
odour
of
the
vodka
he
had
drunk
.
</p>
<p>
‘
We
were
going
to
Goryachkin
.
’
</p>
<p>
‘
And
look
where
you
’ve
got
to
!
You
should
have
gone
through
Molchanovka
.
’
</p>
<p>
‘
Should
have
,
but
did
n’t
manage
it
,
’
said
Vasili
Andreevich
,
holding
in
the
horse
.
</p>
<p>
‘
That
’s
a
good
horse
,
’
said
Isay
,
with
a
shrewd
glance
at
Mukhorty
,
and
with
a
practised
hand
he
tightened
the
loosened
knot
high
in
the
horse
’s
bushy
tail
.
</p>
<p>
‘
Are
you
going
to
stay
the
night
?
’
</p>
<p>
‘
No
,
friend
.
I
must
get
on
.
’
</p>
<p>
‘
Your
business
must
be
pressing
.
And
who
is
this
?
Ah
,
Nikita
Stepanych
!
’
</p>
<p>
‘
Who
else
?
’
replied
Nikita
.
‘
But
I
say
,
good
friend
,
how
are
we
to
avoid
going
astray
again
?
’
</p>
<p>
‘
Where
can
you
go
astray
here
?
Turn
back
straight
down
the
street
and
then
when
you
come
out
keep
straight
on
.
Do
n’t
take
to
the
left
.
You
will
come
out
onto
the
high
road
,
and
then
turn
to
the
right
.
’
</p>
<p>
‘
And
where
do
we
turn
off
the
high
road
?
As
in
summer
,
or
the
winter
way
?
’
asked
Nikita
.
</p>
<p>
‘
The
winter
way
.
As
soon
as
you
turn
off
you
’ll
see
some
bushes
,
and
opposite
them
there
is
a
way-mark
--
a
large
oak
,
one
with
branches
--
and
that
’s
the
way
.
’
</p>
<p>
Vasili
Andreevich
turned
the
horse
back
and
drove
through
the
outskirts
of
the
village
.
</p>
<p>
‘
Why
not
stay
the
night
?
’
Isay
shouted
after
them
.
</p>
<p>
But
Vasili
Andreevich
did
not
answer
and
touched
up
the
horse
.
Four
miles
of
good
road
,
two
of
which
lay
through
the
forest
,
seemed
easy
to
manage
,
especially
as
the
wind
was
apparently
quieter
and
the
snow
had
stopped
.
</p>
<p>
Having
driven
along
the
trodden
village
street
,
darkened
here
and
there
by
fresh
manure
,
past
the
yard
where
the
clothes
hung
out
and
where
the
white
shirt
had
broken
loose
and
was
now
attached
only
by
one
frozen
sleeve
,
they
again
came
within
sound
of
the
weird
moan
of
the
willows
,
and
again
emerged
on
the
open
fields
.
The
storm
,
far
from
ceasing
,
seemed
to
have
grown
yet
stronger
.
The
road
was
completely
covered
with
drifting
snow
,
and
only
the
stakes
showed
that
they
had
not
lost
their
way
.
But
even
the
stakes
ahead
of
them
were
not
easy
to
see
,
since
the
wind
blew
in
their
faces
.
</p>
<p>
Vasili
Andreevich
screwed
up
his
eyes
,
bent
down
his
head
,
and
looked
out
for
the
way-marks
,
but
trusted
mainly
to
the
horse
’s
sagacity
,
letting
it
take
its
own
way
.
And
the
horse
really
did
not
lose
the
road
but
followed
its
windings
,
turning
now
to
the
right
and
now
to
the
left
and
sensing
it
under
his
feet
,
so
that
though
the
snow
fell
thicker
and
the
wind
strengthened
they
still
continued
to
see
way-marks
now
to
the
left
and
now
to
the
right
of
them
.
</p>
<p>
So
they
travelled
on
for
about
ten
minutes
,
when
suddenly
,
through
the
slanting
screen
of
wind-driven
snow
,
something
black
showed
up
which
moved
in
front
of
the
horse
.
</p>
<p>
This
was
another
sledge
with
fellow-travellers
.
Mukhorty
overtook
them
,
and
struck
his
hoofs
against
the
back
of
the
sledge
in
front
of
them
.
</p>
<p>
‘
Pass
on
...
hey
there
...
get
in
front
!
’
cried
voices
from
the
sledge
.
</p>
<p>
Vasili
Andreevich
swerved
aside
to
pass
the
other
sledge
.
</p>
<p>
In
it
sat
three
men
and
a
woman
,
evidently
visitors
returning
from
a
feast
.
One
peasant
was
whacking
the
snow-covered
croup
of
their
little
horse
with
a
long
switch
,
and
the
other
two
sitting
in
front
waved
their
arms
and
shouted
something
.
The
woman
,
completely
wrapped
up
and
covered
with
snow
,
sat
drowsing
and
bumping
at
the
back
.
</p>
<p>
‘
Who
are
you
?
’
shouted
Vasili
Andreevich
.
</p>
<p>
‘
From
A-a-a
...
’
was
all
that
could
be
heard
.
</p>
<p>
‘
I
say
,
where
are
you
from
?
’
</p>
<p>
‘
From
A-a-a-a
!
’
one
of
the
peasants
shouted
with
all
his
might
,
but
still
it
was
impossible
to
make
out
who
they
were
.
</p>
<p>
‘
Get
along
!
Keep
up
!
’
shouted
another
,
ceaselessly
beating
his
horse
with
the
switch
.
</p>
<p>
‘
So
you
’re
from
a
feast
,
it
seems
?
’
</p>
<p>
‘
Go
on
,
go
on
!
Faster
,
Simon
!
Get
in
front
!
Faster
!
’
</p>
