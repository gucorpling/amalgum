The
sad
thing
is
-
the
American
people
are
losing
in
this
battle
.
Republicans
are
fighting
against
government
interference
in
business
;
Democrats
are
(
or
should
be
)
fighting
against
business
interference
in
government
.
Ultimately
,
though
,
special
interests
are
pumping
so
much
money
into
the
political
scene
that
it
seems
the
voice
of
the
People
is
lost
in
the
noise
of
business
.
</p>
<p>
It
seems
that
the
media
-
especially
the
television
media
-
have
long
ago
figured
out
that
the
way
to
make
their
businesses
work
(
which
,
being
commercial
entities
,
they
must
,
of
course
,
do
as
well
as
they
can
)
requires
ratings
.
Ratings
require
getting
people
to
watch
.
Getting
people
to
watch
requires
controversy
.
And
so
,
people
like
Glenn
Beck
-
among
many
others
-
rise
to
become
stars
,
because
they
can
get
ratings
,
which
ultimately
boil
down
to
money
.
The
problem
is
that
truth
and
compromise
are
boring
,
but
exaggeration
and
controversy
are
exciting
.

When
I
saw
the
thread
on
Fark
,
where
one
of
the
posters
,
in
a
thread
about
Sarah
Palin
announcing
her
support
for
Glenn
Beck
,
said
,
&quot;
Why
have
n't
we
had
an
official
response
to
the
rumor
that
Glenn
Beck
raped
and
murdered
a
girl
in
1990
?
&quot;
--
I
did
n't
think
too
much
of
the
post
by
itself
;
but
in
the
thread
,
it
immediately
took
off
.
A
bunch
of
people
ran
with
it
and
it
became
a
hit
in
that
thread
.
It
was
actually
the
next
day
when
I
saw
this
thread
-
and
so
many
people
had
said
so
many
funny
things
...
it
was
like
a
relief
valve
had
opened
up
and
all
this
pent
up
frustration
was
flowing
out
.

There
was
so
much
energy
in
the
Fark
thread
where
the
meme
got
its
start
.
I
felt
that
it
was
something
worth
continuing
;
that
the
frustration
that
was
being
expressed
in
that
thread
through
the
expression
of
the
meme
might
actually
become
a
force
for
change
.
And
even
if
it
did
n't
manage
to
change
anything
,
just
the
simple
act
of
being
a
part
of
the
meme
might
bring
about
a
cathartic
release
of
that
frustration
at
all
the
stupidity
of
the
pundits
out
there
-
of
whom
I
think
that
Glenn
Beck
is
really
the
worst
of
the
worst
.
</p>
<p>
The
thing
about
Fark
is
-
it
's
a
great
site
,
but
it
's
all
based
on
these
threads
.
Someone
submits
a
link
,
and
that
gives
you
a
thread
to
talk
about
it
.
After
something
like
30
days
,
posting
is
cut
off
.
Also
,
the
site
is
made
up
of
a
lot
of
links
for
the
public
threads
,
but
many
times
that
for
the
private
threads
.
It
can
be
very
hard
to
keep
up
with
a
single
thread
.
So
I
realized
that
if
this
meme
were
to
take
off
-
it
needed
a
home
.
I
knew
I
needed
to
create
a
website
,
and
a
forum
on
that
website
,
to
facilitate
whatever
was
going
to
happen
.
