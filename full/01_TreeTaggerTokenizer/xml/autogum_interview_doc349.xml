What
does
the
WHO
recommend
for
those
individuals
affected
by
H1N1
?
How
does
H1N1
affect
someone
who
is
infected
?

Since
the
H1N1
pandemic
virus
is
now
the
dominant
influenza
virus
circulating
worldwide
,
most
cases
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/influenza">
influenza-like
</ref>
illness
are
likely
pandemic
influenza
.
</p>
<p>
Typical
symptoms
to
watch
for
include
fever
,
cough
,
headache
,
body
aches
,
sore
throat
and
runny
nose
.
</p>
<p>
WHO
advises
health
care
providers
to
treat
people
with
influenza-like
illness
based
on
their
symptoms
and
the
progress
of
their
illness
,
and
not
to
wait
for
laboratory
confirmation
of
pandemic
influenza
.
The
pandemic
H1N1
virus
has
already
spread
worldwide
.
</p>
<p>
Regarding
laboratory
testing
of
cases
,
public
health
authorities
and
WHO
partners
continue
to
do
selective
testing
of
samples
from
patients
with
influenza-like
illness
to
characterize
outbreaks
,
monitor
the
virus
and
identify
disease
trends
.
</p>
<p>
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-viral%20drugs">
Anti-viral
drugs
</ref>
(
which
are
medicines
that
act
directly
on
viruses
to
stop
them
from
multiplying
)
should
not
be
taken
to
prevent
H1N1
.
There
are
two
antiviral
drugs
are
being
used
to
treat
pandemic
influenza
infections
.
These
are
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oseltamivir">
oseltamivir
</ref>
and
zanamivir
,
which
both
block
the
action
of
an
influenza
virus
protein
called
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neuraminidase">
neuraminidase
</ref>
.
</p>
<p>
For
patients
with
symptoms
of
severe
illness
that
are
probably
due
to
pandemic
influenza
,
WHO
recommends
that
treatment
with
oseltamivir
should
start
immediately
,
no
matter
when
the
illness
started
and
without
waiting
for
laboratory
results
to
confirm
infection
.
</p>
<p>
For
patients
at
higher
risk
for
serious
disease
from
pandemic
influenza
,
including
pregnant
women
,
children
under
age
5
and
those
with
certain
underlying
medical
conditions
,
WHO
recommends
treatment
with
either
oseltamivir
or
zanamivir
as
soon
as
possible
after
the
onset
of
symptoms
,
and
without
waiting
for
the
results
of
laboratory
tests
.
</p>
<p>
Otherwise
healthy
people
who
are
not
from
a
higher
risk
group
but
who
have
persistent
or
rapidly
worsening
symptoms
should
be
treated
with
antivirals
.
These
symptoms
include
difficulty
breathing
or
a
high
fever
that
lasts
beyond
three
days
.

Pandemic
H1N1
virus
is
spread
from
person
to
person
in
the
same
way
that
seasonal
influenza
viruses
are
spread
.
It
is
transmitted
as
easily
as
the
normal
seasonal
flu
and
can
be
passed
to
other
people
by
exposure
to
infected
droplets
expelled
by
coughing
or
sneezing
that
can
be
inhaled
,
or
that
can
contaminate
hands
or
surfaces
.
</p>
<p>
Signs
of
the
pandemic
influenza
are
flu-like
,
including
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/malaise">
malaise
</ref>
,
fever
,
cough
,
headache
,
muscle
and
joint
pain
,
sore
throat
and
runny
nose
,
and
sometimes
vomiting
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/diarrhoea">
diarrhoea
</ref>
.
</p>
<p>
The
majority
of
people
with
pandemic
influenza
experience
mild
illness
and
recover
fully
without
treatment
.
However
,
people
should
seek
medical
care
if
they
experience
shortness
of
breath
or
difficulty
breathing
,
or
if
a
fever
,
and
especially
high
fever
,
continues
more
than
three
days
.
For
parents
with
a
young
child
who
is
ill
,
seek
medical
care
if
a
child
has
fast
or
labored
breathing
,
continuing
fever
or
convulsions
(
seizures
)
.
