History
</head>
<p>
The
islands
have
great
historical
significance
in
a
number
of
ways
.
Archeological
sites
on
21
of
the
islands
have
been
placed
on
the
National
Register
of
Historic
Places
and
all
the
islands
are
considered
likely
to
have
significant
sites
.
Evidence
indicates
that
Native
American
peoples
lived
on
the
islands
as
early
as
1000
BC
and
perhaps
before
they
separated
from
the
mainland
sometime
in
the
2000
years
previous
to
that
.
The
highly
alkaline
shell-fragmented
soils
which
preserve
artifacts
better
than
typical
New
England
soils
,
and
the
relatively
low-intensity
use
by
Euro-Americans
,
make
the
islands
an
archeological
treasure
.
</p>
<p>
The
islands
have
undergone
many
various
uses
over
the
years
:
agriculture
,
cemetery
,
fishing
colony
,
fortifications
,
hospital
,
hotel
or
resort
,
industrial
,
poorhouse
,
prison
,
prisoner-of-war
camp
,
quarantine
,
sewage
treatment
,
lighthouses
,
and
dumps
.
</p>
<p>
Deer
Island
has
particular
significance
to
Native
Americans
as
a
place
of
imprisonment
and
interment
during
King
Philip
's
War
in
the
1670s
.
Contemporary
Native
Americans
return
each
October
to
commemorate
their
ancestors
'
suffering
in
this
tragic
slaughter
.
Indications
are
that
1000
or
more
American
Indians
were
forced
onto
Deer
and
other
islands
,
often
to
die
of
starvation
.
Later
Deer
Island
also
served
as
a
quarantine
hospital
in
1847
to
treat
the
many
sick
,
impoverished
Irish
immigrants
fleeing
the
potato
famine
.
</p>
<p>
In
1970
the
Commonwealth
of
Massachusetts
began
acquiring
islands
for
the
benefit
of
the
public
.
In
1985
Boston
Harbor
was
named
the
most
polluted
harbor
in
the
nation
.
After
investment
of
$
4
billion
and
extensive
wastewater
treatment
efforts
by
the
Massachusetts
Water
Resources
Authority
,
improved
water
quality
contributed
to
widespread
support
for
establishing
a
national
park
area
.
</p>
<p>
The
Boston
Harbor
Islands
National
Recreation
Area
was
established
by
act
of
Congress
in
1996
.
The
Partnership
which
governs
it
is
made
up
of
thirteen
members
appointed
by
the
Secretary
of
the
Interior
to
represent
various
Federal
,
State
,
City
of
Boston
,
and
non-profit
interests
.
The
Partnership
subsequently
adopted
the
name
&quot;
Boston
Harbor
Islands
,
a
national
park
area
&quot;
in
response
to
Native
Americans
'
objections
to
the
term
&quot;
recreation
&quot;
being
used
for
an
area
they
consider
sacred
.

The
land
area
changes
from
3100
acres
to
1600
acres
as
the
tide
rises
from
low
to
high
.
The
typical
island
,
and
even
the
peninsulas
,
consist
of
drumlins
(
rounded
hills
of
till
that
form
under
glaciers
)
.
Some
of
the
smaller
islands
are
based
on
rocky
outcroppings
.
The
larger
islands
have
a
variety
of
landscapes
â€”
deciduous
trees
and
thickets
of
bushes
,
salt
marshes
,
bluffs
,
cliffs
and
,
of
course
,
beaches
and
waterscapes
,
including
lighthouses

<p>
Many
of
the
islands
have
trees
,
with
some
having
been
planted
for
shade
in
recent
years
.
Native
plants
such
as
bayberry
and
beach
plum
are
abundant
.
Decorative
flowers
are
in
raised
plantings
so
as
not
to
disturb
possible
archeological
sites
.
Many
marine
and
migrating
birds
are
found
on
the
islands
.
Lovell
Island
has
a
large
population
of
European
hares
put
here
in
the
1940s
and
1950s
.
Gallops
Island
also
has
a
large
population
of
rabbits
.
