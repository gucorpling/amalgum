After
a
fight
Thursday
night
where
she
again
used
sex
as
a
weapon
,
I
have
barely
said
two
words
when
I
have
n’t
needed
to
.
Yesterday
,
I
was
putting
sheets
on
our
daughter
’s
bed
and
wife
tried
to
kiss
me
.
I
barely
touched
her
.
She
made
a
comment
about
it
.
Our
son
came
in
before
I
could
answer
.
Later
that
day
she
asked
me
about
us
.
Told
her
nothing
to
say
that
I
have
n’t
already
.
I
am
done
.
She
won
.
The
times
of
saying
no
hope
,
she
does
n’t
know
what
she
wants
,
etc
have
won
.
She
tried
to
twist
it
into
saying
it
was
my
fault
for
how
I
talked
to
her
.
I
told
her
no
matter
what
happened
in
the
past
I
still
wanted
her
.
Now
,
I
am
not
going
to
put
myself
in
the
position
to
get
worked
up
sexually
only
to
be
told
later
and
then
be
told
“
I
never
said
what
later
meant
.
”
We
went
back
and
forth
with
her
thinking
I
was
blaming
her
while
taking
zero
responsibility
and
me
saying
I
am
responsible
for
my
actions
and
my
actions
were
to
protect
myself
and
my
kids
.
It
might
not
have
been
the
right
way
to
do
ir
,
but
it
was
never
to
hurt
her
.
This
morning
she
came
up
to
me
and
said
she
is
tired
of
fighting
.
We
waste
too
much
energy
on
it
.
Told
her
I
have
said
that
for
years
.
She
says
feels
like
she
has
to
be
superwoman
.
That
everyone
wants
a
part
of
her
.
I
told
her
I
have
many
people
pulling
for
my
attention
and
I
still
made
her
the
priority
.
I
told
her
,
again
,
the
comment
she
made
about
me
not
being
able
to
get
anyone
else
hurt
and
the
constant
rejection
killed
my
self-esteem
.
She
apologized
.
I
honestly
have
seen
sorrow
in
her
eyes
like
that
.
I
reiterated
that
I
cannot
take
being
turned
on
and
then
left
or
chasing
the
why
to
make
things
easier
for
her
.
I
am
done
that
.
This
has
n’t
changed
anything
.
I
hate
who
I
have
become
.
I
am
not
the
me
that
I
like
and
it
is
because
of
the
way
this
relationship
turned
out
.
I
want
to
be
the
best
father
I
can
be
to
my
kids
.
The
best
employee
I
can
be
to
my
company
.
I
want
to
be
the
best
friend
I
can
be
to
my
friends
.
I
cannot
do
that
when
my
energy
is
drained
by
my
relationship
with
my
wife
.
It
is
my
responsibility
to
take
that
energy
back
and
I
am
standing
my
ground
to
do
so
.

Sometimes
,
you
just
have
to
walk
away
.
You
seem
to
be
in
a
state
of
constant
conflict
with
your
partner
.
Nobody
wins
at
that
game
unfortunately
.
