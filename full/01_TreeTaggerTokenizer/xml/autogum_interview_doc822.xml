Where
do
they
violate
Satanic
principles
in
that
conflict
?

</hi>
Each
have
their
own
goals
.
I
would
say
killing
people
who
are
just
innocent
folks
,
that
’s
against
Satanic
philosophy
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism">
Terrorism
</ref>
,
specifically
,
is
against
Satanism
because
we
feel
that
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/justice">
justice
</ref>
is
important
,
and
that
is
giving
people
what
they
deserve
.
Blowing
up
somebody
who
is
just
wandering
around
is
not
a
just
approach
.
That
’s
something
against
the
social
contract
,
and
we
would
oppose
people
engaging
in
terrorism
.

What
about

Abortion
?
</hi>
</p>
<hi rend="bold">
I
would
look
at
it
as
if
I
was
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fetus">
fetus
</ref>
,
I
would
n't
want
to
be
snuffed
out

<p>
<hi rend="bold">
PG
:
</hi>
I
think
people
should
practice
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/birth%20control">
birth
control
</ref>
rather
than
use
abortion
as
an
easy
way
out
.
Again
,
the
concept
of
being
responsible
for
yourself
and
not
to
willy-nilly
get
pregnant
unless
you
are
really
interested
in
carrying
forth
the
child
.
Since
we
have
overpopulation
generally
speaking
,
I
think
abortion
is
something
fine
to
be
used
,
but
I
think
it
should
not
be
used
as
a
means
of
cleaning
up
after
people
’s
irresponsible
sexual
activity
.

<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
Why
do
you
not
consider
it
just
another
operation
?
Some
people
run
or
exercise
not
realizing
their
limitations
and
pull
a
muscle
or
need
an
operation
for
that
.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">
PG

</hi>
I
would
look
at
it
as
if
I
was

be

DS

So
is
the
fetus
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentient">
sentient
being
</ref>
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
PG
:
</hi>
Not
necessarily
,
it
’s
just
a
piece
of
tissue
and
most
human
life
does
n't
really
have
that
much
value
on
a
grand
scale
.
In
the
universe
,
individual
life
is
practically
meaningless
,
it
’s
sort
of
like
droplets
in
a
wave
that
crashes
against
a
rock
.
Who
cares
about
the
droplets
?
The
way
life
works
is
it
is
making
large
amounts
of
species
of
whatever
it
is
,
and
it
keeps
moving
biologically
.
I
would
just
think
that
if
it
was
myself
as
the
fetus
,
I
have
a
potential
to
become
the
person
that
I
am
.
I
would
n't
want
to
be
snuffed
out
.

DS
:
When
do
you
think
life
begins
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
PG
:
</hi>
Life
is
there
,
whether
it
is
conscious
and
valuable
is
debatable
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
You
mean
just
on
a
cellular
level
it
is
functioning
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
PG
:
</hi>
Yeah
,
it
is
life
.
Sperms
and
eggs
are
alive
,
they
're
organic
,
you
ca
n't
say
that
is
not
life
.
But
what
I
think
you
’re
looking
for
is
the
idea
that
Christians
wants
to
say
from
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conception">
conception
</ref>
.
If
people
want
to
have
abortions
it
really
does
n't
bother
me
,
I
just
think
they
really
should
be
more
responsible
.
It
just
makes
more
sense
.
Contraception
is
easy
!

A
lot
of
people
do
n't
like
contraception
