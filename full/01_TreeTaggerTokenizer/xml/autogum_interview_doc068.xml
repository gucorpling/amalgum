Which
positive
aspects
of
Wikimedia
Argentina
do
you
value
at
this
Iberoconf
?

<hi rend="bold">
Asaf
Bartov

</hi>
First
of
all
,
they
have
done
a
great
job
organizing
the
event
.
Everything
is
running
smoothly
as
far
as
I
can
tell
.
The
venue
is
really
good
.
The
program
is
running
according
to
schedule
more
or
less
.
So
that
's
good
;
and
they
did
this
in
a
fairly
short
schedule
after
there
was
some
uncertainty
about
who
would
host
the
conference
.
So
that
was
good
.
More
generally
,
I
really
appreciate
their
successful
transition
with
the
new
Executive
Director
,
who
has
been
able
to
assume
all
of
the
responsibilities
,
including
,
crucially
,
their
submission
to
the
FDC
[
Funds
Dissemination
Committee
]
process
like
their
proposal
which
was
good
as
we
have
just
learned
this
weekend
when
the
FDC
published
its
recommendations
which
are
granting
Wikimedia
Argentina
practically
the
budget
that
they
requested
.
Which
is
a
very
strong
positive
signal
from
the
FDC
that
Wikimedia
Argentina
is
on
the
right
track
,
its
programmatic
approach
is
good
and
its
planning
is
solid
.
This
is
all
very
high
praise
,
this
is
all
hard
to
achieve
;
it
's
is
not
as
easy
as
it
seems
.
Most
specifically
,
I
would
say
Wikimedia
Argentina
has
some
interesting
partnerships
,
these
educational
partnerships
that
we
have
heard
about
yesterday
are
promising
.
I
like
that
they
are
working
...
they
are
not
just
doing
,
you
know
,
the
<hi rend="italic">
Wikipedia
</hi>
education
program
—
going
to
classrooms
,
having
students
write
articles
—
but
they
are
collaborating
with
other
external
non-Wikimedia
organizations
towards
free
culture
and
free
knowledge
.
That
is
a
very
powerful
mechanism
for
growth
of
impact
.
So
that
they
are
not
bound
only
by
the
volunteers
you
have
but
they
also
leverage
the
external
part
.

I
am
from
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Costa_Rica">
Costa
Rica
</ref>
,
and
Costa
Rica
is
the
smallest
of
the
groups
represented
during
this
Iberoconf
.
What
should
Costa
Rica
learn
from
Iberocoop
to
reach
the
same
degrees
of
success
that
have
reached
the
rest
of
the
chapters
?

<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Asaf
Bartov
</hi>
:
That
's
a
good
question
.
I
would
say
,
if
I
were
in
your
shoes
,
one
interesting
question
I
would
ask
of
everyone
here
is
,
when
did
you
feel
,
what
do
you
feel
was
the
inflection
point
,
the
turning
point
,
in
the
growth
of
the
community
in
your
country
—
like
,
was
there
an
event
,
or
was
there
a
—
like
,
not
necessarily
even
a
Wikimedia
event
,
like
maybe
it
was
,
you
know
,
the
National
Elections
of
2008
—
was
there
something
that
you
feel
triggered
a
lot
of
growth
,
was
there
a
moment
where
you
feel
,
yeah
there
was
all
of
the
history
up
to
that
point
,
and
then
there
was
growth
.
It
would
be
interesting
to
learn
from
all
our
colleagues
here
what
that
moment
was
for
them
,
if
they
can
think
of
one
,
and
then
see
if
some
of
those
stories
may
be
relevant
for
Costa
Rica
.
Maybe
there
is
something
you
can
do
,
maybe
something
you
can
think
about
.
Other
than
that
,
there
's
just
the
general
solutions
for
all
in
our
movement
:
trying
to
have
regular
meet-ups
,
trying
to
collaborate
with
allies
groups
like
free
software
groups
.
These
are
more
generally
solutions
,
but
specifically
to
learn
from
Iberocoop
I
would
ask
people
to
think
about
their
early
stages
and
see
if
they
can
offer
you
some
advice
.
