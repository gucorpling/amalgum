Conduct
a
Healthcare
Risk
Assessment
</head>
<p>
Covered
entities
under
the
U.S.
Health
Insurance
Portability
and
Accountability
Act
(
HIPAA
)
of
1996
,
are
health
plans
,
healthcare
clearinghouses
,
and
any
healthcare
provider
who
transmits
health
information
in
an
electronic
form
.
Covered
entities
need
to
comply
with
the
HIPAA
Privacy
and
Security
Rules
in
order
to
avoid
penalties
.
One
of
the
Security
Rule
’s
main
requirements
is
the
performance
of
a
risk
analysis
.
The
Security
Rule
stipulates
that
a
risk
analysis
should
be
documented
but
it
does
n’t
require
any
specific
format
for
it
.
This
article
will
present
several
steps
of
how
to
conduct
a
proper
healthcare
risk
assessment
.

Define
the
Scope
of
the
Risk
Analysis
.
There
are
different
types
of
risk
analysis
methods
depending
on
its
scope
.
The
scope
of
the
healthcare
risk
assessment
includes
the
potential
risks
and
vulnerabilities
to
the
confidentiality
,
availability
and
integrity
of
all
ePHI
that
a
covered
entity
creates
,
receives
,
maintains
,
or
transmits
.

Gather
Current
Documentation
.
A
covered
entity
should
gather
and
document
information
on
where
ePHI
is
stored
,
maintained
and
transmitted
.
This
can
be
done
by
checking
current
and
past
projects
,
auditing
documents
.

Identify
Potential
Threats
and
Vulnerabilities
.
This
step
is
essential
to
determining
the
level
of
risk
.
All
anticipated
threats
(
natural
,
environmental
or
human
)
and
vulnerabilities
should
be
documented
in
category
lists
and
analyzed
afterwards
.

<item>
Analyze
Current
Security
Measures
.
All
security
measures
that
a
covered
entity
uses
to
protect
ePHI
should
be
documented
.
Security
measures
can
be
divided
into
technical
–
related
to
the
software
and
hardware
in
the
network
-
and
non-technical
–
related
to
management
and
operations
.
This
step
will
reveal
whether
the
covered
entity
has
enough
security
safeguards
in
place
.

Determine
the
Likelihood
and
Impact
of
Threats
.
The
covered
entity
has
to
analyze
each
threat
and
vulnerability
combination
in
order
to
determine
the
probability
a
threat
can
occur
.
The
likelihood
of
threat
occurrence
can
be
defined
as
low
,
medium
and
high
or
can
be
a
numeric
representation
.
The
threat
impact
should
also
be
defined
by
using
a
similar
rating
system
.

<item>
Determine
the
Risk
Level
.
Make
a
risk
level
matrix
using
the
identified
likelihood
and
threat
impact
.
Choose
a
rating
system
such
as
the
low
,
medium
and
high
rating
system
.
Add
an
action
description
to
each
risk
level
,
which
will
clarify
to
management
what
actions
should
be
taken
to
prevent
or
minimize
this
risk
and
when
.

Identify
New
Security
Measures
.
After
identifying
the
risk
level
,
covered
entities
have
to
think
what
security
measures
need
to
be
taken
to
reduce
risks
.
When
defining
new
security
measures
,
it
is
important
to
take
into
account
factors
such
as
the
measures
’
effectiveness
,
legislative
or
regulatory
requirements
and
other
organization
’s
policies
.
Like
each
of
the
previous
steps
,
this
step
should
also
be
diligently
documented
.

EPHI
can
be
found
in
various
electronic
media
so
covered
entities
should
consider
all
forms
of
media
containing
ePHI
in
their
analysis
.
Examples
of
such
media
are
hard
drives
,
floppy
disks
,
CDs
,
DVDs
,
smart
cards
,
personal
digital
assistants
(
PDA
)
,
transmission
media
,
and
portable
electronic
storage
media
.

Take
into
account
all
possible
threat
outcomes
.
The
most
common
impacts
as
a
result
of
exploited
vulnerabilities
are
loss
or
corruption
of
ePHI
,
disclosure
or
unavailability
of
ePHI
,
loss
of
software
or
hardware
inventory
,
and
loss
of
reputation
.
