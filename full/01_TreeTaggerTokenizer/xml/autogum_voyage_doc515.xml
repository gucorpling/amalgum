Southwest

,
is
regarded
as
perhaps
the
most
scenic
county
in
<ref target="Ireland">
Ireland
</ref>
and
is
certainly
the
most
renowned
for
its
scenery
.
It
holds
most
of
Ireland
's
highest
mountains
(
including
the
highest
,
Carrauntuohill
)
in
its
most
westerly
fringes
and
holds
a
special
place
in
Irish
culture
.
It
became
a
popular
tourist
attraction
in
the
19th
century
and
is
still
very
popular
today
,
despite
considerable
rainfall
.
In
some
places
the
tourist
pressure
has
arguably
had
a
mixed
effect
but
in
general
the
county
is
friendly
and
relaxed
as
well
as
beautiful
.
