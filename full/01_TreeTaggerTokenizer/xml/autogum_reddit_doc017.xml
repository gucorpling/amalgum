Regret
not
moving
out
for
University
</head>
<sp who="#qulep2">
<p>
I
'm
a
19
year
old
asian
male
who
just
finished
my
first
year
in
University
around
a
month
ago
and
I
chose
to
commute
and
stay
at
home
with
my
parents
.
Typical
high
school
me
thought
that
this
would
be
a
good
idea
as
I
'll
be
able
to
save
money
for
the
future
but
I
really
regret
it
.
Although
I
am
19
,
I
still
have
to
tell
my
parents
when
I
'm
going
out
and
follow
a
9
pm
curfew
,
which
means
I
cannot
do
many
of
the
fun
things
that
a
lot
of
my
peers
are
doing
such
as
sleeping
over
and
getting
wasted
or
hanging
around
a
bar
with
friends
late
at
night
.
I
have
drank
before
,
but
never
gotten
drunk
or
I
'll
get
into
serious
trouble
and
scolding
.
I
have
white
friends
who
commute
to
University
,
but
do
n't
have
these
restrictions
on
them
ever
since
they
turned
18
,
and
I
envy
them
a
lot
.
I
feel
like
I
wo
n't
be
able
to
know
what
it
's
like
to
be
drunk
until
I
reach
my
mid
20
's
,
which
is
very
disappointing
.
I
also
cannot
stand
my
home
because
of
how
often
I
am
still
treated
as
kid
.
When
I
do
go
outside
I
always
get
phone
calls
every
hour/2
hours
from
my
parents
asking
if
I
'm
okay
,
make
sure
to
be
safe
,
and
do
n't
speak
to
strangers
.
Like
wow
,
considering
how
I
do
go
out
a
decent
amount
and
am
still
alive
,
I
would
think
they
would
eventually
stop
calling
me
so
frequently
and
understand
that
I
can
think
for
myself
,
but
I
guess
not
.
At
this
point
I
stopped
answering
most
of
the
calls
,
and
usually
it
ends
up
with
5-10
missed
calls
by
the
time
I
reach
home
.
I
just
want
to
know
,
are
there
any
other
of
you
guys
with
asian
parents
and
have
a
similar
experience
who
chose
to
commute
to
University
?
tl
;
dr
:
asian
kid
who
chose
to
live
with
asian
parents
that
put
restrictions
on
my
life
,
making
my
university
life
feel
less
fulfilling
EDIT
:
Thanks
for
the
advice
and
stories
guys
!
!
I
'm
also
glad
to
know
that
there
are
people
who
can
relate
to
my
situation
haha

This
was
my
exact
experience
in
undergrad
when
I
was
commuting
from
home
.
I
did
the
same
thing
as
you
--
stopped
answering
calls
and
got
a
dozen
missed
calls
.
This
was
when
cell
phones
were
just
taking
off
.
I
ca
n't
imagine
what
sorts
of
text
messages
I
would
've
gotten
!
</p>
<p>
One
time
,
my
mom
got
so
angry
scared
when
I
stopped
picking
up
her
calls
that
she
got
in
the
car
and
went
out
looking
for
me
.
I
have
no
idea
where
she
went
.
Got
the
biggest
scolding
of
my
life
after
that
.
It
's
funny
in
hindsight
but
was
traumatizing
at
the
time
,
lol
.
</p>
<p>
I
regret
not
having
the
typical
college
experience
and
blame
my
parents
'
over-protectiveness
for
making
me
unprepared
for
the
real
world
.
I
now
live
in
a
different
state
from
them
and
have
attempted
to
catch
up
on
life
.
My
relationship
with
them
has
also
vastly
improved
.
</p>
<p>
I
do
n't
have
good
advice
for
you
,
but
I
wanted
to
say
that
some
of
us
get
you
!
You
're
not
alone
.
It
gets
better
.
</p>
<p>
Pros
from
this
is
that
you
're
not
massively
in
student
debt
.
I
also
think
that
I
absorbed
most
of
my
parents
'
insanity
on
behalf
of
my
younger
brother
,
so
yay
for
him
,
lol
.
</p>
<p>
A
few
tricks
that
I
think
helped
:
1
)
Tell
them
that
it
's
hard
to
answer
the
phone
,
like
if
you
're
in
movie
,
in
class
,
or
a
loud
restaurant
,
but
you
can
check
in
with
them
via
text
.
Teach
them
how
to
text
if
they
do
n't
know
how
.
Gain
their
trust
by
actually
texting
when
they
do
n't
expect
it
.
2
)
Sell
everything
that
you
do
as
being
related
to
academics
or
work
.
I
think
this
experience
has
made
me
a
really
good
salesperson
,
haha
.
(
Not
a
salesperson
by
trade
,
but
it
helps
with
pitching
ideas
to
friends
and
colleagues
.
)
3
)
When
you
get
the
chance
to
move
out
,
and
it
wo
n't
bankrupt
you
,
do
it
.
