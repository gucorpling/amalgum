“
Do
n’t
you
remember
me
now
--
at
Mrs.
Murrett
’s
?
”
She
threw
the
question
at
Darrow
across
a
table
of
the
quiet
coffee-room
to
which
,
after
a
vainly
prolonged
quest
for
her
trunk
,
he
had
suggested
taking
her
for
a
cup
of
tea
.
</p>
<p>
In
this
musty
retreat
she
had
removed
her
dripping
hat
,
hung
it
on
the
fender
to
dry
,
and
stretched
herself
on
tiptoe
in
front
of
the
round
eagle-crowned
mirror
,
above
the
mantel
vases
of
dyed
immortelles
,
while
she
ran
her
fingers
comb-wise
through
her
hair
.
The
gesture
had
acted
on
Darrow
’s
numb
feelings
as
the
glow
of
the
fire
acted
on
his
circulation
;
and
when
he
had
asked
:
“
Are
n’t
your
feet
wet
,
too
?
”
and
,
after
frank
inspection
of
a
stout-shod
sole
,
she
had
answered
cheerfully
:
“
No
--
luckily
I
had
on
my
new
boots
,
”
he
began
to
feel
that
human
intercourse
would
still
be
tolerable
if
it
were
always
as
free
from
formality
.
</p>
<p>
The
removal
of
his
companion
’s
hat
,
besides
provoking
this
reflection
,
gave
him
his
first
full
sight
of
her
face
;
and
this
was
so
favourable
that
the
name
she
now
pronounced
fell
on
him
with
a
quite
disproportionate
shock
of
dismay
.
</p>
<p>
“
Oh
,
Mrs.
Murrett’s
--
was
it
THERE
?
”
</p>
<p>
He
remembered
her
now
,
of
course
:
remembered
her
as
one
of
the
shadowy
sidling
presences
in
the
background
of
that
awful
house
in
Chelsea
,
one
of
the
dumb
appendages
of
the
shrieking
unescapable
Mrs.
Murrett
,
into
whose
talons
he
had
fallen
in
the
course
of
his
head-long
pursuit
of
Lady
Ulrica
Crispin
.
Oh
,
the
taste
of
stale
follies
!
How
insipid
it
was
,
yet
how
it
clung
!
</p>
<p>
“
I
used
to
pass
you
on
the
stairs
,
”
she
reminded
him
.
</p>
<p>
Yes
:
he
had
seen
her
slip
by
--
he
recalled
it
now
--
as
he
dashed
up
to
the
drawing-room
in
quest
of
Lady
Ulrica
.
The
thought
made
him
steal
a
longer
look
.
How
could
such
a
face
have
been
merged
in
the
Murrett
mob
?
Its
fugitive
slanting
lines
,
that
lent
themselves
to
all
manner
of
tender
tilts
and
foreshortenings
,
had
the
freakish
grace
of
some
young
head
of
the
Italian
comedy
.
The
hair
stood
up
from
her
forehead
in
a
boyish
elf-lock
,
and
its
colour
matched
her
auburn
eyes
flecked
with
black
,
and
the
little
brown
spot
on
her
cheek
,
between
the
ear
that
was
meant
to
have
a
rose
behind
it
and
the
chin
that
should
have
rested
on
a
ruff
.
When
she
smiled
,
the
left
corner
of
her
mouth
went
up
a
little
higher
than
the
right
;
and
her
smile
began
in
her
eyes
and
ran
down
to
her
lips
in
two
lines
of
light
.
He
had
dashed
past
that
to
reach
Lady
Ulrica
Crispin
!
</p>
<p>
“
But
of
course
you
would
n’t
remember
me
,
”
she
was
saying
.
“
My
name
is
Viner
--
Sophy
Viner
.
”
</p>
<p>
Not
remember
her
?
But
of
course
he
DID
!
He
was
genuinely
sure
of
it
now
.
“
You
’re
Mrs.
Murrett
’s
niece
,
”
he
declared
.
</p>
<p>
She
shook
her
head
.
“
No
;
not
even
that
.
Only
her
reader
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Her
reader
?
Do
you
mean
to
say
she
ever
reads
?
”
</p>
<p>
Miss
Viner
enjoyed
his
wonder
.
“
Dear
,
no
!
But
I
wrote
notes
,
and
made
up
the
visiting-book
,
and
walked
the
dogs
,
and
saw
bores
for
her
.
”
</p>
<p>
Darrow
groaned
.
“
That
must
have
been
rather
bad
!
”
</p>
<p>
“
Yes
;
but
nothing
like
as
bad
as
being
her
niece
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
That
I
can
well
believe
.
I
’m
glad
to
hear
,
”
he
added
,
“
that
you
put
it
all
in
the
past
tense
.
”
</p>
<p>
She
seemed
to
droop
a
little
at
the
allusion
;
then
she
lifted
her
chin
with
a
jerk
of
defiance
.
“
Yes
.
All
is
at
an
end
between
us
.
We
’ve
just
parted
in
tears
--
but
not
in
silence
!
”
</p>
<p>
“
Just
parted
?
Do
you
mean
to
say
you
’ve
been
there
all
this
time
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Ever
since
you
used
to
come
there
to
see
Lady
Ulrica
?
Does
it
seem
to
you
so
awfully
long
ago
?
”
</p>
<p>
The
unexpectedness
of
the
thrust
--
as
well
as
its
doubtful
taste
--
chilled
his
growing
enjoyment
of
her
chatter
.
He
had
really
been
getting
to
like
her
--
had
recovered
,
under
the
candid
approval
of
her
eye
,
his
usual
sense
of
being
a
personable
young
man
,
with
all
the
privileges
pertaining
to
the
state
,
instead
of
the
anonymous
rag
of
humanity
he
had
felt
himself
in
the
crowd
on
the
pier
.
It
annoyed
him
,
at
that
particular
moment
,
to
be
reminded
that
naturalness
is
not
always
consonant
with
taste
.
</p>
<p>
She
seemed
to
guess
his
thought
.
“
You
do
n’t
like
my
saying
that
you
came
for
Lady
Ulrica
?
”
she
asked
,
leaning
over
the
table
to
pour
herself
a
second
cup
of
tea
.
</p>
<p>
He
liked
her
quickness
,
at
any
rate
.
“
It
’s
better
,
”
he
laughed
,
“
than
your
thinking
I
came
for
Mrs.
Murrett
!
”
</p>
<p>
“
Oh
,
we
never
thought
anybody
came
for
Mrs.
Murrett
!
It
was
always
for
something
else
:
the
music
,
or
the
cook
--
when
there
was
a
good
one
--
or
the
other
people
;
generally
ONE
of
the
other
people
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
see
.
”
</p>
<p>
She
was
amusing
,
and
that
,
in
his
present
mood
,
was
more
to
his
purpose
than
the
exact
shade
of
her
taste
.
It
was
odd
,
too
,
to
discover
suddenly
that
the
blurred
tapestry
of
Mrs.
Murrett
’s
background
had
all
the
while
been
alive
and
full
of
eyes
.
Now
,
with
a
pair
of
them
looking
into
his
,
he
was
conscious
of
a
queer
reversal
of
perspective
.
</p>
<p>
“
Who
were
the
‘
we
’
?
Were
you
a
cloud
of
witnesses
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
There
were
a
good
many
of
us
.
”
She
smiled
.
“
Let
me
see
--
who
was
there
in
your
time
?
Mrs.
Bolt
--
and
Mademoiselle
--
and
Professor
Didymus
and
the
Polish
Countess
.
Do
n’t
you
remember
the
Polish
Countess
?
She
crystal-gazed
,
and
played
accompaniments
,
and
Mrs.
Murrett
chucked
her
because
Mrs.
Didymus
accused
her
of
hypnotizing
the
Professor
.
But
of
course
you
do
n’t
remember
.
We
were
all
invisible
to
you
;
but
we
could
see
.
And
we
all
used
to
wonder
about
you
--
