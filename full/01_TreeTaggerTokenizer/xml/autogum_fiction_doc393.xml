Bandits
</head>
<p>
When
Madeline
and
her
party
recovered
composure
they
sat
up
to
watch
the
finish
of
the
match
.
It
came
with
spectacular
suddenness
.
A
sharp
yell
pealed
out
,
and
all
the
cowboys
turned
attentively
in
its
direction
.
A
big
black
horse
had
surmounted
the
rim
of
the
mesa
and
was
just
breaking
into
a
run
.
His
rider
yelled
sharply
to
the
cowboys
.
They
wheeled
to
dash
toward
their
grazing
horses
.
</p>
<p>
“
That
's
Stewart
.
There
is
something
wrong
,
”
said
Madeline
,
in
alarm
.
</p>
<p>
Castleton
stared
.
The
other
men
exclaimed
uneasily
.
The
women
sought
Madeline
's
face
with
anxious
eyes
.
</p>
<p>
The
black
got
into
his
stride
and
bore
swiftly
down
upon
them
.
</p>
<p>
“
Oh
,
look
at
that
horse
run
!
”
cried
Helen
.
“
Look
at
that
fellow
ride
!
”
</p>
<p>
Helen
was
not
alone
in
her
admiration
,
for
Madeline
divided
her
emotions
between
growing
alarm
of
some
danger
menacing
and
a
thrill
and
quickening
of
pulse-beat
that
tingled
over
her
whenever
she
saw
Stewart
in
violent
action
.
No
action
of
his
was
any
longer
insignificant
,
but
violent
action
meant
so
much
.
It
might
mean
anything
.
For
one
moment
she
remembered
Stillwell
and
all
his
talk
about
fun
,
and
plots
,
and
tricks
to
amuse
her
guest
.
Then
she
discountenanced
the
thought
.
Stewart
might
lend
himself
to
a
little
fun
,
but
he
cared
too
much
for
a
horse
to
run
him
at
that
speed
unless
there
was
imperious
need
.
That
alone
sufficed
to
answer
Madeline
's
questioning
curiosity
.
And
her
alarm
mounted
to
fear
not
so
much
for
herself
as
for
her
guests
.
But
what
danger
could
there
be
?
She
could
think
of
nothing
except
the
guerrillas
.
</p>
<p>
Whatever
threatened
,
it
would
be
met
and
checked
by
this
man
Stewart
,
who
was
thundering
up
on
his
fleet
horse
;
and
as
he
neared
her
,
so
that
she
could
see
the
dark
gleam
of
face
and
eyes
,
she
had
a
strange
feeling
of
trust
in
her
dependence
upon
him
.
</p>
<p>
The
big
black
was
so
close
to
Madeline
and
her
friends
that
when
Stewart
pulled
him
the
dust
and
sand
kicked
up
by
his
pounding
hoofs
flew
in
their
faces
.
</p>
<p>
“
Oh
,
Stewart
,
what
is
it
?
”
cried
Madeline
.
</p>
<p>
“
Guess
I
scared
you
,
Miss
Hammond
,
”
he
replied
.
“
But
I
'm
pressed
for
time
.
There
's
a
gang
of
bandits
hiding
on
the
ranch
,
most
likely
in
a
deserted
hut
.
They
held
up
a
train
near
Agua
Prieta
.
Pat
Hawe
is
with
the
posse
that
's
trailing
them
,
and
you
know
Pat
has
no
use
for
us
.
I
'm
afraid
it
would
n't
be
pleasant
for
you
or
your
guests
to
meet
either
the
posse
or
the
bandits
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
fancy
not
,
”
said
Madeline
,
considerably
relieved
.
“
We
'll
hurry
back
to
the
house
.
”
</p>
<p>
They
exchanged
no
more
speech
at
the
moment
,
and
Madeline
's
guests
were
silent
.
Perhaps
Stewart
's
actions
and
looks
belied
his
calm
words
.
His
piercing
eyes
roved
round
the
rim
of
the
mesa
,
and
his
face
was
as
hard
and
stern
as
chiseled
bronze
.
</p>
<p>
Monty
and
Nick
came
galloping
up
,
each
leading
several
horses
by
the
bridles
.
Nels
appeared
behind
them
with
Majesty
,
and
he
was
having
trouble
with
the
roan
.
Madeline
observed
that
all
the
other
cowboys
had
disappeared
.
</p>
<p>
One
sharp
word
from
Stewart
calmed
Madeline
's
horse
;
the
other
horses
,
however
,
were
frightened
and
not
inclined
to
stand
.
The
men
mounted
without
trouble
,
and
likewise
Madeline
and
Florence
.
But
Edith
Wayne
and
Mrs.
Beck
,
being
nervous
and
almost
helpless
,
were
with
difficulty
gotten
into
the
saddle
.
</p>
<p>
“
Beg
pardon
,
but
I
'm
pressed
for
time
,
”
said
Stewart
,
coolly
,
as
with
iron
arm
he
forced
Dorothy
's
horse
almost
to
its
knees
.
Dorothy
,
who
was
active
and
plucky
,
climbed
astride
;
and
when
Stewart
loosed
his
hold
on
bit
and
mane
the
horse
doubled
up
and
began
to
buck
.
Dorothy
screamed
as
she
shot
into
the
air
.
Stewart
,
as
quick
as
the
horse
,
leaped
forward
and
caught
Dorothy
in
his
arms
.
She
had
slipped
head
downward
and
,
had
he
not
caught
her
,
would
have
had
a
serious
fall
.
Stewart
,
handling
her
as
if
she
were
a
child
,
turned
her
right
side
up
to
set
her
upon
her
feet
.
Dorothy
evidently
thought
only
of
the
spectacle
she
presented
,
and
made
startled
motions
to
readjust
her
riding-habit
.
It
was
no
time
to
laugh
,
though
Madeline
felt
as
if
she
wanted
to
.
Besides
,
it
was
impossible
to
be
anything
but
sober
with
Stewart
in
violent
mood
.
For
he
had
jumped
at
Dorothy
's
stubborn
mount
.
All
cowboys
were
masters
of
horses
.
It
was
wonderful
to
see
him
conquer
the
vicious
animal
.
He
was
cruel
,
perhaps
,
yet
it
was
from
necessity
.
When
,
presently
,
he
led
the
horse
back
to
Dorothy
she
mounted
without
further
trouble
.
Meanwhile
,
Nels
and
Nick
had
lifted
Helen
into
her
saddle
.
</p>
<p>
“
We
'll
take
the
side
trail
,
”
said
Stewart
,
shortly
,
as
he
swung
upon
the
big
black
.
Then
he
led
the
way
,
and
the
other
cowboys
trotted
in
the
rear
.
</p>
<p>
It
was
only
a
short
distance
to
the
rim
of
the
mesa
,
and
when
Madeline
saw
the
steep
trail
,
narrow
and
choked
with
weathered
stone
,
she
felt
that
her
guests
would
certainly
flinch
.
</p>
<p>
“
That
's
a
jolly
bad
course
,
”
observed
Castleton
.
</p>
<p>
The
women
appeared
to
be
speechless
.
</p>
<p>
Stewart
checked
his
horse
at
the
deep
cut
where
the
trail
started
down
.
</p>
<p>
“
Boys
,
drop
over
,
and
go
slow
,
”
he
said
,
dismounting
.
“
Flo
,
you
follow
.
Now
,
ladies
,
let
your
horses
loose
and
hold
on
.
Lean
forward
and
hang
to
the
pommel
.
It
looks
bad
.
But
the
horses
are
used
to
such
trails
.
