Penzance
</hi>
</ref>
(
Cornish
:
<hi rend="italic">
Pennsans
</hi>
)
is
the
most
south-westerly
town
in
<ref target="Cornwall">
Cornwall
</ref>
.
Famous
for
its
association
with
the
Gilbert
and
Sullivan
opera
(
now
often
played
as
a
<ref target="musical">
musical
</ref>
)
<hi rend="italic">
The
Pirates
of
Penzance
</hi>
,
the
town
is
an
ideal
base
for
exploring
the
Penwith
area
of
Cornwall
.
It
is
increasingly
attracting
those
interested
in
cultural
tourism
due
to
its
long
association
with
the
arts
.
<p>
Penzance
is
the
main
link
with
the
<ref target="Isles%20of%20Scilly">
Isles
of
Scilly
</ref>
via
the
spring
and
summer-only
ferry
.

has
flights
from
London
(

)
,
Dublin
,
Leeds
Bradford
,

.
It
's
about
30
miles
(
48
km
)
away
from
Penzance
by
A3075
and
A30
,
reckon
45
min
by
car
.
Its
two
disadvantages
are
(
i
)
most
flights
are
summer
only
;
(
ii
)
public
transport
is
tricky
as
first
you
have
to
get
the
bus
into
<ref target="Newquay">
Newquay
</ref>
(
last
bus
around
6:30PM
)
,
then
rely
on
an
infrequent
bus
or
branch-line
train
for
connections
to
Penzance
.
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
<ref target="Exeter">
Exeter
</ref>
Airport
</hi>
(

further
but

a
simpler
option
.

has
more
flights
year-round
,
the
airport
bus
runs

&quot;
Skybus
&quot;
aircraft
are
small
fixed-wing
twin-props

so
your
total
baggage
limit
is
only
15
kg
,
and
flights
can
be
grounded
by
weather
that
would
n't
bother
an
Airbus
or
737
.
There
's
also
a
helicopter
service
,
using
a
10-seater
