CHAPTER
XXII
</head>
<p>
A
WEEK
is
gone
;
LE
JOUR
DES
NOCES
arrived
;
the
marriage
was
solemnized
at
St.
Jacques
;
Mdlle
.
Zoraide
became
Madame
Pelet
,
NEE
Reuter
;
and
,
in
about
an
hour
after
this
transformation
,
“
the
happy
pair
,
”
as
newspapers
phrase
it
,
were
on
their
way
to
Paris
;
where
,
according
to
previous
arrangement
,
the
honeymoon
was
to
be
spent
.
The
next
day
I
quitted
the
pensionnat
.
Myself
and
my
chattels
(
some
books
and
clothes
)
were
soon
transferred
to
a
modest
lodging
I
had
hired
in
a
street
not
far
off
.
In
half
an
hour
my
clothes
were
arranged
in
a
commode
,
my
books
on
a
shelf
,
and
the
“
flitting
”
was
effected
.
I
should
not
have
been
unhappy
that
day
had
not
one
pang
tortured
me
--
a
longing
to
go
to
the
Rue
Notre
Dame
aux
Neiges
,
resisted
,
yet
irritated
by
an
inward
resolve
to
avoid
that
street
till
such
time
as
the
mist
of
doubt
should
clear
from
my
prospects
.
</p>
<p>
It
was
a
sweet
September
evening
--
very
mild
,
very
still
;
I
had
nothing
to
do
;
at
that
hour
I
knew
Frances
would
be
equally
released
from
occupation
;
I
thought
she
might
possibly
be
wishing
for
her
master
,
I
knew
I
wished
for
my
pupil
.
Imagination
began
with
her
low
whispers
,
infusing
into
my
soul
the
soft
tale
of
pleasures
that
might
be
.
</p>
<p>
“
You
will
find
her
reading
or
writing
,
”
said
she
;
“
you
can
take
your
seat
at
her
side
;
you
need
not
startle
her
peace
by
undue
excitement
;
you
need
not
embarrass
her
manner
by
unusual
action
or
language
.
Be
as
you
always
are
;
look
over
what
she
has
written
;
listen
while
she
reads
;
chide
her
,
or
quietly
approve
;
you
know
the
effect
of
either
system
;
you
know
her
smile
when
pleased
,
you
know
the
play
of
her
looks
when
roused
;
you
have
the
secret
of
awakening
what
expression
you
will
,
and
you
can
choose
amongst
that
pleasant
variety
.
With
you
she
will
sit
silent
as
long
as
it
suits
you
to
talk
alone
;
you
can
hold
her
under
a
potent
spell
:
intelligent
as
she
is
,
eloquent
as
she
can
be
,
you
can
seal
her
lips
,
and
veil
her
bright
countenance
with
diffidence
;
yet
,
you
know
,
she
is
not
all
monotonous
mildness
;
you
have
seen
,
with
a
sort
of
strange
pleasure
,
revolt
,
scorn
,
austerity
,
bitterness
,
lay
energetic
claim
to
a
place
in
her
feelings
and
physiognomy
;
you
know
that
few
could
rule
her
as
you
do
;
you
know
she
might
break
,
but
never
bend
under
the
hand
of
Tyranny
and
Injustice
,
but
Reason
and
Affection
can
guide
her
by
a
sign
.
Try
their
influence
now
.
Go
--
they
are
not
passions
;
you
may
handle
them
safely
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
will
NOT
go
was
my
answer
to
the
sweet
temptress
.
A
man
is
master
of
himself
to
a
certain
point
,
but
not
beyond
it
.
Could
I
seek
Frances
to-night
,
could
I
sit
with
her
alone
in
a
quiet
room
,
and
address
her
only
in
the
language
of
Reason
and
Affection
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
No
,
”
was
the
brief
,
fervent
reply
of
that
Love
which
had
conquered
and
now
controlled
me
.
</p>
<p>
Time
seemed
to
stagnate
;
the
sun
would
not
go
down
;
my
watch
ticked
,
but
I
thought
the
hands
were
paralyzed
.
</p>
<p>
“
What
a
hot
evening
!
”
I
cried
,
throwing
open
the
lattice
;
for
,
indeed
,
I
had
seldom
felt
so
feverish
.
Hearing
a
step
ascending
the
common
stair
,
I
wondered
whether
the
“
locataire
,
”
now
mounting
to
his
apartments
,
were
as
unsettled
in
mind
and
condition
as
I
was
,
or
whether
he
lived
in
the
calm
of
certain
resources
,
and
in
the
freedom
of
unfettered
feelings
.
What
!
was
he
coming
in
person
to
solve
the
problem
hardly
proposed
in
inaudible
thought
?
He
had
actually
knocked
at
the
door
--
at
MY
door
;
a
smart
,
prompt
rap
;
and
,
almost
before
I
could
invite
him
in
,
he
was
over
the
threshold
,
and
had
closed
the
door
behind
him
.
</p>
<p>
“
And
how
are
you
?
”
asked
an
indifferent
,
quiet
voice
,
in
the
English
language
;
while
my
visitor
,
without
any
sort
of
bustle
or
introduction
,
put
his
hat
on
the
table
,
and
his
gloves
into
his
hat
,
and
drawing
the
only
armchair
the
room
afforded
a
little
forward
,
seated
himself
tranquilly
therein
.
</p>
<p>
“
Ca
n’t
you
speak
?
”
he
inquired
in
a
few
moments
,
in
a
tone
whose
nonchalance
seemed
to
intimate
that
it
was
much
the
same
thing
whether
I
answered
or
not
.
The
fact
is
,
I
found
it
desirable
to
have
recourse
to
my
good
friends
“
les
besicles
;
”
not
exactly
to
ascertain
the
identity
of
my
visitor
--
for
I
already
knew
him
,
confound
his
impudence
!
but
to
see
how
he
looked
--
to
get
a
clear
notion
of
his
mien
and
countenance
.
I
wiped
the
glasses
very
deliberately
,
and
put
them
on
quite
as
deliberately
;
adjusting
them
so
as
not
to
hurt
the
bridge
of
my
nose
or
get
entangled
in
my
short
tufts
of
dun
hair
.
I
was
sitting
in
the
window-seat
,
with
my
back
to
the
light
,
and
I
had
him
VIS-A-VIS
;
a
position
he
would
much
rather
have
had
reversed
;
for
,
at
any
time
,
he
preferred
scrutinizing
to
being
scrutinized
.
Yes
,
it
was
HE
,
and
no
mistake
,
with
his
six
feet
of
length
arranged
in
a
sitting
attitude
;
with
his
dark
travelling
surtout
with
its
velvet
collar
,
his
gray
pantaloons
,
his
black
stock
,
and
his
face
,
the
most
original
one
Nature
ever
modelled
,
yet
the
least
obtrusively
so
;
not
one
feature
that
could
be
termed
marked
or
odd
,
yet
the
effect
of
the
whole
unique
.
There
is
no
use
in
attempting
to
describe
what
is
indescribable
.
Being
in
no
hurry
to
address
him
,
I
sat
and
stared
at
my
ease
.
