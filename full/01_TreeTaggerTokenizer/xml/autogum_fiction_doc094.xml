Chapter
II
.
The
Law
of
Club
and
Fang
</head>
<p>
Buck
’s
first
day
on
the
Dyea
beach
was
like
a
nightmare
.
Every
hour
was
filled
with
shock
and
surprise
.
He
had
been
suddenly
jerked
from
the
heart
of
civilization
and
flung
into
the
heart
of
things
primordial
.
No
lazy
,
sun-kissed
life
was
this
,
with
nothing
to
do
but
loaf
and
be
bored
.
Here
was
neither
peace
,
nor
rest
,
nor
a
moment
’s
safety
.
All
was
confusion
and
action
,
and
every
moment
life
and
limb
were
in
peril
.
There
was
imperative
need
to
be
constantly
alert
;
for
these
dogs
and
men
were
not
town
dogs
and
men
.
They
were
savages
,
all
of
them
,
who
knew
no
law
but
the
law
of
club
and
fang
.
</p>
<p>
He
had
never
seen
dogs
fight
as
these
wolfish
creatures
fought
,
and
his
first
experience
taught
him
an
unforgetable
lesson
.
It
is
true
,
it
was
a
vicarious
experience
,
else
he
would
not
have
lived
to
profit
by
it
.
Curly
was
the
victim
.
They
were
camped
near
the
log
store
,
where
she
,
in
her
friendly
way
,
made
advances
to
a
husky
dog
the
size
of
a
full-grown
wolf
,
though
not
half
so
large
as
she
.
There
was
no
warning
,
only
a
leap
in
like
a
flash
,
a
metallic
clip
of
teeth
,
a
leap
out
equally
swift
,
and
Curly
’s
face
was
ripped
open
from
eye
to
jaw
.
</p>
<p>
It
was
the
wolf
manner
of
fighting
,
to
strike
and
leap
away
;
but
there
was
more
to
it
than
this
.
Thirty
or
forty
huskies
ran
to
the
spot
and
surrounded
the
combatants
in
an
intent
and
silent
circle
.
Buck
did
not
comprehend
that
silent
intentness
,
nor
the
eager
way
with
which
they
were
licking
their
chops
.
Curly
rushed
her
antagonist
,
who
struck
again
and
leaped
aside
.
He
met
her
next
rush
with
his
chest
,
in
a
peculiar
fashion
that
tumbled
her
off
her
feet
.
She
never
regained
them
,
This
was
what
the
onlooking
huskies
had
waited
for
.
They
closed
in
upon
her
,
snarling
and
yelping
,
and
she
was
buried
,
screaming
with
agony
,
beneath
the
bristling
mass
of
bodies
.
</p>
<p>
So
sudden
was
it
,
and
so
unexpected
,
that
Buck
was
taken
aback
.
He
saw
Spitz
run
out
his
scarlet
tongue
in
a
way
he
had
of
laughing
;
and
he
saw
François
,
swinging
an
axe
,
spring
into
the
mess
of
dogs
.
Three
men
with
clubs
were
helping
him
to
scatter
them
.
It
did
not
take
long
.
Two
minutes
from
the
time
Curly
went
down
,
the
last
of
her
assailants
were
clubbed
off
.
But
she
lay
there
limp
and
lifeless
in
the
bloody
,
trampled
snow
,
almost
literally
torn
to
pieces
,
the
swart
half-breed
standing
over
her
and
cursing
horribly
.
The
scene
often
came
back
to
Buck
to
trouble
him
in
his
sleep
.
So
that
was
the
way
.
No
fair
play
.
Once
down
,
that
was
the
end
of
you
.
Well
,
he
would
see
to
it
that
he
never
went
down
.
Spitz
ran
out
his
tongue
and
laughed
again
,
and
from
that
moment
Buck
hated
him
with
a
bitter
and
deathless
hatred
.
</p>
<p>
Before
he
had
recovered
from
the
shock
caused
by
the
tragic
passing
of
Curly
,
he
received
another
shock
.
François
fastened
upon
him
an
arrangement
of
straps
and
buckles
.
It
was
a
harness
,
such
as
he
had
seen
the
grooms
put
on
the
horses
at
home
.
And
as
he
had
seen
horses
work
,
so
he
was
set
to
work
,
hauling
François
on
a
sled
to
the
forest
that
fringed
the
valley
,
and
returning
with
a
load
of
firewood
.
Though
his
dignity
was
sorely
hurt
by
thus
being
made
a
draught
animal
,
he
was
too
wise
to
rebel
.
He
buckled
down
with
a
will
and
did
his
best
,
though
it
was
all
new
and
strange
.
François
was
stern
,
demanding
instant
obedience
,
and
by
virtue
of
his
whip
receiving
instant
obedience
;
while
Dave
,
who
was
an
experienced
wheeler
,
nipped
Buck
’s
hind
quarters
whenever
he
was
in
error
.
Spitz
was
the
leader
,
likewise
experienced
,
and
while
he
could
not
always
get
at
Buck
,
he
growled
sharp
reproof
now
and
again
,
or
cunningly
threw
his
weight
in
the
traces
to
jerk
Buck
into
the
way
he
should
go
.
Buck
learned
easily
,
and
under
the
combined
tuition
of
his
two
mates
and
François
made
remarkable
progress
.
Ere
they
returned
to
camp
he
knew
enough
to
stop
at
“
ho
,
”
to
go
ahead
at
“
mush
,
”
to
swing
wide
on
the
bends
,
and
to
keep
clear
of
the
wheeler
when
the
loaded
sled
shot
downhill
at
their
heels
.
</p>
<p>
“
T’ree
vair
’
good
dogs
,
”
François
told
Perrault
.
“
Dat
Buck
,
heem
pool
lak
hell
.
I
tich
heem
queek
as
anyt’ing
.
”
</p>
<p>
By
afternoon
,
Perrault
,
who
was
in
a
hurry
to
be
on
the
trail
with
his
despatches
,
returned
with
two
more
dogs
.
“
Billee
”
and
“
Joe
”
he
called
them
,
two
brothers
,
and
true
huskies
both
.
Sons
of
the
one
mother
though
they
were
,
they
were
as
different
as
day
and
night
.
Billee
’s
one
fault
was
his
excessive
good
nature
,
while
Joe
was
the
very
opposite
,
sour
and
introspective
,
with
a
perpetual
snarl
and
a
malignant
eye
.
Buck
received
them
in
comradely
fashion
,
Dave
ignored
them
,
while
Spitz
proceeded
to
thrash
first
one
and
then
the
other
.
Billee
wagged
his
tail
appeasingly
,
turned
to
run
when
he
saw
that
appeasement
was
of
no
avail
,
and
cried
(
still
appeasingly
)
when
Spitz
’s
sharp
teeth
scored
his
flank
.
But
no
matter
how
Spitz
circled
,
Joe
whirled
around
on
his
heels
to
face
him
,
mane
bristling
,
ears
laid
back
,
lips
writhing
and
snarling
,
jaws
clipping
together
as
fast
as
he
could
snap
,
and
eyes
diabolically
gleaming
—
the
incarnation
of
belligerent
fear
.
So
terrible
was
his
appearance
that
Spitz
was
forced
to
forego
disciplining
him
;
but
to
cover
his
own
discomfiture
he
turned
upon
the
inoffensive
and
wailing
Billee
and
drove
him
to
the
confines
of
the
camp
.
