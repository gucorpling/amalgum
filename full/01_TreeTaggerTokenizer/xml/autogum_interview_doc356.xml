ruling
</p>
<p>
Frederick
M.
Abbott
,
the
WIPO
arbitrator
,
ruled
that
Eiland-Hall
had
legitimate
interest
in
the
domain
name
of
the
website
he
created
.
&quot;
Respondent
appears
to
the
Panel
to
be
engaged
in
a
parody
of
the
style
or
methodology
that
Respondent
appears
genuinely
to
believe
is
employed
by
Complainant
in
the
provision
of
political
commentary
,
and
for
that
reason
Respondent
can
be
said
to
be
making
a
political
statement
.
This
constitutes
a
legitimate
non-commercial
use
of
Complainant
’s
mark
under
the
Policy
,
&quot;
said
the
WIPO
ruling
.
The
WIPO
arbitrator
commented
that
the
panel
was
&quot;
very
reluctant
to
reject
respondent
’s
claim
of
legitimate
noncommercial
and
fair
use
,
&quot;
and
noted
,
&quot;
Were
we
to
hold
otherwise
,
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
political
cartoonists
and
satirists
would
be
subjected
to
damages
awards
without
any
showing
that
their
work
falsely
defamed
its
subject
.

The
<hi rend="italic">
Hustler
Magazine
v.
Falwell
</hi>
U.S.
Supreme
Court
case
was
cited
by
the
WIPO
arbitrator
in
the
ruling
,
&quot;
This
panel
considers
that
if
Internet
users
view
the
disputed
domain
name
in
combination
with
a
visit
to
respondent
’s
website
,
the
‘
total
effect
’
is
that
of
political
commentary
by
respondent
,
capable
of
protection
as
political
speech
by
the
1st
Amendment

After
the
WIPO
ruling
,
Eiland-Hall
decided
to
voluntarily
relinquish
ownership
of
the
domain
name
and
hand
it
over
to
Glenn
Beck
.
On
Friday
,
Eiland-Hall
sent
a
letter
to
Beck
,
and
pointed
out
that
Beck
's
actions
only
served
to
further
increase
publicity
to
the
meme
described
on
the
website
.
&quot;
It
bears
observing
that
by
bringing
the
WIPO
complaint
,
you
took
what
was
merely
one
small
critique
meme
,
in
a
sea
of
internet
memes
,
and
turned
it
into
a
super-meme
.
Then
,
in
pressing
forward
(
by
not
withdrawing
the
complaint
and
instead
filing
additional
briefs
)
,
you
turned
the
super-meme
into
an
object
lesson
in
First
Amendment
principles
,
&quot;
wrote
Eiland-Hall
in
the
letter
to
Beck
.
</p>
<p>
Eiland-Hall
criticized
Beck
's
actions
with
regard
to
the
First
Amendment
to
the
U.S.
Constitution
,
writing
,
&quot;
It
also
bears
noting
,
in
this
matter
and
for
the
future
,
that
you
are
entirely
in
control
of
whether
or
not
you
are
the
subject
of
this
particular
kind
of
criticism
.
I
chose
to
criticize
you
using
the
well-tested
method
of
satire
because
of
its
effectiveness
.
But
,
humor
aside
,
your
rhetorical
style
is
no
laughing
matter
.
In
this
context
of
this
WIPO
case
,
you
denigrated
the
letter
of
First
Amendment
law
.
In
the
context
of
your
television
show
and
your
notoriety
,
you
routinely
and
shamelessly
denigrate
the
spirit
of
the
First
Amendment
&quot;
.
He
stated
that
he
persevered
in
the
case
in
order
to
uphold
the
value
of
the
First
Amendment
to
the
U.S.
Constitution
,
&quot;
I
want
to
demonstrate
to
you
that
I
had
my
lawyer
fight
this
battle
only
to
help
preserve
the
First
Amendment
.
Now
that
it
is
safe
,
at
least
from
you
(
for
the
time
being
)
,
I
have
no
more
use
for
the
actual
scrap
of
digital
real
estate
you
sought
...
&quot;
A
representative
of
Beck
declined
to
provide
a
comment
about
the
WIPO
ruling
