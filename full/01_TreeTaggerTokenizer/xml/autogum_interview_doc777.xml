In
what
opportunities
did
you
become
a
commentator
from
a
wrestling
fan
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Orange
</hi>
:
Generally
,
I
'm
not
a
notable
person
,
I
just
use
the
media
as
a
promotion
tool
because
we
[
the
public
]
ca
n't
look
down
the
strengths
and
impacts
of
public
opinions
and
mass
media
.
At
that
time
,
due
to
some
coordination
on
behalf
of
broadcasting
rights
of
TV
programs
,
and
many
serious
piracy
and
copyright
issues
in
Taiwan
,
furthermore
,
pirates
often
used
discussion
boards
to
promote
piracy
.
Those
badly
harmed
several
companies
who
do
an
agent
of
genuine
copies
.
And
accidentally
,
after
a
TV
broadcaster
grasped
its
opportunities
on
wrestling
TV
programs
,
I
finally
joined
their
production
for
commentary
and
planning
of
wrestling
programs
until
now
.

Undergoing
with
trendy
changes
of
wrestling
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Orange
</hi>
:
I
met
those
opportunities
coincidentally
because
when
no
one
want
to
do
it
,
and
senior
elites
from
media
industry
may
not
spare
time
to
do
production
.
I
felt
luckily
on
those
undergoing
experiences
.

<p>

</hi>
Before
(
its
)
production
,
what
's
your
opinion
on
similar
programs
especially
in
Chinese-language
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Orange
</hi>
:
It
's
difficult
or
impossible
for
a
broadcaster
to
produce
their
own
and
significant
program
because
the
public
opinion
have
their
wrong
bias
on
wrestling
.
If
the
bias
can
be
corrected
,
I
think
the
public
will
not
consider
it
as
just
a
&quot;
fighting
&quot;
or
a
&quot;
violent
&quot;
sport
,
or
to
say
:
&quot;
What
are
they
doing
?
&quot;
I
chose
the
series
programs
of
World
Wrestling
Entertainment
because
of
its
packages
rather
than
a
fistfight
match
which
contained
several
complex
rules
like
points
or
fouls
,
or
just
results
rather
than
its
content
.
Generally
,
if
a
significant
program
can
be
promoted
,
I
think
several
wrong
bias
of
wrestling
should
be
corrected
.

Generally
OK
.
In
your
opinion
,
which
pro-wrestling
match
do
you
recommend
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Orange
</hi>
:
There
were
several
feature
or
significant
matches
in
their
own
years
.
But
I
recommended
two
classic
matches
like
NWA
Championship
in
1989
-
&quot;
Ric
Flair
vs
Ricky
Steamboat
&quot;
,
and
a
Steel
Cage
Match
in
1981
-
&quot;
Ric
Flair
vs
Jimmy
'
Super
Fly
'
Snuka
&quot;
.

Back
to
the
topic
of
wrestling
in
Taiwan
,
besides
of
media
,
which
tool
will
you
use
to
promote
it
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Orange
</hi>
:
The
Internet
-
another
media
,
a
better
way
differ
than
mass
media
.
By
the
way
,
by
holding
periodical
friendship
matches
,
it
will
work
more
effective
.
And
of
course
,
we
[
the
IWL
]
hope
the
(
friendship
)
matches
can
be
held
not
only
in
Taipei
but
also
in
several
divisions
in
Central
or
Southern
Taiwan
to
correct
conceptions
on
wrestling
in
a
simple
but
relaxed
match
style
.
