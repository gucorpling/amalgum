Vacation
Advice
?

<sp who="#Kahluka">
<p>
My
husband
and
I
are
going
to
be
in
Key
West
for
a
wedding
this
week
and
we
have
Saturday
and
Sunday
to
ourselves
,
I
was
wondering
if
there
's
anything
you
guys
can
suggest
that
we
can
do
for
fun
!
I
've
looked
up
some
things
and
found
the
aquarium
and
a
few
cool
places
,
but
getting
the
local
scoop
is
always
nice
.
If
anyone
has
any
good
food
,
beer
or
happy
hour
recommendations
as
well
that
would
be
fantastic
.
</p>

<p>
I
'm
not
a
local
but
I
've
been
there
several
times
and
just
recently
got
back
so
this
is
all
very
fresh
in
my
mind
.
</p>
<p>
Hog
's
breath
can
get
busy
late
at
night
but
we
've
always
enjoyed
some
day
drinking
there
when
it
's
slow
.
Good
live
music
,
good
food
.
</p>
<p>
Sloppy
Joe
's
is
one
of
the
most
well
known
bars
in
Key
West
.
Have
a
drink
or
two
and
listen
to
some
music
,
but
do
n't
bother
with
the
food
it
's
nothing
special
.
</p>
<p>
The
Green
Parrot
.
The
house
beer
is
awesome
,
they
do
live
music
often
,
it
's
just
got
a
really
good
atmosphere
.
</p>
<p>
Garbo
's
grill
has
great
food
.
It
's
basically
just
a
food
truck
with
a
small
bar
next
to
it
.
</p>
<p>
First
Flight
used
to
be
Kelly
's
.
I
liked
Kelly
's
better
but
they
have
Tito
's
on
tap
and
the
Mo-Tito
was
life
changing
.
</p>
<p>
Waterfront
Brewery
has
pretty
good
beer
and
good
happy
hour
deals
.
</p>
<p>
Two
Friends
Happy
Hour
for
Margaritas
and
Shrimp
</p>
<p>
Jet
Ski
tours
are
a
lot
of
fun
,
we
've
always
gone
Fury
and
have
been
very
happen
with
them
.
</p>
<p>
I
'd
also
recommend
Lazy
Dog
Kayaks
,
the
pickup
service
is
very
convenient
and
getting
away
from
the
busy
waterfront
and
downtown
area
is
nice
.
</p>
<p>
I
'd
recommend
getting
bikes
especially
since
you
're
there
for
a
short
while
and
may
want
to
get
around
quickly
.
Another
option
is
the
Duval
Loop
bus
route
:
https
:
www.carfreekeywest.com
duval-loop-bus
It
's
a
free
bus
route
that
will
run
you
around
the
busiest
areas
.
</p>
<p>
If
you
want
to
go
to
a
beach
go
to
Fort
Zachary
.
</p>
<p>
If
you
go
to
Hemingway
House
go
across
the
street
to
the
Mojito
Bar
before
and
or
after
.
Happy
Hour
12-3
,
good
,
cheap
rum
punch
.
</p>
<p>
For
sunset
you
have
three
options
.
</p>
<p>
Mallory
Square
is
interesting
but
very
crowded
.
</p>
<p>
Take
a
sunset
charter
boat
.
I
recommend
Danger
Charters
Wind
and
Wine
.
Some
companies
have
big
party
barges
and
it
just
does
n't
look
very
fun
,
though
I
've
never
been
on
one
of
those
.
</p>
<p>
Finally
,
there
is
a
Coast
Guard
cutter
museum
ship
that
you
can
tour
.
They
open
back
up
one
hour
before
sunset
for
$
5
.
They
have
some
drinks
available
and
the
cost
helps
maintain
a
piece
of
history
.
</p>
<p>
I
could
go
on
but
I
should
probably
stop
.
</p>
<p>
Ok
,
One
more
thing
Ana
's
Cuban
Cafe
has
the
best
breakfast
and
coffee
,
it
's
near
the
Southernmost
point
.
Get
a
Cafe-con-leche
with
sugar
.
