The
Present
Issue
</head>
<p>
This
special
issue
consists
of
twelve
papers
presenting
state-of-the-art
innovations
covering
several
aspects
of
several
transportation
means
.
The
contents
of
these
papers
are
introduced
here
.
</p>
<p>
Vehicular
networks
have
been
the
most
addressed
topic
in
the
current
issue
,
although
it
has
been
explored
from
different
perspectives
.
The
work
in
presents
a
cross-layer
methodology
to
coordinate
vehicular
congestion
and
awareness
control
protocols
.
The
coordination
methodology
,
so-called
COMPAS
,
does
not
require
changing
the
original
protocols
and
solves
negative
interactions
or
conflicts
that
may
arise
between
such
protocols
when
operating
independently
of
each
other
.
Another
work
focused
on
traffic
management
but
,
in
this
case
,
from
a
centralized
approach
is
presented
in
.
Authors
propose
a
novel
traffic
management
server
capable
of
handling
all
the
traffic
in
a
city
,
while
balancing
traffic
flows
by
accounting
for
present
and
future
traffic
congestion
conditions
.
This
proposal
is
evaluated
by
computer
simulations
and
experimental
tests
showing
substantial
improvements
in
terms
of
travel
times
and
average
travel
speed
of
vehicles
,
reducing
congestion
and
improving
traffic
fluidity
.
In
,
the
authors
present
a
precise
emergency
material
scheduling
model
using
vehicular
communications
.
This
work
provides
a
comprehensive
method
to
make
an
emergency
material
scheduling
plan
considering
the
actual
situation
of
disaster
depots
.
In
turn
,
a
warning
system
to
protect
pedestrians
in
urban
scenarios
using
a
communication
system
is
studied
in
.
Concretely
,
authors
design
four
different
algorithms
to
define
when
to
trigger
alerts
in
the
warning
system
with
the
focus
on
avoiding
the
generation
of
too
many
unnecessary
alerts
.
This
proposal
is
evaluated
via
computer
simulation
.
Finally
,
authors
of
propose
to
virtualize
vehicle
On
Board
Units
(
OBUs
)
and
develop
a
novel
Multi-Access
Edge
Computing
(
MEC
)
layer
in
order
to
offload
processing
from
the
vehicle
and
serving
data-access
requests
.
The
obtained
results
reveal
a
speed-up
of
more
than
50
%
in
the
data
request
resolution
,
with
consequently
great
savings
of
network
resources
in
the
wireless
segment
.

Aligned
with
vehicular
networks
,
cybersecurity
is
of
prominent
importance
and
it
has
been
also
addressed
in
two
contributions
.
The
work
in
focuses
on
the
security
of
Communication-Based
Train
Controls
(
CBTC
)
systems
,
by
employing
a
generalized
stochastic
Petri
net
(
GSPN
)
model
to
capture
the
dynamic
interaction
between
the
attacker
and
the
defender
.
From
this
study
,
a
series
of
security
indicators
to
evaluate
the
security
of
CBTC
systems
under
attack
â€“
defense
confrontation
is
proposed
.
From
a
different
perspective
,
cybersecurity
is
also
addressed
in
.
In
this
case
,
the
authors
evaluate
the
impact
of
using
certificate-based
authentication
mechanisms
in
vehicular
networks
in
terms
of
the
added
delay
due
to
communication
and
processing
tasks
.
Authors
found
that
implicit
authentication
schemes
are
better
suited
than
the
explicit
ones
in
vehicular
scenarios
.
</p>
<p>
Maritime
environments
have
been
also
explored
in
different
papers
but
considering
different
use
cases
.
On
the
one
hand
,
a
novel
tracking
by
detection
mechanism
is
proposed
in
to
detect
and
track
surrounding
vessels
of
Unmanned
Surface
Vessels
(
USV
)
to
avoid
collision
at
sea
.
The
authors
present
a
framework
that
integrates
the
multimodel
and
multi0cue
pipeline
and
evaluate
it
by
using
two
public
maritime
datasets
showing
its
great
performance
.
On
the
other
hand
,
the
work
in
proposes
the
use
of
LoRa
(
Long
Range
)
transmission
technology
for
tracking
and
monitoring
boats
in
port
areas
.
A
real
experiment
is
presented
and
the
obtained
outcomes
confirm
the
validity
of
the
proposal
for
monitoring
activities
and
maneuvers
inside
the
port
or
close
to
the
shore
.
</p>
<p>
Other
works
have
addressed
diverse
topics
related
to
improve
the
performance
of
on-board
monitoring
systems
or
optimize
the
location
of
electric
charging
stations
.
Work
in
proposes
a
Raspberry
Pi-based
system
for
measuring
friction
between
the
types
of
a
vehicle
and
the
road
,
aiming
at
improving
traffic
safety
.
The
presented
results
show
a
better
performance
of
the
developed
prototype
in
comparison
with
professional
vehicle
performance
computers
.
The
authors
of
present
a
novel
framework
for
estimating
the
vehicle
sideslip
angle
.
This
proposal
is
evaluated
through
experimental
tests
,
evidencing
that
it
is
able
to
reliably
estimate
the
vehicle
sideslip
angle
during
both
steady
state
and
transient
maneuvers
.
Finally
,
a
decentralized
optimization
model
for
dispatching
electric
charging
stations
is
presented
in
.
The
aim
of
this
solution
is
to
maximize
the
profit
of
the
charging
stations
,
but
it
also
considers
other
user-related
factors
.
The
results
obtained
by
numerical
simulations
indicate
that
the
adopted
strategy
increases
the
profit
of
the
charging
stations
as
well
as
maintains
a
good
level
of
computation
efficiency
and
stability
.
