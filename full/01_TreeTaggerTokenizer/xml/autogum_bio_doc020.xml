In

Taniguchi
had
suggested

physicians
should
be
aware
of
the
severity
of
clinical
symptoms
that
endometriosis
might
cause
.
According
to
them
,
a
physician
should
take
into
consideration
the
age
of
the
patient
,
the
duration
of
infertility
and
the
stage
in
which
the
disease
is
in
,
in
order
to
suggest
proper
treatment
.
Before
considering
anything
,
a
clinician
should
study
the
patients
