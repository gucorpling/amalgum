Start
a
Sleep
Spa
</head>
<p>
A
Sleep
Spa
is
a
place
you
can
create
with
little
or
no
capital
.
It
is
not
a
business
but
a
mindset
.
It
is
a
place
for
your
client
to
feel
comfortable
,
happy
,
and
calm
.

Get
an
Apartment
.
If
you
are
sleeping
under
a
bridge
that
's
ok
,
just
be
aware
that
you
may
not
be
ready
to
start
a
world
class
Sleep
Spa
.
First
you
're
going
to
need
a
clean
and
comfortable
apartment
in
a
pretty
nice
neighborhood
.
You
do
n't
want
your
client
to
have
to
fight
criminals
or
wolves
on
the
way
to
your
doorstep
.

Get
some
amenities
.
Its
important
to
have
a
way
to
differentiate
yourself
from
other
Sleep
Spas
.
That
's
the
surest
way
to
attract
high
quality
clientele
.
Clients
like
things
like
sleep
masks
,
clean
sheets
,
cooling
fans
,
warm
furnaces
,
and
pleasing
lighting
schematics
.
Definitely
make
sure
you
have
these
and
once
your
operation
is
underway
start
to
add
new
features
as
frequently
as
possible
.
Some
of
the
most
notable
full
service
Sleep
Spas
offer
personal
chefs
,
chauffeurs
,
and
in-house
physical
therapists
.
Building
a
Sleep
Spa
from
the
ground
up
can
be
daunting
but
its
important
to
remember
that
new
amenities
and
features
can
be
added
slowly
over
time
.

Pick
a
a
motto
.
You
may
consider
focusing
on
the
sleep
experience
when
creating
a
tag
line
for
your
Sleep
Spa
.
A
motto
like
&quot;
The
Sleep
Spa
,
where
everybody
gets
nine
hours
&quot;
is
a
great
way
to
market
and
draw
attention
to
your
budding
business
.
</item>
<item>
Get
a
client
.
A
Sleep
Spa
is
just
an
apartment
without
a
lovely
client
to
bring
your
services
to
life
.
Clients
come
in
many
shapes
and
forms
,
but
keep
in
mind
that
the
best
Sleep
Spas
cater
to
only
one
client
at
a
time
so
make
sure
you
chose
your
client
wisely
!

Continue
to
provide
world
renowned
sleep
services
.
A
Sleep
Spa
is
live-changing
undertaking
.
As
many
small
business
owners
say
,
you
will
have
to
work
24/7
when
you
are
operating
a
Sleep
Spa
,
but
at
least
you
can
pick
the
days
and
the
hours
!

Tips
</head>
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Do
n't
overbook
your
Sleep
Spa
.
It
's
ok
to
have
more
than
one
guest
at
the
Spa
on
occasion
,
but
keep
this
to
a
minimum
.
When
running
a
Sleep
Spa
,
your
product
is
a
luxury
experience
.
You
do
n't
want
to
diminish
this
by
creating
a
Youth
Hostel
.

<item>
If
you
are
eventually
considering
turning
your
Sleep
Spa
into
a
franchise
,
consider
reinvesting
all
of
your
dividends
for
rapid
grow
.
</item>
<item>
Make
sure
to
ask
your
client
for
constant
feedback
about
the
climate
,
conditions
,
and
amenities
at
your
Sleep
Spa
.
She
will
have
definite
ideas
and
preferences
and
this
is
an
invaluable
guide
while
you
are
starting
out
.
