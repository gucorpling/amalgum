The
model
that
is
employed
in
this
work
is
the
dual-polarization
ECM
which
refers
to
the
second-order
RC
circuit
as
shown
in
<figure>
Figure

</figure>
.
It
represents
the
time-dependent
polarization
processes
taking
place
during
charge/discharge
,
the
relaxation
effect
and
the
equilibrium
open
circuit
in
the
battery
cells
.
At
a
current
passage
,
the
terminal
voltage
diverges
from
the
due
to
material
resistivity
,
electrochemical
reactions
and
diffusion
processes
.
</p>
<p>
The
ECM
considers
the
load
demand
,
the
initial
SoC
of
the
cells
and
the
temperature
as
inputs
in
order
to
estimate
the
terminal
voltage
and
the
states
of
the
Li-ion
cells
which
are
described
by
Equation
(
1
)
:
(
1
)
where
is
the
OCV
obtained
from
the
experiment
,
is
Ohmic
resistance
,
and
represent
the
activation
(
electrochemical
)
and
the
concentration
polarization
respectively
(
m
)
with
the
capacitances
(
and
in
)
as
to
relate
the
voltage
drops
across
them
(
and
in
mV
)
with
the
two
different
time-constant
.
The
former
,
activation
polarization
is
associated
with
the
charge-transfer
and
the
SEI
layer
build
up
resistance
.
The
latter
accounts
a
concentration
gradient
build-up
taking
place
at
current
flow
or
during
vice-versa
during
relaxation
,
represented
by
.
is
the
current
flow
through
the
battery
cells
(
Amps
)
with
a
sampling
period
of
s
and
it
is
considered
negative
for
charge
.
</p>
<p>
Since
the
impedance
is
dependent
on
the
SoC
,
a
function
for
this
purpose
is
integrated
in
the
DP
ECM
.
Generally
,
the
SoC
of
cells
can
be
estimated
with
OCV(SoC)-based
method
,
with
power
electronics
such
as
online
EIS
measurement
,
model-based-estimation
and
machine
learning
algorithms
,
and
Ah(Coulomb)-counting
,
as
it
thoughtfully
discussed
in
previous
studies
.
Challenges
with
certain
chemistries
can
rise
,
as
for
LFP
’s
low
at
the
slow
dynamic
area
and
its
hysteresis
effect
makes
OCV
(
SoC)-based
methods
not
optimal
,
whereas
EIS-based
measurements
lack
accuracy
through
ageing
and
the
estimations
are
highly
influenced
from
chemistry
and
experimental
conditions
.
Also
,
due
to
overload
on
computational
complexity
and
memory
storage
or
lack
of
accuracy
,
most
implementation
are
to
not
suitable
for
on-board
applications
.
However
,
certain
model-based
methods
and
the
Ah-counting
are
proven
more
relevant
for
this
purpose
.
</p>
<p>
More
in
precise
,
the
model-based
estimation
with
adaptive
Kalman
and
particle
filters
or
observers
and
fuzzy
logic
or
machine
learning
algorithms
such
as
artificial
neural
networks
(
ANN
)
and
support
vector
machines
(
SVM
)
are
typically
used
for
on-board
implementation
,
taking
into
account
their
increased
computational
and
memory
requirements
.
On
the
other
hand
,
the
SoC
estimation
from
Ah-counting
depends
on
the
accuracy
(
sampling
precision
and
frequency
)
of
the
current
sensors
and
the
initialization
of
the
cell
’s
capacity
.
It
usually
gives
accurate
results
,
which
also
relies
on
the
initial
and
re-calibrated
(
to
avoid
error
accumulation
)
SoC
after
dynamic
load
profiles
.
This
low-cost
estimation
method
is
used
in
this
work
as
well
,
according
to
Equation
(
2
)
.
(
2
)
where
is
the
initial
state
of
charge
,
is
the
Coulombic
efficiency
of
the
cell
at
the
certain
C-rates
,
is
the
instantaneous
current
through
the
cell
and
is
the
initial
capacity
(
=
discrete
sampling
period
)
as
a
function
of
temperature
and
current
rate
.
</p>
<p>
Besides
the
ECM
parameters
,
the
total
cell
’s
resistance
incorporates
both
the
Ohmic
and
polarizations
and
is
considered
to
be
the
DC
resistance
of
the
Li-ion
that
can
be
extracted
according
to
Ohm
’s
law
from
the
measured
voltage
drop
at
a
current
pulse
as
in
Equation
(
3
)
:
(
3
)
where
is
the
overpotential
between
the
terminal
voltage
and
the
of
the
current
pulse
.
This
resistance
is
a
modeling
assumption
that
represents
the
overall
impedance
of
the
cells
during
a
current
excitation
which
is
practical
for
on-board
estimation
of
the
available
source
or
sink
power
capability
of
the
cells
,
and
also
the
limitation
on
rate
of
current
that
can
be
drawn
or
fed
on
either
charge
or
discharge
direction
over
a
short
period
of
.
They
can
be
estimated
according
to
Equation
(
4
)
:
(
4
)
</p>
<p>
The
power
capability
is
inverse
dependent
on
the
of
the
battery
cells
and
follows
the
overpotential
build-up
during
the
pulse
.
As
a
result
,
it
is
highly
influenced
from
the
C-rates
,
the
operating
temperature
and
the
current
pulse
length
period
,
as
well
as
the
SoC
of
the
cells
throughout
ageing
and
their
chemistry
.
Consequently
,
is
assessed
here
for
three
C-rates
(
0.33
C
,
1
C
and
2
C-NMC
or
3
C-LTO
)
and
at
three
SoCs
(
20
%
,
50
%
and
80
%
)
,
for
three
different
pulse
times
=
2
s
,
10
s
and
20
s
at
C
and
BoL
.
The
generated
power
losses
at
the
respective
states
can
be
simply
calculated
by
[
in
the
range
of
a
few
Watts
]
.
