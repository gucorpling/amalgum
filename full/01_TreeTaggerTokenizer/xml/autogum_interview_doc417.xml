I
would
advocate
for
a
mandatory
architectural
peer
review
council
to
promote
consistent
and
well
planned
development
.
This
would
enhance
the
public
realm
with
respect
to
green
space
,
size
and
height
,
density
,
and
public
access
ultimately
benefiting
Toronto
's
communities
.
</item>
<item>
A
thorough
and
guaranteed
public
consultation
process
with
local
residents
for
any
large
scale
development
proposal
.
The
recent
surge
of
new
buildings
in
the
Bayview
Institutional
area
could
bring
further
development
and
we
must
ensure
that
the
confines
of
any
original
agreement
and
framework
are
adhered
to
.

Protecting
the
strong
sense
of
community
Ward
26
is
the
most
important
issue
the
must
be
addressed
.
Traffic
and
development
are
converging
forces
in
our
community
that
have
an
impact
on
the
sense
of
neighbourhood
spirit
.
The
city
must
arrive
at
well
planned
decisions
through
a
thoughtful
and
efficient
process
that
accommodates
residents
'
concerns

Q
:
</hi>
Why
have
you
chosen
to
involve
yourself
in
the
political
process
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
A
:
</hi>
I
have
always
had
respect
for
Canada
's
political
process
.
The
municipal
level
symbolizes
grassroots
politics
and
I
enjoy
having
that
direct
contact
and
support
of
my
neighbours
.
I
decided
to
involve
myself
because
it
is
time
that
younger
Canadians
entered
our
political
realm
to
make
that
difference
and
encourage
our
demographic
to
vote
and
have
their
voices
heard
.
I
am
confident
that
I
can
bring
a
FIT
â€“
Forward
,
Innovative
,
Thinking
approach
to
city
hall
in
order
to
bring
sustainable
solutions
to
Toronto
over
the
next
twenty
years

Q

</hi>
Why
do
you
want

represent
this
particular

<p>
<hi rend="bold">
A
:
</hi>
Growing
up
and
living
in
our
community
all
my
life
has
shaped
my
values
and
given
me
a
sense
of
pride
for
where
I
live
.
I
am
proud
of
how
Don
Valley
West
has
evolved
but
still
feel
that
there
is
more
work
to
be
done
.
I
understand
the
traditions
of
my
neighbourhood
and
also
identify
with
the
new
generation
of
residents
who
have
chosen
Ward
26
as
their
home
.
I
want
the
City
of
Toronto
to
take
responsibility
to
ensure
a
safe
,
healthy
,
and
active
community
for
residents
of
all
ages

Which

election

do
you
feel
the
city/your

should
be
most
proud

was

<p>

A

</hi>
Most
desirable
:
The
City
's
commitment
of
sustained
support
of
the
Career
Bridge
program
that
helps
foreign
trained
professionals
get
their
first
Canadian
job
experience
.
Toronto
was
responsible
for
employing
new
immigrants
in
the
City
of
Toronto
workforce
and
set
an
example
to
employers
across
our
City
as
to
how
we
can
tap
in
to
such
valuable
expertise
that
is
right
at
