:
It
depends
on
the
Web
browser
you
are
using
for
specifics
,
but
for
each
major
Web
browser
there
are
tools
you
can
install
(
besides
DuckDuckGo
extensions
)
to
protect
you
in
various
scenarios
.
Some
of
those
that
are
available
in
multiple
browsers
are
Ghostery
,
DoNotTrackMe
,
and
HTTPS
Everywhere
.
Those
help
protect
you
while
not
really
changing
your
browsing
experience
.
Other
tools
do
more
,
but
do
impact
your
browsing
experience
,
like
Tor
and
NoScript
.

What
is
your
opinion
of
ad
block
tools
such
as
AdBlockPlus
and
NoScript
that
ideally
aim
to
block
third-party
js
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
GW
</hi>
:
I
think
they
are
effective
at
doing
what
they
set
out
to
do
,
and
that
is
great
if
you
are
a
consumer
who
wants
that
experience
.
However
,
they
are
not
for
everyone
because
they
do
degrade
browsing
ability
,
especially
NoScript
.

Do
you
think
that
DoNotTarget
option
should
exist
(
if
consistendly
adhered
to
)
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
GW
</hi>
:
Absolutely
.
My
main
problem
with
the
DoNotTrack
setting
right
now
is
it
is
misleading
.
If
you
use
a
major
Web
browser
,
you
have
this
Do
Not
Track
setting
within
it
,
but
it
really
does
next
to
nothing
.
It
is
a
false
sense
of
security
.

What
do
you
see
the
ideal
behaviour
of
companies
when
it
comes
to
making
a
user
's
profile
?
Would
you
like
to
ideally
prohibit
such
activity
entirely
using
legislative
regulations
in
the
long
run
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
GW
</hi>
:
Yes
,
I
think
an
analogy
to
the
Do
Not
Call
list
is
apt
.
Applying
that
analogy
,
if
you
were
on
a
Do
Not
Track
list
then
companies
should
n't
track
you
unless
you
explicitly
ask
them
to
,
e.g.
by
logging
in
and
consenting
to
Terms
of
Service
.
That
will
only
happen
via
legislative
means
,
however
.

Have
you
heard
of
&quot;
Do

feature
support

What

it

:
Opera
browser
for

has
built

support
for
Do
Not

version
12
,
and

Given
that
not
all
companies
respect
this
setting
,
do
you
feel
its
name
misleading
?
Do
you
think
it
could
better
be
named
&quot;
Do
Not

instead
?

This
is
our
major
concern
about
the
DNT
functionality
:
Users
can
be
given
a
false
sense
of
security

should
respect
DNT
users

preferences

<p>
<hi rend="bold">

In
general
we
think
websites
should
comply

web
standards

the
current
proposal
for

legally
enforced
