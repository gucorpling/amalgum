Chapter
VIII
</head>
<p>
The
next
few
months
passed
away
,
as
many
years
can
pass
away
,
without
definite
events
,
and
yet
,
if
suddenly
disturbed
,
it
would
be
seen
that
such
months
or
years
had
a
character
unlike
others
.
The
three
months
which
had
passed
had
brought
them
to
the
beginning
of
March
.
The
climate
had
kept
its
promise
,
and
the
change
of
season
from
winter
to
spring
had
made
very
little
difference
,
so
that
Helen
,
who
was
sitting
in
the
drawing-room
with
a
pen
in
her
hand
,
could
keep
the
windows
open
though
a
great
fire
of
logs
burnt
on
one
side
of
her
.
Below
,
the
sea
was
still
blue
and
the
roofs
still
brown
and
white
,
though
the
day
was
fading
rapidly
.
It
was
dusk
in
the
room
,
which
,
large
and
empty
at
all
times
,
now
appeared
larger
and
emptier
than
usual
.
Her
own
figure
,
as
she
sat
writing
with
a
pad
on
her
knee
,
shared
the
general
effect
of
size
and
lack
of
detail
,
for
the
flames
which
ran
along
the
branches
,
suddenly
devouring
little
green
tufts
,
burnt
intermittently
and
sent
irregular
illuminations
across
her
face
and
the
plaster
walls
.
There
were
no
pictures
on
the
walls
but
here
and
there
boughs
laden
with
heavy-petalled
flowers
spread
widely
against
them
.
Of
the
books
fallen
on
the
bare
floor
and
heaped
upon
the
large
table
,
it
was
only
possible
in
this
light
to
trace
the
outline
.
</p>
<p>
Mrs.
Ambrose
was
writing
a
very
long
letter
.
Beginning
&quot;
Dear
Bernard
,
&quot;
it
went
on
to
describe
what
had
been
happening
in
the
Villa
San
Gervasio
during
the
past
three
months
,
as
,
for
instance
,
that
they
had
had
the
British
Consul
to
dinner
,
and
had
been
taken
over
a
Spanish
man-of-war
,
and
had
seen
a
great
many
processions
and
religious
festivals
,
which
were
so
beautiful
that
Mrs.
Ambrose
could
n't
conceive
why
,
if
people
must
have
a
religion
,
they
did
n't
all
become
Roman
Catholics
.
They
had
made
several
expeditions
though
none
of
any
length
.
It
was
worth
coming
if
only
for
the
sake
of
the
flowering
trees
which
grew
wild
quite
near
the
house
,
and
the
amazing
colours
of
sea
and
earth
.
The
earth
,
instead
of
being
brown
,
was
red
,
purple
,
green
.
&quot;
You
wo
n't
believe
me
,
&quot;
she
added
,
&quot;
there
is
no
colour
like
it
in
England
.
&quot;
She
adopted
,
indeed
,
a
condescending
tone
towards
that
poor
island
,
which
was
now
advancing
chilly
crocuses
and
nipped
violets
in
nooks
,
in
copses
,
in
cosy
corners
,
tended
by
rosy
old
gardeners
in
mufflers
,
who
were
always
touching
their
hats
and
bobbing
obsequiously
.
She
went
on
to
deride
the
islanders
themselves
.
Rumours
of
London
all
in
a
ferment
over
a
General
Election
had
reached
them
even
out
here
.
&quot;
It
seems
incredible
,
&quot;
she
went
on
,
&quot;
that
people
should
care
whether
Asquith
is
in
or
Austen
Chamberlain
out
,
and
while
you
scream
yourselves
hoarse
about
politics
you
let
the
only
people
who
are
trying
for
something
good
starve
or
simply
laugh
at
them
.
When
have
you
ever
encouraged
a
living
artist
?
Or
bought
his
best
work
?
Why
are
you
all
so
ugly
and
so
servile
?
Here
the
servants
are
human
beings
.
They
talk
to
one
as
if
they
were
equals
.
As
far
as
I
can
tell
there
are
no
aristocrats
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Perhaps
it
was
the
mention
of
aristocrats
that
reminded
her
of
Richard
Dalloway
and
Rachel
,
for
she
ran
on
with
the
same
penful
to
describe
her
niece
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
It
's
an
odd
fate
that
has
put
me
in
charge
of
a
girl
,
&quot;
she
wrote
,
&quot;
considering
that
I
have
never
got
on
well
with
women
,
or
had
much
to
do
with
them
.
However
,
I
must
retract
some
of
the
things
that
I
have
said
against
them
.
If
they
were
properly
educated
I
do
n't
see
why
they
should
n't
be
much
the
same
as
men
--
as
satisfactory
I
mean
;
though
,
of
course
,
very
different
.
The
question
is
,
how
should
one
educate
them
.
The
present
method
seems
to
me
abominable
.
This
girl
,
though
twenty-four
,
had
never
heard
that
men
desired
women
,
and
,
until
I
explained
it
,
did
not
know
how
children
were
born
.
Her
ignorance
upon
other
matters
as
important
&quot;
(
here
Mrs.
Ambrose
's
letter
may
not
be
quoted
)
.
.
.
&quot;
was
complete
.
It
seems
to
me
not
merely
foolish
but
criminal
to
bring
people
up
like
that
.
Let
alone
the
suffering
to
them
,
it
explains
why
women
are
what
they
are
--
the
wonder
is
they
're
no
worse
.
I
have
taken
it
upon
myself
to
enlighten
her
,
and
now
,
though
still
a
good
deal
prejudiced
and
liable
to
exaggerate
,
she
is
more
or
less
a
reasonable
human
being
.
Keeping
them
ignorant
,
of
course
,
defeats
its
own
object
,
and
when
they
begin
to
understand
they
take
it
all
much
too
seriously
.
My
brother-in-law
really
deserved
a
catastrophe
--
which
he
wo
n't
get
.
I
now
pray
for
a
young
man
to
come
to
my
help
;
some
one
,
I
mean
,
who
would
talk
to
her
openly
,
and
prove
how
absurd
most
of
her
ideas
about
life
are
.
Unluckily
such
men
seem
almost
as
rare
as
the
women
.
The
English
colony
certainly
does
n't
provide
one
;
artists
,
merchants
,
cultivated
people
--
they
are
stupid
,
conventional
,
and
flirtatious
.
.
.
.
&quot;
She
ceased
,
and
with
her
pen
in
her
hand
sat
looking
into
the
fire
,
making
the
logs
into
caves
and
mountains
,
for
it
had
grown
too
dark
to
go
on
writing
.
Moreover
,
the
house
began
to
stir
as
the
hour
of
dinner
approached
;
she
could
hear
the
plates
being
chinked
in
the
dining-room
next
door
,
and
Chailey
instructing
the
Spanish
girl
where
to
put
things
down
in
vigorous
English
.
The
bell
rang
;
she
rose
,
met
Ridley
and
Rachel
outside
,
and
they
all
went
in
to
dinner
.
