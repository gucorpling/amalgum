Introduction
</head>
<p>
Silica
membranes
are
an
attractive
emerging
gas
separation
technology
because
of
advantages
over
palladium
membranes
such
as
chemical
resistance
,
stability
,
and
low
cost
.
Additionally
,
silica
membranes
exhibit
high
perm-selectivity
at
high
temperature
and
a
tunable
morphology
that
can
be
modified
for
a
variety
of
gas
separations
such
as
CO2/CH4
.
Silica
and
silica-containing
membranes
were
studied
for
use
in
membrane
reactors
and
are
beginning
to
be
applied
industrially
in
gas
separation
systems
.
A
drawback
of
silica
membranes
is
their
poor
hydrothermal
stability
,
which
is
detrimental
in
industrial
applications
with
steam
,
such
as
pervaporation
of
aqueous
mixtures
and
hydrogen
production
by
steam
reforming
.
</p>
<p>
To
improve
the
hydrothermal
stability
of
silica
membranes
,
various
silicon
compounds
with
different
functional
groups
were
studied
such
as
silanes
containing
organic
functional
groups
(
methyl
,
propyl
,
hexyl
,
phenyl
,
and
vinyl
)
attached
directly
to
a
single
silicon
atom
,
and
alkoxy
siloxanes
bridged
with
≡Si
–
R
–
Si≡
structures
(
e.
g.
,
bis(triethoxysilyl)ethane
)
.
However
,
there
were
few
reports
focused
on
the
number
of
the
functional
groups
in
a
silicon
compound
.
</p>
<p>
One
functional
group
that
was
studied
is
the
addition
of
phenyl
groups
,
such
as
dimethoxydiphenylsilane
.
Ohta
et
al.
and
Zhang
et
al.
,
for
example
,
developed
silica
membranes
deposited
with
silicon
compounds
containing
zero
,
one
,
two
,
or
three
phenyl
groups
.
Notably
,
the
increasing
number
of
phenyl
groups
was
correlated
with
an
increase
in
the
estimated
pore
size
in
the
membrane
,
increasing
from
ca
.
0.3
nm
for
the
tetraethyl
orthosilicate-derived
membrane
to
ca
.
0.49
nm
for
the
membrane
derived
from
methoxy(triphenyl)silane
.
This
increase
in
pore
size
has
the
potential
to
increase
H2
permeance
while
maintaining
high
selectivity
toward
larger
organic
species
such
as
methylcyclohexane
(
kinetic
diameter
:
0.60
nm
)
and
toluene
(
0.59
nm
)
.
</p>
<p>
Nomura
et
al.
studied
methyl
groups
in
silicon
compounds
and
developed
silica
membranes
deposited
with
five
kinds
of
silica
precursors
including
tetramethyl
orthosilicate
(
TMOS
)
,
methyltrimethoxysilane
(
MTMOS
)
,
dimethyldimethoxysilane
(
DMDMOS
)
,
and
trimethylmethoxy-silane
(
TMMOS
)
using
the
chemical
vapor
deposition
(
CVD
)
method
,
in
which
oxygen
was
added
to
the
synthesis
mixture
.
In
that
work
,
with
increasing
number
of
methyl
groups
in
the
silica
precursor
,
the
H2
permeance
reached
a
maximum
of
9.0
×
10−7
mol∙m−2∙s−1∙Pa−1
at
600
°C
using
DMDMOS
,
but
then
declined
for
TMMOS
.
The
activation
energies
calculated
from
Arrhenius
plots
were
10
kJ∙mol−1
for
TMOS
,
9.3
kJ∙mol−1
for
MTMOS
,
7.9
kJ∙mol−1
for
DMDMOS
,
and
3.9
kJ∙mol−1
for
TMMOS
.
The
authors
claimed
that
the
deposition
mechanism
of
TMMOS
appeared
to
be
different
from
that
of
TMOS
or
DMDMOS
.
Finally
,
they
concluded
that
the
TMOS-derived
membrane
was
the
best
among
the
five
membranes
because
of
the
smooth
membrane
surface
,
the
dense
silica
,
and
the
lowest
activation
energy
for
H2
permeation
.

<p>
The
main
objective
of
this
study
is
to
determine
the
effect
of
the
number
of
methyl
groups
in
a
silica
precursor
on
the
synthesized
membrane
properties
.
The
work
here
builds
upon
the
previous
research
of
Nomura
et
al.
by
conducting
CVD
under
different
conditions
than
those
used
previously
,
and
uses
additional
characterization
techniques
,
such
as
Fourier-transform
infrared
spectroscopy
(
FTIR
)
,
to
probe
deeper
into
the
microstructure
of
these
silica
membranes
.
In
this
study
,
membrane
features
such
as
the
surface
morphology
,
the
presence
of
surface
functional
groups
,
and
the
silica
matrix
structure
were
studied
.
Furthermore
,
the
gas
permeation
properties
were
investigated
for
various
gas
species
not
tested
by
Nomura
et
al.
,
and
all
results
were
fitted
to
known
gas
diffusion
mechanisms
in
an
effort
to
gain
insight
into
the
mechanism
of
transport
across
a
wide
array
of
gas
species
.
Before
comparison
between
the
silica
precursors
,
adjustments
in
the
deposition
conditions
were
carried
out
in
order
to
develop
defect-free
membranes
.
