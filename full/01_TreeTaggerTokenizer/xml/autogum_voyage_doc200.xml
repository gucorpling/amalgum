Goulburn
</ref>
</hi>
is
a
small
regional
city
200km
(
120
miles
)
south-west
of
<ref target="Sydney">
Sydney
</ref>
,
<ref target="Australia">
Australia
</ref>
.
With
a
population
of
24,000
,
Goulburn
is
one
of
the
largest
cities
in
the
region
and
a
rural
hub
for
surrounding
agriculture
.
Goulburn
lays
claim
to
be
Australia
's
first
inland
city
to
be
settled
.
</p>
<head>
Understand

<p>
Situated
at
the
confluence
of
the
Wollondilly
and
Mulwaree
Rivers
,
the
fertile
lands
which
surround
the
area
of
Goulburn
were
for
centuries
the
home
a
number
of
the
local
Aboriginal
populations
.
White
settlers
discovered
the
area
in
the
late
1700s
,
and
the
first
land
grant
was
made
in
1825
.
The
city
grew
as
a
result
of
its
location
,
being
located
on
the
road
south
from
Sydney
(
now
the
Hume
Highway
)
and
in
the
19th
century
it
became
the
administrative
centre
for
the
&quot;
Argyle
County
&quot;
district
.
Goulburn
gained
a
great
deal
of
its
prosperity
during
the
Gold
Rush
(
when
many
of
its
main
buildings
were
constructed
)
and
the
coming
of
the
Main
South
Railway
Line
between
Sydney
and
<ref target="Melbourne">
Melbourne
</ref>
in
1869
(
which
is
still
in
operation
)
.
In
particular
,
the
area
became
known
for
its
merino
wool
which
was
sent
from
Goulburn
around
Australia
and
overseas
.
The
city
had
the
unique
distinction
of
being
granted
city
status
twice
-
once
in
1853
by
Queen
Victoria
(
which
established
the
city
as
a
&quot;
cathedral
city
&quot;
and
allowed
its
cathedral
,
St
Saviour
's
,
to
be
constructed
)
,
then
officially
again
in
1885
.
</p>
<p>
In
the
twentieth
century
,
the
city
's
importance
declined
as
a
result
of
the
growth
of
coastal
cities
in
Australia
,
as
well
as
Goulburn
's
proximity
to
the
new
national
capital
<ref target="Canberra">
Canberra
</ref>
.
These
factors
led
to
many
government
bodies
and
institutions
that
had
established
branches
in
Goulburn
departing
the
city
for
Canberra
or
Sydney
,
and
leaving
Goulburn
to
rely
on
its
wool
trade
and
its
place
as
a
service
centre
on
the
highway
.
The
city
was
finally
bypassed
by
the
Hume
Highway
in
the
1990s
and
the
wool
trade
has
declined
,
but
Goulburn
is
still
considered
the
major
&quot;
city
&quot;
between
Sydney
and
Canberra
and
visitors
still
take
the
turn
off
the
highway
to
visit
.
Importantly
,
the
city
has
retained
its
heritage
and
remains
an
important
part
of
Australia
's
early
history
.
</p>
<p>
Though
it
might
be
considered
quiet
compared
to
the
bustling
Sydney
two
hours
up
the
road
,
the
Goulburn
area
still
has
a
surprisingly
large
number
of
things
to
do
and
see
,
and
it
remains
a
good
stop-off
point
in
between
Sydney
,
Canberra
,
the
<ref target="Southern%20Highlands%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">
Southern
Highlands
</ref>
and
the
<ref target="South%20Coast%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">

.

Climate
</head>
<p>
Goulburn
has
a
climate
unlike
most
of
its
neighbouring
towns
due
to
its
location
at
the
bottom
of
a
valley
:
summers
tend
to
be
relatively
hot
and
dry
and
winters
cold
.
The
summer
temperature
range
is
10-40°C
(
50-104°F
)
and
winter
's
is
-5-18°C
(
23-64°F
)
.
Be
sure
to
bring
layers
in
winter
as
it
can
get
quite
windy
and
very
cold
.
Despite
the
varied
temperature
,
Goulburn
can
be
visited
at
any
time
of
year
as
long
as
you
bring
the
right
clothing
.
