Nicholas

,
in

article

&quot;
Sexing

Canvas

has
linked
Pricasso

work
with
statements
by
classic
modern
painters
who
referred
to
the
activity
of

as
a
&quot;
seminal
&quot;
or
&quot;
spermatic
&quot;
activity
with
sexual
connotations

declined
to
associate
themselves
with
Pricasso
's
artwork

The
curator
of

Modern
gallery
suggested
that
the
ridicule
of
his
work
could
abate
in
fifty
years
time
and
his
painting
seen
as
having
broken
boundaries
in
art
.
Julia
Charlton
,
the
senior
curator
of
the
Wits
Gallery
,
said
that
it
is
not
a
question
of
whether
it
is
art
,
but
whether
it
is
&quot;
good
art
&quot;
.
Charlton
and
Pieter
van
Heerden
,
the
director
of
the
Pretoria
Art
Institute
,
stated
that
how
he
painted
did
not
determine
the
artistic
nature
of
his
work
,
with
Charlton
adding
that
&quot;
art
is
not
only
meant
to
be
pleasant
,
but
provocative
,
and
it
should
get
people
talking
.
&quot;
Van
Heerden
further
stated
his
work
is
not
offensive
and
that
works
only
become
art
when
they
are
great
.

On
hearing
of
Pricasso

,
Zille
stated
&quot;
This
is
a
free
country

A
free
society
throws
up
these
kinds
of
people
,
who
exercise
their
freedom
in
unusual
ways
.
And
if
this
is
how
he
wants
to
do
it
,
I
must
accept
his
constitutional
right
to
do
so
.
&quot;
Zille
further
commented
that
Pricasso
&quot;
achieved
a
good
likeness
and
I
ca
n't
imagine
how
he
painted
it
without
brushes
or
conventional
equipment
.

Pricasso
participated
in
the
Gold
Coast
Sculptors
'
Society
<hi rend="italic">
Exotic

show

The
controversial
nature
of
his
technique
caused
several
members
of
the
Society
to
object
to
his
participation
,
with
one
member
resigning
in
protest
.
Pricasso
responded
to
criticism
by
saying
,
&quot;
I
think
I
'm
just
as
good
as
anyone
with
a
brush
and
I
'm
probably
a
lot
quicker
...
They
can
complain
if
they
want
to
but
other
people
love
it
