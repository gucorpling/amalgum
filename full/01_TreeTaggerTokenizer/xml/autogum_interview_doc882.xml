During
participation
in
the
Rehabilitation
Project
Force
,
you
recount
how
you
were
slapped
across
the
face
for
refusing
to
climb
into
a
garbage
can
after
being
ordered
to
do
so
by
a
leader
of
your
group
.
How
did
this
make
you
feel
?
Did
you
consider
leaving
the
organization
at
all
at
this
point
in
time
?
Why
or
why
not
,
and
why
did
you
remain
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
AS
</hi>
:
It
was
a
completely
nutty
order
and
I
was
n't
about
to
comply
.
I
ran
around
the
block
to
get
away
as
the
lady
who
issued
the
order
chased
after
me
.
I
went
to
the
person
in
charge
asking
for
help
but
he
was
not
in
his
office
.
The
lady
chased
me
into
that
office
and
then
hit
me
across
the
face
.
I
did
NOT
hit
her
back
because
I
wanted
to
show
that
she
was
the
crazy
one
.
However
when
the
Ethics
Officer
got
there
,
he
said
I
should
have
complied
as
she
was
my
superior
.
I
felt
like
it
was
a
huge
injustice
because
the
order
made
no
sense
and
had
no
purpose
.
She
was
just
trying
to
exert
her
&quot;
authority
&quot;
over
me
.
But
,
I
did
n't
want
to
be
in
more
trouble
,
so
I
did
my
punishment
for
non-compliance
and
carried
on
.
No
,
I
did
not
think
of
leaving
then
.
At
that
point
,
I
just
thought
that
lady
was
insane
,
not
the
entire
organization
.

After
completing
your
time
on
the
Rehabilitation
Project
Force
,
you
were
appointed
to
the
position
of
&quot;
Commanding
Officer
of
the
Flag
Land
Base
's
Communicator
&quot;
,
where
you
were
&quot;
responsible
for
all
in-coming
and
out-going
traffic
from
the
executive
and
obtaining
compliance
to
all
orders
issued
&quot;
.
Did
it
surprise
you
that
directly
after
finishing
the
Rehabilitation
Project
Force
,
you
were
given
such
a
position
of
responsibility
as
a
Scientology
executive
?
Does
this
occur
often
in
Scientology
to
members
after
they
finish
their
sentence
in
the
Rehabilitation
Project
Force
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
AS
</hi>
:
In
the
Sea
Organization
,
one
is
expected
to
be
able
to
perform
any
duty
â€“
with
or
without
training
.
It
's
preached
that
the
salvation
of
the
world
is
on
our
shoulders
and
everyone
needs
to
pull
up
their
bootstraps
and
make
it
go
right
.
So
,
the
appointment
did
not
surprise
me
.

Shortly
after
your
promotion
from
Rehabilitation
Project
Force
member
to
this
position
,
you
were
promoted
to
&quot;
Flag
Land
Bureau
Estates
Management
Chief
&quot;
,
where
you
were
&quot;
responsible
for
all
public
hotels
and
services
&quot;
,
and
subsequently
promoted
to
the
&quot;
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore's%20Messenger%20Organization">
Commodore
's
Messenger
Organization
</ref>
(
CMO
)
&quot;
.
At
the
end
of
chapter
3
,
you
write
how
you
were
&quot;
placed
under
a
group
justice
action
,
called
a
Committee
of
Evidence
&quot;
,
and
the
committee
,
&quot;
recommended
my
removal
for
neglect
of
duty
regarding
the
schedule
&quot;
.
However
,
a
few
days
later
you
were
told
you
were
assigned
to
Los
Angeles
,
California
,
in
order
to
recruit
for
members
to
join
the
CMO
.
Again
,
this
appears
to
be
a
pattern
of
conflicting
orders
within
the
organization
,
where
in
one
instance
you
were
disciplined
for
perceived
slights
,
and
yet
directly
afterward
,
promoted
to
a
higher
position
of
authority
as
a
Scientology
executive
.
How
do
you
explain
this
behavior
within
the
organization
?
