Where
MSAs
are
being
used
around
the
world
,
huge
cost
savings
are
being
realized
.
More
importantly
,
research
shows
these
cost
savings
are
not
resulting
in
a
decline
in
people
’s
health
.
The
cost
savings
achieved
through
MSAs
will
be
re-invested
in
healthcare
areas
such
as
long
term
care
,
pharmacare
and
expensive
medical
technologies
.
Lastly
,
the
MSA
plan
is
the
only
party
plan
that
provides
an
incentive
for
eating
well
,
quitting
smoking
and
getting
exercise
:
take
care
of
your
body
,
and
you
will
stay
away
from
the
doctor
and
avoid
paying
the
Liberal
Health
Tax
.
Further
,
unused
portions
of
MSAs
can
be
rolled
into
RRSPs
.
</p>
<p>
The
shortage
of
healthcare
professionals
will
be
dealt
with
by
increasing
compensation
packages
to
attract
doctors
and
nurses
to
the
province
.
These
compensation
packages
are
needed
to
win
over
doctors
and
nurses
in
the
international
bidding
war
to
Ontario
.
Prioritizing
the
provincial
budget
will
pay
for
the
big
expense
of
winning
the
bidding
war
for
healthcare
expenses
.
This
means
cuts
in
other
government
areas
will
be
necessary
.

Issue
#2
:
Farming
</p>
<p>
The
Family
Coalition
Party
has
always
believed
that
the
family
farm
is
one
of
the
basic
building
blocks
of
Ontario
’s
economy
.
The
FCP
will
propose
“
Right
to
Farm
”
legislation
.
The
farming
sector
must
be
free
to
operate
responsibly
,
without
interference
regarding
standard
farm
operating
practices
.
The
FCP
will
continue
to
support
the
responsible
use
of
approved
chemicals
in
agriculture
.
Lastly
,
I
propose
an
“
Adopt-a-Steer
”
program
so
that
farmers
can
sell
their
meat
locally
at
a
value-added
price
.
Under
our
current
system
,
farmers
receive
the
smallest
fraction
of
the
cost
of
beef
that
people
pay
at
the
store
.
If
I
want
to
buy
my
neighbour
’s
meat
,
I
should
be
able
to
,
and
it
is
good
for
the
farmer
.
</p>
<p>
Issue
#3
:
Infrastructure
</p>
<p>
The
infrastructure
of
roads
,
bridges
and
water
systems
is
crumbling
in
Ontario
.
Investment
in
safety
sensitive
infrastructure
areas
is
essential
.
I
propose
the
creation
of
reserve
accounts
in
municipal
budgets
for
water
systems
,
for
example
.
These
accounts
need
an
initial
cash
infusion
from
the
provincial
government
over
the
short
term
until
the
reserve
accounts
are
self-sustaining
through
a
portion
of
property
tax
rates
.

<hi rend="bold">
What
should
be
the
first
order
of
business
in
the
39th
Legislative
Assembly
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
The
first
thing
I
would
do
is
introduce
legislation
banning
sex-selection
abortions
.
Even
China
has
a
law
like
this
.
Ontario
should
not
be
second
to
China
for
anything
when
it
comes
to
human
rights
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Are
the
property
taxes
in
your
riding
at
a
fair
level
for
the
amount
of
services
received
in
the
municipality
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
Most
people
do
not
believe
they
receive
good
value
for
the
property
taxes
they
pay
.
In
general
,
people
used
to
pay
$
1.00
and
got
$
1.30
in
services
.
Now
we
pay
$
1.00
and
get
$
0.70
back
in
services
.
The
FCP
is
committed
to
freezing
the
education
portion
of
property
tax
rates
.
We
will
remove
the
education
portion
of
taxes
from
agricultural
lands
.
Concerning
Market
Value
Assessment
increases
,
if
a
significant
increase
is
required
,
it
must
be
phased
in
over
time
.
Halting
provincial
downloading
that
forces
higher
expenses
on
municipalities
and
towns
can
also
relieve
property
taxes
.
Lastly
,
property
taxes
going
up
are
also
a
response
to
the
pressures
of
an
aging
population
with
a
shrinking
tax
base
,
so
we
either
need
to
lower
our
expectations
of
government
and
pay
less
taxes
;
or
have
more
babies
.
