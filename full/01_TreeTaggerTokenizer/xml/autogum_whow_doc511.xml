<list type="ordered">
<item>
Enroll
in
a
tattoo
artist
apprenticeship
program
.
This
program
can
take
you
12
to
24
months
to
complete
,
but
it
could
also
be
very
expensive
.
You
will
gain
the
experience
you
need
to
become
a
tattoo
artist
,
which
can
come
in
handy
because
you
typically
need
to
have
experience
in
a
hands-on
program
before
you
can
start
your
own
tattoo
business
.
You
wo
n't
be
tattooing
right
away
,
but
the
program
is
vital
to
your
experience
.

Find
a
location
for
your
shop
.
Set
up
a
tattoo
shop
in
a
place
where
there
is
a
lot
of
automotive
and
pedestrian
traffic
to
help
increase
your
potential
for
walk-ins
.
When
people
can
see
your
business
from
the
road
or
as
they
are
walking
past
,
they
may
be
more
likely
to
remember
it
and
visit
later
.
