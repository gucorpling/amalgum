Iran
seems
unwilling
to
give
up
its
nuclear
programme
,
do
you
think
they
will
eventually
given
the

sanctions
?

<p>
<hi rend="bold">

:
The
only
way
Islamic
Regime
in
Iran
will
give
up
its
nuclear
program
is
either
full
operation
and
military
attack
by
the
West
or
total
oil
sanctions
.
85
–
90
%
of
the
the
Islamic
Republic
’s
money
comes
from
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crude%20oil">

.
This
money
does
not
go
to
the
Iranian
people
,
but
instead
funds
the
nuclear
program
,

The

will
be
forced
into
abandoning
its

when
oil

dry
up
the

supply
.

Do
you
feel
the
Islamic
Republic
of
Iran
is
trying
to
provoke
a
response
from
the
Western
nations
(
USA

<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/UK">

,
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/France">

)
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
AAF
</hi>
:
A
limited
military
response
from
the
West
which
will
not
be
for
a
regime
change
would
be
a
gift
to
the
Islamic
Republic
,
and
would
feed
the
narrative
of
“
overreaching
,
imperialistic
Western
governments
”
perpetuated
by
the
regime
.
The
IR
is
well
aware
of
the
rapid
decline
in
support
from
the
Iranian
people
and
is
looking
for
a
way
to
gain
back
some
of
that
support
,
even
superficially
.
An
attack
from
the
west
would
buoy
the
regime
and
damage
the
work
being
done
by
the
opposition
.

What
is
the
need
for
Iran
to
have
a
nuclear
programme
,
are
they
doing
it
for
energy
or
for
weapons
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
AAF
</hi>
:
Iran
makes
clear
its
intentions
for
the
nuclear
program
through
its
actions
.
The
regime
expresses
desire
to
annihilate
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Israel">
Israel
</ref>
almost
daily
,
and
has
repeatedly
refused
negotiation
and
inspection
of
its
nuclear
sites
.
Also
you
can
find
several
type
of
energies
in
Iran
and
at
all
they
do
n't
need
to
have
this
expensive
and
dangerous
nuclear
energy
.
For
sure
Islamic
republic
of
Iran
wants
to
have
Nuclear
bomb
.

If
Iran
does
not
listen
and
change
course
with
regards
to
its
nuclear
program
,
do
you
think
that
the
United
Nations
will
apply
more
sanctions
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
AAF
</hi>
:
It
took
a
very
long
time
to
sanction
the
Islamic
Republic
to
the
extent
it
is
now
,
and
since
the
UN
continues
to
send
negotiators
to
the
table
to
discuss
Iran
’s
nuclear
program
,
tighter
sanctions
at
this
point
in
time
are
unlikely
.
It
is
our
responsibility
at
Iranian
opposition
to
inform
United
Nations
about
this
regime
's
threat
to
international
community
.
We
should
move
much
more
organize[d
]
and
faster
to
cut
Islamic
Republic
's
diplomatic
relationship
with
the
world
.
Our
campaign
on
oil
sanctions
showed
us
it
is
possible
.

Do
you
think
that
the
United
States
is
particularly
unhappy
and
international
relations
are
poor
considering
that
Iran
recently
captured
a
drone
and
refused
to
return
it
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
AAF
</hi>
:
While
a
failure
militarily
and
with
regard
to
foreign
policy
,
the
captured
drone
incident
is
a
relatively
small
event
in
the
context
of
ongoing
tensions
between
the
United
States
and
the
Islamic
Republic
.
