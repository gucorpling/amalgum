Describe
the
Process
of
Bone
Healing
to
Kids
</head>
<p>
When
a
child
breaks
a
bone
,
they
are
often
scared
and
have
many
questions
about
how
it
is
going
to
fix
itself
.
Explaining
what
is
going
on
to
the
child
can
be
quite
difficult
as
the
answers
are
often
way
beyond
their
comprehension
.
It
is
important
to
use
diagrams
and
terminology
they
can
understand
.
This
article
will
provide
strategies
for
explaining
complex
processes
to
children
,
along
with
a
format
to
explain
the
bone
healing
process
in
a
way
a
child
can
understand
.

Ensure
they
know
what
a
bone
is
.
Although
the
child
may
have
heard
the
term
bone
several
times
they
may
not
be
entirely
sure
what
it
is
.
Show
the
child
pictures
of
a
bone
and
explain
where
they
can
be
found
in
the
body
and
the
role
they
play
.

Use
visuals
.
It
is
important
to
show
the
child
pictures
and
labelled
diagrams
of
each
step
in
the
bone
healing
processes
.
Providing
visual
aids
will
help
to
captivate
the
child
's
interest
by
increasing
their
focus
.
Having
visuals
will
also
aid
in
the
child
's
comprehension
.

<item>
Keep
it
simple
.
Try
to
use
vocabulary
they
already
know
.
Avoid
using
scientific
terms
but
rather
describe
it
using
physical
attributes
or
the
function
.
</item>
<item>
Use
similes
.
There
will
be
some
new
terms
you
cannot
avoid
using
.
When
this
happens
use
smilies
to
help
the
child
understand
.
A
smilie
is
the
comparison
of
two
different
things
in
order
to
create
a
new
meaning
.
The
comparison
is
usually
made
using
the
words
&quot;
like
&quot;
or
&quot;
as
.

Eliminate
the
details
.
Providing
the
child
with
every
little
detail
about
the
bone
healing
process
will
only
confuse
them
.
Try
to
focus
on
the
major
components
of
the
process
and
eliminate
any
that
seem
insignificant
.

Explain
the
hematoma
formation
as
a
pool
of
blood
.
Explain
to
the
child
that
when
the
bone
breaks
it
tears
the
blood
vessels
surrounding
it
.
The
blood
coming
from
the
blood
vessels
then
pools
around
where
the
break
happened
.
The
torn
blood
vessels
slowly
stop
releasing
blood
because
they
are
clogged
with
cells
.
By
saying
the
blood
vessels
are
clogged
you
can
avoid
using
the
term
clotting
process
.

If
the
child
does
not
know
what
a
blood
vessel
is
explain
it
as
a
tube
which
blood
flows
through
much
like
a
garden
hose
with
water
flowing
through
it
.
</item>

<item>
Explain
what
happens
to
the
surrounding
cells
by
comparing
what
happens
to
people
when
they
do
nâ€™t
eat
.
Explain
to
the
child
that
blood
carries
nutrients
to
cells
.
Tell
the
child
nutrients
are
like
food
for
our
cells
.
When
blood
vessels
tear
during
a
break
blood
can
no
longer
flow
through
them
properly
so
nutrients
cannot
get
to
the
bone
cells
around
the
break
and
they
die
.
Just
like
how
people
ca
n't
live
without
food
,
the
bone
cells
ca
n't
live
without
nutrients
so
they
begin
to
die
.
<figure rend="Blood_Vessels.png">

Compare
the
blood
vessels
growing
into
the
hematoma
as
roots
growing
into
the
soil
.
A
few
days
after
the
break
,
tiny
blood
vessels
start
to
grow
into
the
pool
of
blood
.
These
small
blood
vessels
grow
off
of
the
broken
blood
vessels
much
like
how
roots
branch
off
a
trunk
into
the
soil
.
Inform
the
child
that
these
small
blood
vessels
connect
the
ends
of
the
broken
blood
vessels
back
together
.
Make
sure
the
child
understands
that
this
allows
blood
to
flow
normally
again
.

Explain
phagocytic
cells
as
special
cells
that
eat
dead
cells
.
Do
not
use
the
proper
name
,
phagocytic
cells
,
as
this
could
be
confusing
for
the
child
.
Refer
to
phagocytic
cells
as
&quot;
special
cells
&quot;
that
come
and
eat
the
dead
cells
to
get
rid
of
them
.
By
calling
them
special
cells
the
child
will
get
the
idea
that
they
are
different
from
other
cells
.

Express
the
bone
formation
process
by
the
physical
features
or
the
function
of
the
biological
term
.

<item>
Instead
of
using
the
proper
terminology
,
fibroblasts
and
osteoblasts
,
refer
to
them
as
bone
forming
cells
.
Bone
forming
cells
enter
the
area
where
the
blood
pool
occurred
and
begin
to
remake
the
bone
.
</item>
<item>
You
can
avoid
using
the
term
collagen
fibers
by
explaining
their
physical
properties
.
The
broken
bone
ends
are
connected
with
bundles
of
long
thread
like
structures
made
out
of
protein
.
</item>
<item>
You
can
refer
to
fibrocartilaginous
callus
as
a
repair
tissue
.
A
temporary
repair
tissue
is
built
between
the
broken
bones
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Explain
about
spongy
bone
by
focusing
on
its
physical
attributes
.
The
repair
tissue
is
turned
into
spongy
bone
.
This
spongy
bone
forms
the
inner
layer
of
all
bones
and
it
looks
a
lot
like
a
sponge
.
It
takes
about
2
months
for
the
broken
bone
ends
to
be
joined
together
.
Show
a
picture
of
spongy
bone
to
help
the
child
understand
.

<item>
Define
remodeling
to
explain
bone
remodeling
.
The
spongy
bone
is
then
remodeled
meaning
the
old
bone
is
replaced
by
new
bone
.

Compare
compact
bone
to
a
shell
.
Lastly
,
a
hard
outer
layer
forms
over
the
bone
to
provide
protection
and
strength
much
like
a
shell
.
