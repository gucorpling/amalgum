Paint
a
Candy
House
in
Watercolor
</head>
<p>
Toward
the
end
of
the
year
,
candy
and
sweets
lurk
around
every
corner
.
Those
visions
of
sugarplums
can
be
used
make
art
.
Doing
a
painting
of
a
house
made
of
candy
is
a
fun
way
to
indulge
without
eating
too
much
sugar
or
spending
a
lot
of
cash
.
The
resulting
painting
will
last
for
years
and
starts
with
a
simple
rectangle
.

Lay
out
the
beginnings
of
your
house
.
Begin
by
drawing
,
in
pencil
,
a
rectangle
.
Use
a
template
if
you
wish
,
a
box
,
disk
sleeve
or
other
rectangular
item
.
Place
this
somewhere
in
the
center
of
your
page
.
</item>
<item>
Construct
the
roof
.
Find
the
center
of
your
rectangle
at
and
draw
3
”
vertical
line
upward
.
The
top
end
of
the
line
will
be
the
peak
of
the
roof
.
Construct
the
roof
by
drawing
a
line
down
each
side
to
form
a
large
triangle
.
Use
a
curvy
item
as
a

Return
to

door

Make
it
as
tall

square
windows

Decorate
the
house
with
candy
shapes
.
Look
at
your
references
and
analyze
the
various
types
and
styles
of
candies
.
These
will
be
your
building
materials
,
so
look
over
their
various
sizes
and
shapes
.
Try
to
picture
which
candy
would
look
best
at
what
point
on
your
house
.
<figure rend="Decwcandy.jpg">

Begin
to
put
candy
on
the
house
.
Sketch
candy
of
one
shape
in
pencil
,
repeatedly
,
to
fill
one
area
of
your
house
.
For
example
,
for
the
front
,
you
might
have
round
candies
to
mimic
siding
shingles
.
</item>
<item>
Imagine
how
you
want
the
roof
to
be
.
You
might
use
long
candies
to
edge
the
roof
or
make
it
piled
with
snow
--
-marshmallow
fluff
to
mimic
snow
.
By
working
in
pencil
,
you
can
make
changes
easily
if
one
idea
does
n't
work
out
.
Erase
and
try
something
else
.

Create
a
suitably
sweet
environment
for
your
house
.
Use
varied
sizes
,
shapes
and
colors
of
candies
to
make
trees
,
pathways
,
rocks
,
signposts
,
and
trimming
around
the
corners
of
the
house
and
its
windows
.
Candy
canes
make
good
lampposts
.
Green
lollipops
look
a
bit
like
ornamental
trees
.
Long
,
narrow
candies
standing
in
a
row
resemble
a
fence
.
Pile
on
the
candy
until
much
of
the
house
is
covered
.
The
landscape
ought
to
be
a
magical
place
where
candy
reigns
supreme
.
Remember
to
populate
the
scene
.
Gingerbread
men
,
women
and
children
look
exactly
right
as
residents
of
a
candy
house
.

Activate
your
paints
with
drops
of
water
.
Begin
to
paint
the
design
.
The
hard
work
is
done
if
you
have
taken
time
to
make
your
drawing
detailed
and
complete
.
</item>
<item>
Look
to
see
where
a
color
can
be
used
in
another
part
of
the
design
.
While
you
have
one
color
on
your
brush
,
use
it
wherever
else
it
is
needed
.
</item>
<item>
Wash
in
a
solid
color
for
a
sky
.
This
will
be
a
nice
backdrop
for
the
colorful
candy
.
With
so
much
going
on
in
the
picture
a
simple
sky
will
be
nice
.
</item>
<item>
Work
until
the
piece
looks
finished
.
Allow
it
to
dry
and
give
it
another
look
.
If
any
part
needs
punching
up
do
it
.

<item>
Allow
the
paint
to
dry
before
attempting
to
put
another
color
close
to
it
unless
you
want
the
two
colors
to
mingle
.
</item>
<item>
As
you
paint
,
work
the
colors
from
one
spot
into
other
areas
of
the
design
.
Instead
of
working
in
sections
and
completing
one
area
at
a
time
aim
to
keep
the
whole
painting
involved
.
This
all
over
approach
to
color
will
give
a
sense
of
unity
to
your
work
,
having
various
shades
sprinkled
throughout
the
page
.
