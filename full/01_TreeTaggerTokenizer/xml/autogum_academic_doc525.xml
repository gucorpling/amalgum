Introduction

.
Background
</head>
<p>
The
emission
of
greenhouse
gas
(
GHG
)
has
steeply
increased
by
approximately
82.5
%
since
1979
,
which
has
been
a
major
contributor
to
climate
change
globally
.
This
gives
rise
to
considerable
global
efforts
to
reduce
its
emissions
.
As
a
part
of
it
,
South
Korea
announced
a
target
of
reducing
GHG
emissions
by
37
%
compared
to
Business
As
Usual
(
BAU
)
by
2030
in
the
Paris
Agreement
of
the
Intergovernmental
Panel
on
Climate
Change
(
IPCC
)
in
2016
.
</p>
<p>
Humans
,
who
are
mostly
responsible
for
GHG
emissions
,
spend
approximately
90
%
of
the
daytime
in
buildings
.
The
estimated
GHG
emissions
from
buildings
are
as
high
as
20
%
of
the
total
emissions
.
Therefore
,
many
studies
have
been
conducted
to
reduce
energy
consumption
in
buildings
in
an
effort
to
reduce
GHG
emissions
from
buildings
.
</p>
<p>
The
application
of
renewable
energy
to
buildings
has
increased
recently
in
an
effort
to
reduce
the
energy
consumption
of
buildings
.
To
properly
distribute
the
supply
of
renewable
energy
sources
,
it
is
necessary
to
accurately
predict
the
energy
consumption
of
each
building
.
In
particular
,
from
a
building
life-cycle
perspective
,
the
energy
consumed
in
the
operation
stage
of
a
building
amounts
to
approximately
70
–
90
%
of
the
total
energy
.
Therefore
,
it
is
essential
to
accurately
predict
the
energy
consumption
of
buildings
for
their
efficient
operation
.

Literature
Review
(
Analysis
of
Previous
Studies
)
</head>
<p>
In
this
section
,
previous
studies
were
reviewed
to
introduce
(
i
)
the
necessity
of
predicting
building
energy
consumption
,
(
ii
)
a
comparative
analysis
of
energy
prediction
methods
,
and
(
iii
)
the
advantages
of
feature
selection
.
Based
on
these
,
the
optimal
modeling
strategy
for
predicting
building
energy
consumption
was
developed
.

<p>
Linda
et
al.
showed
that
energy
distribution
systems
can
be
planned
by
predicting
heat
and
electricity
demand
.
They
created
regression
analysis
models
for
buildings
using
the
heat
and
electricity
consumptions
measured
every
hour
and
predicted
the
heat
and
electricity
loads
as
well
as
the
annual
energy
demand
in
a
specific
area
.
As
a
result
,
they
optimized
a
system
for
energy
distribution
to
buildings
.
Yudong
Ma
et
al.
conducted
research
on
energy
reduction
in
buildings
using
an
energy
demand
prediction
.
They
constructed
a
system
optimized
for
storing
the
heat
source
generated
from
a
cooling
system
and
a
prediction
control
system
for
preventing
the
overproduction
of
heat
sources
.
The
simulation
results
showed
that
an
energy-saving
effect
of
up
to
24.5
%
can
be
achieved
.
The
district
heating
system
efficiently
provides
heat
sources
using
a
centralized
supply
of
cold
and
hot
water
used
in
local
facilities
.
Therefore
,
it
is
possible
to
determine
an
optimal
operation
plan
before
using
chillers
and
boilers
if
their
loads
can
be
accurately
predicted
.
M.
Sakawa
et
al.
predicted
the
load
using
an
artificial
neural
network
(
ANN
)
for
efficient
district
cooling
and
heating
operation
.
Kody
M.
Powell
et
al.
conducted
research
on
the
energy
reduction
of
heating
,
ventilation
and
air
conditioning
(
HVAC
)
using
a
building
energy
consumption
prediction
model
.
They
presented
an
efficient
method
of
coping
with
the
peak
load
by
controlling
the
thermal
storage
system
.
Samuel
et
al.
conducted
a
study
to
predict
the
heating
load
in
a
district
heating
system
by
applying
four
types
of
machine
learning
.
They
used
district
heating
data
collected
from
10
residential
and
commercial
buildings
located
in
Skellefteå
,
Sweden
,
and
using
machine
learning
techniques
,
namely
,
support
vector
machine
(
SVM
)
,
forward
backpropagation
neural
network
(
FFNN
)
,
multilinear
regression
(
MLR
)
,
regression
.
Prediction
of
energy
consumption
shows
that
it
is
a
key
step
towards
the
realization
of
optimized
energy
production
,
distribution
,
and
consumption
.
To
improve
present
and
future
energy
supplies
,
predicting
energy
demands
is
an
essential
stage
.
However
,
the
lack
of
accurate
and
comprehensive
data
sets
to
predict
future
demand
is
one
of
the
big
problems
in
developing
economies
.
Therefore
,
Sasan
et
al.
proposed
an
ensemble
hybrid
forecasting
model
as
a
solution
for
predicting
energy
consumption
while
dealing
with
the
shortage
of
data
sets
.
These
studies
controlled
the
production
and
operation
of
heat
sources
by
predicting
the
building
energy
consumption
and
the
induced
energy
reduction
.
They
also
prevented
the
overproduction
of
heat
sources
through
the
energy
consumption
prediction
.
