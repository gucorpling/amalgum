Despite
their
apparent
lack
of
experience
,
Arsenal
started
out
the
match
strongly
,
with
crisp
passing
and
great
control
.
They
pressed
their
advantage
,
and
forced
Chelsea
keeper
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petr%20Cech">
Petr
Cech
</ref>
into
several
saves
.
On
12
minutes
,
Theo
Walcott
struck
gold
,
as
he
orcestrated
a
give
and
go
with
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abou%20Diaby">
Abou
Diaby
</ref>
and
slotted
the
ball
into
the
far
corner
of
the
net
,
scoring
his
first
ever
goal
for
the
Gunners
.
Soon
after
,
Baptista
of
Arsenal
had
a
legitimate
claim
for
a
penalty
,
but
referee
Howard
Webb
would
n't
hear
of
it
.
Chelsea
struck
back
quickly
,
and
a
hint
of
offside
was
shown
as
Didier
Drogba
was
played
in
by
an
over
the
top
ball
by
Michael
Ballack
.
The
Ivory
Coast
striker
did
n't
wait
for
a
whistle
,
and
slotted
the
ball
between
Manuel
Almunia
's
legs
to
tie
the
match
.
A
few
more
chances
were
spurned
due
to
poor
finishing
before
the
break
,
but
the
game
went
into
halftime
drawn
at
one
a
piece
.
</p>
<p>
The
second
half
started
much
as
the
first
,
with
the
youthful
exuberance
of
Arsenal
showing
through
,
as
they
continued
to
press
.
Chelsea
's
output
was
increased
as
well
however
,
with
the
addition
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arjen%20Robben">
Arjen
Robben
</ref>
at
the
exspense
of
Makelele
.
2
yellow
cards
were
handed
out
to
Chelsea
in
the
next
few
minutes
,
before
the
game
took
a
huge
downturn
.
Chelsea
skipper
John
Terry
was
seriously
injured
,
when
Diaby
's
foot
connected
squarly
with
his
face
as
Diaby
attempted
to
clear
the
ball
.
Terry
was
taken
off
in
a
stretcher
and
was
replaced
by
Mikel
.
The
loss
of
their
captain
seemed
to
push
Chelsea
to
new
levels
,
as
Drogba
forced
a
fine
save
out
of
Almunia
,
and
Lampard
saw
his
shot
go
off
the
woodwork
.
Arsenal
were
not
able
to
hold
on
,
and
on
81
minutes
,
Denilson
made
a
sloppy
pass
and
Robben
picked
up
the
scraps
.
He
sent
a
cross
in
as
Drogba
beat
Senderos
to
the
ball
and
headed
in
his
28th
of
the
campaign
.
The
blue
tide
continued
,
and
Shevchenko
blasted
a
ball
off
the
woodwork
,
missing
his
chance
to
seal
the
victory
.
</p>
<p>
As
the
game
entered
stoppage
time
,
Mikel
and
Toure
entered
a
shoving
match
,
and
more
players
got
involved
.
Coaches
took
the
field
to
attempt
to
settle
their
players
,
and
when
all
was
finally
calm
,
Mikel
and
Toure
were
shown
red
cards
,
along
with
Adebayor
of
Arsenal
.
The
game
was
finally
called
at
101
minutes
,
and
stand
in
skipper
Lampard
was
able
to
hoist
the
Carling
Cup
.
