Claus
</head>
<p>
Another
day
found
Necile
's
bower
the
most
popular
place
in
the
Forest
.
The
nymphs
clustered
around
her
and
the
child
that
lay
asleep
in
her
lap
,
with
expressions
of
curiosity
and
delight
.
Nor
were
they
wanting
in
praises
for
the
great
Ak
's
kindness
in
allowing
Necile
to
keep
the
babe
and
to
care
for
it
.
Even
the
Queen
came
to
peer
into
the
innocent
childish
face
and
to
hold
a
helpless
,
chubby
fist
in
her
own
fair
hand
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
What
shall
we
call
him
,
Necile
?
&quot;
she
asked
,
smiling
.
&quot;
He
must
have
a
name
,
you
know
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Let
him
be
called
Claus
,
&quot;
answered
Necile
,
&quot;
for
that
means
'
a
little
one
.
'
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Rather
let
him
be
called
Neclaus
,
&quot;
**
returned
the
Queen
,
&quot;
for
that
will
mean
'
Necile
's
little
one
.
'
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
nymphs
clapped
their
hands
in
delight
,
and
Neclaus
became
the
infant
's
name
,
although
Necile
loved
best
to
call
him
Claus
,
and
in
afterdays
many
of
her
sisters
followed
her
example
.
</p>
<p>
Necile
gathered
the
softest
moss
in
all
the
forest
for
Claus
to
lie
upon
,
and
she
made
his
bed
in
her
own
bower
.
Of
food
the
infant
had
no
lack
.
The
nymphs
searched
the
forest
for
bell-udders
,
which
grow
upon
the
goa-tree
and
when
opened
are
found
to
be
filled
with
sweet
milk
.
And
the
soft-eyed
does
willingly
gave
a
share
of
their
milk
to
support
the
little
stranger
,
while
Shiegra
,
the
lioness
,
often
crept
stealthily
into
Necile
's
bower
and
purred
softly
as
she
lay
beside
the
babe
and
fed
it
.
</p>
<p>
So
the
little
one
flourished
and
grew
big
and
sturdy
day
by
day
,
while
Necile
taught
him
to
speak
and
to
walk
and
to
play
.
</p>
<p>
His
thoughts
and
words
were
sweet
and
gentle
,
for
the
nymphs
knew
no
evil
and
their
hearts
were
pure
and
loving
.
He
became
the
pet
of
the
forest
,
for
Ak
's
decree
had
forbidden
beast
or
reptile
to
molest
him
,
and
he
walked
fearlessly
wherever
his
will
guided
him
.
</p>
<p>
Presently
the
news
reached
the
other
immortals
that
the
nymphs
of
Burzee
had
adopted
a
human
infant
,
and
that
the
act
had
been
sanctioned
by
the
great
Ak
.
Therefore
many
of
them
came
to
visit
the
little
stranger
,
looking
upon
him
with
much
interest
.
First
the
Ryls
,
who
are
first
cousins
to
the
wood-nymphs
,
although
so
differently
formed
.
For
the
Ryls
are
required
to
watch
over
the
flowers
and
plants
,
as
the
nymphs
watch
over
the
forest
trees
.
They
search
the
wide
world
for
the
food
required
by
the
roots
of
the
flowering
plants
,
while
the
brilliant
colors
possessed
by
the
full-blown
flowers
are
due
to
the
dyes
placed
in
the
soil
by
the
Ryls
,
which
are
drawn
through
the
little
veins
in
the
roots
and
the
body
of
the
plants
,
as
they
reach
maturity
.
The
Ryls
are
a
busy
people
,
for
their
flowers
bloom
and
fade
continually
,
but
they
are
merry
and
light-hearted
and
are
very
popular
with
the
other
immortals
.
</p>
<p>
Next
came
the
Knooks
,
whose
duty
it
is
to
watch
over
the
beasts
of
the
world
,
both
gentle
and
wild
.
The
Knooks
have
a
hard
time
of
it
,
since
many
of
the
beasts
are
ungovernable
and
rebel
against
restraint
.
But
they
know
how
to
manage
them
,
after
all
,
and
you
will
find
that
certain
laws
of
the
Knooks
are
obeyed
by
even
the
most
ferocious
animals
.
Their
anxieties
make
the
Knooks
look
old
and
worn
and
crooked
,
and
their
natures
are
a
bit
rough
from
associating
with
wild
creatures
continually
;
yet
they
are
most
useful
to
humanity
and
to
the
world
in
general
,
as
their
laws
are
the
only
laws
the
forest
beasts
recognize
except
those
of
the
Master
Woodsman
.
</p>
<p>
Then
there
were
the
Fairies
,
the
guardians
of
mankind
,
who
were
much
interested
in
the
adoption
of
Claus
because
their
own
laws
forbade
them
to
become
familiar
with
their
human
charges
.
There
are
instances
on
record
where
the
Fairies
have
shown
themselves
to
human
beings
,
and
have
even
conversed
with
them
;
but
they
are
supposed
to
guard
the
lives
of
mankind
unseen
and
unknown
,
and
if
they
favor
some
people
more
than
others
it
is
because
these
have
won
such
distinction
fairly
,
as
the
Fairies
are
very
just
and
impartial
.
But
the
idea
of
adopting
a
child
of
men
had
never
occurred
to
them
because
it
was
in
every
way
opposed
to
their
laws
;
so
their
curiosity
was
intense
to
behold
the
little
stranger
adopted
by
Necile
and
her
sister
nymphs
.
</p>
<p>
Claus
looked
upon
the
immortals
who
thronged
around
him
with
fearless
eyes
and
smiling
lips
.
He
rode
laughingly
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
merry
Ryls
;
he
mischievously
pulled
the
gray
beards
of
the
low-browed
Knooks
;
he
rested
his
curly
head
confidently
upon
the
dainty
bosom
of
the
Fairy
Queen
herself
.
And
the
Ryls
loved
the
sound
of
his
laughter
;
the
Knooks
loved
his
courage
;
the
Fairies
loved
his
innocence
.
</p>
<p>
The
boy
made
friends
of
them
all
,
and
learned
to
know
their
laws
intimately
.
No
forest
flower
was
trampled
beneath
his
feet
,
lest
the
friendly
Ryls
should
be
grieved
.
He
never
interfered
with
the
beasts
of
the
forest
,
lest
his
friends
the
Knooks
should
become
angry
.
The
Fairies
he
loved
dearly
,
but
,
knowing
nothing
of
mankind
,
he
could
not
understand
that
he
was
the
only
one
of
his
race
admitted
to
friendly
intercourse
with
them
.
</p>
<p>
Indeed
,
Claus
came
to
consider
that
he
alone
,
of
all
the
forest
people
,
had
no
like
nor
fellow
.
To
him
the
forest
was
the
world
.
He
had
no
idea
that
millions
of
toiling
,
striving
human
creatures
existed
.
