This
article
incorrectly
describes
BP
as
'
British
Petroleum
'
.
In
fact
,
such
a
company
has
not
existed
for
many
years
as
BP
dropped
this
name
when
becoming
a
multinational
company
.
The
initials
no
longer
stand
for
anything
.

as
the
first
part
of
a
&quot;
static
kill
&quot;
procedure
intended
to
permanently
stop
the
flow
of
oil
into
the
Gulf
coast
.
Earlier
in
the
day
,
the
multi-national
energy
company
ran
&quot;
injectivity
tests
&quot;
to
find
out
if
the
well
,
which
had
been
leaking
for
months
,
could
withstand
the
pressure
of
the
procedure
,
which
is
meant
to
plug
up
the
oil
that
is
n't
flowing
because
the
well
has
been
capped
.
The
procedure
,
unlike
the
&quot;
top
kill
&quot;
attempted
in
May
,
is
designed
to
proceed
slowly
.
</p>
<p>
After
a
day-long
delay
,
BP
declared
that
the
procedure
could
safely
begin
and
that
company
's
senior
vice
president
,
Kent
Wells
,
said
that
the
afternoon
pressure
test
&quot;
went
exactly
as
planned
&quot;
.
</p>
<p>
The
company
also
said
that
the
&quot;
static
kill
&quot;
was
only
half
the
solution
,
with
the
other
half
being
two
relief
wells
that
are
planned
to
plug
the
well
from
the
bottom
.

Kenyans
to
vote
on
new
constitution
</head>
<p>
On
Wednesday
,
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Kenya">
Kenyans
</ref>
will
vote
on
a
new
constitution
that
intends
to
fix
many
of
the
country
's
political
problems
like
widespread
corruption
and
heightened
ethnic
divisions
.
Wednesday
has
been
declared
a
public
holiday
so
more
people
can
vote
.
</p>
<p>
Billie
O’Kadameri
of
Radio
France
International
described
opposition
that
arose
from
an
alliance
of
churches
and
political
leaders
.
Warnings
of
disruption
in
opposition
areas
have
marred
what
the
government
initially
hoped
would
be
a
united
vote
in
support
of
the
proposal
.
</p>
<p>
However
,
Salim
Lone
,
senior
adviser
to
Prime
Minister
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Raila_Odinga">
Raila
Odinga
</ref>
,
said
that
&quot;
[
Kenyans
]
are
united
as
we
have
never
been
since
independence
more
than
45
years
ago
,
&quot;
and
,
&quot;
Virtually
all
Kenyans
,
from
across
the
political
and
ethnic
divides
,
want
this
constitution
&quot;
.
</p>
<p>
The
new
constitution
would
restrict
the
president
's
power
,
gives
the
people
a
bill
of
rights
,
gives
more
power
to
local
governments
and
encourages
land
reform
.
However
,
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalenjin">
Kalenjin
</ref>
tribe
claims
that
the
new
land
reform
would
lead
to
the
taxation
and
even
seizure
of
their
lands
.
</p>
<p>
The
last
time
a
major
vote
was
held
(
the
Kenyan
presidential
election
in
2007
)
,
violence
left
almost
1,500
people
dead
and
over
half
a
million
displaced
.
