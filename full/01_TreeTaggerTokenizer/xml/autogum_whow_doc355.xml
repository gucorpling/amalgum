Find
Interesting
Stargazing
Targets
</head>
<p>
Sometimes
stargazing
can
get
a
bit
boring
.
When
it
does
,
it
's
time
to
find
some
interesting
targets
.
You
want
to
see
stars
big
enough
to
fill
half
the
solar
system
,
black
holes
heavier
than
galaxies
-
you
know
,
the
<hi rend="italic">
interesting
</hi>
stuff
.

VY
Canis
Majoris
-
one
of
the
galaxy
's
biggest
stars
</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Find
Sirius
.
It
should
be
fairly
obvious
,
it
's
the
big
bright
star
just
below
Orion
.

<item>
Find
Omicron
2
Canis
Majoris
and
Beta
Canis
Majoris
.
A
star
map
is
very
helpful
here
.

Imagine
that
Sirius
,
Beta
and
Omicron
2
form
the
corners
of
a
giant
parallelogram
.
VY
Canis
Majoris
is
at
the
fourth
corner
.
You
'll
need
some
good
binoculars
to
see
it
(
7x50
's
at
least
)
,
it
's
a
bit
dim
.

T
Tauri
-
a
cute
little
baby
star
</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Find
Aldebaran
.
It
's
the
bright
red
one
in
Taurus
.
<figure rend="Find Interesting Stargazing Targets Step 4.jpg">

<item>
Aldebaran
,
Theta
Tauri
,
Gamma
Tauri
,
Delta
Tauri
and
Epsilon
Tauri
form
a
V-shaped
pattern
.
This
is
the
core
of
the
Hyades
star
cluster
.
Aldebaran
and
Epsilon
are
at
the
tips
of
the
V
,
and
Gamma
is
at
the
bottom
.
All
five
of
these
stars
are
visible
with
the
naked
eye
.
<figure rend="Find Interesting Stargazing Targets Step 5.jpg">

</item>
<item>
Find
Delta
Tauri
.
It
's
the
one
between
Epsilon
and
Gamma
.
The
one
between
Gamma
and
Aldebaran
is
Theta
.
You
do
n't
want
Theta
.
<figure rend="Find Interesting Stargazing Targets Step 6.jpg">
</figure>
</item>
<item>
Look
at
it
through
binoculars
.
Hundreds
of
other
stars
should
appear
in
the
vicinity
.
This
is
the
Hyades
star
cluster
.
It
can
be
pretty
confusing
,
but
keep
looking
at
Delta
and
you
'll
be
OK
.
Using
a
telescope
is
good
because
it
's
easier
to
focus
on
one
spot
.
<figure rend="Find Interesting Stargazing Targets Step 7.jpg">

From
Delta
Tauri
,
move
up
(
increase
declination
)
slightly
.
T
Tauri
is
embedded
in
a
nebula
(
NGC
1555
)
called
Hind
's
variable
nebula
,
so
look
for
the
star
in
a
fuzzy
patch
.
<figure rend="Find Interesting Stargazing Targets Step 8.jpg">

If
you
're
up
for
a
challenge
,
try
to
find
Struve
's
lost
nebula
.
This
nebula
,
catalogued
as
NGC
1554
,
is
near
to
T
Tauri
,
both
physically
and
in
the
sky
.
However
,
since
it
's
first
observation
(
by
Otto
Wilhelm
von
Struve
)
,
it
has
disappeared
,
earning
it
the
name
Struve
's
lost
nebula
.
Perhaps
it
's
disappeared
,
perhaps
it
never
existed
.
We
'll
probably
never
know
.

TX
Piscium
-
a
red
beauty
</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Find
the
Great
Square
of
Pegasus
.
This
is
one
of
the
most
obvious
asterisms
in
the
sky
,
after
the
Big
Dipper
and
the
W
of
Cassiopeia
.
It
's
usually
used
to
find
the
Andromeda
galaxy
.
<figure rend="Find Interesting Stargazing Targets Step 10.jpg">
</figure>
</item>
<item>
Just
below
the
square
should
be
a
faint
ring
of
stars
.
This
is
part
of
the
constellation
of
Pisces
.
It
's
very
faint
,
so
use
binoculars
.
There
should
be
seven
stars
in
the
ring
.
As
TX
is
variable
,
you
may
only
see
six
.
If
so
,
come
back
tomorrow
or
even
later
in
the
night
.

Find
TX
Piscium
in
the
ring
.
Look
on
Wikipedia
's
star
map
of
Pisces
:
it
shows
five
stars
in
the
ring
.
The
white
circle
to
the
left
of
the
line
connecting
Iota
and
Lambda
is
TX
Piscium
.
If
you
can
make
out
the
colours
of
the
stars
in
the
sky
,
TX
Piscium
is
among
the
reddest
that
can
be
seen
.

The
Alpha
Persei
cluster
</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Find
Capella
and
Aldebaran
.
Capella
's
the
really
bright
one
in
Auriga
.
It
's
very
obvious
,
but
do
n't
confuse
it
with
Vega
,
Deneb
,
Sirius
etc.
Aldebaran
is
the
red
one
in
Taurus
.
<figure rend="Find Interesting Stargazing Targets Step 13.jpg">

<item>
Going
up
from
Aldebaran
and
right
from
Capella
should
lead
to
Perseus
.
It
should
look
like
two
reasonably
bright
stars
(
Alpha
Persei
and
Algol
the
demon
star
)
surrounded
by
a
smattering
of
dimmer
stars
.
The
left-hand
bright
star
(
closer
to
Capella
)
is
Alpha
Persei
.
<figure rend="Find Interesting Stargazing Targets Step 14.jpg">

<item>
Look
at
Alpha
Persei
through
binoculars
.
The
other
stars
in
the
cluster
should
jump
into
view
.

Holmberg
15A
-
a
galaxy-sized
black
hole
</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Find
Beta
Ceti
,
Eta
Ceti
and
Iota
Ceti
.
the
best
way
to
do
this
is
to
grab
a
star
map
and
use
that
.
<figure rend="Find Interesting Stargazing Targets Step 16.jpg">

Imagine
two
lines
:
one
connecting
Eta
and
Iota
,
the
other
from
Beta
going
north
(
i.
e.
from
Beta
Ceti
to
Polaris
)
.
The
black
hole
is
where
the
lines
cross
.
Holmberg
15A
is
the
central
black
hole
of
another
galaxy
,
and
has
a
currently
accepted
mass
of
10
billion
times
the
mass
of
the
Sun
(
although
estimates
range
up
to
310
billion
suns
)
,
about
equal
to
the
Large
Magellanic
Cloud
.

Do
n't
bother
with
binoculars
or
even
a
telescope
.
The
galaxy
is
far
too
dim
to
see
.
You
'll
have
to
content
yourself
with
knowing
that
it
's
there
