Steven

withdrew
from

to
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008%20Summer%20Olympics">

&quot;
Conscience
will
not
allow
me
to
continue
with
business
as
usual
,
&quot;
he
said
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Sudan
's
government
bears
the
bulk
of
the
responsibility
for
these
ongoing
crimes
but
the
international
community
,
and
particularly
China
,
should
be
doing
more
to
end
the
continuing
human
suffering
there
,
&quot;
Spielberg
's
statement
said
.
&quot;
China
's
economic
,
military
and
diplomatic
ties
to
the
government
of
Sudan
continue
to
provide
it
with
the
opportunity
and
obligation
to
press
for
change
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
China
immediately
expressed
regret
over
his
decision
and
suggested
that
&quot;
ulterior
motives
&quot;
may
be
at
play
.
&quot;
It
is
understandable
if
some
people
do
not
understand
the
Chinese
government
policy
on
Darfur
,
but
I
am
afraid
that
some
people
may
have
ulterior
motives
,
and
this
we
cannot
accept
.
...
China
is
also
concerned
about
the
humanitarian
situation
in
Darfur
.
[
But
]
empty
rhetoric
will
not
help
.
We
hope
that
relevant
people
will
be
more
pragmatic

Deputy-Director
General

<p>
Following
Spielberg
's
withdrawal
,
other
organizations
called
for
boycott
of
the
Games
.
However
,
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_Kingdom">

<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister%20for%20the%20Olympics">
Minister
for
the

</ref>
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessa%20Jowell">
Tessa
Jowell
</ref>
rejected
such
calls
.
&quot;
The
world
has
known
for
the
last
seven
years
that
Beijing
would
host
the
Olympics
,
&quot;
Jowell
told
<hi rend="italic">
The
Times
</hi>
.
&quot;
Most
progressive
governments
accept
that
there
are
wholly
unacceptable
aspects
of
Chinese
policy
,
but
that
did
not
stop
the
International
Olympic
Committee
awarding
them
the
games
.
A
call
for
a
boycott
does
n't
serve
any
purpose
and
it
would
be
a
great
pity
.
This
does
n't
mean
,
however
,
we
should
be
distracted
from
the
urgency
of
Darfur
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
China
is
also
concerned
about
the
humanitarian
issues
there
,
but
we
have
been
playing
a
positive
and
constructive
role
in
promoting
peace
in
Darfur
,
&quot;
Liu
said
,
adding
that
China
is
working
with
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_Nations">
United
Nations
</ref>
to
provide
aid
and
resolve
the
crisis
.
</p>
<p>
Critics
of
China
contend
that
China
supports
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Islam">
Islamic
</ref>
regime
in
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Sudan">
Sudan
</ref>
because
it
buys
two-thirds
of
the
country
's
oil
exports
and
also
sells
it
weapons
.
Further
,
China
has
been
defending
the
government
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khartoum">
Khartoum
</ref>
in
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United%20Nations%20Security%20Council">
United
Nations
Security
Council
</ref>
.
Since
2003
,
fighting
between
government-backed
militia
and
rebels
in
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Darfur">
Darfur
</ref>
has
led
to
the
death
of
more
than
200,000
people
and
displaced
some
2.5
million
others
.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile
,
United
States
President
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/George_W._Bush">
George
W.
Bush
</ref>
confirmed
that
he
still
plans
to
attend
the
Games
in
Beijing
.
&quot;
I
view
the
Olympics
as
a
sporting
event
.
On
the
other
hand
,
I
have
a
different
platform
to
Steven
Spielberg
,
so
I
get
to
talk
to
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Hu_Jintao">
Hu
Jintao
</ref>
[
President
of
China
]
and
I
do
remind
him
he
can
do
more
to
relieve
the
suffering
in
Darfur
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Bush
followed
this
by
saying
:
&quot;
I
â€™m
not
going
to
use
the
Olympics
as
an
opportunity
to
express
my
opinions
to
the
Chinese
people
in
a
public
way
because
I
do
it
all
the
time
with
the
president
.
