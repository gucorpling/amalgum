Prune
Ninebark
</head>
<p>
Ninebark
is
a
popular
shrub
for
landscaping
because
it
is
low-maintenance
and
it
comes
in
attractive
varieties
.
It
is
also
resistant
to
most
plant
diseases
and
grows
easily
.
If
you
have
a
ninebark
,
you
will
need
to
prune
it
at
least
once
per
year
to
keep
it
healthy
.
Choose
the
best
time
to
prune
,
identify
the
areas
that
would
benefit
from
pruning
,
and
use
proper
pruning
techniques
to
ensure
that
your
ninebark
remains
healthy
and
beautiful
for
years
to
come
!

Choosing
When

Prune
Ninebark
</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Prune
early
in
your
region
’s
growing
season
.
It
is
usually
best
to
prune
ninebark
before
it
starts
to
develop
too
much
,
which
will
be
sometime
between
late
winter
and
early
summer
depending
on
your
climate
.
Consider
when
the
growing
season
usually
begins
in
your
region
to
determine
when
to
prune
ninebark
.

For
example
,
if
you
live
somewhere
that
starts
to
get
warm
around
February
or
March
,
then
you
may
need
to
prune
early
.
If
it
does
n’t
start
to
get
warm
until
June
in
your
area
,
then
you
may
not
need
to
prune
until
later
.

Wait
for
flowers
to
appear
.
Ninebark
will
start
to
flower
early
in
the
growing
season
,
so
this
is
a
good
indication
that
it
is
time
to
prune
.
Wait
for
flowers
to
start
appearing
on
your
ninebark
and
then
prune
it
.

Avoid
waiting
to
prune
for
more
than
a
few
days
after
the
flowers
appear
because
this
may
damage
the
ninebark
and
the
plant
will
start
growing
and
expanding
,
which
will
create
more
work
for
you
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Perform
light
pruning
in
early
summer
to
get
rid
of
damaged
and
unhealthy
branches
.
After
your
initial
pruning
at
the
start
of
the
growing
season
,
you
may
need
to
do
some
maintenance
pruning
during
the
early
part
of
summer
.
Pay
attention
to
how
the
plant
develops
and
prune
as
needed
to
keep
it
healthy
and
looking
its
best
.
<figure rend="Prune Ninebark Step 3.jpg">

Do
not
prune
ninebark
past
the
middle
of
summer
because
the
ninebark
will
be
entering
its
dormant
phase
and
pruning
at
this
time
may
damage
it

Remove
dead
and
damaged
branches
and
shoots
.
Check
the
ninebark
for
any
branches
that
have
died
or
that
are
broken
during
your
maintenance
pruning
.
Cut
these
down
to
the
ground
or
as
close
to
the
connecting
branch
as
you
can
.

Do
n’t
cut
the
branches
down
to
stubs

Remove
them
completely
.

<item>
The
leaves
on
dead
stems
and
branches
will
be
dry
and
crunchy
or
nonexistent
.
Branches
that
are
sick
or
dead
may
have
flaky
bark
that
looks
different
from
the
bark
on
the
rest
of
the
shrub
.
</item>

</item>
<item>
Thin
out
stems
and
branches
in
areas
that
are
overcrowded
.
Check
the
interior
of
your
ninebark
during
maintenance
pruning
to
see
how
well
the
stems
and
branches
are
spaced
out
.
If
they
look
crowded
,
then
remove
some
of
them
to
thin
them
out
and
promote
healthier
growth
.
Make
sure
to
cut
them
all
the
way
down
to
the
connecting
branch
.

For
example
,
if
you
find
an
area
of
the
shrub
where
the
branches
are
rubbing
together
,
remove
a
few
of
the
branches
so
that
they
are
not
rubbing
together
anymore
.
</item>
<item>
You
may
also
notice
that
some
areas
of
the
ninebark
are
so
full
of
foliage
that
no
light
can
get
through
to
the
interior
of
the
plant
.
This
may
be
the
case
even
if
the
branches
are
spaced
out
.
Thin
out
these
areas
by
cutting
out
some
of
the
stems
and
their
connecting
leaves
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Eliminate
weak
or
spindly
shoots
.
If
during
maintenance
pruning
you
spot
any
shoots
that
look
weak
(
sagging
or
flimsy
)
or
spindly
(
with
few
leaves
or
flowers
)
,
then
remove
these
.
Cut
them
as
close
to
the
connecting
branch
as
you
can
.
Do
n’t
leave
any
stubs
.

<item>
Choose
the
right
tool
for
the
cut
you
need
to
make
.
The
type
of
tool
you
use
will
depend
on
the
area
of
the
ninebark
you
are
pruning
.
Depending
on
the
size
of
your
ninebark
,
you
may
need
1
tool
for
shoots
and
stems
and
another
tool
for
branches
.
Some
common
pruning
tools
include
:
<figure rend="Prune Ninebark Step 7.jpg">
</figure>
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Pruning
shears
.
Pruning
shears
are
best
for
cutting
through
branches
that
are
up
to
in
diameter
.
</item>
<item>
Loppers
.
Loppers
,
or
lopping
shears
,
work
well
for
cutting
through
branches
that
are
up
to
in
diameter
.
</item>
<item>
Hand
saw
.
You
may
need
a
hand
saw
to
remove
branches
greater
than
in
diameter
.
Some
hand
saws
are
even
strong
enough
to
cut
through
branches
as
thick
as
in
diameter
.
For
anything
thicker
,
use
a
chainsaw
.

Disinfect
your
tools
after
using
them
.
To
prevent
the
spread
of
diseases
among
diseased
and
healthy
plants
,
it
is
important
to
disinfect
your
gardening
tools
after
using
them
.
First
,
rinse
your
tools
off
with
clean
water
.
Then
,
mix
up
a
disinfectant
solution
made
up
of
1
part
bleach
and
9
parts
water
.
Soak
your
tools
in
the
solution
for
30
minutes
and
then
rinse
them
off
with
clean
water
.
Let
them
air
dry
or
dry
them
with
a
clean
towel
before
storing
them
.

Cut
branches
nearly
down
to
the
ground
.
It
is
important
to
cut
any
branches
you
remove
near
the
ground
.
Otherwise
,
they
may
hinder
the
growth
of
the
ninebark
and
they
will
affect
the
appearance
of
the
shrub
as
well
.
<figure rend="Prune Ninebark Step 9.jpg">
</figure>
<list type="unordered">
<item>
You
can
even
cut
the
entire
shrub
nearly
down
to
the
ground
if
it
is
out
of
control
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Make
cuts
in
branches
at
about
45
degree
angles
.
Whenever
you
need
to
remove
a
branch
,
cut
it
at
a
45
degree
angle
.
The
lowest
part
of
the
branch
should
be
even
with
the
connecting
branch
and
the
highest
part
of
the
branch
should
be
about
from
the
connecting
branch
.

Leave
the
base
of
the
shrub
wider
than
the
top
.
It
is
important
to
leave
the
bottom
of
the
shrub
wider
than
the
top
of
the
shrub
after
you
prune
it
or
the
bottom
of
the
shrub
will
not
get
adequate
light
.
This
could
cause
the
ninebark
to
grow
poorly
.
Prune
the
shrub
at
a
slight
angle
so
that
there
is
a
gradual
thickening
towards
the
base
.

For
example
,
you
could
prune
the
ninebark
into
a
pyramid-type
shape
with
a
rounded
top
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Maintain
symmetry
in
your
pruning
.
For
aesthetic
reasons
,
make
your
cuts
with
symmetry
in
mind
.
If
you
cut
a
branch
on
1
side
of
the
shrub
,
make
sure
that
the
opposite
side
has
a
similar
angle
to
it
.
Step
back
and
look
at
your
shrub
now
and
then
to
ensure
that
you
are
keeping
it
symmetrical
.
