A
rebel
group

Ethiopia
</ref>
'

<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogaden">

region
said
today
that
it
has
killed
626
government
troops
after
heavy
fighting
near
the
border
with
neighboring
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Somalia">
Somalia
</ref>
.
The
government
,
however
,
has
dismissed
the
claim
,
calling
it
&quot;
a
complete
fabrication
&quot;
.
</p>
<p>
A
communiqué
sent
to
news
agencies
by
e-mail
announced
that
a
multi-front
offensive
launched
by
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogaden%20National%20Liberation%20Front">
Ogaden
National
Liberation
Front
</ref>
(
ONLF
)
on
November
10
is
still
in
progress
.
The
communiqué
,
believed
to
be
sent
from
ONLF
offices
in
Europe
,
says
626
Ethiopian
troops
have
died
,
and
the
statement
says
the
battlefields
are
littered
with
bodies
of
soldiers
.
It
described
ONLF
casualties
as
&quot;
minimal
&quot;
,
but
gave
no
details
.
</p>
<p>
A
rebel
communiqué
issued
on
Friday
said
the
rebels
had
captured
seven
towns
along
the
border
with
Somalia
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
The
operation
involved
thousands
of
ONLF
troops
and
resulted
in
two
days
of
heavy
fighting
.
A
significant
number
of
Ethiopian
troops
have
been
killed
and
their
military
hardware
captured
or
destroyed
,
&quot;
read
a
statement
by
the
ONLF
.
</p>
<p>
They
said
that
they
entered
the
towns
of
Boodhaano
,
Galadiid
,
Gunogabo
,
Hamaro
,
Higlaaley
,
Obolka
,
and
Yucub
,
where
the
Ethiopian
government
had
stationed
troops
and
military
hardware
.
&quot;
ONLF
forces
were
warmly
welcomed
by
the
population
in
these
areas
and
are
administering
medical
care
to
those
civilians
killed
by
retreating
Ethiopian
occupation
forces
,
&quot;
the
statement
continued
.
</p>
<p>
The
reports
could
not
be
independently
verified
,
as
journalists
are
not
permitted
into
the
region
.
Ethiopian
government
spokesman
Shimelis
Kemal
,
however
,
called
the
ONLF
claims
completely
false
.
In
a
telephone
interview
with
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice%20of%20America">
Voice
of
America
</ref>
news
agency
,
he
described
the
communiqués
as
a
desperate
measure
used
occasionally
by
the
rebels
to
portray
the
region
as
being
in
turmoil
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
This
group
used
to
make
exaggerated
claims
,
&quot;
said
Shimelis
Kemal
.
&quot;
This
is
the
usual
lie
,
deliberately
fabricated
by
this
terrorist
group
.
&quot;
He
also
told
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence%20France-Presse">
Agence
France-Presse
</ref>
news
agency
that
the
rebel
's
announcements
were
&quot;
baseless
claim
,
blank
propaganda
.
This
terrorist
group
is
currently
disbanded
from
government
campaigns
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Shimelis
denied
any
government
troops
had
been
killed
,
and
said
the
current
fighting
is
between
the
rebels
and
local
militia
groups
.
&quot;
The
rebels
were
expelled
and
defeated
by
the
local
militia
,
&quot;
said
Shimelis
.
&quot;
The
army
was
not
involved
there
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Ethiopia
calls
the
rebels
&quot;
terrorists
&quot;
backed
by
neighboring
rival
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Eritrea">
Eritrea
</ref>
,
and
with
ties
to
the
Somali
group
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Al-Shabab">
al-Shabab
</ref>
.
Eritrea
and
the
ONLF
both
denied
the
links
,
and
there
is
no
independent
verification
of
the
charges
.
</p>
<p>
Government
troops
launched
a
fierce
offensive
against
the
ONLF
in
early
2007
after
the
rebels
attacked
a
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/China">
Chinese
</ref>
-owned
oil
exploration
field
in
Ethiopia
's
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebole">
Ebole
</ref>
district
,
killing
74
people
.
The
ONLF
accused
the
troops
of
conducting
a
&quot;
scorched
earth
&quot;
campaign
,
a
claim
that
was
strongly
denied
by
the
government
.
</p>
<p>
The
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_Nations">
United
Nations
</ref>
twice
requested
access
to
the
region
to
conduct
independent
human
rights
assessments
,
but
Ethiopia
refused
the
requests
.
</p>
<p>
Government
spokesman
Shimelis
said
that
2007
offensive
effectively
ended
the
ONLF
's
military
capability
.
&quot;
Since
the
Ebole
incident
,
the
ONLF
bandit
group
is
on
the
run
,
&quot;
he
said
.
&quot;
Recently
however
,
they
have
tried
to
raid
some
administrations
in
the
localities
,
and
that
attempt
had
been
effectively
defeated
by
the
local
militia
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Ethiopia
has
recently
attempted
to
assure
oil
companies
the
ONLF
no
longer
has
the
ability
to
threaten
exploration
and
production
in
the
Ogaden
region
.
However
,
Ethiopia
's
mines
and
energy
minister
was
quoted
this
week
as
saying
no
petroleum
reserves
had
been
found
in
the
country
,
despite
years
of
search
.
</p>
<p>
The
ONLF
has
been
fighting
for
greater
autonomy
or
independence
for
the
Ogaden
since
Ethiopia
seized
the
mostly
Somali-speaking
region
in
a
war
with
Somalia
more
than
30
years
ago
.
