The
two
convicted
reportedly
murdered
Aitchison
on
November
23
,
2011
,
inside
an
abandoned
building
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steinish">
Steinish
</ref>
,
a
village
located
on
the
island
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis">
Lewis
</ref>
.
Aitchison
,
who
had
originally
resided
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lochboisdale">
Lochboisdale
</ref>
on
the
island
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South%20Uist">
South
Uist
</ref>
,
moved
up
to
Stornoway
in
Lewis
and
began
working
as
a
fisherman
alongside
MacKinnon
and
Millar
,
developing
a
social
relationship
with
them
.
MacKinnon
and
Millar
pled
not
guilty
to
the
charges
of
murder
,
which
police
had
charged
them
with
in
December
2011
.
Judge
Lord
Kinclaven
presided
over
the
subsequent
court
trial
,
which
started
approximately
two
months
ago
.
</p>
<p>
Aitchison
and
Millar
were
listening
to
music
and
drinking
alongside
MacKinnon
in
his
residence
on
November
22
,
2011
and
MacKinnon
punched
Aitchison
as
&quot;
a
joke
&quot;
during
this
visit
,
the
court
was
told
.
The
three
walked
from
the
house
upon
receiving
noise
complaints
from
MacKinnon
's
mother
.
The
court
was
told
MacKinnon
commenced
fighting
with
Aitchison
when
a
bottle
of
aftershave
he
had
apparently
stolen
from
MacKinnon
dropped
from
his
pocket
.
Prior
to
the
murder
,
MacKinnon
had
stolen
a
meat
cleaver
from
a
boat
he
was
working
on
and
had
been
keeping
it
in
his
bedroom
,
the
court
was
also
told
.
The
exact
motive
for
the
murder
is
unclear
thus
far
.

Aitchison
died
when
he
was
stabbed
twenty
times
,
as
well
as
being
hit
with
a
bottle
and
stomped
on
his
head
.
Some
items
of
clothing
he
was
wearing
,
that
he
had
borrowed
from
MacKinnon
,
were
removed
from
his
body
following
the
killing
.
There
were
no
reports
during
the
trial
of
any
trace
of
the
items
of
clothing
being
discovered
,
nor
did
police
recover
any
murder
weapons
.
The
trial
was
predominantly
inferential
due
to
a
lack
of
solid
physical
evidence
.
</p>
<p>
Aitchison
was
likely
murdered
within
a
90
minute
period
on
November
23
,
2011
,
during
a
&quot;
communication
silence
&quot;
in
which
neither
of
the
accused
made
use
of
their
mobile
phones
,
the
prosecution
believed
.
Blood
stains
were
not
discovered
on
the
clothing
of
the
suspects
,
although
blood
stains
discovered
at
the
scene
of
the
murder
matched
MacKinnon
's
DNA
.
However
,
the
court
was
also
told
MacKinnon
had
previously
cut
his
hand
in
the
abandoned
building
several
years
prior
and
the
blood
stains
could
not
be
dated
.
A
key
piece
of
evidence
in
the
trial
came
from
Dominic
Long
,
who
recalled
how
Millar
boasted
about
the
murder
while
conversing
with
him
in
a
jail
.
Frances
McMenamin
,
QC
for
Millar
,
subsequently
claimed
Long
had
exaggerated
in
his
recount
and
was
an
unreliable
witness
as
he
suffered
from
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention%20deficit%20hyperactivity%20disorder">
attention
deficit
hyperactivity
disorder
</ref>
.
</p>
<p>
Aitchison
's
father
Norrie
said
following
the
guilty
verdicts
MacKinnon
and
Millar
were
given
would
&quot;
finally
allow
Liam
to
rest
in
peace
and
bring
his
family
some
closure
.
&quot;
He
called
this
murder
case
one
which
&quot;
no
family
should
have
to
endure
&quot;
,
additionally
commenting
of
the
convicted
:
&quot;
The
cowards
who
robbed
our
Liam
of
his
life
and
his
future
should
never
be
able
to
see
the
outside
of
a
prison
ever
again
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Following
the
sentencing
,
Claire
Aitchison
,
Liam
Aitchison
's
step-mother
,
said
:
&quot;
We
are
happy
that
justice
has
been
done
and
that
these
two
brutal
murderers
will
spend
a
long
time
in
prison
.
&quot;
However
,
she
criticised
the
sentences
given
,
saying
&quot;
they
are
getting
off
lightly
—
life
imprisonment
should
mean
life
.
They
killed
an
innocent
boy
in
cold
blood
but
,
by
the
time
they
leave
jail
,
they
will
still
be
young
enough
to
make
plans
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
.
&quot;
Claire
and
her
husband
Norrie
had
criticised
the
Scottish
legal
system
after
the
guilty
verdicts
were
given
for
the
way
it
could
allow
murder
suspects
to
be
granted
bail
after
MacKinnon
and
Millar
were
both
granted
bail
in
February
2012
and
December
2011
respectively
.
&quot;
We
want
to
head
up
a
campaign
to
keep
anyone
that
is
charged
with
murder
on
remand
until
proven
innocent
or
guilty
,
&quot;
Norrie
Aitchison
said
.
</p>
<p>
In
a
statement
,
Detective
Inspector
Andy
Logan
,
the
senior
investigator
of
Aitchison
's
murder
,
said
the
crime
had
&quot;
caused
considerable
distress
in
such
a
small
community
.
&quot;
He
also
said
&quot;
Liam
's
family
have
also
had
to
cope
with
the
loss
Liam
in
the
most
tragic
of
circumstances
and
hopefully
[
these
]
sentences
will
help
to
reassure
the
community
and
help
the
family
in
coming
to
terms
with
their
terrible
loss
.

Liam
Murphy
said
Aitchison
's
murder
&quot;
caused
shock
and
concern
in
this
small
community
of
Lewis
and
across
Scotland
&quot;
but
stressed
there
was
a
low
murder
rate
in
this
region
.
&quot;
I
hope
that
these
murder
convictions
reassure
those
communities
that
when
we
do
have
such
crimes
,
justice
will
be
done
,
&quot;
he
added
