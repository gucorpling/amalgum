At
the
end
of
my
sophomore
year
of
high
school
,
my
English
Teacher
(
who
was
retiring
after
that
year
)
gave
me
a
compliment
that
I
'll
never
forget
.
I
had
done
some
fun
stuff
in
her
class
,
including
acting
out
self-adapted
skits
of
Julius
Caesar
and
argumentative
essays
and
whatnot
,
and
at
the
end
of
the
year
,
she
asked
me
for
a
hug
and
said
,
</p>
<p>
You
remind
me
of
why
I
wanted
to
have
children
.
</p>
<p>
I
did
n't
realize
the
importance
of
that
at
the
time
,
but
since
graduating
high
school
,
she
's
really
the
only
teacher
I
've
kept
in
touch
with
.

I
was
in
gym
class
and
we
had
to
balance
ourself
on
a
line
and
I
had
some
difficulty
.
A
girl
(
to
whom
I
had
always
a
dick
to
,
if
I
'm
being
honest
)
told
me
to
just
focus
on
one
point
in
the
distance
and
that
it
would
work
.
I
did
and
it
worked
.
Once
I
was
done
,
she
told
me
Everybody
deserves
a
chance
to
succeed
.
</p>
<p>
Not
exactly
a
compliment
,
but
still
something
very
nice
that
stuck
with
me
.

An
old
co-worker
of
mine
told
me
that
she
thought
my
curiosity
was
marvelous
.
She
said
that
she
was
always
looking
forward
to
our
shared
shifts
because
I
was
constantly
following
some
new
spark
of
interest
head
on
without
looking
back
.
</p>
<p>
Honestly
never
realized
I
was
like
that
until
she
mentioned
it
.
I
still
try
to
keep
that
same
curiosity
alive
.

I
work

college
students

I
hosted
a
group
at
my
house
along
with
my
wife
and
three
kids
.
At
the
end
of
the
night
,
a
few
of
them
referred
to
us
as

I
'm
glad
I
read
this
thread
today
The
news
in
our
country
(
USA
)
is
so
disturbing
and
hurtful
that
my
heart
has
been
heavy
Reading
this
has
given
me
hope
that
there
are
kind
and
compassionate
people
in
this
world

I
was
n't
the
person
who
could
easily
make
good
grades
in
HS
.
I
went
to
a
small
HS
and
I
worked
my
derri√®re
off
to
keep
my
grades
up
.
I
had
two
friends
that
would
just
clown
around
and
not
work
hard
at
all
to
maintain
their
good
grades
.
I
would
always
get
so
jealous
...
but
then
just
put
my
head
down
and
go
back
to
studying
.
I
graduated
4th
in
my
class
and
those
clowns
I
think
finished
out
the
Top
10
.
We
all
went
off
to
college
and
years
later
,
one
of
them
finds
me
on
AIM
.
(
Yes
,
I
'm
old
)
.
He
told
me
that
he
had
a
Trisassyjcc
size
chip
on
his
shoulder
.
He
said
that
once
he
got
to
college
,
he
realized
that
he
could
n't
rest
on
his
laurels
.
That
he
had
to
work
really
hard
to
do
well
.
And
he
just
said
that
he
often
imagined
me
just
sitting
in
the
corner
studying
and
he
would
get
back
to
work
.
I
had
no
idea
I
had
had
that
effect
on
him
.
That
someone
had
even
noticed
it
...
and
would
use
me
as
an
example
to
better
their
own
lives
.
It
was
,
by
far
,
one
of
the
best
compliments
I
had
ever
received
.
</p>
<p>
That
and
someone
once
told
me
that
I
just
had
a
natural
ability
to
make
people
feel
comfortable
and
welcome
so
much
so
that
random
people
would
just
feel
comfortable
opening
their
hearts
to
me
and
speaking
freely
.
That
one
meant
a
lot
to
me
.
