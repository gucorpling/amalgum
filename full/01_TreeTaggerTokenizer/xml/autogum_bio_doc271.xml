Emboldened
by
the
voyage
,
Boki
sought
to
trade
on
the
fame
it
gave
him
.
He
moved
a
wood
frame
house
inland
and
opened
a
store
and
inn
called
the
Blonde
Hotel
.
He
became
unpopular
with
local
missionaries
because
he
sold
liquor
there
.
He
stocked
his
bar
with
cheap
but
bad
wine
,
saying
it
was
good
enough
for
visiting
sailors
.
Like
his
other
business
ventures
,
it
was
not
profitable
to
himself
,
but
perhaps
was
to
his
employees
.
One
of
them
claimed
the
building
in
the
1830s
,
calling
it
the
&quot;
Boki
House

arriving

had
been
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptism">

as

Although

to
be
baptized
,
when
he
married
Liliha
,
he
refused
to
marry
her
in
church
and
,
despite
his
conversion
,
was
known
to
enjoy
partaking
of
&quot;
sinful
&quot;
and
&quot;
immoral
&quot;
treats
,
such
as
drinking

Queen
regent
Kaʻahumanu
had
become
influenced
by
the
Protestant
missionaries
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honolulu">
Honolulu
</ref>
and
was
baptized
into
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congregational_church">
Congregational
church
</ref>
.
Heeding
the
advice
of
her
Congregationalist
ministers
,
Kaʻahumanu
influenced
King
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamehameha_III">
Kamehameha
III
</ref>
to
ban
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church">
Roman
Catholic
Church
</ref>
from
the
islands
.
Boki
and
Liliha
were
a
constant
threat
to
Kaʻahumanu
and
her
hold
on
the
boy-king
and
when
she
learned
that
they
were
among
the
first
chiefs
to
convert
to
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Honolulu">
Hawaii
Catholic
Church
</ref>
it
angered
her
,
since
she
wanted
all
the
chiefs
to
accept
Protestantism
,
an
example
she
hoped
all
Hawaiians
would
follow
.
Torn
in
conflicting
directions
,
the
young
king
under
the
influence
of
Boki
turned
to
alcohol
in
what
was
portrayed
as
a
clear
rejection
of
the
either
Christian
standards
of
morality
.

<p>
After
restrictions
on
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandalwood">
sandalwood
</ref>
trading
placed
by
Kamehameha
I
lapsed
,
Boki
immersed
himself
in
the
business
.
He
grew
rich
,
like
many
other
chiefs
,
but
the
chiefs
'
lack
of
understanding
of
financial
concepts
caused
him
to
become
deeply
indebted
by
1829
.
When
word
reached
him
that
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hebrides">
New
Hebrides
</ref>
,
a
faraway
group
of
South
Pacific
islands
,
was
heavily
forested
in
sandalwood
,
he
pulled
together
a
fleet
of
two
ships
and
set
sail
.
It
is
known
that
he
reached
Rotuma
in
1827
and
also
called
at
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erromango">
Erromango
</ref>
.
However
,
when
he
failed
to
return
to
Hawaii
it
was
assumed
that
he
had
perished
at
sea
.
</p>
<p>
Despite
the
Hawaiian
belief
that
he
died
during
his
sandalwood
expedition
,
there
is
evidence
that
Boki
was
alive
and
well
in
Samoa
in
the
year
1830
.
According
to
Marques
'
1893
report
,
Boki
's
ship
was
wrecked
in
1830
near
Iva
on
the
Samoan
island
of
Savaiʻi
where
he
rallied
under
the
banner
of
the
ambitious
Samoan
chief
,
Malietoa
Vaiinupo
.
The
Hawaiian
embassy
delegation
sent
to
Samoa
by
King
Kalakaua
in
1886
learned
that
the
two
Prussian
cannons
from
Boki
's
ships
were
indeed
still
to
be
found
in
Iva
village
along
with
&quot;
many
of
his
descendants
&quot;
.

<p>
Before
departing
,
Boki
entrusted
administration
of
Oahu
to
his
wife
and
,
subsequently
,
widow
,
Liliha
who
was
made
chiefess
of
Waiʻanae
and
governor
of
Oʻahu
,
until
she
tried
to
overthrow
Kaʻahumanu
.
Her
father
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoapili">
Hoapili
</ref>
talked
her
out
of
it
at
the
last
minute
,
but
she
was
,
nevertheless
,
relieved
of
her
duties
.
After
Kaʻahumanu
died
in
1832
,
Liliha
was
described
as
no
longer
observant
of
the
missionary
rules
.
