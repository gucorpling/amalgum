confirmed
yesterday
that
the
police
will
enforce
the
law
banning

propaganda
of
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Homosexuality">

The
statement
said
&quot;
law
enforcement
agencies
can
have
no
qualms
with
people
who
harbour
a
nontraditional
sexual
orientation
&quot;
so
long
as
they
do
not
promote
homosexuality
to
minors
,
&quot;
do
not
conduct
any
kind
of
provocation
and
take
part
in
the
Olympics
peacefully
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
statement
continued
:
&quot;
Any
discussion
on
violating
the
rights
of
representatives
of
nontraditional
sexual
orientations
,
stopping
them
from
taking
part
in
the
Olympic
Games
or
discrimination
of
athletes
and
guests
of
the
Olympics
according
to
their
sexual
orientation
is
totally
unfounded
and
contrived
.

,
the
deputy

told
the

agency
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIA%20Novosti">
RIA
Novosti
</ref>
:
&quot;
If
a
person
does
not
put
across
his
views
in
the
presence
of
children
,
no
measures
against
him
can
be
taken
.
People
of
nontraditional
sexual
orientations
can
take
part
in
the
competitions
and
all
other
events
at
the
games
unhindered
,
without
any

letter
to

<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/David_Cameron">
David

arguing
the

Vladimir

&quot;
is
making
scapegoats
of
gay
people
,
just
as
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler">
Hitler

did
Jews
&quot;
.
Fry
argued
&quot;
[
anti-gay
]
beatings
,
murders
and
humiliations
are
ignored
by
the
police
.
Any
defence
or
sane
discussion
of

is
against
the
law
.

</p>
<p>
Fry
attended
a
protest
in
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/London">
London
</ref>
on
Saturday
against
the
Russian
laws
on
homosexuality
.
At
the
protest
he
said
:
&quot;
All
homophobic
regimes
say
this
—
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think%20of%20the%20children">
they
say
they
do
it
for
the
children
</ref>
.
They
do
this
to
stop
children
being
propogandised
at
by
gay
people
.
That
's
not
the
situation
at
all
.
What
they
have
done
is
unleashed
thugs
who
have
done
unspeakable
things
to
teenagers
,
lured
them
,
beaten
them
,
humiliated
them
,
tortured
them
.
This
continues
to
be
the
case
.

<p>
On

,
David
Cameron
responded
to
Fry
's
call
for
a
relocation
of
the
Games
:
&quot;
Thank
you
for
your
note
@stephenfry
.
I
share
your
deep
concern
about
the
abuse
of
gay
people
in
Russia
.
However
,
I
believe
we
can
better
challenge
prejudice
as
we
attend
,
rather
than
boycotting
the
Winter
Olympics
.

Lord
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian%20Coe">
Sebastian
Coe
</ref>
,
head
of
the
British
Olympic
Association
,
also
rejected
the
call
for
a
boycott
or
relocation
:
&quot;
only
damage
one
group
of
people
,
and
that
is
the
athletes
.
It
is
an
issue
that
needs
to
be
addressed
,
but
not
an
issue
that
is
one
of
a
boycott
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Coe
also
argued
the
Olympics
and
other
sporting
events
help
promote
social
change
:
&quot;
International
sport
is
not
an
inhibitor
of
social
change
,
it
actually
has
quite
strong
catalytic
effects
.
I
am
a
profound
believer
that
the
relationships
developed
through
international
sport
are
often
in
the
infancy
of
social
change
.

has
also
rejected

call
for

.
At
a
press
conference
at
the
White
House
last
week
,
he
stated
:
&quot;
I
want
to
just
make
very
clear
right
now
:
I
do
not
think
it
’s
appropriate
to
boycott
the
Olympics[
...
]
We
’ve
got
a
bunch
of
Americans
out
there
who
are
training
hard
,
who
are
doing
everything
they
can
to
succeed
.
Nobody
’s
more
offended
than
me
by
some
of
the
anti-gay
and
-lesbian
legislation
that
you
’ve
been
seeing
in
Russia
