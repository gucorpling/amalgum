Do
you
feel
there
should
be
a
happy
ending
for
Nikki
and
Victor
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Melody

:
No
,
no
,
no
to
the
happy
ending
!
If
we
languished
in
happiness
for
too
long
,
it
would
be
beyond
boring
.
Tension
and
conflict
is
the
only
way
to
keep
characters
interesting
.
You
may
think
you
want
them
to
be
happy
,
but
after
a
short
time
,
the
audience
would
want
to
see
some
fireworks
again
.

Your
character
went
from
stripper
to
socialite
.
How
do
you
feel
this
change
deepened
the
facets
of
your
character
's
personality
?

Melody
Thomas
Scott
</hi>
:
Nikki
went
through
a
lot
even
before
the
stripper
storyline
.
In
the
first
few
months
after
I
started
,
she
killed
her
father
in
self-defense
(
he
had
rape
on
his
mind
)
,
joined
a
cult
,
and
was
a
model
for
an
agency
that
turned
out
to
be
a
front
for
prostitution
.
Beyond
wayward
!
Being
a
&quot;
socialite
&quot;
never
entered
her
mind
,
as
she
believed
Victor
was
the
butler
when
she
fell
in
love
with
him
.
The
socialite
aspect
happened
very
slowly
,
but
finding
herself
as
the
wife
of
Victor
Newman
,
she
had
to
learn
how
to
present
herself
properly
in
this
world
that
was
180
degrees
from
where
she
came
from
.
I
think
deep
down
she
still
feels
unworthy
of
her
position
in
life
.

How
do
you
feel
about
being
recognized
not
only
in
the
U.S.
,
but
abroad
as
well
?

It
's
amazing
.
One
of
the
perks
of
being
on
such
an
internationally
successful
show
has
been
traveling
to
other
countries
(
we
are
[
currently
]
broadcast
in
55
countries
)
on
the
show
's
behalf
.
I
'll
never
forget
the
mind-boggling
reception
we
received
in
Istanbul
.
Journalists
and
film
crews
were
actually
on
the
tarmac
as
we
disembarked
the
plane
.
We
kept
looking
behind
us
to
see
who
they
were
waiting
for
.
Was
Princess
Diana
on
the
plane
with
us
?
No
,
they
were
there
for
us
.
We
have
enjoyed
similar
receptions
in
Italy
,
Belgium
,
France
,
Monte
Carlo
,
Canada
,
the
Caribbean
,
and
Australia
,
to
name
a
few
.
It
's
given
us
very
treasured
memories
.
