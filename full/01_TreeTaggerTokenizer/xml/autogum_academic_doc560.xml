Approach
</head>
<p>
The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
identify
the
power
consumption
of
buildings
and
determine
the
variables
that
contribute
to
their
use
.
This
study
confirms
that
key
variables
obtained
using
clustering
in
machine
learning
strongly
correlate
with
the
energy
consumption
of
buildings
.
For
this
purpose
,
it
is
important
to
first
identify
building
energy
consumption
patterns
.
This
was
done
based
on
a
total
of
16
variables
related
to
building
energy
usage
,
in
addition
to
the
electricity
consumption
of
the
target
building
.
Then
,
the
variables
that
best
define
the
energy
consumption
patterns
were
identified
.
The
major
elements
affecting
consumption
are
not
identified
by
simulation
,
or
by
the
analyst
â€™s
experience
,
but
through
a
machine
learning
process
.
The
structure
of
the
research
work
is
described

This
study
targets
11
office
buildings
in
eight
different
regions
of
South
Korea
.
Their
heating
and
cooling
systems
use
electricity
.
The
11
buildings
all
have
different
areas
,
building
designs
,
and
heating
and
cooling
systems
,
and
are
used
for
different
purposes
.
In
the
data
analysis
,
the
physical
qualities
are
referred
to
as
nominal
variables
.
In
this
study
,
only
the
continuous
data
that
change
in
real
time
as
a
result
of
the
actions
of
the
occupants
were
used
for
the
analysis
.
Four
categories
of
variables
were
identified
for
the
analysis
,
i.
e.
,
the
amount
of
electric
energy
used
by
the
building
,
external
environmental
data
,
building
system
data
,
and
occupancy
schedules
.
In
total
,
16
continuous
variables
were
selected
;

Before
analyzing
the
large
amount
of
data
used
in
machine
learning
,
preprocessing
is
a
necessary
step
that
prepares
data
by
processing
missing
values
,
removing
noise
,
or
removing
outliers
.
In
data
preprocessing
,
cleaning
is
a
process
that
fills
in
or
removes
missing
values
,
corrects
noisy
data
,
identifies
outliers
,
and
therefore
ensures
the
consistency
of
data
outcomes
;

The
data
set
in
this
research
contains
time
variables
(
such
as
the
year
,
month
,
day
,
day
of
the
week
,
and
hour
)
,
external
environment
variables
(
including
temperature
,
humidity
,
sunlight
,
airflow
,
wind
speed
,
and
soil
temperature
)
,
and
energy
variables
that
track
the
energy
consumed
during
the
building
operating
hours
(
in
2016
,
use
of
electricity
consumption
hourly
data
of
11
offices
)
;
</p>
<p>
(

)
To
determine
the
most
important
variables
,
unsupervised
learning
,
which
does
not
require
a
ground
truth
,
was
used
.
This
involved
using
clustering
to
extract
the
most
important
variables
that
control
the
building
energy
usage
and
cluster
similar
variables
together
;

In
addition
,
using
the
<hi rend="italic">
t
</hi>
-test
,
we
aimed
to
verify
the
validity
of
the
variables
,
derived
from
machine
learning
,
that
affect
the
building
energy
consumption
;
</p>
<p>
(

)
For
each
target
building
,
the
first
16
variables
related
to
energy
consumption
,
and
five
variables
derived
from
machine
learning
,
were
compared
with
the
same
verification
logic
.

<p>
As
stated
in
Section
3
,
this
study
aims
to
use
energy
data
derived
from
a
building
and
identify
important
variables
that
control
most
of
the
energy
consumption
.
Two
representative
clustering
methodologies
used
for
this
purpose
are
the
Density-Based
Spatial
Clustering
of
Applications
with
Noise
(
DBSCAN
)
and
K-means
.

Clustering
:
DBSCAN
and
K-Means
</head>
<p>
Density-based
spatial
clustering
of
applications
with
noise
,
one
of
the
most
widely
used
density-based
clustering
methods
,
explores
core
objects
that
have
a
high
density
in
a
neighborhood
.
Centroid-based
clustering
methods
of
K-means
predetermine
the
K
value
and
the
number
of
clusters
,
and
then
assign
each
datum
to
one
of
the
K
clusters
to
minimize
dispersion
.
Centroid-based
algorithms
have
the
advantages
of
clustering
many
data
points
quickly
and
easily
,
and
spherical
data
have
a
relatively
better
reliability
.

Table

shows
a
sequential
list
of
operations
performed
through
DBSCAN
and
K-means
using
the
open-source
program
R
3.6.1
.
To
summarize
the
clustering
process
for
extracting
key
variables
,
first
,
similar
characteristics
(
density
center
,
distance-based
)
in
the
various
data
were
assessed
to
create
the
first
cluster
.
Although
N
clusters
were
formed
,
it
was
impossible
to
determine
which
clusters
were
meaningful
.
Then
,
results
were
extracted
only
for
clusters
containing
a
large
amount
of
data
.
Based
on
these
results
,
the
data
were
classified
into
high-energy-consumption
and
low-energy-consumption
data
clusters
.
Lastly
,
for
the
two
clusters
with
large
amounts
of
high-energy-consumption
data
,
box
plots
were
used
to
confirm
which
of
the
16
variables
related
to
building
energy
were
the
most
important
.
