Carmelo
's
ego
ruined
the
Knicks
</head>
<sp who="#jennys0">
<p>
The
<hi rend="bold">
Melodrama
</hi>
ended
up
with
a
trade
to
the
Knicks
.
Everything
looked
seemingly
good
in
his
27
games
there
.
The
Knicks
were
already
playoff
bound
before
Carmelo
arrived
.
They
went
into
the
playoffs
,
but
got
swept
by
the
Celtics
in
round
1
.
Let
's
break
down
year
by
year
:
<hi rend="bold">
2011-2012
Season
</hi>
Carmelo
's
first
full
year
.
There
was
the
CBA
lockout
which
limited
the
games
to
only
66
instead
of
82
.
The
New
York
Knicks
started
out
horribly
,
going
8-15
in
Carmelo
Anthony
's
first
full
season
as
a
Knick
.
Their
playoff
chances
was
becoming
slim
to
none
.
A
game
before
Carmelo
got
injured
,
an
unknown
23
yearold
player
named
Jeremy
Lin
broke
out
.
In
a
span
of
9
games
,
Jeremy
Lin
put
up
:
*
25pts
9.2asts
3.8rebs
2.2stls
on
50.9/33.3/70.8
shooting
.
In
those
9
games
,
the
Knicks
went
8-1
after
their
8-15
start
.
Linsanity
hype
was
the
biggest
sports
talk
in
the
world
.
It
was
an
undrafted
and
unknown
2nd
year
player
who
was
dominating
.
However
,
<ref target="http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/8509424/new-york-knicks-star-carmelo-anthony-master-getting-way-espn-magazine">
Carmelo
was
n't
entirely
happy
it
because
of
all
the
attention
being
focused
on
Lin
instead
of
him
.
</ref>
&gt;&quot;Lin
was
getting
what
Carmelo
was
promised
,
&quot;
says
a
source
close
to
the
team
When
Carmelo
came
back
from
his
injury
,
he
had
to
adjust
with
the
ball
being
in
Lin
's
hand
more
.
However
,
he
was
resistant
because
he
thought
the
offense
was
ran
through
too
Lin
too
much
and
did
n't
fit
his
half-court
isolation
style
.
Lin
's
scoring
role
was
reduced
,
but
he
was
still
the
facilitator
of
the
offense
.
They
only
won
2
of
9
.

Reports
come
out
about
Carmelo
being
unhappy
about
the
offense

&gt;
Carmelo
thought
D'Antoni
was
going
to
favor
Jeremy

so
he
had
to
get
D'Antoni
out
of
there

I
've
got
a
motto
.
When
the
posse
's
chasing
you
out
of
town
,
you
just
act
like
you
're
the
head
of
a
parade
.
After
firing
D'Antoni
,
Mike
Woodson
replaces
him
.
In
the
9
game
stretch
with
Carmelo
before
the
firing
,
Jeremy
Lin
averaged
33.9minutes
and
13.4
FGA
per
game
.
After
the
firing
,
Lin
's
playing
style
and
role
changed
.
He
averaged
only
28minutes
and
had
only
9
FGA
for
7
games
before
he
got
injured
for
the
season
.
Despite
the
coaching
changes
and
internal
dysfunction
,
Jeremy
Lin
put
up
solid
numbers
playing
with
Carmelo
through
16
games
:
*
15pts
6.8asts
3.7rebs
1.9stls
on
40.1/31.8/84.9
shooting
Carmelo
was
jealous
of
Lin
's
fame
in
NY
when
he
was
supposed
to
be
the
face
of
Knicks
basketball
.
D'Antoni
was
ok
with
running
the
offense
through
Lin
,
but
Carmelo
was
not
.
He
saw
himself
as
a
superstar
who
's
offensive
attention
should
not
be
shifted
onto
a
random
23yearold
that
came
from
the
GLeague
.

Lin
]
being
the
new
star
In
free
agency
,
Jeremy
Lin
got
a
4
year
$28.8million
offer
from
the
Rockets
that
was
only
guaranteed
for
3
years
.
It
came
out
to
$7.2million/year
.
Knicks
were
ready
to
match
,
but
the
Rockets
came
back
with
a
3
year
$25million
deal
where
they
backloaded
it
.
It
came
to
about
$5million
for
the
first
2
years
,
and
$
14.9
million
for
the
final
3rd
year

For

highest
paid
player
behind
Stoudemire(20million

Carmelo(21

,
and
Chandler(13.5million

.
[
While
on
the
US
Olympic
team
that
summer
,
Carmelo
was
asked
about
if
Jeremy
Lin
would
come
back
to
the
Knicks
,
to
which
Melo
called
it
a
ridiculous
contract
</ref>
&gt;
&quot;
It
's
not
up
to
me
,
&quot;
Anthony
said
with
a
laugh
.
&quot;
It
's
up
to
the
organization
to
say
they
want
to
match
that
ridiculous
contract
that
's
out
there
.
&quot;
Knicks
did
not
match
the
offer
and
let
him
leave
to
Houston
.
Instead
,
they
signed
Raymond
Felton
to
a
cheaper
contract
at
PG
.
They
also
acquired
39yearold
Jason
Kidd
.
Both
of
their
salaries
combined
for
around
$
6.5
million
per
year
.
<hi rend="bold">
2012-2013
Season
</hi>
In
the
next
year
,
they
had
a
great
season
under
Mike
Woodson
going
52-48
.
They
made
the
playoffs
,
but
lost
to
the
Pacers
in
the
2nd
round
.
They
had
slight
issues
at
the
PG
position
with
Felton
being
a
fringe
starting
PG
.
They
had
no
one
on
the
roster
who
could
consistently
break
down
defenses
and
get
inside
the
paint
.
They
did
n't
have
anyone
who
could
consistently
create
their
own
shot
except
for
Carmelo
and
JR
Smith(to
some
extent
)
.
Lack
of
scoring
was
a
big
problem
for
them
.
<hi rend="bold">
2013-2014
Season
</hi>
Kidd
retires
and
they
bring
in
36yearold
Pablo
Priginoi
and
31yearold
Beno
Udrih
to
help
at
PG
.
Raymond
Felton
heavily
regresses
,
and
the
PG
position
becomes
a
hole
.
They
have
no
one
who
can
penetrate
defenses
or
create
shots
off
the
dribble
.
They
had
no
one
who
could
score
on
that
team
.
They
go
37-45
and
miss
the
playoffs
.
They
fire
Mike
Woodson
and
hire
Derrick
Fisher
.
Carmelo
's
contract
doens't
expire
for
2
more
seasons
,
but
he
extends
it
for
3
more
years
.
<hi rend="bold">
2014-2015
Season
</hi>
In
the
next
season
,
they
changed
Felton
and
Beno
for
33yearold
Calderon
and
Larkin
.
They
start
off
5-29
with
Carmelo
playing
in
almost
all
of
the
games
.
PG
is
a
major
weakness
and
they
had
no
one
on
that
team
who
could
create
their
own
shot
.
Again
...
no
scorer
on
this
team
either
.
Carmelo
is
injured
after
that
start
,
and
they
miss
the
playoffs
.

Carmelo
's
own
ego
hurt
the
Knicks
.
They
were
never
able
to
find
a
starting
caliber
PG
.
They
struggled
finding
anyone
who
could
consistently
create
their
own
shot
.
They
went
on
4
straight
losing
seasons
.
I
'm
not
saying
Jeremy
Lin
would
've
been
able
to
keep
up
his
production
from
Linsanity
,
but
he
would
've
easily
filled
a
missing
void
they
needed
.
He
would
've
been
the
PG
who
can
break
defenses
down
and
open
the
floor
for
players
.
He
would
've
taken
the
scoring
load
off
of
Carmelo
.
He
would
've
provided
their
perimeter
defense
that
they
desperately
lacked
from
Calderon
,
Beno
,
Prigoni
,
and
Felton
.
Lin
might
've
not
been
a
franchise
player
,
but
he
would
've
been
1
piece
closer
in
helping
the
Knicks
become
a
good
team
.
The
Knicks
'
front
office
makes
their
own
decisions
,
but
it
's
the
Lin
move
that
started
a
chain
of
events
.
When
their
star
Melo
dislikes
playing
alongside
another
,
of
course
they
would
take
that
into
serious
condition
.
Especially
when
he
calls
that
contract
&quot;
ridiculous
&quot;
to
the
whole
wide
world
.
Carmelo
's
ego
hurt
the
Knicks
'
.
With
him
,
the
Knicks
were
never
able
to
build
a
contending
team
.
If
it
were
n't
for
them
drafting
Porzingis
in
the
2015
draft
,
the
future
of
the
Knicks
would
be
extremely
bleak
.
