Robert

</ref>
flew
to
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Slovakia">
Slovakia
</ref>
on
Wednesday
,
to
ask
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/NATO">
NATO
</ref>
defense
ministers
to
help
the
United
States
respond
to
the
request
for
more
resources
made
by
the
US
and
NATO
commander
in
Afghanistan
,
General
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley%20McChrystal">

.
</p>
<p>
Gates
told
reporters
on
his
aircraft
that
he
believed
it
makes
sense
to
have
these
talks
now
,
because
he
said
the
effort
to
stabilize
and
develop
Afghanistan
is
a
NATO
mission
,
not
just
one
for
the
US
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
This
is
an
alliance
issue
and
my
view
all
along
has
been
we
ought
to
do
this
in
a
way
that
if
General
McChrystal
has
an
additional
set
of
needs
,
it
should
not
be
looked
upon
as
exclusively
the
responsibility
of
the
United
States
to
respond
,
&quot;
the
defense
secretary
remarked
.
</p>
<p>
Gates
said
that
since
the
NATO
summit
last
spring
he
has
seen
&quot;
more
energy
and
more
commitment
&quot;
among
NATO
nations
to
doing
what
is
necessary
to
succeed
in
Afghanistan
.
He
described
current
consultations
with
NATO
allies
as
&quot;
intense
.
&quot;
General
McChrystal
says
the
allied
effort
could
fail
to
prevent
a
militant
takeover
in
Afghanistan
unless
he
is
given
more
resources
.
In
a
secret
request
,
he
is
believed
to
be
asking
for
40,000
or
more
additional
troops
,
on
top
of
68,000
U.S.
and
nearly
40,000
coalition
troops
already
there
.
President
Barack
Obama
is
expected
to
decide
on
any
additional
US
deployment
soon
.
</p>
<p>
Gates
added
that
he
wanted
his
NATO
counterparts
to
consider
what
additional
commitments
they
can
also
make
to
help
reverse
gains
made
by
the
Taliban
and
similar
groups
in
recent
years
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
My
hope
is
that
we
can
have
a
serious
discussion
about
how
things
have
changed
in
Afghanistan
since
last
spring
,
and
a
way
forward
in
which
the
alliance
can
share
these
responsibilities
and
work
with
the
Afghan
government
to
move
the
situation
in
a
more
positive
direction
,
&quot;
he
said
.
</p>
<p>
But
the
secretary
noted
that
all
contributions
to
the
Afghanistan
effort
do
not
have
to
be
military
.
He
said
he
headed
for
Bratislava
with
a
&quot;
menu
of
options
&quot;
for
allies
to
consider
,
and
that
much
of
the
capability
General
McChrystal
wanted
is
not
controversial
,
such
as
civilian
assistance
,
training
,
and
financing
for
development
projects
.
</p>
<p>
Speaking
early
on
Thursday
during
a
visit
to
South
Korea
,
Gates
also
welcomed
the
decision
to
hold
a
runoff
to
decide
the
Afghan
presidential
election
,
saying
all
nations
involved
have
an
interest
in
a
smooth
process
to
provide
the
winning
candidate
with
as
much
legitimacy
as
possible
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
think
virtually
all
of
the
nations
that
increased
their
troop
presence
to
provide
security
for
the
elections
in
August
have
kept
those
forces
there
and
so
are
in
a
position
to
try
and
,
along
with
their
Afghan
Army
and
police
counterparts
,
provide
as
good
a
security
as
possible
for
the
[
runoff
]
elections
,
&quot;
he
said
.
</p>
<p>
Gates
,
however
,
noted
that
will
not
end
problems
of
corruption
and
weak
governance
in
Afghanistan
.
He
said
the
international
community
will
still
have
much
work
to
do
with
any
new
government
in
Kabul
to
provide
the
kind
of
stability
,
security
and
services
that
will
have
a
chance
of
convincing
the
Afghan
people
to
support
the
government
,
rather
than
the
militants
of
the
Taliban
and
al-Qaida
.
