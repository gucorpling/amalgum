I
also
have
been
subjected
to
a
disappointingly
unfair
process
by
which
the
Party
has
not
even
remotely
provided
an
equal
chance
to
other
candidates
and
me
.
This
is
n't
unique
to
the
Democratic
Party
.
Both
Parties
dramatically
favor
their
&quot;
politically
privileged
&quot;
member[s
]
;
those
individuals
who
have
served
their
respective
Parties
for
a
long
time
and
raised
serious
money
on
behalf
of
their
Party
.
</p>
<p>
If
I
detailed
all
of
the
&quot;
behind
the
scenes
&quot;
inequities
that
I
and
others
candidates
like
me
have
endured
,
you
'd
be
shocked
.
Perhaps
that
will
be
another
legacy
of
this
campaign
as
I
am
inclined
to
bring
these
issues
to
light
and
have
the
courts
decide
whether
the
practices
should
be
continued
.
That
might
be
a
greater
benefit
to
the
People
than
even
serving
as
president
of
the
United
States
.

:
I
am
disappointed
by
the
treatment
I
have
received
such
as
being
denied
the
courtesy
of
automatic
ballot
access
that
's
afforded
&quot;
politically
privileged
&quot;
candidate[s
]
,
having
votes
mysteriously
disappear
from
election
results
,
having
State
Parties
in
caucus
states
withhold
location
information
,
list
me
as
&quot;
Other
&quot;
and
refuse
to
provide
areas
for
my
preference
groups
to
form
,
etc.
However
,
I
am
not
disappointed
by
the
results
under
those
circumstances
.

Despite
this
type
of
treatment
,
I
have
successfully
qualified
to
participate
in
the
primaries
and
caucuses
in
a
combination
of
48
states
and
territories
.
I
have
also
already
amassed
more

While
those
candidates
have
suspended
their
campaigns
,
an
independent
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/NPR">
NPR
</ref>
article
recently
noted
my
performance
as
somewhat
of
a
phenomenon
given
that
my
campaign
is
predominantly
self-funded
and
enjoys
absolutely
zero
Party
support
or
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super%20PAC">

money
.
Conversely
,
these
candidates
all
received
massive
support
from
the
Republican
Party
in
terms
of
the
visibility
and
support
they
were
given
.
Most
also
have
benefited
from
the
monetary
support
of
conservative
Super
PACs
.
</p>
<p>
I
'm
not
sharing
this
information
to
brag
but
rather
to
provide
a
context
for
how
the
Parties
have
insulated
themselves
with
a
set
of
rules
that
preclude
legitimate
candidates
such
as
me
from
having
an
equal
opportunity
to
be
heard
and
have
an
impact
.
Why
not
let
the
People
choose
?
