Become
a
Guide
Dog
Trainer
</head>
<p>
Guide
dog
trainers
perform
their
job
because
they
have
a
passion
for
animals
and
helping
others
.
The
level
of
training
to
become
a
guide
dog
trainer
is
high
and
the
compensation
is
often
low
.
A
trainer
is
required
to
work
with
a
puppy
for
approximately
one
year
,
then
hand
the
trained
dog
over
to
a
person
in
need
of
its
services
.
The
separation
can
be
painful
for
the
trainer
,
but
knowing
their
training
is
helping
a
blind
person
gain
independence
can
be
very
rewarding
.

Complete
a
college
degree
.
Many
places
that
hire
guide
dog
trainers
require
a
college
degree
of
some
sort
.
Consider
completing
a
degree
in
zoology
.
Although
it
is
not
dog
training
specifically
,
it
will
help
you
understand
the
anatomical
,
biological
and
physiological
side
of
animals
.
It
will
also
give
you
an
edge
over
the
competition
when
applying
for
a
dog
training
position
.

dog
trainer

people

dogs

you
are
training
dogs

opportunities

Volunteer
at
an
animal

Volunteering
at
an
animal
hospital
may
be
less
hands-on
than
at
a
shelter
,
because
animals
are
being
treated
for
injuries
and
illness
,
but
it
will
help
feed
your
passion
for
dogs
.
Research
what
hospitals
in
your
area
take
volunteers
.
Some
may
be
more
hands-on
than
others
and
require
you
to
complete
an
application
.
Expect
to
do
things
like
cleaning
out
kennels
and
checking
in
patients
.

Work
