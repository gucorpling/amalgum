said
today
&quot;
when
devolution
came
,
[
McLetchie
]
picked
up
the
reins
and
made
sure
that
the
Scottish
Conservatives
had
a
strong
voice
&quot;
.
Cameron
also
called
McLetchie
&quot;
one
of
Scottish
politics
'
most
formidable
intellects
and
finest
debaters
.
All
he
did
was
carried
out
with
dedication
and
conviction
,
and
his
passing
leaves
a
gap
in
the
lives
of
all
who
knew
him
.
&quot;
The
Prime
Minister
said
he
is
&quot;
deeply
saddened
&quot;
by
the
news
.
</p>
<p>
McLetchie
lead
the
party

said
&quot;
First
and
foremost
my
deepest
condolences
go
to
his
wife
Sheila
and
their
family
.
David
had
so
much
left
to
give
and
it
is
difficult
to
describe
just
what
his
loss
at
such
a
relatively
young
age
means
to
all
who
knew
him
.
&quot;
She
said
he
&quot;
had
friends
in
every
political
party
and
he
was
often
the
fulcrum
of
some
of
the
most
unusual
alliances
in
order
to
improve
,
force
or
block
a
piece
of
legislation
.

,
drive
and

noting

.
She
called
his
death
&quot;
a
huge
loss
to
the
Scottish
Parliament

spoke
of
a
&quot;
towering
figure
in
this
new
Scottish
parliamentary
age
...
who
made
a
difference
&quot;
and
&quot;
commanded
immediate
respect
and
trust
from

and
foe
alike
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Scottish
First
Minister
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Alex_Salmond">
Alex
Salmond
</ref>
called
the
late
politician
&quot;
an
extremely
effective
leader
of
the
Conservative
group
in
the
first
Parliament
,
allowing
it
to
punch
politically
well
above
its
actual
numbers
&quot;
.
</p>
<p>
McLetchie
played
golf
and
followed
football
and
rugby
,
supporting

.
He
has
a
son
from
a
previous
marriage
,
two
stepchildren
,
and
four
grandchildren
.
He
put
his
switch
from
law
to
politics
down
to
&quot;
a
combination
of
a
mid-life
career
change
and
a
mid-life
crisis
...
I
wanted
the
challenge
of
representing
the
Conservative
Party
in
a
parliament
which
was
an
ambition
I
had
harboured
since
my
teens
,
but
which
I
had
not
been
able
to
put
into
effect
in
the
preceding
20
years
because
of
career
and
family
commitments
.
