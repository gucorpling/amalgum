.
Hamza
Hateer
and
Mussa
Ismael
al
Fartusi
had
their
case
kicked
out
prior
to
trial
owing
to
a
lack
of
evidence
;
they
were
alleged
to
be
involved
in
a
June
2003
mob
attack
on

At
today
's
hearing
,
which
had
been
postponed
by
a
month
to
allow
witnesses
to
travel
,
a
panel
of
three
judges
spent
three
and
a
half
hours
to
question
those
who
were
there
.
Sources
disagree
on
the
number
of
witnesses
—
between
nine
and
eleven
—
none
of
whom
said
they
had
seen
the
accused
participate
in
any
violence
.
Most
of
those
questioned
were
Iraqi
police

The
killings
in
Majar
al-Kabir
followed
a
dispute
at
the
local
market
in
which
British
soldiers
had
argued
with
Iraqis
over
the
use
of
dogs
to
search
,
which
the
locals
were
upset
about
,
according
to
policeman
Ahmed
Hassan
Sayed
.
He
said
gunfire
followed
and
the
soldiers
killed
around
ten
people
.
&quot;
I
was
inside
the
[
police
]
station
with
the
British
soldiers
.
They
had
been
coming
twice
a
week
for
training
...
I
heard
sounds
of
shooting
that
got
closer
and
closer
.
We
saw
a
lot
of
people
approaching
the
building
.
I
told
all
my
employees
to
leave
.
I
also
told
the
British
to
leave
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Sayed
went
on
to
say
in
his
testimony
that
the
British
soldiers
had
refused
to
leave
as
they
felt
they
were
in
the
clear
since
they
were
present
for
training
only
.
The
police
left
the
station
via
a
back
window
;
the
British
remained
in
the
courtyard
while
around
400
people
attacked
.
&quot;
What
I
understand
is
that
this
was
an
act
of
tribal
vengeance
.
They
wanted
justice
for
the
killing
of
their
relatives
,
&quot;
explained
Sayed
.
&quot;
We
fled
through
the
back
window
and
the
British
stayed
behind
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Although
no
witnesses
saw
either
defendant
engaged
in
violence
,
one
stated
that
Hateer
took
a
dead
man
's
weapon
;
he
will
be
tried
for
its
theft
.
The
pair
were
among
eight
whose
arrests
were
anounced
in
February
;
six
were
released
without
charge
.
</p>
<p>
Judge
Balee
Hamdi
told
<hi rend="italic">
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/The_Guardian">
The
Guardian
</ref>
</hi>
that
in
releasing
the
men
&quot;
I
built
my
decisions
on
the
evidence
that
was
before
me
.
The
evidence
was
not
sufficient
to
convict
them
.
&quot;
He
also
said
that
should
rebels
be
convicted
before
him
&quot;
[
i]f
they
are
here
for
resistance
against
occupiers
,
I
will
try
to
lessen
the
sentence
.

she

the

,
they

,
&quot;
we
have
no
choice

to
respect
the
decision

They
will
have
weighed
up
the
credibility

However
