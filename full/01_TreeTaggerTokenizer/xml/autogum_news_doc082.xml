and
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Uganda">

caused

of
deaths
.
The
parasites
are
spread
by
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tsetse%20flies">
tsetse
flies
</ref>
.
It
is
considered
one
of
the
worst
epidemics
in
the
last
five
decades
.
As
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization">
WHO
</ref>
reported
,
subsequent
recent
introduction
of
population
screening
in
rural
areas
and
distribution
of
more
effective
drugs
had
potentially
reduced
the
number
of
death
incidents
.
However
,
the
main
effect
of
these
measures
being
a
decrease
in
spreading
of
the
parasite
and
not
in
decrease
of
the
death
rate
,
the
researchers
decided
to
tackle
the
puzzle
.
</p>
<p>
The
scientists
studied
the
molecules
the
human
immune
system
activates
in
response
to
the
attack
.
They
were
looking
for
the
way
the
parasites
inhibit
it
and
lead
to
the
death
of
the
victim
.
Of
the
several
known
parasite
species
,
the
two
that
can
infect
humans
were
chosen
to
study
,
called
<hi rend="italic">
Trypanosoma
brucei
gambiense
</hi>
and
<hi rend="italic">
Trypanosoma
brucei
rhodensiense
</hi>
.
Several
others
also
exist
,
but
they
affect
only
animals
.
</p>
<p>
Researchers
knew
that
the
Trypanosoma
attacks
typically
are
repelled
by
an
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-density%20lipoprotein">
HDL
</ref>
,
more
specifically
<hi rend="italic">
trypanosome
lytic
factor-1
</hi>
(
TLF-1
)
.
It
is
generated
in
the
humans
'
immune
system
and
is
toxic
to
the
parasites
but
not
to
humans
.
It
was
known
that
one
of
the
parasites
,
<hi rend="italic">
T.
b.
rhodensiense
</hi>
,
has
evolved
an
inhibitor
of
the
toxic
chemical
,
called
Serum
Resistance
Associated
(
SRA
)
protein
.
However
the
other
one
,
<hi rend="italic">
T.
b.
gambiense
</hi>
,
was
responsible
for
over
95
%
of
human
deaths
,
and
it
had
been
previously
unknown
why
.
</p>
<p>
The
study
showed
that
a
gene
mutation
has
lead
to
a
change
in
the
parasite
's
surface
protein
receptor
.
It
does
n't
bind
to
TLF-1
as
well
as
for
other
species
,
leading
to
a
substantial
decrease
in
TLF-1
uptake
by
the
parasite
.
The
receptor
is
more
strict
,
causing
a
lower
nutrient
intake
as
well
,
but
it
suffices
,
and
the
parasite
defends
against
the
human
immune
system
.

As
professor
and
head
of
the
department
of
biochemistry
and
molecular
biology
at
UGA
(
and
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
research
)
Stephen
Hajduk
explained
,
&quot;
Humans
have
evolved
TLF-1
as
a
highly
specific
toxin
against
African
trypanosomes
by
tricking
the
parasite
into
taking
up
this
HDL
because
it
resembles
a
nutrient
the
parasite
needs
for
survival
.
But
T.
b.
gambiense
has
evolved
a
counter
measure
to
these
human
'
Trojan
horses
'
simply
by
barring
the
door
and
not
allowing
TLF-1
to
enter
the
cell
,
effectively
blocking
human
innate
immunity
and
leading
to
infection
and
ultimately
disease
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Based
on
the
results
of
the
research
,
humans
could
possibly
develop
a
defense
mechanism
to
keep
the
parasites
from
evading
the
human
defense
system
.
Stephen
Hajduk
commented
,
&quot;
We
believe
this
research
represents
a
paradigm
shift
and
causes
us
to
think
more
broadly
about
how
pathogens
avoid
host
defense
mechanisms
.
It
turns
out
that
African
trypanosomes
have
evolved
a
diversity
of
ways
to
avoid
human
innate
and
acquired
immune
systems
.
