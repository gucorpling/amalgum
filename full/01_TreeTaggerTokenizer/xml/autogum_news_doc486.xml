Their
study
claimed
KRACK
affects
every
modern
device
using
Wi-Fi
;
it
can
be
fixed
by
a
software
update
,
researchers
said

&quot;
Attackers
can
use
this
novel
attack
technique
to
read
information
that
was
previously
assumed
to
be
safely
encrypted
.
This
can
be
abused
to
steal
sensitive
information
such
as
credit
card
numbers
,
passwords
,
chat
messages
,
emails
,
photos
and
so
on
.
&quot;
Vanhoef
notified
vendors
about
the
flaw
in
July
,
including
UNIX-like
operating
system
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenBSD">
OpenBSD
</ref>
.
&quot;
If
your
device
supports
Wi-Fi
,
it
is
most
likely
affected
.

In
general
,
any
data
or
information
that
the
victim
transmits
can
be
decrypted

<p>
The
study
papers
,
which
were
submitted
for
review
on
May
19
,
were
kept
in
confidence
allowing
companies
to
fix
the
security
flaw
.

informed
vendors
on

.
The
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi%20Alliance">

said
it
&quot;
could
be
resolved
through
a
straightforward
software
update
.
&quot;
OpenBSD
released
their
software
patch
on
August
30

Exploring
the
flaw
which
affected
every
device
the
researchers
had
tested
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National%20Cyber%20Security%20Centre">

of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/UK">
UK
</ref>
said
&quot;
the
attacker
would
have
to
be
physically
close
to
the
target
&quot;
.
But
due
to
this
flaw
,
an
attacker
can
send
malware
or
ransomware
on
the
websites
,
Vanhoef
claimed

Android

v6.0
and
higher
are
especially
affected
by
this
flaw
,
while
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft%20Windows">
Windows
</ref>
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iOS">
iOS
</ref>
are
not
as
vulnerable
as
Android
by
this
flaw
as
they
do
not
fully
implement
WPA2
.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft
reportedly
has
released
security
patches
for
Windows
7
,
8
,
8.1
and
10
.
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Google">
Google

said
Android
operating
systems
would
receive
the
updates
in
the
software
update
scheduled
to
be
made
available
on
November
6
.
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Apple">
Apple
</ref>
has
implemented
the
patch
in
the
beta
versions
of
their
operating
system
iOS
,
macOS
,
tvOS
and
watchOS
,
however
it
is
yet
to
roll
out
patches
for
stable
operating
systems
.
</p>
<p>
WPA2
protocol
has
been
used
for
more
than
a
decade
,
and
has
been
compulsory
for
Wi-Fi
since
2006
.
KRACK
would
also
affect
various
home
appliances
which
can
be
controlled
over
Wi-Fi
,
within
the
so-called

said
,
&quot;
We
can
be
sure
a
lot
of
these
devices
wo
n’t
be
patched[

Whether
that
matters
for
this
attack
or
only
for
some
future
attack
is
yet
to
be
seen
.

study
and
its
