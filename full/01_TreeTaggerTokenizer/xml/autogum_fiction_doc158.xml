PLAERDEMAVIDA
</head>
<p>
By
the
great
mercy
of
God
,
Plaerdemavida
was
saved
from
the
shipwreck
and
taken
to
the
city
of
Tunis
,
to
the
house
of
a
fisherman
's
daughter
,
as
was
related
previously
.
Then
,
after
two
years
had
passed
the
fisherman
's
daughter
took
a
husband
near
that
city
.
And
while
they
held
Plaerdemavida
captive
there
,
she
always
lived
very
honestly
,
working
gold
and
silk
as
the
maidens
of
Greece
are
accustomed
to
doing
.
It
happened
one
day
that
her
mistress
went
to
the
city
of
Montagata
,
and
left
Plaerdemavida
to
watch
the
house
.
She
had
gone
to
the
city
to
make
some
purchases
,
and
while
she
was
there
she
went
to
talk
to
the
king
's
daughter
,
and
she
told
her
:
</p>
<p>
&quot;
My
lady
,
I
've
been
told
that
you
are
planning
to
marry
,
and
that
you
are
supplying
yourself
with
blouses
embroidered
with
gold
and
silk
and
other
things
proper
for
maidens
.
I
have
a
young
slave
who
is
able
to
do
what
I
have
taught
her
from
the
time
she
was
an
infant
:
to
embroider
all
manner
of
things
as
befits
young
women
.
Here
are
some
samples
of
what
she
can
do
.
If
you
want
her
,
I
will
give
her
to
you
for
one
hundred
doubloons
,
even
though
I
will
be
losing
all
the
training
I
have
given
her
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
princess
,
seeing
the
samples
,
wanted
her
very
much
,
and
she
said
that
she
would
be
happy
to
give
her
the
one
hundred
doubloons
.
The
Moor
said
:
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
'll
be
glad
to
give
her
to
you
for
that
price
,
on
one
condition
:
you
must
tell
her
that
I
have
loaned
her
to
you
for
two
months
,
because
if
she
guessed
that
I
had
sold
her
,
she
would
be
so
sad
that
she
would
fall
into
despair
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Plaerdemavida
was
placed
in
her
hands
and
she
came
to
love
the
princess
very
much
.
It
happened
a
short
time
later
that
the
city
was
attacked
,
and
the
Moors
took
many
Christians
prisoner
.
Among
the
men
they
captured
was
a
soldier
who
had
been
an
oarsman
on
Tirant
's
galley
when
it
was
lost
.
Plaerdemavida
recognized
him
,
and
she
said
:
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Are
n't
you
one
of
the
Christians
who
were
on
Tirant
's
galley
when
it
went
down
at
sea
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
My
lady
,
&quot;
said
the
man
&quot;
it
's
true
:
I
was
there
,
and
I
nearly
drowned
.
I
reached
the
shore
half
dead
,
and
afterward
I
was
beaten
,
and
bought
and
sold
.
I
went
through
great
trials
in
those
days
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
What
can
you
tell
me
about
Tirant
?
&quot;
said
Plaerdemavida
.
&quot;
Where
did
he
die
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
By
the
Virgin
Mary
!
&quot;
said
the
prisoner
.
&quot;
He
is
very
much
alive
.
He
's
right
here
.
He
's
the
commander
,
and
he
's
using
all
his
might
to
conquer
this
land
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
He
also
told
her
that
Lord
Agramunt
was
wounded
,
and
then
she
asked
him
:
</p>
<p>
&quot;
What
became
of
Plaerdemavida
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
That
maiden
you
're
asking
about
,
&quot;
said
the
prisoner
,
&quot;
it
's
believed
that
she
died
in
the
sea
,
and
our
captain
has
grieved
deeply
over
her
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
When
she
heard
the
news
she
ordered
all
the
prisoners
to
flee
.
Hearing
that
Tirant
was
alive
and
so
near
,
she
also
wanted
very
much
to
escape
,
but
considering
how
Tirant
had
conquered
so
much
of
the
Barbary
Coast
,
and
thinking
of
the
victories
that
were
told
about
the
Christian
captain
,
she
was
very
happy
.
For
she
had
known
nothing
about
him
and
believed
that
he
had
drowned
in
the
sea
.
She
fell
to
her
knees
,
raised
her
clasped
hands
to
heaven
and
gave
thanks
and
praise
to
God
Our
Lord
for
the
great
success
He
had
given
to
Tirant
and
to
the
new
Christianity
,
for
he
was
making
war
on
the
enemies
of
Jesus
Christ
so
bravely
.
She
became
very
hopeful
that
soon
she
would
be
out
of
captivity
,
and
all
the
suffering
she
had
gone
through
up
to
then
seemed
to
be
nothing
to
her
:
the
thought
that
she
would
see
Tirant
consoled
her
that
much
.
</p>
<p>
On
the
day
her
mistress
had
to
go
and
talk
to
the
captains
,
she
disguised
herself
so
well
that
no
one
would
recognize
her
.
When
the
lady
was
before
the
captain
,
she
was
accompanied
by
fifty
maidens
,
but
Tirant
would
not
listen
to
her
and
he
sent
her
to
his
cousin
,
Lord
Agramunt
.
And
if
he
had
replied
badly
to
the
ambassadors
,
he
gave
an
even
worse
reply
to
the
lady
.
Hopeless
,
they
went
back
,
crying
and
lamenting
loudly
.
All
that
night
,
men
as
well
as
women
did
not
cease
their
wailing
and
sighing
.
</p>
<p>
In
the
morning
Plaerdemavida
told
her
mistress
and
the
honorable
men
of
the
city
that
if
they
would
give
her
liberty
to
go
out
,
she
would
talk
to
the
captain
,
and
would
tell
him
such
things
that
he
would
do
anything
she
wished
.
They
agreed
that
she
should
go
,
because
they
had
lost
all
hope
and
had
only
that
one
day
left
.
That
day
Plaerdemavida
dressed
as
a
Moor
,
and
painted
her
eyes
so
that
she
would
not
be
recognized
.
She
took
thirty
well
dressed
maidens
with
her
.
At
noon
they
left
the
city
and
went
to
the
camp
,
and
there
they
saw
Tirant
at
the
door
of
his
tent
.
When
he
saw
them
coming
he
sent
word
that
they
should
go
to
Lord
Agramunt
,
and
that
he
could
do
nothing
since
he
had
turned
all
his
power
over
to
him
.
Plaerdemavida
answered
:
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Tell
the
captain
that
he
should
not
refuse
to
see
us
,
and
even
less
to
speak
to
us
,
because
if
that
captain
did
such
a
thing
he
would
be
cruel
and
unjust
.
Since
he
is
a
knight
and
we
are
maidens
,
in
accordance
with
the
order
of
chivalry
he
must
aid
us
,
and
give
us
his
advice
and
his
support
.
