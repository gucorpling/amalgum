Am
I
working
out
too
much
?
</head>
<sp who="#apocalypse_meeooow">
<p>
So
I
recently
quit
drinking
(
16
days
ago
)
and
while
an
active
alcoholic
I
was
consuming
about
2500-3000
calories
a
day
in
malt
liquor
.
In
the
last
2
years
of
alcoholism
I
gained
65lb
.
Since
I
quit
have
gotten
a
FitBit
and
joined
a
gym
.
I
go
every
day
,
sometimes
twice
a
day
.
Just
something
to
note
really
quick
is
that
I
have
led
a
completely
sedentary
lifestyle
for
over
a
year
now
,
and
even
before
that
,
any
exercise
was
really
just
an
incidental
result
of
me
doing
things
that
I
enjoyed
(
fishing
and
hiking
)
.
I
recently
got
a
job
(
first
in
6
months
)
in
a
call
center
that
starts
on
the
6th
,
so
1
.
I
will
be
sitting
most
of
my
day
there
,
and
with
that
knowledge
2
.
I
have
been
trying
to
get
in
as
much
physical
activity
as
I
think
I
am
capable
of
.
Currently
my
average
step
count
a
day
is
~14k
,
but
yesterday
I
did
22k
and
worked
arms
and
thighs/butt
.
I
'm
sore
today
in
my
arms
and
chest
but
it
really
is
n't
too
bad
.
My
plan
once
I
start
working
is
to
still
hopefully
get
in
10k
steps
a
day
by
going
to
the
gym
,
but
I
've
never
had
a
FT
job
that
involved
sitting
most
of
the
time
and
I
've
also
never
had
any
job
during
a
time
that
I
had
a
daily
work
out
goal
.
This
is
all
new
territory
for
me
.
I
guess
my
question
(
or
concern
rather
)
is
this
-
I
have
done
some
form
of
cardio
every
day
without
fail
(
small
note
:
I
've
also
been
loosely
watching
what
I
eat
,
nothing
too
fatty
,
smaller
portions
,
more
veggies/fruit
but
no
changes
that
are
too
extreme
)
,
which
is
great
,
but
I
have
literally
never
done
this
before
.
I
've
never
tried
to
get
fit
before
,
not
<hi rend="bold">
really
.
</hi>
Sure
there
were
sporadic
gym
memberships
that
ended
up
just
being
free
money
for
the
gym
cause
after
2
weeks
I
stopped
going
,
&quot;
nightly
walks
&quot;
that
turned
into
&quot;
nightly
ice
cream
&quot;
in
just
a
few
days
,
etc.
I
've
never
had
the
motivation
that
I
have
now
(
which
I
completely
credit
to
my
new
sobriety
and
realization
that
I
need
to
love
me
and
in
order
to
do
that
I
need
to
love
and
care
for
the
body
I
'm
in
...
finally
)
.
But
what
if
I
burn
myself
out
?
I
've
walked
and
hiked
and
worked
arms
and
legs
a
lot
in
the
last
2
weeks
and
I
generally
feel
the
better
for
it
.
Even
when
I
'm
sore
,
I
'm
happy
that
I
'm
sore
.
But
could
I
be
damaging
my
body
in
any
way
or
pushing
it
too
hard
?
Should
I
cut
back
my
active
days
to
5
days
a
week
?
Should
I
alternate
days
?
I
'm
so
,
so
sorry
for
this
long
rambling
...
thing
.
I
'm
just
new
to
this
(
if
you
did
n't
catch
that
the
first
5
times
I
mentioned
it
)
and
while
I
've
been
subbed
here
for
a
long
time
I
never
actually
tried
.
I
read
articles
and
tips
that
contradict
each
other
and
I
do
nt
really
know
which
path
to
take
.
I
do
n't
know
how
to
add
the
info
to
my
username
yet
but
I
'm
28/F
,
current
weight
188
,
beginning
weight
goal
of
165
and
ultimate
weight
goal
of
125
.
I
have
not
watched
my
weight
too
closely
in
the
last
two
weeks
but
I
have
lost
<hi rend="bold">
maybe
</hi>
2lb
,
which
is
kind
of
disappointing
because
I
figured
I
'd
drop
some
water
weight
too
.
I
actually
think
I
need
to
be
drinking
more
water
.
Any
tips
are
appreciated
and
I
thank
you
VERY
much
for
reading
all
of
that
if
you
did
.

I
might
be
overdoing
it
with
exercise
after
an
unemployed
and
alcoholic
sedentary
lifestyle
for
2
years
,
and
I
want
to
know
if
I
am
doing
too
much
despite
my
body
not
feeling
any
true
negative
affects
(
I
do
n't
have
any
extreme
pain
,
some
soreness
but
nothing
debilitating
)
.
Also
any
other
tips
to
help
me
along
my
weight
loss
journey
...
I
fucking
hate
my
body
right
now
.
Two
summers
ago
I
was
a
size
4
.
Any
advice
appreciated
:
)
Edit
:
also
forgot
to
mention
that
I
am
not
married
and
do
not
have
kids
,
so
my
time
is
my
time
and
I
have
the
freedom
to
exercise
and
do
whatever
when
I
am
not
working
</p>

Best
to
warm
up
with
stretching
and
cool
down
with
stretching
(
before
and
after
)
this
majorly
helps
prevent
injury
.
</p>
<p>
Normally
I
YouTube
stretching
videos
just
find
one
according
to
what
your
doing
(
example
warm
up
stretch
for
running
)
that
kind
of
stuff
.
Usually
good
to
warm
up
for
at
least
10
minutes
.
</p>
<p>
There
â€™s
some
great
yoga
videos
as
well
.
