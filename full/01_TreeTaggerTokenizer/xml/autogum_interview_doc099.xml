There
are
reports
that
Russia
could
be
ejected
from
the
G8
group
of
developed
economies
.
Would
this
be
a
major
blow
for
Putin
's
domestic
popularity
?

In
present
circumstances
not
.
There
is
a
substantial
constituency
in
Russia
that
is
nostalgic
about
its
imperial
status
,
especially
after
the
humiliation
inflicted
on
the
state
during
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Boris_Yeltsin">
Yeltsin
</ref>
period
,
and
these
conflicts
are
presented
in
this
context
.
Certainly
recognition
of
Russia
at
the
G8
was
a
prestige
factor
,
but
there
are
clearly
compensations
on
an
ideological
level
in
the
present
situation
.
This
is
an
illustration
of
Russia
's
ascendency
vis-a-vis
the
US
and
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/EU">
EU
</ref>
[
European
Union
]
in
one
sense
.
What
it
all
means
in
the
longer
term
depends
on
a
significant
amount
of
variables
,
however

Is
the
Russian
general
public
in
full
support
of
the
deployment
of
their
own
troops
into
Ukraine
,
a

nation
?

No
,
this
is
a
distraction
by
Putin
from
increasing
economic
and
political
problems
in
Russia
.
A
minority
of
Russians
support
deployment
and
I
think
support
from
ordinary
Russians
will
fall
when
they
realise
deployment
may
result
in
the

There
is
no
such
thing
as
a
united
Russian
public
.
There
are
many
views
in
Russia
,
as
elsewhere
.
Clearly
,
some
people
in
Russia
oppose
this
assault
on
Ukraine
,
as
we
have
seen
from
the
arrests
and
beating
of
demonstrators
in
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Moscow">
Moscow
</ref>
.
There
is
a
section
of
the
academic
&quot;
community
&quot;
—
also
a
deceptive
word
—
that
is
opposed
to
the
invasion
.

If
you
are
interested
in
this
,
read
the
discussion
on
Ab
Imperio
's
Facebook
site
,
where
many
young
academics
are
expressing
their
views
.
</p>
<p>
I
would
like
to
repeat
one
point
:
the
notion
of
a
simple
nationalized
divide
between
East
and
West
Ukraine
is
both
false
and
counter-productive
.
There
are
nationalists
in
many
areas
of
the
country
,
but
there
are
also
people
with
other
political
commitments
.
It
is
dangerous
for
the
Western
media
to
reinforce
the
notion
that
nationalist
sentiment
(
pro-Russian
or
pro-Ukrainian
)
is
the
only
political
force
in
Ukraine
.
A
whole
generation
has
grown
up
since
Ukraine
's
independence
and
many
people
,
old
and
young
and
in
the
middle
,
have
ideas
about
sovereignty
and
politics
that
are
not
simply
&quot;
ethnic
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
<list type="unordered">
<item>
<hi rend="bold">
Brandist
</hi>
:
Russia
does
not
have
a
unified
or
stable
'
public
opinion
'
any
more
than
anywhere
else
.
Moreover
,
the
Crimea
and
east
of
Ukraine
are
not
necessarily
viewed
as
fully
a
separate
nation
among
many
Russians
.
Many
Russians
have
relatives
there
and
go
there
for
vacations
.
At
present
the
majority
are
in
support
for
the
reasons
I
've
just
outlined
.
However
,
we
have
seen
significant
opposition
movements
in
recent
years
,
which
shows
that
if
things
turn
out
badly
then
Putin
may
be
vulnerable
.
There
is
clearly
an
assessment
of
risks
that
has
been
carried
out
by
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow%20Kremlin">
Kremlin
</ref>
,
and
so
far
it
has
paid
off
.
Indeed
,
it
probably
strengthens
Putin
's
compromised
standing
at
home
,
but
if
things
do
go
wrong
then
this
could
change
quickly
.
