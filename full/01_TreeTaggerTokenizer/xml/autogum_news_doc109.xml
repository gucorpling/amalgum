â€”
Madagascan
President
Marc
Ravalomanana
</p>
<p>
Mr
Ravalomanana
attempted
to
hand
power
over
to
the
heads
of
the
military
,
given
the
tasks
of
discussing
and
drafting
constitutional
changes
,
rather
than
transfer
power
to
Mr
Rajoelina
.
After
the
resignation
was
announced
to
the
opposition
,
four
Army
generals
and
a
head
of
the
church
were
detained
for
reasons
unknown
.
The
true
extent
of
the
Army
's
loyalty
to
Mr
Rajoelina
is
unclear
,
as
reportedly
the
military
refused
to
arrest
President
Ravalomanana
despite
orders
from
Mr
Rajoelina
.
</p>
<p>
Mr
Rajoelina
installed
himself
in
the
Presidential
Palace
in
upper
Antananarivo
,
which
troops
had
seized
yesterday
.
A
cabinet
loyal
to
him
has
been
in
operation
since
the
end
of
January
,
when
Mr
Rajoelina
proclaimed
Mr
Ravalomanana
's
rule
to
be
illegitimate
.
The
Madagascan
opposition
accuses
Mr
Ravalomanana
of
mismanaging
the
country
while
restricting
personal
freedoms
.
</p>
<p>
President
Ravalomanana
was
reportedly
first
announced
via
an
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS%20messaging">
text
message
</ref>
from
one
of
his
aides
before
being
confirmed
by
Ravalomanana
's
office
in
a
radio
broadcast
,
in
which
the
President
proclaimed
,
&quot;
After
deep
reflection
,
I
have
decided
to
dissolve
the
government
and
give
up
power
so
that
a
military
directorate
can
be
established
&quot;
.
Madagascan
Army
Chief
of
Staff
Colonel
Andre
Ndriarijaona
has
declared
his
support
for
Rajoelina
and
says
that
&quot;
99
%
of
the
forces
are
behind
&quot;
the
opposition
leader

The

,
meanwhile
,
reiterated
its
position
that
a
military
takeover
in
Madagascar
would
be
considered
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coup%20d'etat">
coup
d'etat
</ref>
,
which
could
result
in
&quot;
firm
measures
&quot;
such
as
Madagascar
's
suspension
from
the
organization
or
a
blocking
of
international
aid
,
and
urged
the
military
to
obey
the
country
's
constitution
,
which
bars
Mr
Rajoelina
from
the
presidency
due
to
his
age
,
and
not
hand
power
over
to
the
former
mayor
,
instead
suggesting
that
power
could
be
given
to
Madagascan
Prime
Minister
General
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles%20Rabemananjara">

.
Members
of
the
Madagascan
opposition
say
they
plan
to
re-write
the
constitution
and
electoral
code
before
holding
new
elections
within
two
years
.
</p>
<p>
While
reports
are
that
the
country
has
been
overall
stable
during
the
coup
,
the
unrest
of
the
past
two
months
has
deprived
the
country
of
tourist
revenue
.
