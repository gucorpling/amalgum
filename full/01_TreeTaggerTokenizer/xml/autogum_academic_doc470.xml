Challenges
in
MSC
Translation
into
Clinical
Practice
:
The
Bone
Disease
Framework
</head>
<p>
Other
interesting
aspects
and
new
perspectives
in
the
field
of
tissue
regeneration
and
applicative
use
of
MSC
are
strictly
related
to
their
potential
to
tackle
the
increase
in
bone
diseases
related
with
the
extended
life
expectancy
.
Indeed
,
in
many
countries
bone
diseases
are
becoming
a
relevant
cause
of
disability
,
even
if
they
are
acute
,
such
as
fractures
,
or
chronic
,
such
as
osteoporosis
and
tumours
.
In
any
case
these
pathologies
require
treatments
to
enhance
the
healing
and
regenerative
capacity
of
bone
tissue
.
The
common
therapeutic
strategies
based
on
bone
grafting
(
autografts
or
allografts
)
show
some
disadvantages
.
Autografts
are
limited
by
the
bone
volume
that
can
be
harvested
from
the
iliac
crest
and
present
surgical
risks
such
as
bleeding
,
inflammation
,
infection
,
chronic
pain
,
damage
at
the
donor
site
and
morbidity
.
Allografts
also
have
some
limitations
,
such
as
the
lack
of
donors
,
high
costs
,
the
need
for
sterilization
and
the
risk
of
infectious
agent
transmission
or
immune
mediated
tissue
rejection
.
</p>
<p>
These
limitations
and
disadvantages
associated
with
auto-
and
allograft
approaches
indicate
a
clinical
need
for
alternative
therapeutic
strategies
aimed
at
bone
healing
and
regeneration
.
Thus
,
new
biomaterials
and
scaffolds
,
in
association
with
MSC
and
growth
factors
,
having
requirements
of
biocompatibility
,
osteoinductive
and
osteoconductive
properties
,
are
investigated
to
improve
bone
repair
.
The
use
of
MSC
is
attractive
since
they
can
be
harvested
from
the
host
with
minimal
morbidity
,
they
can
be
modified
to
secrete
osteoinductive
factors
and
implanted
on
an
osteoconductive
scaffold
,
to
obtain
the
three
key
components
leading
to
osteogenesis
.
</p>
<p>
hMSC
have
been
found
in
several
adult
tissues
,
including
the
synovial
membrane
,
the
adipose
tissue
,
the
dental
pulp
tissue
,
or
in
perinatal
tissues
(
umbilical
cord
blood
and
umbilical
cord
tissue
)
.
All
these
cells
are
suited
to
therapeutic
applications
for
bone
regeneration
,
by
means
of
two
different
ways
of
autologous
cells
transplantation
:
(
1
)
cell
therapies
without
expansion
in
culture
(
one-step
procedure
)
and
(
2
)
cell
therapies
with
ex
vivo
expansion
.
In
the
first
case
,
cells
are
harvested
during
surgery
.
In
2010
,
Jagër
et
al.
,
successfully
treated
more
than
100
patients
with
local
bone
healing
disorders
using
a
biomaterial
composite
in
association
with
BM
aspiration
concentrate
.
They
observed
that
the
use
of
BM
concentrate
reduced
the
harvest
of
autogenous
bone
by
50
%
without
negative
effects
on
bone
healing
.
The
second
clinical
application
of
MSC
includes
the
autologous
cell
transplantation
after
ex-vivo
expansion
.
In
2007
,
Nöth
et
al.
,
used
a
cell
population
from
BM
aspirate
cultured
over
12
days
under
GMP
conditions
and
transplanted
them
autologously
with
a
tricalcium
phosphate
biomaterial
for
the
treatment
of
femoral
head
necrosis
.
The
main
limitations
for
clinical
application
are
the
sterility
technique
,
long
culture
time
,
high
cost
,
and
the
mixture
of
human
cell
culture
medium
with
fetal
bovine
serum
.
Thus
,
recently
,
orthopedic
researchers
focused
their
attention
on
the
clinical
use
of
BM
aspirate
(
BMA
)
and
BM
concentrate
(
BMC
)
for
musculoskeletal
regeneration
with
a
“
one-step
”
procedure
,
avoiding
the
need
of
additional
laboratory
stages
and
GMP
facility
,
thus
reducing
costs
and
risks
.

It
has
been
identified
as
an
excellent
source

it

We
focused
our
attention
on
the
use
of
BM-derived
MSC
in
spinal
fusion
surgical
procedures
,
which
is
the
most
definitive
treatment
performed
to
restore
the
structural
stability
of
the
spinal
column
in
degenerative
and
oncological
spine
diseases
.
Currently
,
the
gold
standard
stimulus
to
achieve
spinal
fusion
is
autologous
bone
(
autograft
)
,
which
is
commonly
harvested
from
the
iliac
crest
or
obtained
from
the
surgical
site
(
local
bone
)
.
As
autologous
bone
possesses
osteogenic
,
osteoinductive
and
osteoconductive
abilities
;
the
success
rate
of
spinal
fusion
with
autograft
is
high
(
up
to
95
%
)
.
However
,
autograft
material
is
limited
in
quantity
and
its
quality
varies
depending
on
the
patient
.
Moreover
,
significant
morbidity
is
associated
with
bone
harvesting
,
as
previously
described
.
Between
many
alternatives
proposed
to
achieve
spinal
fusion
,
MSC
are
interesting
because
they
can
provide
osteogenic
properties
allowing
bone
regeneration
.
</p>
<p>
We
recently
published
a
descriptive
systematic
literature
review
in
order
to
understand
if
the
use
of
MSC
may
represent
a
valid
strategy
to
facilitate
and
accelerate
bone
regeneration
and
fusion
during
spine
surgery
.
In
this
review
we
selected
and
analyzed
50
relevant
papers
,
stratified
according
to
preclinical
studies
and
clinical
trials
.
Preclinical
published
data
showed
that
MSC
have
the
potential
to
achieve
,
facilitate
and
accelerate
spinal
fusion
.
However
,
preclinical
studies
on
animal
models
indicated
that
some
barriers
remain
prior
to
this
therapy
translation
into
the
clinical
application
.
</p>
<p>
So
far
,
few
published
clinical
studies
employ
stem
cells
for
spinal
fusion
.
Most
of
them
used
concentrated
autologous
BM
as
primary
source
of
stem
cells
and
they
showed
fusion
results
ranging
from
87
%
to
92.3
%
in
a
total
of
297
patients
.
