The
Feast
of
Lady
Banefort
's
Grand
Tourney
</head>
<sp who="#FluffyShrimp">
<p>
On
the
eve
following
the
great
tournament
the
Banefort
was
filled
with
music
and
cheers
,
light
beaming
out
of
every
window
and
the
scent
of
a
feast
lingering
in
the
evening
air
.
But
the
castle
itself
looked
odd
,
for
in
the
courtyard
before
the
great
hall
a
great
tent
had
been
raised
,
standing
far
taller
than
the
ancient
walls
.
The
tent
reached
out
towards
the
gatehouse
but
did
not
quite
reach
it
.
Within
the
ground
had
been
flattened
,
and
two
great
tables
had
been
placed
.
Inside
the
great
hall
itself
another
three
tables
had
been
brought
forth
,
bringing
the
total
to
five
.
There
was
one
table
that
stood
slightly
higher
where
the
Lady
Banefort
sat
,
though
her
family
was
dispersed
among
the
other
tables
,
so
that
each
had
a
host
.
Once
most
of
the
noble
knights
and
ladies
had
returned
from
the
tourney
grounds
a
steady
stream
of
servants
begun
to
appear
from
within
the
bowels
of
the
castle
,
each
carrying
platter
after
platter
of
food
.
The
main
course
was
an
ox
,
fried
over
and
open
fire
and
dripping
with
sizzling
butter
.
To
it
came
a
myriad
of
lesser
meats
,
fish
and
bird
,
each
accompanied
by
fruits
and
berries
and
other
vegetables
.
There
were
pan-fried
walnuts
and
lemon
herring
,
pies
of
spinach
,
ham
and
cheese
and
venison-stew
with
mushrooms
.
And
there
were
cakes
of
raspberry
and
strawberries
,
the
last
of
the
summer
's
harvest
.
Pudding
of
half
a
dozen
kinds
had
been
prepared
,
along
with
whole
crabs
and
a
marlin
fried
with
potatoes
and
summer
spices
.
As
the
night
went
on
there
were
many
more
dishes
,
so
many
that
people
would
speak
of
this
feast
for
years
to
come
.
Bar
a
few
guests
being
invited
to
the
high
table
the
guests
were
allowed
to
sit
where
they
pleased
,
and
the
feast
was
begun
the
moment
the
food
arrived
at
the
tavles
.

The
Presters
seated
themselves
at
a
table
close
by
to
their
neighbours
to
whom
they
owed
homage
,
the
Kennings
.

The
Lord
of
Feastfires
enjoyed
the
feast
,
though
he
clearly
was
tired
after
the
day
's
events
.
He
was
silent
for
most
of
the
night
.

Sits
next
to
her
brother
,
Thaddeus
.
She
periodically
scans
the
area
,
keeping
her
eyes
on
the
rest

her
kin
as
they
venture
around
the
feast
.

Slightly
soured
by
his
loss
in
the
lists
,
Joffrey
spends
most
of
the
time
eating
and
drinking
in
silence
.
It
does
n't
take
long
for
him
to
leave
the
table
.

Patrek
(

-
Unlike
his
elder
brother
,
Patrek
's
loss
had
done
nothing
to
dampen
his
spirit
.
He
alternates
between
which
family
member
he
speaks
to
,
seeming
to
revel
in
the
company
of
his
family
once
again
.

hanging
on
his
every
word
