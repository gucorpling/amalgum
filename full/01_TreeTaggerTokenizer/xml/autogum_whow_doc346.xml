React
when
a
Doctor
Says
Nothing
More
Can
Be
Done
(
Surgery
)
</head>
<p>
If
a
doctor
tells
you
nothing
more
can
be
done
with
respect
to
a
surgery
,
just
thank
him
or
her
and
go
home
and
relax
a
minute
.
Then
,
proceed
to
locate
the
nearest
teaching
hospital
in
your
state
with
specialty
department
that
meets
your
needs
.
Remember
that
even
&quot;
C
&quot;
grade
students
become
doctors
.
Try
to
find
the
geniuses
who
are
available
at
teaching
hospitals
with
technology
and
staff
not
available
in
your
hometown
.

Be
aware
that
a
doctor
who
says
that
nothing
more
can
be
done
just
does
n't
have
the
knowledge
or
experience
to
know
what
else
can
be
done
.
However
,
there
is
always
something
else
that
can
be
done
if
you
ask
a
surgeon
at
a
teaching
hospital
,
even
if
they
do
n't
know
yet
what
it
is
.
The
doctors
in
these
hospitals
are
the
best
of
the
best
.
They
will
research
and
consult
and
research
some
more
until
they
come
up
with
the
plan
for
care
.
They
will
be
confident
in
their
skills
and
your
outcome
from
surgery
and
they
may
have
better
technology
and
staff
available
than
a
hometown
hospital
.

These
hospitals
take
Medicare
and
Medicaid
happily
so
that
's
not
an
issue
either
.

You
may
be
able
to
have
bad
outcomes
from
previous
surgeries
fixed

Expect
to
have
a
nurse
assigned
to
you
who
will
handle
all
the
details
of
beforehand
testing
and
preparing
you
for
your
surgery
and
recovery
,
so
do
n't
worry
about
the
details
.
Just
keep
notes
and
follow
directions
.

Ask
as
many
questions
as
you
have
until
you
feel
comfortable
.
That
's
what
makes
for
better
outcomes
too
,
when
you
know
what
to
expect
.

Be
sure
you
have
completed
all
pre-surgery
testing
necessary
at
least
ten
days
ahead
of
out-of-town
surgery
to
eliminate
any
need
to
postpone
a
surgery
.
And
only
have
complex
and
invasive
tests
done
at
the
recommended
facility
because
some
tests
are
n't
familiar
to
your
local
providers
and
they
may
not
even
know
what
you
are
talking
about
in
some
instances
.
It
may
be
inconvenient
but
just
do
it
for
the
best
results
.

Do
n't
cut
corners
when
it
comes
to
your
recovery
.
If
the
doctors
suggest
an
acute
rehab
hospital
after
you
leave
their
hospital
,
go
there
.
An
acute
rehab
hospital
will
teach
you
how
to
move
without
injuring
yourself
and
improve
your
recovery
too
.
Prepare
yourself
mentally
for
surgery
,
surrounding
yourself
with
good
energy
and
positive
thoughts
.

Do
n't
leave
any
issues
up
in
the
air
before
surgery
.
Nail
down
who
will
care
for
your
pets
and
have
a
back
up
just
in
case
.
Once
all
of
the
details
are
confirmed
,
you
'll
be
able
to
relax
during
your
hospital
stay
.
Keep
lists
to
help
keep
track
of
the
details
and
do
n't
stress
yourself
out
.
Once
an
issue
is
resolved
,
do
n't
worry
about
it
anymore
.
Move
on
to
the
next
thing
.
And
be
happy
–
–
tell
your
loved
ones
what
they
mean
to
you
because
they
could
be
gone
tomorrow
and
no
one
wants
a
regret
either
.
