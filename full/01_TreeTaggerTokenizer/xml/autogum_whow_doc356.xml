Perform
an
Orbital
Transfer
</head>
<p>
An
orbital
transfer
is
a
maneuver
used
to
change
the
height
of
your
orbit
around
a
planet
,
moon
or
other
body
.
Although
you
'll
probably
never
need
to
use
this
knowledge
in
real
life
,
it
comes
in
very
handy
if
you
're
using
a
simulator
like
the
Kerbal
Space
Program
.

Raising
Your
Orbit
with
a
Hohmann
Transfer
</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Decide
if
you
should
use
a
Hohmann
transfer
.
In
general
,
you
should
use
a
Hohmann
transfer
if
:
desired
radius/current
radius
&lt;
11.95
.

When
you
reach
your
periapsis
(
the
lowest
point
of
your
orbit
)
,
burn
prograde
(
in
the
direction
of
travel
)
.
This
has
the
effect
of
raising
your
apoapsis
(
the
highest
point
of
your
orbit
)
.
Burn
until
your
apoapsis
reaches
the
height
of
your
desired
orbit
.
You
can
calculate
the
delta-v
for
this
burn
using
the
formula
in
the
picture
.

When
you
reach
apoapsis
,
burn
prograde
until
your
periapsis
reaches
the
desired
height
.
This
should
cause
your
orbit
to
circularise
.
Again
,
you
can
use
the
equation
to
calculate
the
delta-v
for
this
burn
.

When

Use
a
low
thrust

this

much
delta-v

When

reach
periapsis

burn
retrograde
(
opposite
the
direction

motion

your
apoapsis

the

Warnings

<list type="unordered">
<item>
When
performing
a
bi-elliptical
transfer
,
make
sure
that
your
apoapsis
does
n't
leave
the
planet
's
sphere
of
influence
!
If
it
does
,
you
'll
escape
the
planet
's
gravity
and
go
flying
off
into
space
.
