CHAPTER
29
</head>
<p>
Catherine
was
too
wretched
to
be
fearful
.
The
journey
in
itself
had
no
terrors
for
her
;
and
she
began
it
without
either
dreading
its
length
or
feeling
its
solitariness
.
Leaning
back
in
one
corner
of
the
carriage
,
in
a
violent
burst
of
tears
,
she
was
conveyed
some
miles
beyond
the
walls
of
the
abbey
before
she
raised
her
head
;
and
the
highest
point
of
ground
within
the
park
was
almost
closed
from
her
view
before
she
was
capable
of
turning
her
eyes
towards
it
.
Unfortunately
,
the
road
she
now
travelled
was
the
same
which
only
ten
days
ago
she
had
so
happily
passed
along
in
going
to
and
from
Woodston
;
and
,
for
fourteen
miles
,
every
bitter
feeling
was
rendered
more
severe
by
the
review
of
objects
on
which
she
had
first
looked
under
impressions
so
different
.
Every
mile
,
as
it
brought
her
nearer
Woodston
,
added
to
her
sufferings
,
and
when
within
the
distance
of
five
,
she
passed
the
turning
which
led
to
it
,
and
thought
of
Henry
,
so
near
,
yet
so
unconscious
,
her
grief
and
agitation
were
excessive
.
</p>
<p>
The
day
which
she
had
spent
at
that
place
had
been
one
of
the
happiest
of
her
life
.
It
was
there
,
it
was
on
that
day
,
that
the
general
had
made
use
of
such
expressions
with
regard
to
Henry
and
herself
,
had
so
spoken
and
so
looked
as
to
give
her
the
most
positive
conviction
of
his
actually
wishing
their
marriage
.
Yes
,
only
ten
days
ago
had
he
elated
her
by
his
pointed
regard
--
had
he
even
confused
her
by
his
too
significant
reference
!
And
now
--
what
had
she
done
,
or
what
had
she
omitted
to
do
,
to
merit
such
a
change
?
</p>
<p>
The
only
offence
against
him
of
which
she
could
accuse
herself
had
been
such
as
was
scarcely
possible
to
reach
his
knowledge
.
Henry
and
her
own
heart
only
were
privy
to
the
shocking
suspicions
which
she
had
so
idly
entertained
;
and
equally
safe
did
she
believe
her
secret
with
each
.
Designedly
,
at
least
,
Henry
could
not
have
betrayed
her
.
If
,
indeed
,
by
any
strange
mischance
his
father
should
have
gained
intelligence
of
what
she
had
dared
to
think
and
look
for
,
of
her
causeless
fancies
and
injurious
examinations
,
she
could
not
wonder
at
any
degree
of
his
indignation
.
If
aware
of
her
having
viewed
him
as
a
murderer
,
she
could
not
wonder
at
his
even
turning
her
from
his
house
.
But
a
justification
so
full
of
torture
to
herself
,
she
trusted
,
would
not
be
in
his
power
.
</p>
<p>
Anxious
as
were
all
her
conjectures
on
this
point
,
it
was
not
,
however
,
the
one
on
which
she
dwelt
most
.
There
was
a
thought
yet
nearer
,
a
more
prevailing
,
more
impetuous
concern
.
How
Henry
would
think
,
and
feel
,
and
look
,
when
he
returned
on
the
morrow
to
Northanger
and
heard
of
her
being
gone
,
was
a
question
of
force
and
interest
to
rise
over
every
other
,
to
be
never
ceasing
,
alternately
irritating
and
soothing
;
it
sometimes
suggested
the
dread
of
his
calm
acquiescence
,
and
at
others
was
answered
by
the
sweetest
confidence
in
his
regret
and
resentment
.
To
the
general
,
of
course
,
he
would
not
dare
to
speak
;
but
to
Eleanor
--
what
might
he
not
say
to
Eleanor
about
her
?
</p>
<p>
In
this
unceasing
recurrence
of
doubts
and
inquiries
,
on
any
one
article
of
which
her
mind
was
incapable
of
more
than
momentary
repose
,
the
hours
passed
away
,
and
her
journey
advanced
much
faster
than
she
looked
for
.
The
pressing
anxieties
of
thought
,
which
prevented
her
from
noticing
anything
before
her
,
when
once
beyond
the
neighbourhood
of
Woodston
,
saved
her
at
the
same
time
from
watching
her
progress
;
and
though
no
object
on
the
road
could
engage
a
moment
's
attention
,
she
found
no
stage
of
it
tedious
.
From
this
,
she
was
preserved
too
by
another
cause
,
by
feeling
no
eagerness
for
her
journey
's
conclusion
;
for
to
return
in
such
a
manner
to
Fullerton
was
almost
to
destroy
the
pleasure
of
a
meeting
with
those
she
loved
best
,
even
after
an
absence
such
as
hers
--
an
eleven
weeks
'
absence
.
What
had
she
to
say
that
would
not
humble
herself
and
pain
her
family
,
that
would
not
increase
her
own
grief
by
the
confession
of
it
,
extend
an
useless
resentment
,
and
perhaps
involve
the
innocent
with
the
guilty
in
undistinguishing
ill
will
?
She
could
never
do
justice
to
Henry
and
Eleanor
's
merit
;
she
felt
it
too
strongly
for
expression
;
and
should
a
dislike
be
taken
against
them
,
should
they
be
thought
of
unfavourably
,
on
their
father
's
account
,
it
would
cut
her
to
the
heart
.
</p>
<p>
With
these
feelings
,
she
rather
dreaded
than
sought
for
the
first
view
of
that
well-known
spire
which
would
announce
her
within
twenty
miles
of
home
.
Salisbury
she
had
known
to
be
her
point
on
leaving
Northanger
;
but
after
the
first
stage
she
had
been
indebted
to
the
post-masters
for
the
names
of
the
places
which
were
then
to
conduct
her
to
it
;
so
great
had
been
her
ignorance
of
her
route
.
She
met
with
nothing
,
however
,
to
distress
or
frighten
her
.
Her
youth
,
civil
manners
,
and
liberal
pay
procured
her
all
the
attention
that
a
traveller
like
herself
could
require
;
and
stopping
only
to
change
horses
,
she
travelled
on
for
about
eleven
hours
without
accident
or
alarm
,
and
between
six
and
seven
o'clock
in
the
evening
found
herself
entering
Fullerton
.
