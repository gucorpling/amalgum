Cross

</head>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">
Cross
country
skiing
</hi>
is
an
efficient
way
of
travelling
long
distances
across
snow
.
The
skis
are
narrower
than
downhill
and
slalom
skis
,
and
the
poles
are
longer
to
increase
propulsion
.
Cross
country
is
possible
in
groomed
trails
or
in
untouched
snow
,
the
latter
often
referred
to
as
ski
touring
or
back
country
skiing
.
Skis
to
go
outside
of
the
tracks
tend
to
be
a
bit
wider
than
the
skis
you
use
in
tracks
,
to
help
you
to
float
better
in
the
snow
outside
of
the
tracks
.
Boots
for
back
country
skiing
are
usually
made
of
leather
and
boots
for
groomed
trails
are
usually
made
of
synthetic
flexible
fabric
.
</p>
<p>
Cross
country
skiing
is
a
good
exercise
for
the
whole
body
and
as
intense
cardio
training
is
an
alternative
to
jogging
.
Cross
country
can
also
be
variation
at
a
ski
resort
or
as
a
means
to
get
to
the
true
wilderness
in
wintertime
.
</p>
<head>
Understand
</head>
<p>
Cross
country
skiing
is
the
original
form
of
skiing
and
was
developed
as
a
common
mode
of
transport
in
Northern
Europe
.
For
many
people
in
the
<ref target="Nordic%20Countries">
Nordic
Countries
</ref>
,
&quot;
skiing
&quot;
still
means
cross
country
skiing
and
is
widely
practiced
for
exercise
or
recreation
.
The
word
&quot;
ski
&quot;
originates
from
Old
Norwegian
and
is
still
used
in
the
wide
original
meaning
-
a
piece
of
wood
.
Unlike
in
English
it
is
not
a
verb
in
Norwegian
,
only
a
noun
.
Instead
,
in
Norwegian
and
Swedish
expressions
like
&quot;
ski
hiking
&quot;
or
&quot;
ski
racing
&quot;
are
used
.
</p>
<p>
There
are
two
different
techniques
for
competitive
skiing
cross
country
:
&quot;
classic
&quot;
and
&quot;
freestyle
&quot;
,
where
the
former
means
mostly
gliding
forward
with
the
skis
in
the
tracks
,
while
the
latter
resembles
skating
.
In
deep
fresh
snow
classic
is
the
only
feasible
way
,
likewise
if
there
is
no
space
besides
the
tracks
on
a
prepared
route
.
Routes
with
groomed
tracks
often
offer
space
for
both
.
If
the
temperature
has
varied
around
the
freezing
point
(
0°C
,
32°F
)
there
may
be
hard
snow
on
or
near
the
surface
,
allowing
the
skating
technique
in
fields
.
Frozen
lakes
and
rivers
with
thin
snow
cover
also
invite
to
this
.
Competitive
skiers
use
special
equipment
for
freestyle
or
&quot;
skate
skiing
&quot;
.
Recreational
and
back
country
skiing
use
both
techniques
depending
on
the
terrain
and
snow
quality
.
Freestyle
or
skating
is
easier
with
light
skis
.
Skating
creates
superior
speed
on
hard
,
even
surfaces
.
</p>
<p>
In
deep
loose
snow
speeds
are
low
,
comparable
to
slow
walking
,
but
in
open
terrain
usually
faster
than
with
snowshoes
and
another
world
compared
to
walking
in
that
snow
without
equipment
,
if
the
skis
are
adequate
.
In
more
compact
snow
,
or
snow
with
a
frozen
layer
close
to
the
surface
,
skiing
is
usually
somewhat
faster
than
when
walking
on
bare
ground
.
With
tracks
or
ideal
conditions
speeds
are
comparable
to
running
,
sometimes
considerably
faster
;
winner
times
on
50
km
classic
in
the
<ref target="https://english.finlandiahiihto.fi">
Finlandia
race
</ref>
are
2
–
2.5
hours
.
</p>
<p>
Classical
skiing
is
based
on
the
principle
of
traction
or
friction
to
allow
the
backward
kick
.
In
groomed
tracks
,
traction
is
usually
achieved
with
grip
wax
(
a
sticky
substance
applied
to
the
mid
part
of
the
ski
)
,
while
in
the
back
country
traction
is
also
achieved
with
a
waxless
ski
sole
or
with
a
removable
&quot;
skin
&quot;
.
The
mid
part
of
the
ski
should
touch
the
track
firmly
when
kicking
,
but
rise
when
gliding
,
which
means
the
skis
have
to
be
chosen
to
fit
your
weight
.
Some
skis
are
more
forgiving
,
which
is
an
advantage
when
having
a
backpack
that
might
be
more
or
less
heavy
.
There
are
also
differences
in
how
carefully
the
ski
has
to
be
prepared
(
waxed
)
for
the
specific
kind
of
snow
facing
you
on
a
route
.
</p>
<p>
There
is
a
trade-off
for
length
and
width
of
the
skis
:
long
and
wide
skis
are
good
in
thick
loose
snow
in
open
terrain
,
but
long
skis
are
cumbersome
in
woods
,
bushes
and
steep
hills
and
extremely
wide
skis
may
not
fit
in
prepared
tracks
(
also
some
bindings
may
be
problematic
)
.
</p>
<p>
When
getting
the
equipment
,
be
prepared
to
choose
between
several
options
depending
on
what
you
are
going
to
do
and
what
you
are
prepared
to
pay
(
at
least
in
specialist
shops
,
others
may
offer
only
one
kind
)
.
The
skis
,
bindings
,
boots
and
poles
may
be
optimized
for
either
classic
or
skate
skiing
,
for
tracks
or
for
true
cross-country
with
deep
loose
snow
,
for
mostly
flat
terrain
or
offering
a
possibility
also
to
downhill
skiing
with
the
telemark
technique
.
Skis
,
bindings
and
boots
should
match
and
are
often
sold
as
a
package
;
consider
whether
you
want
to
be
able
to
replace
some
without
replacing
all
of
them
.
</p>
<p>
Skiing
downhill
,
in
tracks
and
in
untouched
snow
are
very
different
experiences
.
Do
not
expect
the
thrills
of
one
when
performing
another
.
And
while
some
techniques
are
easy
to
adopt
to
another
environment
,
there
is
much
to
be
learnt
for
somebody
lacking
experience
in
the
current
one
.
</p>
<head>
Ski
types
by
purpose
</head>
<p>
There
are
rough
categories
of
skis
for
different
purposes
.
The
division
here
may
not
be
universal
and
there
may
be
compromises
,
but
you
should
probably
decide
which
types
make
sense
for
you
.
The
skis
for
different
purposes
and
techniques
differ
in
length
,
width
,
stiffness
and
possibly
other
aspects
.
If
there
is
a
chance
you
will
ski
in
tracks
,
in
loose
snow
(
other
than
downhill
)
or
in
mountains
,
try
to
find
a
ski
that
is
adequate
in
all
your
uses
.
In
wilderness
backpacking
,
the
important
thing
is
not
to
get
the
best
possible
performance
,
but
not
to
have
a
situation
where
the
ski
makes
you
miserable
–
avoid
the
extremes
.
</p>
<p>
Also
bindings
and
poles
differ
by
intended
use
and
skiing
boots
are
usually
made
to
fit
one
specific
model
of
binding
(
there
are
often
two
big
brands
with
different
bindings
for
any
type
of
ski
,
and
possibly
many
obsolete
designs
)
.
Bindings
differ
,
in
addition
to
usability
for
a
specific
type
of
skiing
,
by
how
easily
frozen
snow
can
stuck
the
fastening
mechanism
,
to
what
extent
they
can
be
repaired
in
the
field
etc.
There
may
be
variations
in
this
respect
between
bindings
that
fit
the
same
boot
.
</p>
<p>
A
traditional
all-round
ski
is
about
as
long
as
the
user
with
a
raised
arm
.
This
length
allows
turning
on
the
spot
(
after
some
training
)
.
Much
longer
skis
are
clumsy
in
dense
wood
and
going
downhill
.
Somewhat
shorter
skis
are
easier
to
handle
for
the
beginner
,
in
dense
wood
and
in
steep
terrain
.
The
corresponding
poles
reach
from
the
ground
to
the
armpit
.
</p>
<p>
The
width
of
old
wooden
skis
was
about
5
–
10
cm
(
2
–
4
&quot;
)
.
Machine
made
tracks
allow
up
to
,
which
is
worth
taking
into
consideration
.
Wider
skis
can
be
made
shorter
and
still
carry
the
user
in
loose
snow
(
and
allow
more
curvature
for
going
downhill
)
.
</p>
<p>
The
stiffness
is
usually
chosen
so
that
the
ski
touches
the
ground
under
the
foot
when
the
user
's
weight
is
put
on
it
,
but
not
when
the
weight
is
evenly
on
both
skis
.
This
allows
effective
skiing
in
tracks
as
the
rougher
middle
part
touches
the
track
only
when
kicking
,
but
using
a
gliding-one-way-only
structure
a
less
stiff
ski
can
do
its
job
.
