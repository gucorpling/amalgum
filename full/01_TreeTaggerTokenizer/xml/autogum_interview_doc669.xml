Now
the
journalists
and
the
people
in
power
,
the
government
and
financial
world
,
they
're
all
of
the
same
class
,
which
is
privileged
class
.
Journalists
are
people
who
are
distant
from
those
who
are
&quot;
The
Deciders
&quot;
,
to
use
Bush
's
phrase
.
I
think
there
is
an
all-inclusiveness
,
and
I
think
the
Washington
Press
Corp
is
representative
of
what
I
am
saying
.
They
co-mingle
;
they
live
in
the
same
neighborhoods
and
they
go
to
the
same
places
.
The
Washington
Press
Corp.
is
the
worst
.

Did
you
see
Stephen
Colbert
roast
the
Washington
Press
Corp
and
Bush
at
the
White
House
Press
Correspondence
dinner
?
Nobody
laughed
,
because
they
were
all
coming
from
the
same
place
.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">

And
it
got
a
bad
review
,
and
then
a
revised
review
!
The
first
account
I
read
--
I
did
n't
see
it
or
watch
it
--
was
that
it
was
boring
.
Then
it
took
on
a
life
of
its
own
!
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
Because
nobody
reported
about
it
,
or
they
just
said
he
bombed
.
Then
it
went
out
on
the
internet
and
took
on
a
life
of
its
own
and
people
said
,
&quot;
This
is
n't
bombing
,
this
a
roasting
of
the
entire
power
structure
and
the
power
structure
decided
they
did
n't
like
it
.

</hi>
I
feel
the
Washington
Press
Corp.
should
be
broken
up
.
Just
have
them
distributed
around
the
country
.
Put
them
in
state
capitals
and
just
feed
the
state
capitals
with
more
reporters
and
have
them
feed
the
big
papers
.
Cover
the
country
not
from
Washington
.
It
's
so
federalized
.
More
state
's
rights
kind
of
reporting
;
represent
power
across
the
country
not
just
overloaded
in
one
place
.

A

</hi>
That
's
right

It
would
be
harder
,
because
they

n't
be

They
'll
have
to
do
more

[
<hi rend="italic">

That
's
right
!
They
would
n't
really
like
that
.
And
they
would
probably
be
able
to
report
the
war
better
as
it
is
reflected
in
towns
with
a
lot
of
soldiers
,
and
returning
injured
and
dead
in
those
towns
.
They
would
really
get
a
feel
for
the
country
,
and
not
just
those
<hi rend="italic">
non-participants
</hi>
in
Washington
who
are
mouthing
this-and-that
and
getting
defense
appropriations

<hi rend="bold">
DS

The
way
it
is
now
,
they
do
n't
get
an
interview
with
so-and-so
if
they
write
something
,
or
they
do
n't
get
to
go
to
someone

party

Yeah
,
well

cut
half
the
leaking

Just
leave
the

cover

Do
you
think
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob%20Woodward">
Bob
Woodward

is
still
an
intrepid
Washington
reporter

He
's
often
been
accused
of
being
too
close
to
the
people
he
covers
