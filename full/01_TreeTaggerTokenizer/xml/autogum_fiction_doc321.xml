THE
LOVE
OF
ULRICH
NEBENDAHL
</head>
<p>
Perhaps
of
all
,
it
troubled
most
the
Herr
Pfarrer
.
Was
he
not
the
father
of
the
village
?
And
as
such
did
it
not
fall
to
him
to
see
his
children
marry
well
and
suitably
?
marry
in
any
case
.
It
was
the
duty
of
every
worthy
citizen
to
keep
alive
throughout
the
ages
the
sacred
hearth
fire
,
to
rear
up
sturdy
lads
and
honest
lassies
that
would
serve
God
,
and
the
Fatherland
.
A
true
son
of
Saxon
soil
was
the
Herr
Pastor
Winckelmann
--
kindly
,
simple
,
sentimental
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Why
,
at
your
age
,
Ulrich
--
at
your
age
,
&quot;
repeated
the
Herr
Pastor
,
setting
down
his
beer
and
wiping
with
the
back
of
his
hand
his
large
uneven
lips
,
&quot;
I
was
the
father
of
a
family
--
two
boys
and
a
girl
.
You
never
saw
her
,
Ulrich
;
so
sweet
,
so
good
.
We
called
her
Maria
.
&quot;
The
Herr
Pfarrer
sighed
and
hid
his
broad
red
face
behind
the
raised
cover
of
his
pewter
pot
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
They
must
be
good
fun
in
a
house
,
the
little
ones
,
&quot;
commented
Ulrich
,
gazing
upward
with
his
dreamy
eyes
at
the
wreath
of
smoke
ascending
from
his
long-stemmed
pipe
.
&quot;
The
little
ones
,
always
my
heart
goes
out
to
them
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Take
to
yourself
a
wife
,
&quot;
urged
the
Herr
Pfarrer
.
&quot;
It
is
your
duty
.
The
good
God
has
given
to
you
ample
means
.
It
is
not
right
that
you
should
lead
this
lonely
life
.
Bachelors
make
old
maids
;
things
of
no
use
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
That
is
so
,
&quot;
Ulrich
agreed
.
&quot;
I
have
often
said
the
same
unto
myself
.
It
would
be
pleasant
to
feel
one
was
not
working
merely
for
oneself
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Elsa
,
now
,
&quot;
went
on
the
Herr
Pfarrer
,
&quot;
she
is
a
good
child
,
pious
and
economical
.
The
price
of
such
is
above
rubies
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Ulrich
's
face
lightened
with
a
pleasant
smile
.
&quot;
Aye
,
Elsa
is
a
good
girl
,
&quot;
he
answered
.
&quot;
Her
little
hands
--
have
you
ever
noticed
them
,
Herr
Pastor
--
so
soft
and
dimpled
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
Pfarrer
pushed
aside
his
empty
pot
and
leaned
his
elbows
on
the
table
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
think
--
I
do
not
think
--
she
would
say
no
.
Her
mother
,
I
have
reason
to
believe
--
Let
me
sound
them
--
discreetly
.
&quot;
The
old
pastor
's
red
face
glowed
redder
,
yet
with
pleasurable
anticipation
;
he
was
a
born
matchmaker
.
</p>
<p>
But
Ulrich
the
wheelwright
shuffled
in
his
chair
uneasily
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
A
little
longer
,
&quot;
he
pleaded
.
&quot;
Let
me
think
it
over
.
A
man
should
not
marry
without
first
being
sure
he
loves
.
Things
might
happen
.
It
would
not
be
fair
to
the
maiden
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
Herr
Pfarrer
stretched
his
hand
across
the
table
and
laid
it
upon
Ulrich
's
arm
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
It
is
Hedwig
;
twice
you
walked
home
with
her
last
week
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
It
is
a
lonesome
way
for
a
timid
maiden
;
and
there
is
the
stream
to
cross
,
&quot;
explained
the
wheelwright
.
</p>
<p>
For
a
moment
the
Herr
Pastor
's
face
had
clouded
,
but
now
it
cleared
again
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Well
,
well
,
why
not
?
Elsa
would
have
been
better
in
some
respects
,
but
Hedwig
--
ah
,
yes
,
she
,
too
,
is
a
good
girl
a
little
wild
perhaps
--
it
will
wear
off
.
Have
you
spoken
with
her
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Not
yet
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
But
you
will
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Again
there
fell
that
troubled
look
into
those
dreamy
eyes
.
This
time
it
was
Ulrich
who
,
laying
aside
his
pipe
,
rested
his
great
arms
upon
the
wooden
table
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Now
,
how
does
a
man
know
when
he
is
in
love
?
&quot;
asked
Ulrich
of
the
Pastor
who
,
having
been
married
twice
,
should
surely
be
experienced
upon
the
point
.
&quot;
How
should
he
be
sure
that
it
is
this
woman
and
no
other
to
whom
his
heart
has
gone
out
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
A
commonplace-looking
man
was
the
Herr
Pastor
,
short
and
fat
and
bald
.
But
there
had
been
other
days
,
and
these
had
left
to
him
a
voice
that
still
was
young
;
and
the
evening
twilight
screening
the
seared
face
,
Ulrich
heard
but
the
pastor
's
voice
,
which
was
the
voice
of
a
boy
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
She
will
be
dearer
to
you
than
yourself
.
Thinking
of
her
,
all
else
will
be
as
nothing
.
For
her
you
would
lay
down
your
life
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
They
sat
in
silence
for
a
while
;
for
the
fat
little
Herr
Pfarrer
was
dreaming
of
the
past
;
and
long
,
lanky
Ulrich
Nebendahl
,
the
wheelwright
,
of
the
future
.
</p>
<p>
That
evening
,
as
chance
would
have
it
,
Ulrich
returning
to
his
homestead
--
a
rambling
mill
beside
the
river
,
where
he
dwelt
alone
with
ancient
Anna
--
met
Elsa
of
the
dimpled
hands
upon
the
bridge
that
spans
the
murmuring
Muhlde
,
and
talked
a
while
with
her
,
and
said
good-night
.
</p>
<p>
How
sweet
it
had
been
to
watch
her
ox-like
eyes
shyly
seeking
his
,
to
press
her
dimpled
hand
and
feel
his
own
great
strength
.
Surely
he
loved
her
better
than
he
did
himself
.
There
could
be
no
doubt
of
it
.
He
pictured
her
in
trouble
,
in
danger
from
the
savage
soldiery
that
came
and
went
like
evil
shadows
through
these
pleasant
Saxon
valleys
,
leaving
death
and
misery
behind
them
:
burnt
homesteads
;
wild-eyed
women
,
hiding
their
faces
from
the
light
.
Would
he
not
for
her
sake
give
his
life
?
</p>
<p>
So
it
was
made
clear
to
him
that
little
Elsa
was
his
love
.
</p>
<p>
Until
next
morning
,
when
,
raising
his
eyes
from
the
whirling
saw
,
there
stood
before
him
Margot
,
laughing
.
Margot
,
mischief-loving
,
wayward
,
that
would
ever
be
to
him
the
baby
he
had
played
with
,
nursed
,
and
comforted
.
Margot
weary
!
Had
he
not
a
thousand
times
carried
her
sleeping
in
his
arms
.
Margot
in
danger
!
At
the
mere
thought
his
face
flushed
an
angry
scarlet
.
