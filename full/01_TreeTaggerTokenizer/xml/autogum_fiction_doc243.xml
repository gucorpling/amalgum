CHAPTER
I
--
REVISITS
ISLAND
</head>
<p>
That
homely
proverb
,
used
on
so
many
occasions
in
England
,
viz.
&quot;
That
what
is
bred
in
the
bone
will
not
go
out
of
the
flesh
,
&quot;
was
never
more
verified
than
in
the
story
of
my
Life
.
Any
one
would
think
that
after
thirty-five
years
'
affliction
,
and
a
variety
of
unhappy
circumstances
,
which
few
men
,
if
any
,
ever
went
through
before
,
and
after
near
seven
years
of
peace
and
enjoyment
in
the
fulness
of
all
things
;
grown
old
,
and
when
,
if
ever
,
it
might
be
allowed
me
to
have
had
experience
of
every
state
of
middle
life
,
and
to
know
which
was
most
adapted
to
make
a
man
completely
happy
;
I
say
,
after
all
this
,
any
one
would
have
thought
that
the
native
propensity
to
rambling
which
I
gave
an
account
of
in
my
first
setting
out
in
the
world
to
have
been
so
predominant
in
my
thoughts
,
should
be
worn
out
,
and
I
might
,
at
sixty
one
years
of
age
,
have
been
a
little
inclined
to
stay
at
home
,
and
have
done
venturing
life
and
fortune
any
more
.
</p>
<p>
Nay
,
farther
,
the
common
motive
of
foreign
adventures
was
taken
away
in
me
,
for
I
had
no
fortune
to
make
;
I
had
nothing
to
seek
:
if
I
had
gained
ten
thousand
pounds
I
had
been
no
richer
;
for
I
had
already
sufficient
for
me
,
and
for
those
I
had
to
leave
it
to
;
and
what
I
had
was
visibly
increasing
;
for
,
having
no
great
family
,
I
could
not
spend
the
income
of
what
I
had
unless
I
would
set
up
for
an
expensive
way
of
living
,
such
as
a
great
family
,
servants
,
equipage
,
gaiety
,
and
the
like
,
which
were
things
I
had
no
notion
of
,
or
inclination
to
;
so
that
I
had
nothing
,
indeed
,
to
do
but
to
sit
still
,
and
fully
enjoy
what
I
had
got
,
and
see
it
increase
daily
upon
my
hands
.
Yet
all
these
things
had
no
effect
upon
me
,
or
at
least
not
enough
to
resist
the
strong
inclination
I
had
to
go
abroad
again
,
which
hung
about
me
like
a
chronic
distemper
.
In
particular
,
the
desire
of
seeing
my
new
plantation
in
the
island
,
and
the
colony
I
left
there
,
ran
in
my
head
continually
.
I
dreamed
of
it
all
night
,
and
my
imagination
ran
upon
it
all
day
:
it
was
uppermost
in
all
my
thoughts
,
and
my
fancy
worked
so
steadily
and
strongly
upon
it
that
I
talked
of
it
in
my
sleep
;
in
short
,
nothing
could
remove
it
out
of
my
mind
:
it
even
broke
so
violently
into
all
my
discourses
that
it
made
my
conversation
tiresome
,
for
I
could
talk
of
nothing
else
;
all
my
discourse
ran
into
it
,
even
to
impertinence
;
and
I
saw
it
myself
.
</p>
<p>
I
have
often
heard
persons
of
good
judgment
say
that
all
the
stir
that
people
make
in
the
world
about
ghosts
and
apparitions
is
owing
to
the
strength
of
imagination
,
and
the
powerful
operation
of
fancy
in
their
minds
;
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
spirit
appearing
,
or
a
ghost
walking
;
that
people
's
poring
affectionately
upon
the
past
conversation
of
their
deceased
friends
so
realises
it
to
them
that
they
are
capable
of
fancying
,
upon
some
extraordinary
circumstances
,
that
they
see
them
,
talk
to
them
,
and
are
answered
by
them
,
when
,
in
truth
,
there
is
nothing
but
shadow
and
vapour
in
the
thing
,
and
they
really
know
nothing
of
the
matter
.
</p>
<p>
For
my
part
,
I
know
not
to
this
hour
whether
there
are
any
such
things
as
real
apparitions
,
spectres
,
or
walking
of
people
after
they
are
dead
;
or
whether
there
is
anything
in
the
stories
they
tell
us
of
that
kind
more
than
the
product
of
vapours
,
sick
minds
,
and
wandering
fancies
:
but
this
I
know
,
that
my
imagination
worked
up
to
such
a
height
,
and
brought
me
into
such
excess
of
vapours
,
or
what
else
I
may
call
it
,
that
I
actually
supposed
myself
often
upon
the
spot
,
at
my
old
castle
,
behind
the
trees
;
saw
my
old
Spaniard
,
Friday
's
father
,
and
the
reprobate
sailors
I
left
upon
the
island
;
nay
,
I
fancied
I
talked
with
them
,
and
looked
at
them
steadily
,
though
I
was
broad
awake
,
as
at
persons
just
before
me
;
and
this
I
did
till
I
often
frightened
myself
with
the
images
my
fancy
represented
to
me
.
One
time
,
in
my
sleep
,
I
had
the
villainy
of
the
three
pirate
sailors
so
lively
related
to
me
by
the
first
Spaniard
,
and
Friday
's
father
,
that
it
was
surprising
:
they
told
me
how
they
barbarously
attempted
to
murder
all
the
Spaniards
,
and
that
they
set
fire
to
the
provisions
they
had
laid
up
,
on
purpose
to
distress
and
starve
them
;
things
that
I
had
never
heard
of
,
and
that
,
indeed
,
were
never
all
of
them
true
in
fact
:
but
it
was
so
warm
in
my
imagination
,
and
so
realised
to
me
,
that
,
to
the
hour
I
saw
them
,
I
could
not
be
persuaded
but
that
it
was
or
would
be
true
;
also
how
I
resented
it
,
when
the
Spaniard
complained
to
me
;
and
how
I
brought
them
to
justice
,
tried
them
,
and
ordered
them
all
three
to
be
hanged
.
What
there
was
really
in
this
shall
be
seen
in
its
place
;
for
however
I
came
to
form
such
things
in
my
dream
,
and
what
secret
converse
of
spirits
injected
it
,
yet
there
was
,
I
say
,
much
of
it
true
.
I
own
that
this
dream
had
nothing
in
it
literally
and
specifically
true
;
but
the
general
part
was
so
true
--
the
base
;
villainous
behaviour
of
these
three
hardened
rogues
was
such
,
and
had
been
so
much
worse
than
all
I
can
describe
,
that
the
dream
had
too
much
similitude
of
the
fact
;
and
as
I
would
afterwards
have
punished
them
severely
,
so
,
if
I
had
hanged
them
all
,
I
had
been
much
in
the
right
,
and
even
should
have
been
justified
both
by
the
laws
of
God
and
man
.
