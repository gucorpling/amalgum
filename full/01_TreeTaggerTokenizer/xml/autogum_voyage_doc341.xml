History
</head>
<p>
Dothan
began
as
&quot;
Poplar
Head
&quot;
,
a
stop
along
the
main
trail
that
ran
through
this
portion
of
the
state
during
the
early
19th
century
.
It
was
incorporated
in
1885
,
and
renamed
after
the
village
mentioned
in
Genesis
37:17
,
which
reads
&quot;
let
us
go
to
Dothan
&quot;
.
The
city
quickly
became
a
hub
for
local
agriculture
and
industry
,
especially
the
peanut
business
,
and
its
annual
<hi rend="bold">
National
Peanut
Festival
</hi>
(
since
1938
)
reflects
this
heritage
.
Dothan
has
long
proclaimed
itself
the
&quot;
Peanut
Capital
of
the
World
&quot;
,
as
approximately
one-quarter
of
the
peanuts
grown
in
the
U.S.
are
grown
within
