Introduction
</head>
<p>
Rubberized
bitumen
has
been
applied
widely
in
bitumen
pavements
because
of
its
remarkable
performance
,
eco-friendly
characteristics
,
and
energy-saving
features
,
etc.
.
Adding
crumb
rubber
(
CR
)
to
bitumen
can
effectively
reduce
high
temperature
permanent
deformation
,
low
temperature
thermal
cracking
,
load-associated
fatigue
cracking
,
and
chemical
aging
or
hardening
of
bitumen
pavements
.
Currently
,
two
technical
routes
have
been
adopted
as
the
primary
approaches
to
produce
rubberized
bitumen
which
are
wet
and
dry
processes
,
with
the
wet
process
being
used
most
widely
today
.
For
the
dry
process
,
CR
is
regarded
as
particles
distributed
directly
in
the
aggregate
of
bitumen
mixture
and
there
is
limited
interaction
between
CR
and
bitumen
,
whereas
,
during
the
wet
process
,
CR
is
mixed
with
bitumen
at
a
high
temperature
by
a
thermomechanical
process
and
a
complete
interaction
exists
between
CR
and
bitumen
.
It
can
significantly
improve
engineering
performance
as
compared
with
conventional
paving
grade
bitumen
,
however
,
the
high
temperature
storage
instability
and
high
viscosity
of
rubberized
bitumen
have
restricted
its
application
.
The
different
density
and
polarity
between
CR
particles
and
bitumen
leads
to
incompatibility
and
sedimentation
in
rubberized
bitumen
.
Furthermore
,
the
amount
of
aromatic
oil
absorption
and
CR
particle
swelling
increases
the
viscosity
of
rubberized
bitumen
.
In
order
to
solve
these
problems
,
researchers
have
proposed
different
methods
to
enhance
the
compatibility
and
interaction
between
CR
and
bitumen
.
Generally
,
these
methods
can
be
grouped
into
the
following
three
categories
:
reduce
the
viscosity
by
adding
warm
mix
additives
(
WMA
)
or
blend
oil
additives
,
pretreat
CR
particles
with
microwave
irradiation
or
chemical
reagents
,
and
improve
CR
compatibility
with
bitumen
by
adding
preswelling
agents
or
reactive
additives
.
</p>
<p>
Modifying
the
chemical
bonds
between
the
functional
groups
of
the
modifying
agents
and
bitumen
compounds
and
promoting
swelling
reactions
are
useful
ways
to
mitigate
phase
separation
between
CR
and
bitumen
.
Polyphosphoric
acid
,
crosslinking
agent
,
nanosilica
,
etc.
,
have
been
incorporated
in
rubberized
bitumen
to
improve
the
compatibility
of
CR
particles
with
bitumen
,
among
which
trans-polyoctenamer
(
TOR
)
has
shown
high
reactivity
.
TOR
is
a
type
of
polymer
that
consists
of
linear
and
cyclic
macromolecules
that
can
facilitate
the
interaction
between
CR
and
bitumen
via
crosslinking
reactions
with
double
bonds
and
the
sulfur
component
in
the
bitumen
and
surface
of
the
CR
particles
.
It
has
been
noted
that
the
addition
of
TOR
improved
the
elasticity
,
modulus
,
and
temperature
susceptibility
of
rubberized
bitumen
.
Liu
indicated
that
there
was
a
complex
chemical
reaction
between
TOR
and
rubberized
bitumen
that
changed
the
rheological
properties
of
rubberized
bitumen
and
contributed
to
the
bitumen
binder
â€™s
storage
stability
.
In
addition
,
TOR
added
to
rubberized
bitumen
mixture
can
improve
the
high
temperature
resistance
to
rutting
and
low
temperature
crack
resistance
of
bitumen
pavements
.
</p>
<p>
High
viscosity
caused
by
aromatic
oil
absorption
and
the
CR
particle
swelling
is
another
problem
that
needs
to
be
solved
.
Many
researchers
have
been
evaluating
the
performance
and
investigating
the
mechanism
of
warm
mix
rubberized
bitumen
,
which
can
decrease
viscosity
significantly
and
conserve
fossil
fuel
.
On
the
basis
of
the
chemical
composition
and
modification
mechanism
,
the
various
WMAs
can
be
grouped
into
three
categories
:
chemical
,
organic
,
and
foaming
additives
or
technologies
.
Researchers
have
analyzed
the
workability
,
mechanical
,
fatigue
,
and
rheological
property
characterization
of
bitumen
mixtures
modified
with
various
WMAs
,
and
found
that
the
viscosity
of
rubberized
bitumen
reduced
significantly
,
however
,
WMAs
had
adverse
effects
on
the
fatigue
property
and
rutting
resistance
,
with
the
exception
of
Sasobit
additive
.
Xiao
et
al.
indicated
that
the
binder
type
played
a
key
role
in
determining
the
rheological
properties
of
WMA
binders
by
using
Fourier
transform
infrared
(
FTIR
)
analysis
.
Furthermore
,
the
modification
mechanisms
of
WMAs
were
explored
by
researchers
using
a
set
of
advanced
testing
equipment
.
On
the
basis
of
a
series
of
chemical
analyses
,
Yu
et
al.
found
that
no
major
chemical
reactions
were
detected
after
the
addition
of
CR
and
WMA
,
but
a
better
dissolution
of
CR
was
achieved
in
rubberized
bitumen
with
Sasobit
.
However
,
some
studies
indicated
that
the
stiffness
of
rubberized
bitumen
increased
at
low
temperatures
when
the
WMA
was
added
,
which
led
to
cracking
of
the
bitumen
pavements
.
</p>
<p>
The
desulfurization
and
degradation
behavior
of
CR
particles
in
bitumen
has
an
important
influence
on
the
performance
of
rubberized
bitumen
.
Several
studies
have
indicated
that
short-term
microwave
irradiation
improved
the
devulcanization
of
CR
and
reduced
its
degradation
.
Yu
et
al.
found
that
microwave
irradiation
cleft
the
surface
vulcanization
network
of
CR
,
resulting
in
higher
surface
activity
,
and
improved
its
compatibility
with
bitumen
.
According
to
the
microstructures
of
CR
treated
by
microwave
irradiation
,
the
CR
surface
became
fluffy
,
which
resulted
in
good
affinity
,
permeability
,
and
reactivity
at
the
interface
with
oil
.
Liang
indicated
that
microwave
irradiation
activated
CR
and
increased
the
risk
of
fatigue
cracking
caused
by
the
hardening
effect
of
aging
but
endowed
the
aged
residue
with
stronger
resistance
to
thermal
cracking
.
These
results
are
attributed
to
the
effect
of
degradation
and
devulcanization
of
CR
,
however
,
CR
treated
by
microwave
irradiation
had
an
adverse
effect
on
the
stability
of
rubberized
bitumen
.
