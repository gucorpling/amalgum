HEARTS
AND
OTHER
HEARTS
</head>
<p>
Stephen
had
brought
a
change
of
clothes
,
as
he
had
a
habit
of
being
ducked
once
at
least
during
the
day
;
and
since
there
was
a
halt
in
the
proceedings
and
no
need
of
his
services
for
an
hour
or
two
,
he
found
Rose
and
walked
with
her
to
a
secluded
spot
where
they
could
watch
the
logs
and
not
be
seen
by
the
people
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
You
frightened
everybody
almost
to
death
,
jumping
into
the
river
,
&quot;
chided
Rose
.
</p>
<p>
Stephen
laughed
.
&quot;
They
thought
I
was
a
fool
to
save
a
fool
,
I
suppose
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Perhaps
not
as
bad
as
that
,
but
it
did
seem
reckless
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
know
;
and
the
boy
,
no
doubt
,
would
be
better
off
dead
;
but
so
should
I
be
,
if
I
could
have
let
him
die
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Rose
regarded
this
strange
point
of
view
for
a
moment
,
and
then
silently
acquiesced
in
it
.
She
was
constantly
doing
this
,
and
she
often
felt
that
her
mental
horizon
broadened
in
the
act
;
but
she
could
not
be
sure
that
Stephen
grew
any
dearer
to
her
because
of
his
moral
altitudes
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Besides
,
&quot;
Stephen
argued
,
&quot;
I
happened
to
be
nearest
to
the
river
,
and
it
was
my
job
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
How
do
you
always
happen
to
be
nearest
to
the
people
in
trouble
,
and
why
is
it
always
your
'
job
'
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
If
there
are
any
rewards
for
good
conduct
being
distributed
,
I
'm
right
in
line
with
my
hand
stretched
out
,
&quot;
Stephen
replied
,
with
meaning
in
his
voice
.
</p>
<p>
Rose
blushed
under
her
flowery
hat
as
he
led
the
way
to
a
bench
under
a
sycamore
tree
that
overhung
the
water
.
</p>
<p>
She
had
almost
convinced
herself
that
she
was
as
much
in
love
with
Stephen
Waterman
as
it
was
in
her
nature
to
be
with
anybody
.
He
was
handsome
in
his
big
way
,
kind
,
generous
,
temperate
,
well
educated
,
and
well-to-do
.
No
fault
could
be
found
with
his
family
,
for
his
mother
had
been
a
teacher
,
and
his
father
,
though
a
farmer
,
a
college
graduate
.
Stephen
himself
had
had
one
year
at
Bowdoin
,
but
had
been
recalled
,
as
the
head
of
the
house
,
when
his
father
died
.
That
was
a
severe
blow
;
but
his
mother
's
death
,
three
years
after
,
was
a
grief
never
to
be
quite
forgotten
.
Rose
,
too
,
was
the
child
of
a
gently
bred
mother
,
and
all
her
instincts
were
refined
.
Yes
;
Stephen
in
himself
satisfied
her
in
all
the
larger
wants
of
her
nature
,
but
she
had
an
unsatisfied
hunger
for
the
world
,
--
the
world
of
Portland
,
where
her
cousins
lived
;
or
,
better
still
,
the
world
of
Boston
,
of
which
she
heard
through
Mrs.
Wealthy
Brooks
,
whose
nephew
Claude
often
came
to
visit
her
in
Edgewood
.
Life
on
a
farm
a
mile
and
a
half
distant
from
post-office
and
stores
;
life
in
the
house
with
Rufus
,
who
was
rumored
to
be
somewhat
wild
and
unsteady
,
--
this
prospect
seemed
a
trifle
dull
and
uneventful
to
the
trivial
part
of
her
,
though
to
the
better
part
it
was
enough
.
The
better
part
of
her
loved
Stephen
Waterman
,
dimly
feeling
the
richness
of
his
nature
,
the
tenderness
of
his
affection
,
the
strength
of
his
character
.
Rose
was
not
destitute
either
of
imagination
or
sentiment
.
She
did
not
relish
this
constant
weighing
of
Stephen
in
the
balance
:
he
was
too
good
to
be
weighed
and
considered
.
She
longed
to
be
carried
out
of
herself
on
a
wave
of
rapturous
assent
,
but
something
seemed
to
hold
her
back
,
--
some
seed
of
discontent
with
the
man
's
environment
and
circumstances
,
some
germ
of
longing
for
a
gayer
,
brighter
,
more
varied
life
.
No
amount
of
self-searching
or
argument
could
change
the
situation
.
She
always
loved
Stephen
more
or
less
:
more
when
he
was
away
from
her
,
because
she
never
approved
his
collars
nor
the
set
of
his
shirt
bosom
;
and
as
he
naturally
wore
these
despised
articles
of
apparel
whenever
he
proposed
to
her
,
she
was
always
lukewarm
about
marrying
him
and
settling
down
on
the
River
Farm
.
Still
,
to-day
she
discovered
in
herself
,
with
positive
gratitude
,
a
warmer
feeling
for
him
than
she
had
experienced
before
.
He
wore
a
new
and
becoming
gray
flannel
shirt
,
with
the
soft
turnover
collar
that
belonged
to
it
,
and
a
blue
tie
,
the
color
of
his
kind
eyes
.
She
knew
that
he
had
shaved
his
beard
at
her
request
not
long
ago
,
and
that
when
she
did
not
like
the
effect
as
much
as
she
had
hoped
,
he
had
meekly
grown
a
mustache
for
her
sake
;
it
did
seem
as
if
a
man
could
hardly
do
more
to
please
an
exacting
lady-love
.
</p>
<p>
And
she
had
admired
him
unreservedly
when
he
pulled
off
his
boots
and
jumped
into
the
river
to
save
Alcestis
Crambry
's
life
,
without
giving
a
single
thought
to
his
own
.
</p>
<p>
And
was
there
ever
,
after
all
,
such
a
noble
,
devoted
,
unselfish
fellow
,
or
a
better
brother
?
And
would
she
not
despise
herself
for
rejecting
him
simply
because
he
was
countrified
,
and
because
she
longed
to
see
the
world
of
the
fashion-plates
in
the
magazines
?
</p>
<p>
&quot;
The
logs
are
so
like
people
!
&quot;
she
exclaimed
,
as
they
sat
down
.
&quot;
I
could
name
nearly
every
one
of
them
for
somebody
in
the
village
.
Look
at
Mite
Shapley
,
that
dancing
little
one
,
slipping
over
the
falls
and
skimming
along
the
top
of
the
water
,
keeping
out
of
all
the
deep
places
,
and
never
once
touching
the
rocks
.
