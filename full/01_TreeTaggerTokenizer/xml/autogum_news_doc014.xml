The

toll
updates
previous
estimates
,
which
at
the
time
of
the
incident
were
of
at

50
dead
.
The
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/BBC">

on
Tuesday
reported
an
official
told
them
the
figure
of
236
was
erroneously
reached
by
combining
the
numbers
of
dead
and
wounded
.
The
camp
in
Rann
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borno%20State">
Borno
State
</ref>
is
home
to
thousands
and
lies
near
the
northeastern
border
with
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Cameroon">
Cameroon
</ref>
.
</p>
<p>
Home
to
those
displaced
by
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Boko_Haram">
Boko

</ref>
insurgents
,
the
camp
is
in
an
area
suffering
famine
.
Farmers
are
unable
to
work
owing
to
bombs
on
their
land
.
The
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Red_Cross">
Red
Cross
</ref>
was
there
to
distribute
food
when
the
attack
happened
.
Twenty
Nigerian
Red

workers
were
injured
or
killed
.

are
treating
the
majority
of
the
wounded
in
makeshift
tents
in
Rann
,

hospital
facilities
.
A

number
have
been
evacuated
to

<p>
Military
officials
said
at
the
time
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian%20Air%20Force">
Air
Force
</ref>
had
been
dispatched
to
Rann
after
reports
of
&quot;
remnants
&quot;
of
Boko
Haram
in
the
area
.
The
military
claims
it
is
in
a
&quot;
final
push
&quot;
against
the
rebel
group
.
A
promised
investigation
has
materialised
in
the
form
of
a
panel
of
Air

officials
,
with
orders
to
complete
the
probe
by

end

for
compensation
for
victims

They
say
the
military
is
not
absolved

liability
and
suggest
the
camp
's
tents
were
obvious
.
Eyewitnesses
say
the

circled

Journalists

Officials
claim
all
the
dead
in
Rann
have
been
buried
,
and
two
more
died
in
hospital
in
Maiduguri
.
Most
of
those
killed
were
women
and
children
.
Soldiers
were
also
amongst
those
killed
.
Eyewitnesses
claim
two
days
after
the
disaster
in
excess
of
100
Boko
Haram
militants
attacked
the
camp
,
fighting
with
soldiers
for
hours

MSF
field
co-ordinator
Alfred
Davies
said
,
&quot;
There
are
no
words
to
describe
the
chaos[
...
]
I
saw
the
bodies
of
children
that
had
been
cut
in
two
.
&quot;
MSF
have
called
for
&quot;
a
transparent
account
&quot;
with
the
organisation
's
general
director
complaining
refugees
&quot;
were
bombed
by
those
who
were
meant
to
safeguard
them
&quot;
.
Some
humanitarian
groups
have
suggested
the
incident
constitutes
a
war
crime
even
as
an
accident
,
and
Human
Rights
Watch
is
urging
an
independent
probe
.
They
say
35
structures
were
destroyed
at
two
separate
locations
within
the
camp
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
We
saw
dozens
of
patients
with
multiple
traumatic
injuries
,
including
open
fractures
and
wounds
to
the
abdomen
and
chest
,
&quot;
said
MSF
doctor
Mohammed
Musoke
.
He
described
wounded
children
,
including
a
crying
baby
with
shrapnel
in
its
neck
and
&quot;
a
10-year-old
boy
with
a
large
,
deep
flesh
wound
to
his
thigh
.
The
flesh
was
hanging
loose
on
one
side
and
you
could
see
through
to
the
bone
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Survivor
Baba
,
37
,
a
refugee
,
said
military
aircraft
were
not
an
uncommon
sight
but
the
attacking
jet
behaved
abnormally
.
&quot;
The
plane
flew
back
and
forth
,
and
we
knew
something
was
wrong
before
the
bombing
happened
.
&quot;
His
remarks
were
released
by
MSF
.
</p>
<p>
Prior
to
the
attacks
camp
residents
had
been
starving
,
some
dying
from
malnutrition
.
War
and
substandard
infrastructure
left
Rann
isolated
,
and
the
attack
came
as
the
Red
Cross
were
about
to
distribute
food
they
had
just
arrived
with
.
The
Red
Cross
say
they
have
five
weeks
'
worth
of
food
.
</p>
<p>
The
International
NGO
Safety
Organisation
claims
2016
saw
in
excess
of
90
aid
workers
killed
worldwide
,
with
154
injured
.
