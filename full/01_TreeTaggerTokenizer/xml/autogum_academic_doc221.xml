<p>
It
is
unarguable
that
an
effective
response
to
the
challenge
of
climate
change
and
its
contributory
GHG
emissions
must
include
an
explicit
policy
focus
on
the
building
sector
.
To
this
end
,
a
coherent
response
by
governments
calls
for
the
deployment
of
diverse
,
complementary
policy
instruments
.
</p>
<p>
The
effective
implementation
of
building
energy
policy
ultimately
depends
on
achieving
an
intended
behavioral
change
by
the
respondent
sectoral
stakeholder
group
.
These
outcomes
require
engagement
with
property
developers
,
contractors
,
lessees
,
builders
,
or
individual
consumers
,
depending
on
the
market
sector
targeted
by
the
policy
measure
in
question
.
For
example
,
in
the
residential
sector
,
consumers
and
building
service
providers
are
seen
to
be
the
key
target
stakeholder
groups
.
</p>
<p>
This
paper
seeks
to
break
new
ground
by
examining
residential
building
energy
policy
interventions
using
a
BE
approach
,
wherein
the
behavior
of
key
stakeholders
such
as
consumers
,
designers
,
and
builders
,
is
addressed
from
a
socio-psychological
perspective
.
Although
BE
theory
is
being
applied
to
policy
implementation
in
areas
such
as
consumer
protection
,
finance
,
and
public
health
,
its
principles
have
yet
to
be
applied
to
the
key
building
sector
in
the
core
area
of
building
performance
(
as
energy
efficiency
)
.
It
is
worth
reflecting
on
the
contribution
of
residential
building
performance
,
including
services
such
as
water
heating
,
to
total
residential
energy
demand
.
According
to
a
definitive
study
by
the
Australian
Government
,
residential
space
conditioning
and
water
heating
accounts
for
over
60
%
of
the
total
residential
energy
consumption
,
with
the
balance
taken
up
by
electrical
appliances
and
cooking
.
So
,
policy
interventions
focused
on
improved
building
design
and
construction
are
particularly
important
for
reducing
residential
energy
consumption
,
as
downstream
interventions
directed
towards
reducing
demand
during
building
operation
will
inevitably
be
constrained
by
structural
factors
.
</p>
<p>
Working
from
a
grounding
in
BE
theory
,
the
paper
explains
how
decisions
made
by
building
industry
stakeholders
differ
substantially
from
those
assumed
by
an
orthodox
(
essentially
economic
)
policy
perspective
.
This
divergence
has
significant
implications
for
the
framing
of
sectoral
climate
and
energy
policies
.
Thus
,
BE
theory
suggests
that
understanding
and
applying
inferences
drawn
from
an
appreciation
of
the
cognitive
heuristics
at
play
among
stakeholders
can
contribute
to
a
marked
improvement
in
the
prospects
for
successful
policy
intervention
,
to
deliver
sustained
behavioral
change
.
Conversely
,
failure
to
heed
the
lessons
available
from
BE
theory
is
likely
to
jeopardize
prospects
for
successful
policy
deployment
.
</p>
<p>
A
high
level
of
complementarity
between
key
elements
of
BE
theory
—
represented
by
cognitive
heuristics
—
and
the
behavioral
triggers
that
building
energy
policy
seeks
to
influence
(
Table
2
)
has
been
demonstrated
.
So
,
it
follows
that
lessons
available
from
BE
theory
might
make
a
substantial
contribution
to
the
development
of
the
government
policy
instruments
that
are
being
deployed
to
accelerate
the
transition
to
an
energy
efficient
,
low-carbon
residential
building
stock
(
see
Table
4
below
for
examples
)
.
</p>
<p>
In
a
series
of
case
studies
(
Section
5
)
,
the
operation
of
each
major
category
of
building
energy
policy
intervention
was
examined
in
turn
.
This
section
of
the
paper
clarifies
and
reinforces
the
strong
relationship
between
the
tenets
of
BE
theory
and
the
mechanics
of
building
policy
.
More
revealingly
,
each
category
of
policy
implementation
is
shown
to
suffer
from
significant
flaws
—
deficiencies
that
might
reasonably
be
attributed
,
at
least
prima
facie
,
to
a
failure
by
policy
makers
to
appreciate
the
implications
of
the
behavioral
changes
expected
from
targeted
stakeholder
groups
.
The
utilization
of
BE
principles
through
the
application
of
appropriate
heuristics
offers
a
powerful
vehicle
for
addressing
these
identified
policy
shortcomings
.
</p>
<p>
Reviewing
these
policy
failures
through
a
BE
lens
better
explains
the
following
:
<list>
<item>
Why
compliance
with
energy
efficiency
requirements
mandated
in
building
regulations
may
be
fatally
compromised
as
a
result
of
indifference
by
both
building
project
developers
and
consumers
;
</item>
<item>
Why
price-based
interventions
in
the
property
market
(
such
as
through
an
ETS
)
will
not
necessarily
prompt
a
rational
response
from
consumers
;
</item>
<item>
Why
consumer
information
campaigns
such
as
the
EU
EPC
initiative
fail
to
achieve
a
significant
market
impact
,
or
a
price
premium
for
superior
certified
performance
,
because
of
weak
and
irrational
consumer
responses
.
</item>
</list>
</p>
<p>
These
findings
are
summarized
in
Table
4
,
together
with
selected
references
from
the
literature
that
could
provide
a
platform
for
the
development
of
more
effective
market
interventions
based
on
BE
principles
.
</p>
<p>
BE
theory
suggests
that
understanding
and
applying
inferences
to
be
drawn
from
an
appreciation
of
the
cognitive
heuristics
at
play
among
industry
stakeholders
could
contribute
to
a
marked
improvement
in
the
success
of
policy
interventions
,
delivering
a
sustained
behavioral
change
.
But
failure
to
heed
the
lessons
available
from
BE
theory
is
likely
to
jeopardize
prospects
for
successful
building
policy
deployment
.
</p>
<p>
Despite
the
strong
case
for
a
focus
on
energy
efficient
buildings
in
terms
of
a
global
climate
response
,
this
policy
area
has
yet
to
be
appreciated
by
government
BITs
.
A
recent
OECD
study
into
the
potential
application
of
BE
principles
to
energy
policy
development
concluded
that
areas
for
exploring
the
application
of
behavioral
insights
should
specifically
focus
on
regulatory
implementation
and
decision
making
by
regulatory
agencies
.
