Consider
an
intern
position
to
get
your
foot
in
the
door
.
Sometimes
it
's
best
not
to
be
too
picky
about
what
you
apply
for
in
the
equestrian
field
.
If
this
is
something
that
you
are
passionate
about
,
you
may
want
to
consider
taking
what
you
can
get
,
including
an
internship
as
a
horse
groomer
or
handyman
.
It
may
not
be
your
ultimate
goal
of
becoming
a
horse
trainer
,
but
it
may
get
you
there
eventually
.
And
in
the
mean
time
you
can

your
resume
with
valuable
knowledge
and
allow
your
employer
to
see
what
you
are
truly
capable
of
.
