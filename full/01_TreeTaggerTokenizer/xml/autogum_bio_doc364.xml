Biography

<p>
Prior
to
the
first
English
settlement
on
Roanoke
Island
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Amadas">
Philip
Amadas
</ref>
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Barlowe">
Arthur
Barlowe
</ref>
explored
the
area
(
April
27
,
1584
)
on
behalf
of
Raleigh
,
who
had
received
an
English
charter
to
establish
a
colony
a
month
earlier
.
During
their
expedition
,
Barlowe
took
detailed
notes
relating
to
conflicts
and
rivalries
between
different
groups
of
Native
Americans
.

In
one
account
,
Wingina
explained
his
own
tribal
history
,
in
relation
to
a
neighboring
tribe
at
the
mouth
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuse_River">
Neuse
River
</ref>
,
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neusiok">
Neusiok
</ref>
,
referred
to
as
the
&quot;
Neiosioke
&quot;
by
Barlowe
.
According
to
Wingina
,
the
Secotans
endured
years
of
warfare
with
the
Neiosioke
,
and
&quot;
some
years
earlier
,
&quot;
he
met
with
the
Neiosioke
king
,
in
an
effort
to
ensure
a
&quot;
permanent
coexistence
.
&quot;
The
two
leaders
arranged
a
feast
between
the
two
groups
.
An
unspecified
number
of
Secotan
men
and
30
women
attended
a
feast
in
the
town
of
Neiosioke
.
The
Neiosioke
ambushed
the
Secotans
at
the
feast
,
and
by
the
time
fighting
ended
,
the
Neiosioke
had
&quot;
slewn
them
every
one
,
reserving
the
women
and
children
only
.

In
conveying
this
&quot;
inter-tribal
&quot;
history
to
Barlowe
,
Wingina
saw
an
opportunity
to
advance
the
interest
of
the
Secotans
.
Wingina
and
his
people
attempted
on
several
occasions
to
convince
the
English
to
join
them
in
devising
a
surprise
attack
against
the
Neiosioke
.
The
Englishmen
,
uncertain
of
&quot;
whether
their
perswasion
be
to
the
ende
they
may
be
revenged
of
their
enemies
,
or
for
the
love
they
beare
to
us
,
&quot;
declined
to
help
the
Secotans
wage
war
against
their
rivals
.
Instead
,
the
English
established
a
trusting
relationship
with
the
Secotans
,
exemplified
by
the
willingness
of
two
Secotan
chiefs
,

back
to
