Decide
where
you
want
to
go
.
Do
you
fancy
a
trip
in
Europe
?
How
about
an
American
adventure
?
Maybe
an
Asian
week
of
fun
is
more
your
style
?
Wherever
you
want
to
go
,
make
sure
you
have
planned
out
how
many
days
you
are
going
for
,
who
you
are
going
with
,
and
what
you
are
going
to
do
and
see
.
A
spot
of
cuisine-tasting
is
a
must
!

Book
accommodations
.
Know
what
hotel
you
are
staying
in
and
what
the
prices
are
.
Make
sure
you
do
n't
go
somewhere
too
pricey
because
you
will
be
too
worked
up
worrying
about
how
you
can
pay
it
and
wo
n't
take
as
much
from
the
vacation
as
you
would
.
Be
sensible

Make
a
list
of
what
you
will
pack
but
keep
it
down
to
the
bare
minimum
.
You
do
n't
want
to
be
carting
lots
of
bags
everywhere
.
Take
the
essentials
and
a
couple
of
other
things
and
you
should
be
fine
.
When
you
do
come
to
packing
,
choose
a
wheely-case
so
it
's
easier
to
carry
.

Research
restaurants

no
food

Once

dine
at

for
cake

everything
packed
and
organized

enjoy
your
birthday

the
most
important
step
you

birthday
