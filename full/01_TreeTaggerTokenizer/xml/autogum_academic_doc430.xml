Introduction
</head>
<p>
Nowadays
,
distributed
energy
resources
(
DER
)
are
leading
the
change
in
power
generation
as
a
result
of
the
interest
in
renewable
energy
systems
(
RES
)
.
These
DER
could
be
connected
to
the
utility
grid
or
microgrids
through
three-phase
voltage
source
converters
(
VSCs
)
,
consequently
,
the
technical
requirements
,
which
must
be
accomplished
by
the
power
converter
and
its
control
algorithm
,
are
growing
.
</p>
<p>
The
trend
in
multifrequency
control
using
vectorial
complex
theory
has
increased
the
possible
features
.
Among
those
possibilities
,
there
is
an
useful
one
in
power
oscillations
mitigation
.
Nevertheless
,
the
techniques
and
objectives
fulfilled
can
vary
in
each
application
when
dealing
with
unbalanced
grids
.
</p>
<p>
Basically
,
if
the
active
power
oscillations
are
reduced
in
the
VSC
AC
side
,
the
low-frequency
ripples
in
the
DC-bus
will
decrease
.
Firstly
,
when
low-frequency
DC
ripple
currents
flow
through
the
DC-bus
capacitor
,
the
temperature
of
the
passive
component
increases
,
which
causes
a
decreasing
lifetime
of
this
component
.
The
batteries
also
suffer
this
problematic
effect
and
DC
microgrids
converters
also
look
for
reduced
voltage
oscillations
due
to
power
oscillations
.
Secondly
,
the
DC
bus
ripple
voltage
can
have
a
harmful
effect
on
the
induction
machine
performance
characteristics
as
torque
pulsations
.
Besides
,
on
doubly
fed
induction
generators
(
DFIGs
)
for
wind
turbines
,
active
power
oscillations
are
related
to
electromagnetic
torque
ripples
that
increase
the
mechanical
stress
on
the
turbine
system
.
</p>
<p>
The
harmonic
power
oscillations
in
three-phase
three-wire
AC
electrical
systems
come
from
the
presence
of
distorted
or
unbalanced
grids
.
Therefore
,
the
control
strategy
aims
to
regulate
the
instantaneous
active
power
at
a
constant
value
by
injecting
the
suitable
currents
into
the
grid
.
The
current
reference
could
be
calculated
by
means
of
the
active
and
reactive
power
theory
,
first
introduced
in
Reference
.
From
that
theory
,
many
works
have
dealt
with
the
regulation
of
active
power
oscillations
when
grid
imbalances
or
grid
faults
are
faced
by
the
power
converter
.
However
,
these
methodologies
only
remove
the
second
harmonic
power
ripple
due
to
the
appearance
of
fundamental
negative
sequence
(
FNS
)
voltage
and
its
interaction
with
the
fundamental
positive
sequence
(
FPS
)
current
.
In
distorted
grids
,
there
are
higher
even
harmonic
power
ripples
due
to
other
harmonic
sequence
voltages
(
−5
,
+7
,
−11
,
+13
)
.
Hence
,
an
effective
multifrequency
current
reference
calculator
is
required
by
the
algorithm
to
accomplish
the
power
ripple
removal
.
</p>
<p>
The
presented
control
objective
has
an
unavoidable
characteristic
in
three-phase
three-wire
systems
—
the
elimination
of
active
power
oscillations
implies
more
reactive
power
fluctuations
.
Previous
publications
such
as
References
claimed
the
elimination
of
both
active
and
reactive
power
oscillations
,
simultaneously
.
However
,
this
approach
in
three-wire
systems
leads
to
the
injection
of
zero-sequence
currents
.
Hence
,
the
harmonic
distortion
in
the
injected
current
increases
dramatically
.
Even
so
,
there
are
some
works
where
this
injection
is
regulated
.
In
Reference
,
two
control
coefficients
are
added
to
control
the
injection
of
3rd
order
current
harmonics
,
that
is
,
zero-sequence
.
Nevertheless
,
most
case
studies
only
consider
positive
and
negative
sequences
because
zero-sequence
voltages
of
unbalanced
voltage
dips
do
not
exist
in
three-wire
systems
,
nor
can
they
propagate
to
the
secondary
side
of
star-ungrounded
or
delta-connected
transformers
in
four-wire
systems
.
Even
for
unbalanced
systems
with
zero-sequence
voltage
,
four-leg
inverter
topologies
can
eliminate
zero-sequence
current
with
appropriate
control
.
</p>
<p>
The
multifrequency
current
reference
calculator
purpose
,
just
taking
into
account
positive
and
negative
sequences
,
has
been
partly
fulfilled
for
DER
applications
as
well
as
DFIG
ones
.
Both
proposals
are
defined
in
synchronous
reference
frames
(
SRF
)
,
hence
,
coordinate
transformations
are
required
.
This
implies
online
computation
of
trigonometric
functions
,
which
is
usually
performed
through
tables
,
increasing
the
memory
requirements
of
the
algorithm
to
get
considerable
accuracy
.
However
,
they
are
unnecessary
because
the
current
reference
calculation
can
be
directly
implemented
in
the
stationary
reference
frame
(
StRF
)
,
as
Reference
has
shown
for
unbalanced
grids
.
However
,
the
StRF
approach
has
been
unemployed
for
the
multifrequency
control
of
instantaneous
power
,
which
avoids
redundant
transformations
for
each
one
of
the
dealt
harmonics
.
Besides
,
grid
frequency
variations
are
under
the
scope
in
recent
years
and
grid
frequency
offset
around
its
nominal
values
decreases
the
quality
of
injected
currents
.
Therefore
,
frequency-adaptive
techniques
must
be
applied
in
order
to
accomplish
the
control
objective
of
constant
active
power
,
as
is
shown
in
this
paper
.
</p>
<p>
From
the
grid
code
operation
point
of
view
,
the
injected
harmonic
sequence
currents
are
limited
by
the
total
harmonic
distortion
(
THD
)
standards
.
In
order
to
achieve
standards
limitations
,
any
of
the
harmonic
sequence
currents
could
be
set
to
zero
or
current
HD
minimization
could
be
performed
.
Both
approaches
must
sacrifice
the
cancellation
of
one
power
ripple
component
,
and
the
smallest
power
ripple
is
chosen
for
the
optimum
performance
.
Therefore
,
the
optimum
current
harmonics
shaping
is
also
applied
in
this
proposal
.
