Introduction

<p>
Folklore
,
legends
,
myths
and
fairy
tales
have
followed
childhood
through
the
ages
,
for
every
healthy
youngster
has
a
wholesome
and
instinctive
love
for
stories
fantastic
,
marvelous
and
manifestly
unreal
.
The
winged
fairies
of
Grimm
and
Andersen
have
brought
more
happiness
to
childish
hearts
than
all
other
human
creations
.
</p>
<p>
Yet
the
old
time
fairy
tale
,
having
served
for
generations
,
may
now
be
classed
as
&quot;
historical
&quot;
in
the
children
's
library
;
for
the
time
has
come
for
a
series
of
newer
&quot;
wonder
tales
&quot;
in
which
the
stereotyped
genie
,
dwarf
and
fairy
are
eliminated
,
together
with
all
the
horrible
and
blood-curdling
incidents
devised
by
their
authors
to
point
a
fearsome
moral
to
each
tale
.
Modern
education
includes
morality
;
therefore
the
modern
child
seeks
only
entertainment
in
its
wonder
tales
and
gladly
dispenses
with
all
disagreeable
incident
.
</p>
<p>
Having
this
thought
in
mind
,
the
story
of
&quot;
The
Wonderful
Wizard
of
Oz
&quot;
was
written
solely
to
please
children
of
today
.
It
aspires
to
being
a
modernized
fairy
tale
,
in
which
the
wonderment
and
joy
are
retained
and
the
heartaches
and
nightmares
are
left
out
.

THE
WONDERFUL
WIZARD
OF
OZ
</head>
<head>
1
.
The
Cyclone
</head>
<p>
Dorothy
lived
in
the
midst
of
the
great
Kansas
prairies
,
with
Uncle
Henry
,
who
was
a
farmer
,
and
Aunt
Em
,
who
was
the
farmer
's
wife
.
Their
house
was
small
,
for
the
lumber
to
build
it
had
to
be
carried
by
wagon
many
miles
.
There
were
four
walls
,
a
floor
and
a
roof
,
which
made
one
room
;
and
this
room
contained
a
rusty
looking
cookstove
,
a
cupboard
for
the
dishes
,
a
table
,
three
or
four
chairs
,
and
the
beds
.
Uncle
Henry
and
Aunt
Em
had
a
big
bed
in
one
corner
,
and
Dorothy
a
little
bed
in
another
corner
.
There
was
no
garret
at
all
,
and
no
cellar
--
except
a
small
hole
dug
in
the
ground
,
called
a
cyclone
cellar
,
where
the
family
could
go
in
case
one
of
those
great
whirlwinds
arose
,
mighty
enough
to
crush
any
building
in
its
path
.
It
was
reached
by
a
trap
door
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
,
from
which
a
ladder
led
down
into
the
small
,
dark
hole
.
</p>
<p>
When
Dorothy
stood
in
the
doorway
and
looked
around
,
she
could
see
nothing
but
the
great
gray
prairie
on
every
side
.
Not
a
tree
nor
a
house
broke
the
broad
sweep
of
flat
country
that
reached
to
the
edge
of
the
sky
in
all
directions
.
The
sun
had
baked
the
plowed
land
into
a
gray
mass
,
with
little
cracks
running
through
it
.
Even
the
grass
was
not
green
,
for
the
sun
had
burned
the
tops
of
the
long
blades
until
they
were
the
same
gray
color
to
be
seen
everywhere
.
Once
the
house
had
been
painted
,
but
the
sun
blistered
the
paint
and
the
rains
washed
it
away
,
and
now
the
house
was
as
dull
and
gray
as
everything
else
.
</p>
<p>
When
Aunt
Em
came
there
to
live
she
was
a
young
,
pretty
wife
.
The
sun
and
wind
had
changed
her
,
too
.
They
had
taken
the
sparkle
from
her
eyes
and
left
them
a
sober
gray
;
they
had
taken
the
red
from
her
cheeks
and
lips
,
and
they
were
gray
also
.
She
was
thin
and
gaunt
,
and
never
smiled
now
.
When
Dorothy
,
who
was
an
orphan
,
first
came
to
her
,
Aunt
Em
had
been
so
startled
by
the
child
's
laughter
that
she
would
scream
and
press
her
hand
upon
her
heart
whenever
Dorothy
's
merry
voice
reached
her
ears
;
and
she
still
looked
at
the
little
girl
with
wonder
that
she
could
find
anything
to
laugh
at
.
</p>
<p>
Uncle
Henry
never
laughed
.
He
worked
hard
from
morning
till
night
and
did
not
know
what
joy
was
.
He
was
gray
also
,
from
his
long
beard
to
his
rough
boots
,
and
he
looked
stern
and
solemn
,
and
rarely
spoke
.
</p>
<p>
It
was
Toto
that
made
Dorothy
laugh
,
and
saved
her
from
growing
as
gray
as
her
other
surroundings
.
Toto
was
not
gray
;
he
was
a
little
black
dog
,
with
long
silky
hair
and
small
black
eyes
that
twinkled
merrily
on
either
side
of
his
funny
,
wee
nose
.
Toto
played
all
day
long
,
and
Dorothy
played
with
him
,
and
loved
him
dearly
.
</p>
<p>
Today
,
however
,
they
were
not
playing
.
Uncle
Henry
sat
upon
the
doorstep
and
looked
anxiously
at
the
sky
,
which
was
even
grayer
than
usual
.
Dorothy
stood
in
the
door
with
Toto
in
her
arms
,
and
looked
at
the
sky
too
.
Aunt
Em
was
washing
the
dishes
.
