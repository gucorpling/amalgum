Introduction
</head>
<p>
Lipid
oxidation
is
one
of
the
major
causes
of
food
deterioration
,
leading
to
the
loss
of
nutrients
and
bioactives
,
off
flavors
development
,
and
could
also
form
potentially
toxic
compounds
.
The
use
of
synthetic
antioxidants
,
such
as
butylated
hydroxytoluene
,
butylated
hydroxyanisole
,
or
n-propyl
gallate
to
delay
lipid
oxidation
is
currently
questioned
due
to
their
possible
harmful
effects
on
human
health
,
and
the
use
of
natural
antioxidants
is
of
growing
interest
.
In
recent
years
,
flavonoids
have
been
used
to
improve
the
oxidative
stability
of
foods
.
The
main
mechanisms
by
which
flavonoids
act
against
lipid
oxidation
involve
transferring
a
hydrogen
atom
or
electrons
to
a
peroxyl
radical
and
metal
chelation
.
Free
flavonoids
,
mainly
quercetin
,
myricetin
,
morin
,
(
+)catechin
,
(
−)epigallocatechin
,
(
−)epicatechin
,
and
kaempferol
have
been
incorporated
in
different
lipid
systems
with
varying
degrees
of
success
in
terms
of
oxidative
stability
.
The
incorporation
of
free
flavonoids
in
lipid
systems
may
have
some
drawbacks
since
these
phenolic
compounds
have
limited
solubility
and
stability
,
together
with
unpleasant
flavors
in
some
cases
.
</p>
<p>
Encapsulation
of
flavonoids
is
a
technology
which
could
enhance
the
stability
of
flavonoids
.
Among
the
encapsulation
methods
,
spray-drying
is
the
most
widely
used
for
the
encapsulation
of
bioactive
compounds
in
the
food
industry
.
Inulin
is
a
linear
fructo-oligosaccharide
composed
of
fructosyl
units
(
β
(
2→1
)
linkage
)
and
usually
contains
one
terminal
glucose
moiety
per
molecule
.
β-linkage
makes
inulin
resistant
to
hydrolysis
by
human
gastrointestinal
enzymes
and
it
is
classified
as
colonic
delivery
biopolymer
.
Although
inulin
is
moderately
water
soluble
,
it
is
used
as
an
encapsulating
agent
by
spray
drying
due
to
low
viscosity
and
colorless
solutions
.
However
,
there
are
few
studies
focused
on
the
effect
of
the
incorporation
of
microencapsulated
flavonoids
on
the
oxidative
stability
of
lipid
systems
.
In
previous
studies
undertaken
by
our
research
group
,
flavonoids
were
microencapsulated
with
inulin
(
lipid-insoluble
polymer
)
,
where
channelizing
agents
(
lipid-soluble
polymer
)
were
incorporated
.
These
microparticles
were
able
to
release
the
encapsulated
flavonoids
and
improve
the
oxidative
stability
of
methyl
linoleate
and
vegetable
oils
,
which
was
attributed
to
the
formation
of
channels
inside
the
microparticles
,
favoring
the
diffusion
of
flavonoids
.
</p>
<p>
In
general
,
powders
obtained
by
spray-drying
are
amorphous
.
However
,
in
the
case
of
inulin
,
process
variables
of
spray-drying
such
as
feed
temperature
and
inlet
air
temperature
have
been
reported
to
influence
both
the
morphology
and
the
degree
of
crystallinity
of
the
microparticles
.
When
the
flavonoid-inulin
microparticles
are
incorporated
into
a
lipid
system
,
the
physical
state
of
these
microparticles
(
semi-crystalline/amorphous
)
may
influence
the
oxidative
stability
of
the
system
,
but
this
still
has
not
been
addressed
.
</p>
<p>
The
objective
of
this
research
was
to
design
flavonoids
(
epicatechin
and
quercetin
)
microparticles
with
inulin
as
encapsulating
agent
and
to
evaluate
the
influence
of
the
physical
state
of
spray-dried
flavonoid
microparticles
(
semi-crystalline/amorphous
)
on
the
oxidative
stability
of
lipid
systems
.
