Introduction
</head>
<p>
In
2018
,
it
was
estimated
by
the
Population
Division
of
the
Department
of
Economic
and
Social
Affairs
of
the
United
Nations
that
55
%
of
the
world
’s
inhabitants
live
in
urban
areas
.
This
is
projected
to
rise
to
68
%
by
2050
.
The
movement
to
“
major
urban
agglomerations
”
involves
a
choice
between
the
cities
and
their
suburbs
and
ultimate
land
use
change
.
To
accommodate
this
increasing
population
,
residential
development
can
take
place
on
infilled
or
reclaimed
land
with
higher
density
and
existing
infrastructure
,
or
on
newly-developed
land
with
lower
density
and
little
or
no
infrastructure
.
</p>
<p>
The
work
for
this
paper
involved
a
major
metropolitan
watershed
that
encompasses
both
a
segment
of
the
City
of
Philadelphia
,
and
all
or
part
of
15
suburban
municipalities
.
The
main
objective
was
to
determine
and
compare
the
economic
,
energy
,
and
environmental
impacts
of
scenarios
of
placing
housing
according
to
profitability
criteria
on
the
one
hand
,
and
environmental
sustainability
criteria
on
the
other
.
The
profitability
criteria
involved
the
profit
generated
by
the
average
housing
unit
sale
,
as
well
as
neighborhood
characteristics
(
e.
g.
,
an
income
index
and
a
crime
index
)
,
in
each
zip
code
within
the
municipalities
.
The
sustainability
criteria
included
proximity
to
infrastructure
and
institutions
already
in
place
.
Both
scenarios
had
areas
that
were
restricted
from
development
.
The
prior
expectations
were
that
the
scenario
based
on
profitability
would
have
higher
profit
,
and
that
based
on
sustainability
would
have
significantly
smaller
environmental
impacts
.

<p>
Different
aspects
of
the
work
in
this
paper
have
been
investigated
by
previous
authors
.
Much
of
the
literature
on
the
geographical
aspects
of
housing
,
as
shown
in
Hasanzadeh
et
al.
,
deals
with
the
demand
side
.
Using
public
participation
Geographic
Information
Systems
(
GIS
)
,
the
authors
investigated
whether
people
inhabited
the
parts
of
the
urban
structure
that
their
classification
of
urbanists
,
semi-urbanists
,
and
nature-lovers
suggested
they
would
.
The
majority
did
not
.
On
the
housing
supply
side
,
Saiz
used
US
Geological
Survey
Digital
Elevation
Model
and
National
Land
Cover
data
in
GIS
to
examine
geographical
restrictions
on
supply
in
US
metropolitan
statistical
areas
over
500,000
.
The
author
concluded
that
those
areas
with
greater
restrictions
(
including
regulatory
)
had
higher
housing
prices
and
a
lower
price
elasticity
of
housing
supply
.
Hudson
contrasted
the
treatment
of
sustainable
housing
development
with
the
traditional
approach
in
the
US
,
of
development
without
much
concern
for
natural
capital
.
Sandberg
approached
sustainable
housing
by
looking
at
proposed
downsizing
of
dwellings
in
Finland
.
Musse
et
al.
applied
a
“
backcasting
”
approach
to
providing
low-income
housing
in
a
Brazilian
city
through
a
vision
of
a
sustainable
future
.
Koshkar
et
al.
studied
the
impact
of
urban
growth
and
residential
densification
on
urban
–
suburban
green
space
and
ecosystem
services
in
sections
of
the
Stockholm
region
.
Göçmen
,
Z.
et
al.
surveyed
many
county
and
municipal
governments
in
Wisconsin
,
USA
to
ascertain
the
types
of
sustainable
practices
,
e.
g.
,
New
Urbanism
,
that
the
agencies
implemented
with
respect
to
future
residential
development
.
Stachuro
examined
the
behavioral
implications
of
creating
“
eco-districts
”
with
their
own
sustainable
infrastructure
within
urban
areas
.
Hanlon
concentrated
on
suburban
re-development
after
decades
of
expansion
in
Baltimore
,
MD
,
USA
.
Sorrentino
et
al.
and
Sorrentino
et
al.
used
housing
buildout
in
an
urban
–
suburban
watershed
to
determine
the
relative
impacts
of
alternative
development
scenarios
.
Dunphy
et
al.
proposed
a
business
model
that
values
sustainable
retrofit
at
more
than
monetary
values
and
involved
co-production
by
sellers
and
buyers
.

Use
of
the
GREET
2018
model
to
estimate
air
pollution
and
greenhouse
gas
emissions
appeared
in
Almeida
et
al.
.
Using
life-cycle
analysis
,
the
focus
was
on
how
different
battery
technologies
would
influence
electric
automobile
emissions
over
time
.
Their
approach
was
similar
to
the
work
in
this
paper
in
that
scenarios
were
evaluated
in
terms
of
emissions
.
However
,
their
scale
was
national
and
not
related
<hi rend="italic">
per

to
housing
location
.

In
the
water-related
dimension
,
a
recent
example
of
the
hydrological
modeling
approach
is
Guo
et
al.
.
The
authors
incorporated
low
impact
development
(
LID
)
into
a
Storm
Water
Management
Model
(
SWMM
)
,
and
built
scenarios
showing
the
effects
of
green
roofs
,
permeable
pavement
,
and
other
LID
technologies
on
runoff
.
Chao
et
al.
reported
the
results
of
implementing
sustainable
residential
development
on
water
consumption
in
two
urban
regions
in
Australia
.
Xian
et
al.
used
remote
sensing
to
assess
the
impacts
on
water-quality
parameters
of
increased
impervious
surface
and
population
density
in
the
Tampa
Bay
,
FL
,
USA
watershed
.
Nesheim
and
Barkved
evaluated
the
sustainability
potential
of
watersheds
altered
for
hydropower
production
in
Norway
,
using
a
process
that
combined
ecosystem
services
valuation
with
the
value
of
uses
that
accrue
to
beneficiaries
from
the
human
intervention
itself
.
