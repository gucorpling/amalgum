Founded
in
1903
as
the
ocean
terminus
of
what
is
now
the
Alaska
Railroad
,
Seward
prides
itself
,
not
only
on
its
natural
beauty
,
but
as
Alaska
's
only
deep-water
,
ice-free
port
with
rail
,
highway
and
air
transportation
to
Alaska
's
interior
and
major

Seward
Highway
</ref>
is
a

In

the
Alaska
Department
of
Transportation
announced
a
4-year
2-phase
<hi rend="bold">
<ref target="http://www.sewardhighway75to90.com/">
Milepost
75-90
Rehabilitation
Project
</ref>
</hi>
to
make
major
safety
improvements
to
a
busy
crash-prone
section
of
the
Seward
Highway
from
Girdwood
to
beyond
the
Portage
curve
toward
Turnagain
Pass
.
In
July
2015
a
tour

crash
at
Milepost
79
(
<hi rend="italic">
Portage
Glacier
Road
</hi>
and
<hi rend="italic">

Wildlife
Conservation
Center
</hi>
)
killed
one
man
and
critically
injured
several
others
,
causing
a
10-hour
traffic
jam

During
the
summer
months
,
up
to
15,000
vehicles
use
this
15-mile
stretch
of
Seward
Highway
daily
.
Although
the
project
is
not
yet
fully
funded
,
construction
on
Seward

is
