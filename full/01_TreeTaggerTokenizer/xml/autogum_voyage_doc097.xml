Santa

(

</head>

Santa

is
a
town
in

<head>
Understand

<p>
Santa
Clara
is
a
small
city
of
big
contrasts
.
If
any
city
can
claim
to
be
&quot;
the
center
of
<ref target="Silicon%20Valley">
Silicon
Valley
</ref>
,
&quot;
it
is
this
town
of
just
over
100,000
.
Intel
,
AMD
,
WebEx
,
NVIDIA
,
and
National
Semiconductor
all
have
headquarters
here
.
At
the
same
time
,
Santa
Clara
is
one
of
the
oldest
settlements
(
by
Europeans
)
in
Northern
California
.
The
Mission
Santa
Clara
de
Asís
was
established
in
1777
,
and
the
Jesuit-run
Santa
Clara
University
,
founded
in
1851
,
is
the
oldest
university
in
California
.
Dozens
of
19th-century
homes
are
well-maintained
by
their
21st-century
owners
in
the
&quot;
old
quad
,
&quot;
the
earliest
residential
area
,
adjacent
to
the
university
.
</p>
<p>
Yet
another
contrast
is
the
diversity
of
the
local
population
,
driven
by
the
tech
boom
of
the
1970s-1990s
.
Visitors
from
<ref target="Asia">
Asia
</ref>
and
<ref target="Europe">
Europe
</ref>
frequently
overhear
strangers
speaking
their
native
languages
.
Specialty
markets
offer
native
ingredients
from
around
the
world
,
and
the
Indian
and
East
Asian
restaurants
are
some
of
the
best
in
the
Bay
Area
.
But
many
of
the
best
places
in
Santa
Clara
are
not
visible
at
first
glance
.
You
could
drive
right
through
this
town
and
see
nothing
of
any
interest
,
or
you
could
take
the
time
to
learn
where
to
look
,
explore
,
and
enjoy
.

<hi rend="bold">
California
Hospital

</hi>
.
Founded
in
1889
,
the

's
original
buildings
collapsed
in
the
&quot;
San
Francisco
Earthquake
&quot;
of
1906
,
killing
117
people
.
The
new
buildings
,
including
the
still-standing
auditorium
,
clock
tower
and
superintendent
's
residence
,
are
good
examples
of
early
twentieth
century
Mediterranean
Revival
architecture
,
heavily
influenced
by
the
Arts
and
Crafts
style
.
The
new
buildings
represented
a
more
modern
attitude
toward
the
mentally
ill
.
The
smaller
buildings
with
larger
windows
were
designed
to
comfort
and
stimulate
the
mentally
ill
,
rather
than
imprison
them
.
The
state
of
California
moved
the
last
few
hundred
residents
out
in
the
mid
1990s
,
and
sold
the
campus
to
Sun
Microsystems
,
who
promised
to
preserve
the
grounds
and
buildings
,
and
make
the
auditorium

mansion
available
