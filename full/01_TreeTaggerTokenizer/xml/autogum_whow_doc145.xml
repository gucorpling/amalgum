Communicate
Better
and
Not
Argue
</head>
<p>
Everybody
argues
once
in
a
while
,
but
for
some
people
to
stop
is
a
lot
harder
than
others
.
Teenagers
especially
tend
to
argue
a
lot
with
their
family
.
Hopefully
this
article
will
help
to
stop
it
.

Discover
the
key
things
that
tick
you
off
.
If
there
are
a
few
specific
issues
that
make
you
angry
,
find
a
way
to
discuss
these
with
your
family
.
Do
not
do
this
forcefully
,
but
instead
calmly
,
saying
why
it
is
that
it
frustrates
you
.
Let
your
family
have
their
input
also
,
and
find
a
way
to
avoid
these
situations
that
make
you
so
annoyed
.

Try
to
spend
more
time
with
the
person
that
you
argue
most
with
;
whether
it
be
sibling
or
parent
.
At
first
this
may
be
hard
,
and
you
may
find
yourself
at
first
having
even
more
arguments
due
to
the
increased
amount
of
time
you
are
spending
with
them
.
However
,
perseverance
will
definitely
pay
off
;
you
will
learn
what
you
have
in
common
with
this
person
and
develop
a
stronger
bond
with
them
that
allows
you
to
avoid
arguments
,
or
if
they
arise
,
to
sort
them
out
effectively
.

Take
a
deep
breath
.
When
somebody
says
something
and
you
feel
the
burst
of
anger
inside
,
take
a
deep
breath
and
look
downwards
.
Count
to
ten
,
calmly
ignoring
them
.
Then
answer
what
they
have
said
collectively
without
rudeness
.
Change
the
topic
craftily
if
possible
!
This
will
take
time
-
but
it
is
something
that
once
learnt
,
will
always
help
you
.

Walk
out
.
If
an
argument
is
getting
out
of
hand
or
you
cannot
seem
to
master
the
breathing
technique
,
walk
out
of
the
room
.
Your
family
may
find
this
rude
so
make
sure
to
explain
before
or
afterward
about
why
you
are
doing
this
.

If
you
have
walked
out
,
or
the
issue
is
nagging
you
,
think
of
a
way
to
discuss
it
with
your
family
,
once
both
of
you
are
calm
.
Say
what
happened
in
your
perspective
and
do
n't
make
it
long
.
Do
n't
be
aggressive
.
If
they
interrupt
,
try
not
to
flare
up
,
just
continue
calmly
.
Listen
to
what
they
have
to
say
and
keep
in
mind
that
they
probably
felt
similar
to
you
.
Neither
of
you
are
probably
completely
right
.
Then
apologise
.
If
they
approach
you
first
,
listen
,
listen
,
listen
.

Apologize
.
If
arguments
do
happen
,
it
is
NOT
weak
to
be
the
first
to
apologize
.
In
fact
,
this
is
one
of
the
hardest
things
to
do
.
Apologizing
,
if
you
do
it
properly
without
the
whole
'
(
glare
)
&quot;
sorry
&quot;
(
walk
out
of
the
room
)
'
thing
,
will
help
you
to
get
things
into
perspective
.
You
may
realize
your
mistakes
and
hopefully
,
this
will
prevent
them
in
the
future
.
You
may
also
find
that
when
apologizing
,
the
other
person
will
respect
you
for
this
and
admit
what
they
have
done
wrong
also
.
Make
sure
you
have
cooled
down
before
apologizing
as
well
!
Otherwise
,
the
whole
thing
might
start
all
over
again
.
