Be

Pet

As

Muslim
</head>
<p>
What
is
pet
?
Based
on
Merriam
Webster
dictionary
,
pet
is
defined
as
a
domesticated
animal
kept
for
pleasure
rather
than
utility
.
Nowadays
,
people
tend
to
keep
pet
in
their
house
.
These
animals
can
form
very
close
bond
with
their
human
owners
and
in
fact
,
cats
are
even
known
as
man
’s
best
friend
.
But
,
most
of
the
owners
did
not
know
the
right
ways
to
take
care
of
their
pets
.
In
Islamic
views
,
there
are
a
few
ways
on
how
to
take
a
good
care
of
pets
.
In
order
to
be
a
responsible
owner
,
people
should
know
and
implement
the
right
steps
to
make
sure
their
pets
are
in
a
good
condition
including
treating
them
kindly
,
train
the
pets
to
be
good
in
house
and
only
own
pet
that
is
admissible
in
Islam
.

Treating
them
kindly
</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
First
and
foremost
,
Islam
expects
humankind
to
treat
all
animals
with
respect
and
dignity
and
not
cause
it
any
harm
nor
injury
.
Treating
animals
with
kindness
and
mercy
is
just
one
of
the
responsibilities
embedded
in
Allah
’s
creation
.
It
is
stated
in
the
Quran
,
“
And
We
have
sent
you
O
Muhammad
not
but
as
a
mercy
for
all
of
humankind
,
jinn
,
and
all
that
exists
.
”
(
Quran
21:107
)
.
From
this
verse
,
we
could
acknowledge
that
treating
every
creations
including
animals
with
warmth
and
care
is
highly
encouraged
.
Furthermore
,
according
to
one
of
the
hadith
narrated
by
Abu
Hurayrah
,
it
was
stated
that
:
The
Prophet
(
peace
and
blessings
of
Allah
be
upon
him
)
said
;
“
Whilst
a
man
was
walking
on
the
road
,
he
became
very
thirsty
.
He
found
a
well
so
he
went
down
into
it
and
drank
,
then
he
came
out
.
There
,
he
saw
a
dog
that
was
panting
and
biting
the
ground
out
of
thirst
.
The
man
said
:
this
dog
is
feeling
the
same
thirst
that
I
felt
.
So
he
went
back
down
into
the
well
and
filled
his
shoe
with
water
,
then
he
held
it
in
his
mouth
until
he
climbed
back
up
,
and
he
gave
the
water
to
the
dog
.
Allah
appreciated
(
his
action
)
and
forgave
him
.
(
The
Hadith
,
n.
d.
)
Therefore
,
we
as
a
Muslim
must
show
kindness
towards
animals
notably
our
pets
and
that
we
must
also
have
mercy
on
animals
and
not
for
human
beings
alone
.

Secondly
,
pet
owners
also
have
to
train
their
pets
to
be
good
.
Just
like
humans
,
animals
should
also
be
trained
so
that
they
can
behave
well
and
bad
behaviours
like
attacking
people
who
happens
to
visit
our
house
or
even
not
knowing
where
to
pee
could
be
avoided
.
This
is
vital
in
order
to
ensure
our
house
to
remain
organized
and
clean
from
any
dirt
and
unwanted
waste
.
We
,
as
a
Muslim
should
always
keep
our
house
clean
because
in
the
Quran
it
was
stated
that
“
truly
Allah
loves
those
who
turns
to
Him
constantly
and
He
loves
those
who
keeps
themselves
pure
and
clean
.
”
(
Quran
2:22
)
.
From
this
verse
,
it
is
apparent
that
Islam
really
places
a
great
emphasis
on
cleanliness
and
those
who
would
do
as
He
say
surely
will
be
blessed
by
Allah
.
Apart
from
that
,
purity
could
ensure
one
’s
prayers
to
be
answered
.
Besides
training
animals
to
behave
well
in
distinct
environment
may
require
a
huge
effort
but
if
consistent
commitment
were
given
,
success
could
be
achieved
.
The
pet
owners
too
must
invest
their
time
in
acquiring
knowledge
on
how
to
train
their
pets
effectively
and
this
could
be
done
in
several
ways
.
For
example
,
they
could
purchase
books
on
relevant
topics
at
the
bookstore
or
according
to
Regan
(
2012
)
,
they
could
ask
for
some
advice
from
the
professionals
.
Thus
,
pet
owners
should
train
their
pets
so
that
their
pets
could
live
successfully
in
the
human
world
.

Only

</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Thirdly
,
animals
that
are
kept
must
be
animals
that
are
permissible
to
be
kept
according
to
Islamic
point
of
view
.
In
Islam
,
we
are
forbidden
to
pet
animals
like
dogs
,
foxes
and
snakes
.
This
is
because
keeping
it
would
do
us
nothing
but
only
could
bring
harm
to
us
and
there
is
no
guarantee
that
will
not
get
loose
and
harm
us
.
Apart
from
that
,
keeping
them
is
considered
as
splurging
our
money
and
something
unnecessary
and
it
is
a
waste
of
money
.
The
Scholars
of
the
Standing
Committee
for
Issuing
Fatwas
were
asked
about
the
shar‘i
ruling
on
dealing
in
or
keeping
animals
that
are
used
to
fulfil
whims
and
desires
,
including
predators
such
as
wolves
,
lions
,
foxes
and
so
on
.
Then
,
they
replied
:
It
is
not
permissible
to
sell
predators
such
as
wolves
,
lions
,
foxes
and
other
wild
animals
that
have
fangs
,
because
the
Prophet
(
blessings
and
peace
of
Allah
be
upon
him
)
forbade
that
.
And
because
it
is
a
waste
of
money
,
and
the
Prophet
(
blessings
and
peace
of
Allah
be
upon
him
)
forbade
wasting
money
.
(
Fath
al-Wahhaab
,
1/273
)
.
Moreover
,
any
other
animals
that
falls
within
this
category
such
as
pigs
are
impure
and
could
bring
along
several
diseases
such
as
cancer
.
According
to
Abu
Ishaaq
ash-Shiraazi
(
may
Allah
have
mercy
on
him
)
said
:
“
With
regard
to
pigs
,
they
are
impure
because
they
are
worse
than
dogs
,
and
because
it
is
recommended
to
kill
them
even
if
they
are
not
harmful
,
and
it
is
stated
in
the
texts
that
they
are
haraam
.
If
dogs
are
impure
,
then
pigs
are
even
more
so
.
”
In
Homotoxins
and
Homtaxicoses
,
Fundamentals
of
a
Synthesis
of
Medicine
(
1955
)
it
was
stated
that
,
“
The
mice
fed
on
pork
developed
a
marked
tendency
towards
cannibalism
.
As
they
grew
older
(
ranging
from
a
few
months
.
to
about
a
year
)
many
developed
cancer
in
various
parts
of
their
bodies
.
”
From
this
scientific
research
,
we
can
conclude
that
pigs
are
dirty
and
one
who
consumed
it
is
prone
to
suffer
from
diseases
.
Therefore
,
we
should
follow
Allah
’s
commandments
that
is
to
only
own
a
pet
that
is
permissible
in
Islam
.

In
conclusion
,
there
is
a
myriad
of
alternatives
in
the
way
to
be
a
responsible
pet
owner
from
Islamic
perspectives
.
As
stated
earlier
,
the
owners
should
treat
their
pets
kindly
,
know
how
to
train
their
pets
to
behave
well
and
also
to
pet
animals
that
is
admissible
in
Islam
.
By
following
all
of
these
alternatives
,
we
could
also
attain
Allah
’s
pleasures
and
blessings
because
according
to
the
Quran
,
“
And
those
who
believe
and
do
good
works
and
believe
in
that
which
is
revealed
to
Muhammad
,
and
it
is
the
truth
from
their
Lord
,
He
removes
from
them
their
ill-deeds
and
improves
their
state
.

Quran
47:2
)
