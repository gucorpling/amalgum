Nisyros
</ref>
</hi>
is
a
small
island
of
the
<ref target="Dodecanese">

a

<p>
Nisyros
,
with
fewer
than
1,000
permanent
inhabitants
,
is
famous
for
having
the
only
'
active
'
<hi rend="bold">
volcano
</hi>
in
Greece
together
with
Santorini
(
Thyra
)
.
The
island
is
essentially
a
volcanic
cone
with
a
large
collapsed
caldera
in
the
center
.
It
is
possible
to
walk
into
the
volcanic
crater
and
view
the
smoking
fumaroles
at
close
hand
.
</p>
<p>
There
are
two
main
villages
on
the
island
:
<hi rend="bold">
Mandraki
</hi>
in
the
north-west
(
where
the
ferries
dock
)
and
<hi rend="bold">
Nikea
</hi>
,
up
on
the
edge
of
the
volcanic
rim
to
the
south
.
</p>
<p>
During
the
summer
month
the
island
is
frequented
daily
by
hundreds
day-trip
visitors
from
Kos
that
arrive
on
multiple
boats
in
the
morning
,
visit
the
crater
,
spend
some
time
in
<hi rend="italic">
Mandraki
</hi>
and
leave
in
the
afternoon
.
Afterwards
the
island
returns
to
its
calm
and
relaxing
atmosphere
in
which
some
traditional
greek
life
can
be
enjoyed
,
therefore
it
's
worth
to
stay
for
a
night
.

By

<p>
Nisyros
is
a
popular
day-trip
destination
from
<ref target="Kos">
Kos
</ref>
island
.
During
the
summer
month
,
boats
leave
from
Kos
(
Kardameina
port
)
at
9:30
to
<hi rend="italic">
Mandraki
</hi>
and
return
at
15:30
.
Prices
for
a
one-way
boat-trip
range
from
5-8.5€
.
</p>
<p>
Nisyros
is
also
one
of
the
stops
for
ferries
that
run
between
<ref target="Piraeus">
Piraeus

(

Greek

and

<p>
Schedules
for
these
can
be
found
online
.
</p>
<p>
Sailings
are
not
to
a
regular
daily
schedule
and
become
less
frequent
in
the
winter
months
.
</p>
<p>
In
addition
,
a
fast
catamaran
service
runs
to
Rhodes
on
some
days
(
via
Tilos
)
.

<head>
Get
around
</head>
<p>
The
villages
on
the
island
are
small
enough
to
stroll
around
on
foot
.
</p>
<p>
To
travel
between
them
,
two
there
is
an
occasional
bus
service
,
the
schedule
can
be
found
on
http://www.nisyros.gr.
</p>
<p>
There
are
also
about
two
taxis
on
the
island
.
Given
that
there
’s
essentially
only
one
road
,
hitchhiking
is
also
an
easy
option
.
</p>
<p>
There
is
a
car
and
motorcycle
rental
based
on
the
main
port

<p>
Hiking
between
<hi rend="italic">
Mandraki
</hi>
and
<hi rend="italic">
Nikia
</hi>
via
the
volcanic
crater
is
a
great
day-trip
.
Beware
of
the
elevation
and
the
sun
and
pack
enough
water
.
The
island
’s
peak
can
also
be
climbed
,
apparently
one
could
sleep
there
with
a
sleeping
bag
(

</p>
<p>
There
are
multiple
hiking
paths
between
and
Mandraki
and
the
volcanic
crater
.
The
one
east
of
the
mountain
is
hard
to
find
for
the

part
until
it
hits
the
paved
street

<p>
OpenStreepMap
maps
have
good
coverage
of
the
trails

Eat
</head>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">
Mandraki
</hi>
has
many
restaurants
.
If
you
go
with
a
group
,
try
to
avoid
the
places
where
the
tour
guide
sends
you
to
eat
.
Some
tour
guides
get
a
commission
from
the
restaurants
,
which
means
it
will
be
expensive
.
Look
around
and
try
to
avoid
the
main
tourist
pathways
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">
Nikia

There
’s
very
few

On

all

Book

you
’re
arriving
late
