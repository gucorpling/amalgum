It
had
never
before
occurred
to
him
that
she
might
,
after
all
,
have
missed
the
purport
of
the
document
he
had
put
in
her
way
.
What
if
,
in
her
hurried
inspection
of
the
papers
,
she
had
passed
it
over
as
related
to
the
private
business
of
some
client
?
What
,
for
instance
,
was
to
prevent
her
concluding
that
Glennard
was
the
counsel
of
the
unknown
person
who
had
sold
the
“
Aubyn
Letters
.
”
The
subject
was
one
not
likely
to
fix
her
attention
--
she
was
not
a
curious
woman
.
</p>
<p>
Glennard
at
this
point
laid
down
his
fork
and
glanced
at
her
between
the
candle-shades
.
The
alternative
explanation
of
her
indifference
was
not
slow
in
presenting
itself
.
Her
head
had
the
same
listening
droop
as
when
he
had
caught
sight
of
her
the
day
before
in
Flamel
’s
company
;
the
attitude
revived
the
vividness
of
his
impression
.
It
was
simple
enough
,
after
all
.
She
had
ceased
to
care
for
him
because
she
cared
for
someone
else
.
</p>
<p>
As
he
followed
her
upstairs
he
felt
a
sudden
stirring
of
his
dormant
anger
.
His
sentiments
had
lost
all
their
factitious
complexity
.
He
had
already
acquitted
her
of
any
connivance
in
his
baseness
,
and
he
felt
only
that
he
loved
her
and
that
she
had
escaped
him
.
This
was
now
,
strangely
enough
,
his
dominating
thought
:
the
consciousness
that
he
and
she
had
passed
through
the
fusion
of
love
and
had
emerged
from
it
as
incommunicably
apart
as
though
the
transmutation
had
never
taken
place
.
Every
other
passion
,
he
mused
,
left
some
mark
upon
the
nature
;
but
love
passed
like
the
flight
of
a
ship
across
the
waters
.
</p>
<p>
She
sank
into
her
usual
seat
near
the
lamp
,
and
he
leaned
against
the
chimney
,
moving
about
with
an
inattentive
hand
the
knick-knacks
on
the
mantel
.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly
he
caught
sight
of
her
reflection
in
the
mirror
.
She
was
looking
at
him
.
He
turned
and
their
eyes
met
.
</p>
<p>
He
moved
across
the
room
and
stood
before
her
.
</p>
<p>
“
There
’s
something
that
I
want
to
say
to
you
,
”
he
began
in
a
low
tone
.
</p>
<p>
She
held
his
gaze
,
but
her
color
deepened
.
He
noticed
again
,
with
a
jealous
pang
,
how
her
beauty
had
gained
in
warmth
and
meaning
.
It
was
as
though
a
transparent
cup
had
been
filled
with
wine
.
He
looked
at
her
ironically
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
’ve
never
prevented
your
seeing
your
friends
here
,
”
he
broke
out
.
“
Why
do
you
meet
Flamel
in
out-of-the-way
places
?
Nothing
makes
a
woman
so
cheap
--
”
</p>
<p>
She
rose
abruptly
and
they
faced
each
other
a
few
feet
apart
.
</p>
<p>
“
What
do
you
mean
?
”
she
asked
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
saw
you
with
him
last
Sunday
on
the
Riverside
Drive
,
”
he
went
on
,
the
utterance
of
the
charge
reviving
his
anger
.
</p>
<p>
“
Ah
,
”
she
murmured
.
She
sank
into
her
chair
again
and
began
to
play
with
a
paper-knife
that
lay
on
the
table
at
her
elbow
.
</p>
<p>
Her
silence
exasperated
him
.
</p>
<p>
“
Well
?
”
he
burst
out
.
“
Is
that
all
you
have
to
say
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Do
you
wish
me
to
explain
?
”
she
asked
,
proudly
.
</p>
<p>
“
Do
you
imply
I
have
n’t
the
right
to
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
imply
nothing
.
I
will
tell
you
whatever
you
wish
to
know
.
I
went
for
a
walk
with
Mr.
Flamel
because
he
asked
me
to
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
did
n’t
suppose
you
went
uninvited
.
But
there
are
certain
things
a
sensible
woman
does
n’t
do
.
She
does
n’t
slink
about
in
out-of-the-way
streets
with
men
.
Why
could
n’t
you
have
seen
him
here
?
”
</p>
<p>
She
hesitated
.
“
Because
he
wanted
to
see
me
alone
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Did
he
,
indeed
?
And
may
I
ask
if
you
gratify
all
his
wishes
with
equal
alacrity
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
do
n’t
know
that
he
has
any
others
where
I
am
concerned
.
”
She
paused
again
and
then
continued
,
in
a
lower
voice
that
somehow
had
an
under-note
of
warning
.
“
He
wished
to
bid
me
good-by
.
He
’s
going
away
.
”
</p>
<p>
Glennard
turned
on
her
a
startled
glance
.
“
Going
away
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
He
’s
going
to
Europe
to-morrow
.
He
goes
for
a
long
time
.
I
supposed
you
knew
.
”
</p>
<p>
The
last
phrase
revived
his
irritation
.
“
You
forget
that
I
depend
on
you
for
my
information
about
Flamel
.
He
’s
your
friend
and
not
mine
.
In
fact
,
I
’ve
sometimes
wondered
at
your
going
out
of
your
way
to
be
so
civil
to
him
when
you
must
see
plainly
enough
that
I
do
n’t
like
him
.
”
</p>
<p>
Her
answer
to
this
was
not
immediate
.
She
seemed
to
be
choosing
her
words
with
care
,
not
so
much
for
her
own
sake
as
for
his
,
and
his
exasperation
was
increased
by
the
suspicion
that
she
was
trying
to
spare
him
.
</p>
<p>
“
He
was
your
friend
before
he
was
mine
.
I
never
knew
him
till
I
was
married
.
It
was
you
who
brought
him
to
the
house
and
who
seemed
to
wish
me
to
like
him
.
”
</p>
<p>
Glennard
gave
a
short
laugh
.
The
defence
was
feebler
than
he
had
expected
:
she
was
certainly
not
a
clever
woman
.
</p>
<p>
“
Your
deference
to
my
wishes
is
really
beautiful
;
but
it
’s
not
the
first
time
in
history
that
a
man
has
made
a
mistake
in
introducing
his
friends
to
his
wife
.
You
must
,
at
any
rate
,
have
seen
since
then
that
my
enthusiasm
had
cooled
;
but
so
,
perhaps
,
has
your
eagerness
to
oblige
me
.
”
</p>
<p>
She
met
this
with
a
silence
that
seemed
to
rob
the
taunt
of
half
its
efficacy
.
</p>
<p>
“
Is
that
what
you
imply
?
”
he
pressed
her
.
</p>
<p>
“
No
,
”
she
answered
with
sudden
directness
.
“
I
noticed
some
time
ago
that
you
seemed
to
dislike
him
,
but
since
then
--
