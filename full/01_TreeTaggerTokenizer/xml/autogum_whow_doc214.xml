inevitable
family
dinner
conversations

Who
knows
,
you
might
end
up
next
to
your
great-aunt
Kate
who
blabs
on
and
on
about
her
cats
or
next
to
cousin
Joey
who
rightfully
earned
his
title
of
prank
king
.
Read
this
article
to
have
an
easier
time

Consider
whether
there
is
some
rivalry
in
the
family
.
Or
,
do
some
people
just
not
fit
together
?
If
that
is
the
case
,
make
sure
they
sit
on
opposite
sides
of
the
table
!

turn
out
to
be
dangerous

Have
a
corner
for
children

It
's
very
annoying
when
little
kids
bug
you

the
whole
dinner
,

make
sure
that
they
have
toys
to
play
with
and
other
kids
to
scream
with
.

Fake
a
call
.
You
can
say
that
your
friend
is
in
a
homework
crisis
,
or
be
even
less
confidential
and
simply
say
it
's
important
.

Say
you
want
to
check
on
your
3-year-old
cousin
,
or
in
certain
cases
,
your
son
.
Kids
are
a
great
diversion
from
family
dinners
,
because
they
need
so
much
care
and
attention
.
Watch
out
though
,
you
might
find
yourself
spending
the
rest
of
the
night
with
little
Johnny
!

Use
the
restrooms
.
If
you
desperately
need
to
go
to
the
bathroom
,
nobody
could
force
you
to
stay
.
Just
make
sure
you
do
n't
stay
away
for
too
long
.

not
)
