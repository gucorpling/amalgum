system
lines
,
both
operated
by
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMRT%20Corporation">
SMRT
Corporation
</ref>
,
were
disrupted
at
separate
times
yesterday
in
two
incidents
.
</p>
<p>
During
the
morning
rush
hour
,
six
stations
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle%20MRT%20Line">
Circle
MRT
Line
</ref>
(
CCL
)
were
without
train
service
in
both
directions
during
the
morning
rush
hour
following
what
SMRT
described
as
&quot;
intermittent
signal
interference
&quot;
.
The
company
first
announced
the
signalling
fault
on
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Twitter">
Twitter
</ref>
at
7:37
am
,
advising
commuters
to
anticipate
10
additional
minutes
of
travel
time
in
the
commute
between
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasir%20Panjang%20MRT%20Station">
Pasir
Panjang
</ref>
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/one-north%20MRT%20Station">

</ref>
stations
.
The
fault
was
announced
rectified
two
minutes
later
by
another
tweet
from
SMRT
,
though
delays
were
still
expected
in
the
direction
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhoby%20Ghaut%20MRT%20Station">
Dhoby

station
due
to
congestion
at

and

<p>
SMRT
issued
another
tweet
at
8:09
am
,
alerting
commuters
to
another
signalling
fault
affecting
the
CCL
,
on
the
stretch
between
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botanic%20Gardens%20MRT%20Station">
Botanic
Gardens
</ref>
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HarbourFront%20MRT%20Station">
HarbourFront
</ref>
stations
.
</p>
<p>
Initially
informing
commuters
that
the
issue
would
add
10
minutes
of
travel
time
along
the
affected
stretch
,
the
company
later
revised
this
to
20
,
and
finally
,
30
minutes
in
subsequent
tweets
,
attributing
the
delays
to
&quot;
intermittent
signalling
faults
&quot;
.
</p>
<p>
The
company
later
announced
via
Twitter
service
unavailable
between
Botanic
Gardens
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marymount%20MRT%20station">
Marymount
</ref>
stations
at
9:06
am
,
whilst
offering
free
bus
services
along
the
length
of
the
CCL
.
SMRT
later
amended
the
announcement
in
another
tweet
to
encompass
the
stretch
between
Botanic
Gardens
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serangoon%20MRT%20Station">
Serangoon
</ref>
stations
.
Train
service
was
restored
along
the
affected
stretch
by
about
10:27
am
.
</p>
<p>
SMRT
had
previously
experienced
disruptions
in
service
on
the
CCL
for
five
consecutive
days
in
September
,
also
attributable
to
signalling
issues
,
leading
to
authorities
briefly
switching
off
mobile
signals
at
four
CCL
stations
for
two
hours
on
September
2
during
investigations
.
Most
of
the
disruptions
took
place
during
peak
hours
,
leading
to
suspicion
the
telecommunications
network
could
be
interfering
with
the
train
signalling
system
.
After
tests
proved
inconclusive
following
the
lack
of
a
disruption
that
day
,
the
decision
was
made
to
turn
off
telecommunications
signals
in
the
event
of
another
disruption
.
</p>
<p>
â€œ
It
's
very
frustrating
&quot;
,
commented
a
commuter
,
41-year-old
Joseph
Lim
.
&quot;
The
trains
are
sometimes
moving
and
sometimes
getting
stuck
.
I
do
n't
know
whether
to
stay
on
board
.
The
communication
has
been
insufficient
&quot;
.
</p>
<p>
Another
commuter
,
29-year-old
Alice
Pan
,
stated
,
&quot;
I
am
now
stuck
at
the
station
with
no
way
to
get
to
work
.
I
ca
n't
get
on
any
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SBS%20Transit">
SBS
</ref>
buses
because
they
are
full
and
there
's
no
free
shuttle
bus
in
sight
.
I
ca
n't
get
any
cabs
either
&quot;
.
Pan
was
stranded
in
a
train
for
an
hour
at
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorong%20Chuan">
Lorong
Chuan
</ref>
station
.
</p>
<p>
36-year-old
Sean
Chew
,
said
of
his
experience
during
the
incident
,
&quot;
I
was
stuck
at
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buona%20Vista%20MRT%20Station">
Buona
Vista
</ref>
for
more
than
one
hour
.
I
did
n't
want
to
take
the
bus
because
it
was
very
crowded
.
So
no
choice
,
had
to
wait
[
...
]
Luckily
I
just
finished
work
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
However
,
following
the
morning
incidents
,
a
stalled
train
on
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East%20West%20MRT%20Line">
East
West
MRT
Line
</ref>
led
to
a
half-hour
disruption
during
the
evening
peak
hour
on
the
same
day
.
SMRT
informed
commuters
of
the
disruption
,
between
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queenstown%20MRT%20Station">
Queenstown
</ref>
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outram%20Park%20MRT%20Station">
Outram
Park
</ref>
stations
in
the
direction
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasir%20Ris%20MRT%20Station">
Pasir
Ris
</ref>
station
,
on
Twitter
at
5:48
pm
,
attributing
it
to
a
&quot;
train
fault
&quot;
at
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiong%20Bahru%20MRT%20Station">
Tiong
Bahru
</ref>
station
.
In
the
same
tweet
,
SMRT
estimated
that
the
issue
would
be
resolved
around
6:10
pm
.
Due
to
the
disruption
,
the
company
offered
free
bus
services
along
the
affected
stretch
in
a
subsequent
tweet
.
</p>
<p>
At
6:20
pm
,
SMRT
announced
on
Twitter
that
it
had
cleared
the
disruption
by
removing
the
stalled
train
,
and
that
trains
were
&quot;
progressively
return[ing
]
to
normal
speed
&quot;
.
The
company
continued
to
offer
free
bus
services
until
7
pm
,
when
it
announced
the
termination
of
the
service
on
Twitter
.
</p>
<p>
In
the
wake
of
yesterday
's
incidents
,
commuters
criticized
SMRT
's
handling
of
the
matter
on
social
media
,
citing
SMRT
's
failure
to
provide
sufficient
information
or
sufficient
buses
for
commuters
,
and
uploading
photos
of
the
congestion
.
