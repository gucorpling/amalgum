Methodology
</head>
<p>
In
view
of
the
above
literature
review
,
this
paper
aims
at
establishing
a
set
of
sustainable
performance
evaluation
indexes
considering
social
well-being
,
environmental
protection
,
and
financial
earnings
,
along
with
a
set
of
feasible
evaluation
methods
to
ensure
that
reasonable
performance
evaluation
can
be
realized
within
a
project
.
Firstly
,
the
comprehensive
evaluation
index
system
of
SCPM
is
constructed
.
In
the
index
system
,
the
greenization
and
informatization
are
not
considered
in
isolation
,
but
their
impact
on
traditional
project
management
performance
measures
,
such
as
finances
and
safety
,
is
also
reflected
.
Secondly
,
the
ratings
for
the
evaluation
index
that
is
modeled
by
the
iG1
,
are
given
in
linguistic
terms
.
Given
different
kinds
of
professional
knowledge
and
work
experience
,
the
evaluators
’
understanding
of
the
evaluation
index
and
the
enterprises
may
be
different
.
Thus
,
in
aggregating
linguistic
ratings
,
the
amount
of
calculation
is
small
so
as
to
reduce
errors
.
Thirdly
,
the
feasibility
and
practical
application
of
the
proposed
approach
is
verified
using
a
case
study
of
the
Guangzhou
Metro
Line
7
(
GML7
)
.
It
also
provides
a
valuable
reference
for
the
implementation
of
the
evaluation
of
SCPM
for
other
construction
enterprises
.

The
Dimension
of
the
Index
System
</head>
<p>
An
important
step
in
establishing
a
comprehensive
performance
evaluation
system
for
SCPM
is
to
identify
key
aspects
.
It
is
impossible
to
analyze
all
aspects
of
SCPM
.
Such
an
attempt
might
not
only
confuse
the
experts
of
interactive
information
but
also
lead
to
an
inefficient
evaluation
process
.
The
indicators
of
this
research
are
mainly
established
through
three
channels
:
Literature
review
,
enterprise
database
analysis
,
and
the
future
development
trend
analysis
of
the
construction
industry
.
The
framework
of
the
performance
evaluation
index
system
establishment
is
shown
in
<figure>
Figure

</figure>
.
The
first
step
is
the
selection
of
the
dimension
of
the
evaluation
index
system
.
The
traditional
dimension
of
management
performance
includes
financial
,
safety
,
schedule
,
and
quality
.
Others
,
the
frontier
dimension
includes
two
aspects
,
which
are
informatization
and
greenization
.
The
second
step
is
classification
and
filtering
the
secondary
indicator
based
on
literature
review
and
construction
enterprise
management
database
.
</p>
<p>
The
“
knowledge
area
”
proposed
by
PMI
has
been
used
in
traditional
CPM
performance
research
studies
.
Various
studies
have
focused
on
reducing
the
integration
management
,
construction
cost
,
and
schedule
control
.
Demirkesen
and
Ozorhon
contributed
to
the
project
management
body
of
knowledge
in
that
it
develops
a
conceptual
framework
consisting
of
specific
components
for
integration
CPM
,
whereas
the
dimensions
of
project
management
performance
are
time
,
cost
,
quality
,
safety
,
and
client
satisfaction
.
Tan
and
Xiong
sorted
out
50
domestic
theses
related
to
performance
evaluation
in
China
and
finally
listed
the
high-frequency
performance
indicators
which
were
divided
into
different
hierarchical
structures
.
In
their
review
,
the
most
frequent
indicators
focus
on
financial
,
quality
and
time
management
.
The
performance
evaluation
indicators
of
large-scale
engineering
projects
were
divided
into
five
categories
:
Human
,
material
,
machine
,
method
,
and
environment
.
In
this
study
,
we
chose
the
four
most
representative
dimensions
,
which
are
finance
,
safety
,
schedule
,
quality
,
as
the
dimensions
of
the
performance
index
system
for
SCPM
.
</p>
<p>
In
addition
to
the
four
dimensions
of
project
management
mentioned
above
,
the
SCPM
performance
should
take
the
sustainable
development
of
enterprises
into
account
and
encourage
the
application
of
cutting-edge
technologies
to
adapt
to
the
future
development
of
the
industry
.
Therefore
,
based
on
the
traditional
view
and
the
perspective
of
future
development
,
the
final
sustainable
performance
index
system
should
consist
of
the
six
dimensions
:
Finance
,
safety
,
schedule
,
quality
,
informatization
,
and
greenization
management
.

The
Secondary
Indicators
of
the
Index
System
</head>
<p>
The
database
established
by
this
enterprise
includes
two
parts
:
historical
projects
and
actual
needs
of
the
Sichuan
Huashi
construction
enterprise
group
(
Huashi
Group
)
,
which
contains
18
sub-construction
companies
at
home
and
abroad
.
The
Huashi
Group
ranks
18th
among
China
’s
top
60
contractors
in
ENR
,
with
annual
revenue
from
its
main
business
exceeds
12.7
billion
yuan
,
and
stands
for
the
overall
development
level
of
the
construction
industry
.
</p>
<p>
The
secondary
indicators
are
filtered
and
classificated
from
the
Huashi
Group
management
database
and
literature
review
.
This
research
looks
for
the
39
secondary
indicators
of
the
six
dimensions
,
<figure>
Figure

shows
the
final
index
system
for
the
comprehensive
performance
evaluation
of
the
SCPM
,
and
then
,
the
secondary
indicators
are
described
in
the
next
chapter
.

Indicators
for
Financial
Management
</head>
<p>
A
company
attaches
much
significance
to
financial
management
,
which
determines
how
much
benefit
the
construction
enterprise
can
get
from
a
project
.
According
to
the
enterprise
database
,
the
financial
management
contains
three
aspects
,
which
are
overall
financial
position
,
construction
costs
and
financial
management
plans
of
the
project
.
The
overall
financial
situation
of
the
project
is
measured
by
FM1
(
project
profit
ratio
)
,
FM2
(
unit
profit
)
and
FM3
(
per
capita
profit
)
.
FM4
(
project
cost-saving
)
,
FM5
(
success
of
project
claims
)
and
FM6
(
project
payment
default
)
during
the
project
construction
stage
are
used
to
measure
the
funds
and
cost
management
ability
.
Beyond
that
,
FM7
(
the
financial
management
plan
)
is
crucial
to
the
success
of
the
project
.
