The
thousand
injuries
of
Fortunato
I
had
borne
as
I
best
could
,
but
when
he
ventured
upon
insult
,
I
vowed
revenge
.
You
,
who
so
well
know
the
nature
of
my
soul
,
will
not
suppose
,
however
,
that
I
gave
utterance
to
a
threat
.
<hi rend="italic">
At
length
</hi>
I
would
be
avenged
;
this
was
a
point
definitely
settled
--
but
the
very
definitiveness
with
which
it
was
resolved
,
precluded
the
idea
of
risk
.
I
must
not
only
punish
,
but
punish
with
impunity
.
A
wrong
is
unredressed
when
retribution
overtakes
its
redresser
.
It
is
equally
unredressed
when
the
avenger
fails
to
make
himself
felt
as
such
to
him
who
has
done
the
wrong
.
</p>
<p>
It
must
be
understood
that
neither
by
word
nor
deed
had
I
given
Fortunato
cause
to
doubt
my
good
will
.
I
continued
,
as
was
my
wont
,
to
smile
in
his
face
,
and
he
did
not
perceive
that
my
smile
<hi rend="italic">
now
</hi>
was
at
the
thought
of
his
immolation
.
</p>
<p>
He
had
a
weak
point
--
this
Fortunato
--
although
in
other
regards
he
was
a
man
to
be
respected
and
even
feared
.
He
prided
himself
on
his
connoisseurship
in
wine
.
Few
Italians
have
the
true
virtuoso
spirit
.
For
the
most
part
their
enthusiasm
is
adopted
to
suit
the
time
and
opportunity
--
to
practise
imposture
upon
the
British
and
Austrian
<hi rend="italic">
millionaires
</hi>
.
In
painting
and
gemmary
,
Fortunato
,
like
his
countrymen
,
was
a
quack
--
but
in
the
matter
of
old
wines
he
was
sincere
.
In
this
respect
I
did
not
differ
from
him
materially
:
I
was
skillful
in
the
Italian
vintages
myself
,
and
bought
largely
whenever
I
could
.
</p>
<p>
It
was
about
dusk
,
one
evening
during
the
supreme
madness
of
the
carnival
season
,
that
I
encountered
my
friend
.
He
accosted
me
with
excessive
warmth
,
for
he
had
been
drinking
much
.
The
man
wore
motley
.
He
had
on
a
tight-fitting
parti-striped
dress
,
and
his
head
was
surmounted
by
the
conical
cap
and
bells
.
I
was
so
pleased
to
see
him
,
that
I
thought
I
should
never
have
done
wringing
his
hand
.
</p>
<p>
I
said
to
him
--
&quot;My
dear
Fortunato
,
you
are
luckily
met
.
How
remarkably
well
you
are
looking
to-day
!
But
I
have
received
a
pipe
of
what
passes
for
Amontillado
,
and
I
have
my
doubts
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
How
?
&quot;
said
he
.
&quot;
Amontillado
?
A
pipe
?
Impossible
!
And
in
the
middle
of
the
carnival
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
have
my
doubts
,
&quot;
I
replied
;
&quot;
and
I
was
silly
enough
to
pay
the
full
Amontillado
price
without
consulting
you
in
the
matter
.
You
were
not
to
be
found
,
and
I
was
fearful
of
losing
a
bargain
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Amontillado
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
have
my
doubts
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Amontillado
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
And
I
must
satisfy
them
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Amontillado
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
As
you
are
engaged
,
I
am
on
my
way
to
Luchesi
.
If
any
one
has
a
critical
turn
,
it
is
he
.
He
will
tell
me
--
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Luchesi
cannot
tell
Amontillado
from
Sherry
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
And
yet
some
fools
will
have
it
that
his
taste
is
a
match
for
your
own
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Come
,
let
us
go
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Whither
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
To
your
vaults
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
My
friend
,
no
;
I
will
not
impose
upon
your
good
nature
.
I
perceive
you
have
an
engagement
.
Luchesi
--
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
have
no
engagement
;
--
come
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
My
friend
,
no
.
It
is
not
the
engagement
,
but
the
severe
cold
with
which
I
perceive
you
are
afflicted
.
The
vaults
are
insufferably
damp
.
They
are
encrusted
with
nitre
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Let
us
go
,
nevertheless
.
The
cold
is
merely
nothing
.
Amontillado
!
You
have
been
imposed
upon
.
And
as
for
Luchesi
,
he
cannot
distinguish
Sherry
from
Amontillado
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Thus
speaking
,
Fortunato
possessed
himself
of
my
arm
.
Putting
on
a
mask
of
black
silk
,
and
drawing
a
<hi rend="italic">
roquelaire
</hi>
closely
about
my
person
,
I
suffered
him
to
hurry
me
to
my
palazzo
.
</p>
<p>
There
were
no
attendants
at
home
;
they
had
absconded
to
make
merry
in
honour
of
the
time
.
I
had
told
them
that
I
should
not
return
until
the
morning
,
and
had
given
them
explicit
orders
not
to
stir
from
the
house
.
These
orders
were
sufficient
,
I
well
knew
,
to
insure
their
immediate
disappearance
,
one
and
all
,
as
soon
as
my
back
was
turned
.
</p>
<p>
I
took
from
their
sconces
two
flambeaux
,
and
giving
one
to
Fortunato
,
bowed
him
through
several
suites
of
rooms
to
the
archway
that
led
into
the
vaults
.
I
passed
down
a
long
and
winding
staircase
,
requesting
him
to
be
cautious
as
he
followed
.
We
came
at
length
to
the
foot
of
the
descent
,
and
stood
together
on
the
damp
ground
of
the
catacombs
of
the
Montresors
.
</p>
<p>
The
gait
of
my
friend
was
unsteady
,
and
the
bells
upon
his
cap
jingled
as
he
strode
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
The
pipe
,
&quot;
said
he
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
It
is
farther
on
,
&quot;
said
I
;
&quot;
but
observe
the
white
web-work
which
gleams
from
these
cavern
walls
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
He
turned
towards
me
,
and
looked
into
my
eyes
with
two
filmy
orbs
that
distilled
the
rheum
of
intoxication
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Nitre
?
&quot;
he
asked
,
at
length
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Nitre
,
&quot;
I
replied
.
&quot;
How
long
have
you
had
that
cough
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Ugh
!
ugh
!
ugh
!
--
ugh
!
ugh
!
ugh
!
--
ugh
!
ugh
!
ugh
!
--
ugh
!
ugh
!
ugh
!
--
ugh
!
ugh
!
ugh
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
My
poor
friend
found
it
impossible
to
reply
for
many
minutes
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
It
is
nothing
,
&quot;
he
said
,
at
last
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Come
,
&quot;
I
said
,
with
decision
,
&quot;
we
will
go
back
;
your
health
is
precious
.
You
are
rich
,
respected
,
admired
,
beloved
;
you
are
happy
,
as
once
I
was
.
You
are
a
man
to
be
missed
.
For
me
it
is
no
matter
.
We
will
go
back
;
you
will
be
ill
,
and
I
cannot
be
responsible
.
Besides
,
there
is
Luchesi
--
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Enough
,
&quot;
he
said
;
&quot;
the
cough
is
a
mere
nothing
;
it
will
not
kill
me
.
I
shall
not
die
of
a
cough
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
True
--
true
,
&quot;
I
replied
;
&quot;
and
,
indeed
,
I
had
no
intention
of
alarming
you
unnecessarily
--
but
you
should
use
all
proper
caution
.
A
draught
of
this
Medoc
will
defend
us
from
the
damps
.
