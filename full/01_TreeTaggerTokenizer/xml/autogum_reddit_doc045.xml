The
Players
:
\~$Me
-
Pretty
obvious
,
it
's
me
.
\~$Site
-
A
website
,
database
,
hosting
,
and
associated
services
all
wrapped
into
one
.
\~$OldTech
-
The
previous
owner
and
tech
of
the
site
,
who
ran
the
whole
thing
.
\~$NO
-
New
Owners
of
the
site
,
trying
to
rebuild
.
Eager
and
Clueless
.
Who
am
I
?
:
I
'm
me
,
obviously
,
I
do
freelance
(
And
usually
unpaid
)
basic
IT
work
for
my
friends
and
acquaintances
.
Think
,
Virus
removal
,
basic
program
issues
,
speeding
up
and
bare-level
maintenance
on
machines
.
I
was
a
user
of
$Site
,
and
at
the
time
had
no
experience
with
SQL
,
PHP
,
or
the
like
...
all
of
which
will
come
into
play
.
Background
:
$OldTech
has
\[THING\
]
requiring
he
drops
out
of
$Site
fully
,
leaving
the
site
and
server
(
full
access
,
dedicated
host
)
in
the
hands
of
$NO
.
Chaos
Ensues
.
The
Story
:
So
this
was
a
while
ago
,
but
I
'm
new
around
here
so
I
'll
do
my
best
to
recall
it
all
as
faithfully
as
I
can
.
$OldTech
has
sudden
events
in
their
life
,
leaving
them
out
of
the
loop
fully
on
$Site
.
Until
this
point
in
time
,
the
site
's
been
buggy
as
hell
,
with
errors
everywhere
.
$OldTech
had
been
trying
to
work
on
finding
the
source
,
but
everything
he
did
was
causing
more
errors
.
However
,
due
to
his
other
events
in
his
life
,
he
has
to
leave
.
No
contact
whatsoever-
and
leaving
$NO
in
charge
.
$NO
consists
of
a
two-person
team
,
both
with
absolutely
no
experience
in
the
matter
and
both
very
,
very
confident
in
their
abilities
,
who
are
raring
to
go
.
So
go
team
,
go
enthusiasm
.
They
do
PR
well
,
explaining
what
they
can
about
$OldTech
departing
the
site
,
and
about
them
doing
the
best
they
can
to
pick
up
where
he
left
off
.
Unfortunately
,
one
of
the
more
major
issues
flares
up
(
Issue
with
how
PHP
is
sending
information
to
the
database
,
caused
by
out
of
date
software
and
an
utter
refusal
to
update
)
and
the
site
crashes
.
More
appropriately
,
the
database
just
stops
responding
to
queries
due
to
some
load
limit
that
$OldTech
setup
,
and
so
users
are
greeted
with
a
blank
white
page
,
no
data
or
error
code
or
anything
.
$NO
,
being
the
clueless
but
enthusiastic
pair
that
they
are
,
dive
into
the
back
of
the
server
.
They
're
able
to
get
into
the
web
dashboard
,
a
glorified
CPanel-esque
solution
,
and
look
through
.
To
their
credit
,
they
found
the
PHP
error
log
and
diagnosed
the
issue
as
something
with
the
database
.
As
the
hosting
solution
in
play
at
the
time
was
an
unmanaged
host
,
they
do
n't
pull
in
any
professional
techs
or
seek
help
from
the
userbase
.
They
want
to
keep
the
impression
they
have
things
under
control
,
and
so
do
n't
let
on
to
us
they
really
have
\*no
idea\*
what
is
going
on
.
This
leads
to
a
conversation
I
can
only
assume
went
something
like
this
between
$NO
1
and
2
:
\&gt;$NO1
,
over
Skype
:
OK
,
so
it
looks
like
we
have
to
restart
the
database
or
something
.
Is
there
a
button
that
says
'
Restart
'
?
\&gt;$NO2
,
looking
at
the
web
dashboard
:
Uhhhhhh
...
.
yeah
.
Something
like
that
.
\*Click\*
\&gt;$NO1
:
In
the
database
section
,
right
?
\&gt;$NO2
:
Oops
...
In
the
span
of
a
few
moments
,
from
what
it
sounds
like
,
Restart
sounded
a
lot
like
Reset
.
As
in
,
Format
.
With
the
push
of
one
button
,
$NO
had
ordered
the
server
to
be
wiped
,
including
web
files
,
databases
,
the
Cpanel
,
and
all
other
data
pertaining
to
$Site
.
Gone
.
No
backups
,
nothing
.
I
later
come
to
find
out
$OldTech
had
n't
taken
any
backups
for
over
two
years
and
had
just
been
running
one
live
copy
.
I
know
,
Cringe
.
So
$NO
almost
immediately
realizes
what
they
just
did
,
and
look
in
vain
for
a
way
to
fix
it
,
including
contacting
the
hosts
directly
.
Alas
,
unmanaged
means
unmanaged
,
and
their
response
was
along
the
lines
of
&quot;
Sucks
to
be
you
&quot;
,
but
of
course
I
'm
paraphrasing
here
.
This
is
where
$NO1
decides
it
's
time
to
bring
in
extra
help-
consisting
of
me
.
Somehow
they
knew
I
did
a
little
tech
support
,
and
give
me
a
call
.
They
're
calling
from
MST
and
I
'm
in
EST
,
so
this
call
is
rather
early
in
my
morning
.
I
then
get
what
is
so
far
one
of
the
longest
phone
calls
of
my
life
,
as
they
fill
me
in
on
what
monster
they
have
just
created
and
finish
with
something
to
the
effect
of
&quot;
help
plz
&quot;
.
Having
nothing
better
to
do
in
the
near
future
,
I
agree
to
help
them
and
ask
for
any
information
they
have
.
I
get
the
following
:
One
Email
address
,
no
password
One
Web
Host
account
,
with
password
One
Domain
Management
account
,
with
password
Paypal
account
out
of
which
to
pay
for
whatever
we
need
The
first
thing
I
do
is
note
that
the
password
for
the
web
host
and
the
domain
is
the
same
.
I
try
it
on
the
email
account
and
thank
my
lucky
stars
that
the
password
policies
were
so
bad
.
It
's
the
same
password
,
and
I
get
in
.
However
,
this
just
begins
what
takes
up
my
next
week
.
I
take
inventory
of
what
I
have
,
and
the
tasks
I
have
to
complete
.
1
)
Find
out
how
the
site
\*had\*
been
hosted
up
until
the
moment
of
deletion
,
including
software
,
database
type
,
and
requirements
2
)
Collect
any
assets
I
can
find
on
the
web
-
Images
,
text
,
webpage
files
...
you
get
the
idea
.
Wayback
machine
becomes
my
friend
,
and
I
set
$NO2
on
the
case
,
with
very
clear
instructions
.
Success
is
moderate
because
about
a
year
earlier
$OldTech
had
banned
all
bots
from
the
server
,
including
the
Wayback
Machine
's
bots
,
meaning
no
archive
exists
of
recent
data
.
I
am
peeved
.
3
)
Begin
to
figure
out
for
me
WTH
any
of
this
stuff
is
.
I
've
never
seen
anything
like
this
before
,
and
yet
of
the
site
users
,
I
'm
the
most
tech-savvy
.
I
inform
$NO
's
about
this
,
but
they
tell
me
to
go
ahead-
It
's
not
like
I
can
screw
it
up
worse
.
So
I
spend
my
day
finding
out
all
I
need
to
know
about
web
hosting
and
the
software
required
.
I
also
figure
out
that
we
were
paying
for
a
lot
more
than
we
needed-
a
whole
dedicated
server
might
have
been
needed
back
when
$Site
was
founded
around
the
mid-00
's
,
but
nowadays
we
could
downsize
significantly
.
I
'm
also
not
ashamed
to
admit
I
asked
some
pretty
dumb
questions
on
the
internet
,
trying
to
figure
out
this
stuff
.
By
the
next
morning
,
I
am
able
to
figure
out
the
software
that
was
the
forum
host
,
Language
(
PHP
)
,
Database
type
(
SQL
)
,
and
minimum
server
requirements
.
I
also
find
out
,
unfortunately
,
that
without
a
proper
SQL
backup
everything
on
the
forum
is
lost
and
it
'd
be
impossible
to
recover
.
They
tell
me
they
'll
see
what
they
can
do
and
I
head
to
bed
.
Cue
next
morning
.
I
log
on
and
look
at
the
chat
log
.
They
'd
pulled
some
strings
,
and
gotten
in
contact
with
a
guy
who
knew
$OldTech
's
sister
,
and
through
some
arcane
arts
managed
to
acquire
the
last
backup
taken
by
$OldTech
before
his
departure
.
I
'm
super
psyched
,
and
take
a
look
at
the
file
they
send
,
after
uploading
it
through
Skype
's
horrible
file
transfer
system
.
I
then
look
at
the
filing
date
and
die
a
little
on
the
inside
.
XX/XX/2014
.
We
've
lost
two
years
of
data
,
from
the
time
this
database
backup
was
taken
,
but
according
to
$OldTech
's
sister
,
she
'd
talked
to
$OldTech
and
he
'd
not
updated
since
then
,
because
apparently
&quot;
The
Updates
Broke
Things
&quot;
.
Also
included
is
the
critical
assets-
logos
,
landing
pages
,
etc.
I
ditch
a
lot
of
the
junk
data
in
the
files
,
such
as
images
and
assets
not
used
in
approximately
forever
,
and
upload
the
database
,
'
hook
it
up
'
so
to
speak
and
finally
get
into
the
site
,
thank
you
StackOverflow
.
It
's
all
working
,
albeit
with
a
bunch
of
errors
,
a
few
thousand
filling
in
a
minute
.
So
,
I
begin
to
take
it
logically
.
I
start
by
uninstalling
every
single
modification
on
the
server
and
restoring
it
to
the
'
core
'
version
of
the
forum
software
.
I
also
drop
about
a
half-dozen
tables
from
the
database
,
of
information
that
is
no
longer
used
and
should
have
been
trashed
a
very
long
time
ago
when
older
mods
were
removed
.
I
then
make
it
a
point
to
look
at
the
version
of
the
software
the
database
was
running
on
and
that
I
have
it
running
on
.
We
'll
call
the
current
updated
version
X.14
and
the
version
we
were
running
...
X.8
.
I
dutifully
inform
$NO
's
about
the
status
of
what
we
have
,
and
recommend
to
them
that
we
try
to
update
things
now
that
older
modifications
have
been
removed
.
They
greenlight
the
plan
,
and
I
begin
to
try
and
update
.
The
update
goes
through
fine
,
and
I
do
n't
bother
to
ask
why
.
I
then
begin
to
re-add
some
of
the
modifications
that
let
the
site
be
how
people
like
it
.
A
lot
of
the
modifications
are
out
of
date
,
so
I
chalk
up
all
the
errors
to
a
sheer
lack
of
maintenance
and
phobia
of
general
maintenance
.
Long
story
short
,
around
five
hours
later
I
've
implemented
what
I
've
figured
to
be
a
reasonable
conclusion
.
$Site
has
been
restored
on
a
new
host
,
with
a
\*religious\*
backup
scheme
,
which
I
perform
every
week
and
distribute
to
the
now-three
person
$NO
team
.
I
also
have
set
up
different
passwords
across
the
Email
,
Money
,
Domain
,
and
Host
accounts
and
require
$NO
's
to
change
them
every
two
months
.
Updates
are
also
required
,
and
new
data
integrity
procedures
were
put
in
place
.
While
we
lost
two
years
of
data
,
the
group
has
recovered
remarkably
well
,
and
somehow
they
decided
to
keep
me
on
as
the
head
tech
,
despite
as
aforementioned
not
having
known
the
first
thing
about
the
responsibility
I
had
just
inherited
.
So
that
's
the
story
of
how
I
got
started
in
working
IT
for
people
...
and
somehow
took
over
a
small
web
community
's
tech
support
in
the
process
.
