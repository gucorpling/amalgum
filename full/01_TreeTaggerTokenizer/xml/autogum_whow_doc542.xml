Adopt
a
Pet
if
You
're
a
Senior
</head>
<p>
As
a
senior
it
can
be
hard
to
get
out
and
about
,
so
a
nice
companion
in
the
home
is
a
good
opportunity
for
company
and
a
source
of
happiness
.

Decide
which
pet
is
best
for
you
.
If
you
have
limited
mobility
it
is
probably
best
to
go
for
a
low
maintenance
pet
that
wo
n't
require
regular
physical
exercise
and
constant
clean
up
.
A
cat
,
a
hamster
,
or
a
bird
may
be
a
good
choice
if
you
want
a
pet
you
can
physically
interact
with
.
However
,
aquarium
pets
can
bring
much
joy
and
are
very
easy
to
maintain
.
If
you
are
n't
a
fish
person
,
many
aquarium
hobbyists
are
fascinated
with
colorful
species
of
dwarf
shrimp
,
dwarf
frogs
,
and
if
your
budget
is
n't
tight
,
jellyfish
are
currently
being
domesticated
.

Research
your
decided
pet
.
Obviously
you
will
have
already
done
some
of
this
to
make
the
decision
,
but
in-depth
knowledge
on
the
specifics
will
be
needed
in
order
to
have
a
successful
relationship
between
you
and
your
pets
.
Knowing
things
such
as
diseases
the
species
and/or
breed
is
prone
to
,
the
amount
of
space
needed
,
and
special
care
or
treatment
commonly
needed
in
old
age
.
Other
details
such
as
portion
amounts
,
what
might
annoy
your
pet
,
and
what
pleases
them
will
also
be
useful
in
growing
the
bond
between
you
and
your
new
friend
.

Make
sure
the
requirements
of
the
pet
fit
your
lifestyle
.
Never
cut
corners
with
an
animal
.
Check
that
if
you
live
in
an
apartment
complex
that
the
needs
of
your
pet
comply
with
the
standards
set
by
the
landlord
.
Also
,
make
sure
the
services
and
care
you
can
provide
meet
(
better
yet
,
exceed
)
the
requirements
of
your
pet
.

Prepare
for
the
arrival
of
your
new
friend
.
Purchase
all
needed
materials
and
assemble
them
before
you
purchase
your
new
pet
.
This
will
make
the
transition
from
the
pet
store
to
their
forever
home
much
less
stressful
,
for
both
the
pet
and
yourself
.

For
cats
and
dogs
,
make
sure
that
you
are
purchasing
from
a
healthy
pet
from
a
reputable
breeder
.
An
independent
breeder
is
your
best
bet
since
you
can
in
most
cases
see
the
parents
and
the
conditions
they
have
been
living
in
.
If
you
do
go
to
a
pet
store
to
purchase
the
animal
,
ask
lots
of
questions
and
talk
to
someone
informed
.
Pick
the
best
available
animal
:
one
that
looks
healthy
with
a
friendly
demeanor
.

Make
sure
if
they
are
contained
,
their
container
will
not
fall
over
on
the
way
home
.
If
they
are
to
be
let
roam
around
(
which
is
not
advised
)
make
sure
they
are
in
an
area
where
they
will
not
disrupt
your
driving
.

Take
caution
around
them
for
the
first
couple
weeks
.
Make
sure
they
are
comfortable
and
do
n't
show
signs
of
stress
or
disease
.
If
they
do
,
be
sure
to
call
the
solicitor
and
let
them
know
.

If
you
find
yourself
incapable
of
physically
going
out
to
purchase
the
supplies
and
pet
,
most
pet
stores
will
happily
ship
the
supplies
to
your
step
.
In
the
matter
of
purchasing
the
actual
pet
,
shipping
would
not
be
in
the
pets
best
interest
.
However
,
employing
a
neighbor
or
youth
would
be
perfectly
fine
.
The
Internet
these
days
lets
you
preview
the
stock
of
mammals
in
most
pet
stores
.
If
you
are
going
for
reptilian
or
aquatic
,
just
inform
the
person
picking
them
up
of
what
to
look
for
and
if
you
have
specific
color
preferences
.
