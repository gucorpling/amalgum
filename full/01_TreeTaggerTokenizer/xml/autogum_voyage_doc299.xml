The
Eastern
Cape
province
includes
the
former
&quot;
homelands
&quot;
of
Transkei
and
Ciskei
.
With
a
long
coastline
on
the
Indian
Ocean
it
offers
great
beaches
as
well
as
several
very
interesting
National
Parks
.
Its
population
is
mainly
Xhosa-speaking
and
the
province
is
home
to
several
of
South
Africa`s
most
important
persons
in
the
fight
against
Apartheid
(
e.
g.
Nelson
Mandela
,
Thabo
Mbeki
,
Steve
Biko
and
Oliver
Tambo
)
.
It
's
still
a
poor
province
especially
in
the
former
homelands
but
beautiful
and
not
so
touristy
.

<p>
Definitely
the
best
option
if
you
are
more
than
two
as
several
regions
and
some
of
the
National
Parks
are
n't
accessible
by
public
transport
.
Road
Conditions
are
mainly
good
but
get
informed
before
you
start
.
Car
rental
is
available
in
larger
cities
and
along
the
popular
resorts
of
the
Garden
Route
.

<p>
Be
careful
of
wild
animals
,
especially
monkeys
,
on

road

Be
