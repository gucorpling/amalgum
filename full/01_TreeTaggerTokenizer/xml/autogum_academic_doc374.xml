Introduction

<p>
As
the
current
market
environment
among
companies
tends
to
shift
from
product-oriented
to
service-
and
customer-oriented
,
the
importance
of
customer
management
through
creating
positive
customer
value
is
further
emphasized
.
Effective
salespeople
play
key
roles
in
creating
positive
customer
value
by
fostering
sustainable
relationships
between
customers
and
firms
.
These
behaviors
contribute
to
the
sustainable
benefits
of
their
companies
as
well
as
positive
relationships
with
customers
.
</p>
<p>
A
salesperson
plays
an
important
role
in
representing
his
or
her
company
in
the
liberal
market
economy
.
Their
role
is
even
more
critical
in
representing
their
firm
when
the
company
’s
products
are
not
particularly
superior
.
A
salesperson
is
also
a
key
factor
in
delivering
corporate
images
to
customers
.
The
salesperson
is
the
contact
point
for
customers
to
quickly
identify
changes
in
their
needs
,
acquire
and
utilize
customer
information
,
and
provide
services
and
products
that
meet
the
customers
’
expectations
,
except
when
there
exists
a
purchase
facilitator
such
as
a
digital
signage
and
a
different
shopping
characteristics
.
The
salesperson
not
only
increases
customer
satisfaction
but
also
superior
sales
performance
in
a
sustainable
way
.
</p>
<p>
Previous
studies
have
been
conducted
since
the
1960s
to
improve
the
salesperson
’s
performance
and
to
explore
what
is
needed
for
effective
sales
.
As
a
result
,
many
studies
have
shown
that
it
is
possible
to
improve
the
performance
of
salespeople
through
monetary
rewards
,
such
as
incentive
and
salary
increases
,
and
welfare
provisions
and
non-monetary
rewards
,
such
as
education
,
training
,
and
communication
.
However
,
there
are
other
studies
that
suggest
that
if
a
salesperson
is
not
able
to
provide
good
customer
services
,
he
will
feel
exhausted
and
emotionally
unstable
.
As
such
,
monetary
or
non-monetary
rewards
alone
cannot
improve
the
performance
of
the
salesperson
.
Thus
,
more
recent
studies
focus
on
customer
orientation
and
adaptive
selling
as
resources
of
effective
and
sustainable
sales
.
</p>
<p>
According
to
previous
research
,
sustainable
behaviors
have
been
defined
as
a
set
of
actions
to
protect
natural
,
social
,
and
human
resources
.
In
marketing
strategy
and
sales
domains
,
marketing
orientation
or
customer
orientation
is
a
philosophy
and
an
action
plan
that
focuses
on
long-term
business
relationships
.
Companies
conducting
a
coherent
set
of
behaviors
which
focuses
on
their
B2B
partners
find
that
a
solid
business
entry
barrier
can
be
created
by
their
satisfied
clients
.
Furthermore
,
in
the
B2C
market
,
brand
loyalty
can
be
strengthened
by
meeting
the
market
needs
,
and
all
these
efforts
ensure
sustainability
when
managing
core
business
activities
.
</p>
<p>
In
the
marketing
field
,
as
relationship
marketing
was
highlighted
,
one
began
to
pay
attention
to
how
to
maintain
and
promote
long-term
relationships
with
existing
customers
rather
than
short-term
sales-oriented
relationships
with
new
customers
.
The
term
,
relationship
marketing
,
was
first
mentioned
in
the
literature
of
Berry
,
and
since
then
,
much
has
been
discussed
about
relationship
marketing
in
the
service
marketing
literature
.
This
relationship
marketing
has
been
more
effective
in
the
service
industry
when
there
is
a
high
orientation
towards
customers
and
salespeople
interact
closely
with
customers
in
order
to
benefit
from
short-term
exchanges
.
</p>
<p>
Definitions
of
relationship
marketing
may
vary
,
but
the
concept
of
relationship
marketing
is
the
same
as
pursuing
mutual
benefits
that
seek
long-term
relationships
between
customers
and
companies
.
Morgan
and
Hunt
defined
relationship
marketing
as
the
first
line
of
marketing
activities
carried
out
to
form
,
develop
,
and
maintain
successful
relationship
exchanges
,
while
Treacy
and
Wiersema
emphasized
a
company
's
sustainable
competitive
advantage
and
customer
value
.
For
this
,
they
argued
that
customer
intimacy
,
product
leadership
,
and
differentiation
were
necessary
.
Several
studies
directly
investigate
this
influence
of
relationship
marketing
on
business
sustainability
.
In
sum
,
the
main
purpose
of
relationship
marketing
is
to
maximize
mutual
benefits
between
customers
and
companies
by
having
a
long-term
and
sustainable
relationship
with
customers
.
</p>
<p>
Customer
orientation
is
one
of
the
major
concerns
to
maintain
a
long-term
relationship
with
customers
.
Salespeople
focus
on
customers
’
needs
and
desires
and
deliver
relevant
services
.
They
acquire
customer
information
and
knowledge
,
deliver
services
to
satisfy
their
customers
’
needs
and
desires
,
and
develop
products
and
company
knowledge
.
Several
previous
studies
found
that
customer
orientation
affected
performance
of
salespeople
in
a
significant
way
.
It
also
had
an
effect
on
salespeople
’s
behaviors
in
relational
sales
environments
.
</p>
<p>
Adaptive
selling
is
the
ability
of
a
salesperson
to
change
his
sales
behavior
while
interacting
with
customers
,
or
based
on
perceived
information
about
the
nature
of
sales
situations
such
as
correcting
communication
styles
,
content
,
and
sales
behaviors
.
In
other
words
,
adaptive
selling
modifies
sales
behaviors
to
meet
the
individual
needs
of
customers
,
which
strengthens
the
relationship
between
the
customer
and
the
salesperson
,
resulting
in
a
significant
impact
on
the
sales
performance
.
</p>
<p>
This
study
of
customer
orientation
and
adaptive
selling
argues
that
these
sales
behaviors
are
formed
by
the
characteristics
of
organizations
and
the
psychological
characteristics
of
the
individual
salesperson
and
directly
affect
the
sales
performance
.
However
,
research
on
the
difference
between
customer
orientation
and
adaptive
selling
for
the
salesperson
is
insufficient
,
and
the
two
concepts
tend
to
be
considered
as
identical
.
