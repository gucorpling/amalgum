The
objectives
of
this
paper
were
to
study
the
transition
toward
high-tech
urban
agriculture
and
its
adoption
in
urban
planning
practices
in
Shanghai
.
A
combination
of
multi-level
perspective
(
MLP
)
and
actor
–
network
Theory
(
ANT
)
was
used
to
identify
institutional
barriers
and
driving
forces
in
this
transition
.
The
main
findings
are
synthesized
below

Empirical
Findings
</head>
<p>
The
development
of
agricultural
technology
and
the
application
in
urban
food
production
practices
in
Shanghai
were
led
by
the
Chinese
Academy
of
Agricultural
Science
(
CAAS
)
and
the
Agricultural
Science
and
Technology
Innovation
Program
(
ASTIP
)
.
The
transition
pathway
in
Shanghai
was
organized
by
the
state
government
through
top-down
R&amp;D
activities
.
Agricultural
technologies
were
imported
by
CAAS
from
other
countries
,
in
particular
the
Netherlands
.
The
state
government
allowed
the
involvement
of
foreign
businesses
in
the
transition
through
open-door
policies
,
such
as
the
establishment
of
the
Special
Economic
Zone
in
Shanghai
.
The
imported
technologies
were
adopted
by
incumbent
industries
,
such
as
lighting
and
home
appliance
manufacturers
,
and
adapted
to
create
new
equipment
and
products
for
HTUA
practices
.
These
products
and
equipment
were
brought
into
national
and
international
markets
by
Chinese
agricultural
technology
firms
.
The
niche
developers
in
this
transition
pathway
(
i.
e.
,
SOCs
)
collaborated
with
agricultural
technology
firms
to
adopt
agricultural
technologies
in
new
urban
food
production
practices
,
such
as
the
Sunqiao
modern
agriculture
zone
.
To
ensure
that
the
interested
actors
became
involved
in
the
transition
process
and
part
of
the
actor
network
of
transition
,
CAAS
developed
the
key
laboratories
and
demonstration
zone
for
urban
agriculture
.
The
result
of
the
collective
actions
of
the
actor-network
of
transition
was
the
identification
of
plant
factories
as
immutable
mobiles
;
in
other
words
,
they
were
introduced
as
the
promising
solution
for
the
challenges
of
the
agricultural
sector
in
China
.
To
mobilize
the
actor
network
,
the
vegetable
basket
program
was
promoted
by
the
local
government
,
MoA
,
and
CAAS
to
connect
the
urban
food
production
and
consumption
practices
.
Additionally
,
spokespersons
were
appointed
to
represent
the
actor
network
of
transition
and
to
mobilize
the
involved
actors
.
The
director
of
CAAS
as
the
main
spokesperson
had
the
responsibility
of
introducing
plant
factories
and
their
positive
contribution
to
the
economy
and
society
.
</p>
<p>
The
research
shows
that
political
and
economic
interests
were
the
main
driving
forces
behind
the
transition
process
in
Shanghai
.
These
findings
are
in
line
with
Miller
,
who
concluded
that
the
rise
of
HTUA
practices
is
a
result
of
the
adaptation
of
technologies
by
“
dominant
political
and
economic
interests
”
for
providing
food
security
(
p.
11
)
.
Hallock
describes
HTUA
as
a
capitalist
form
of
urban
agriculture
with
the
“
ability
to
standardize
the
food
cultivation
process
,
and
to
incorporate
it
into
factory
like
production
systems
”
(
p.
7
)
.
This
clearly
applies
to
Shanghai
,
where
the
top-down
approach
of
CAAS
and
the
involved
SOCs
was
effective
for
the
development
of
large-scale
practices
.
Large-scale
plant
factories
with
a
focus
on
high
yields
were
supported
and
subsidized
,
driven
by
the
central
government
’s
aims
of
increasing
the
local
production
capacity
and
becoming
less
dependent
on
the
import
of
agricultural
products
.
Therefore
,
the
HTUA
have
become
oriented
toward
large-scale
commercial
vegetable
production
practices
.
CAAS
also
persuaded
local
planning
organizations
to
remove
any
regulatory
barriers
.
It
shows
that
the
government
continues
to
play
a
dominant
role
in
the
development
of
urban
agriculture
in
Shanghai
.
However
,
this
dominant
role
also
made
it
such
that
private
enterprises
involved
in
niche
developments
could
not
compete
with
the
SOCs
,
and
therefore
,
many
of
these
private
companies
went
bankrupt
.
This
may
have
reduced
the
role
of
talented
pioneers
in
the
development
of
novelties
.
The
focus
on
large-scale
food
production
may
also
have
resulted
in
the
loss
of
its
potential
for
improving
urban
lifestyles
and
integration
into
urban
residents
’
lives
.

Furthermore
,
the
results
show
that
strategies
for
representing
material
entities
(
technologies
)
were
crucial
in
the
integration
of
agricultural
technologies
in
urban
practices
.
The
representation
of
technologies
by
visualizations
was
an
effective
tool
for
making
investors
and
the
public
interested
in
HTUA
in
Shanghai
.
The
developers
of
the
Sunqiao
modern
agriculture
zone
hired
architectural
companies
to
create
visualizations
of
their
projects
.
The
architects
created
futuristic
designs
that
were
not
based
on
in-depth
knowledge
of
HTUA
technologies
.
Although
the
visualizations
were
highly
effective
in
attracting
investors
and
public
attention
,
they
also
raised
concerns
about
the
feasibility
of
HTUA
practices
among
agricultural
experts
and
decision-makers
.
Consequently
,
the
decision-makers
consulted
agricultural
experts
to
validate
the
feasibility
of
the
proposed
practices
.
These
results
show
that
visualizations
can
only
play
an
effective
role
as
an
intermediary
between
niche
developers
and
decision-makers
if
technology
experts
are
involved
in
the
design
process
.
These
findings
are
in
line
with
Billger
,
Thuvander
,
and
Wästberg
who
argue
that
visualization
is
an
effective
tool
for
communication
among
stakeholders
in
planning
processes
,
but
also
involves
a
risk
of
“
potential
misuse
,
misinterpretation
and
misempowerment
”
(
p.
12
)
.
To
plan
for
technology-driven
transitions
,
the
identity
of
material
entities
(
technologies
)
and
their
characteristics
must
be
understood
by
planners
.
Bridges
between
knowledge
institutes
,
architecture
,
and
planning
organizations
are
therefore
essential
for
providing
clear
and
representative
visualizations
.
