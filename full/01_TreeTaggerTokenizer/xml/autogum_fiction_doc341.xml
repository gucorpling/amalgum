A
STORM
AT
SEA
</head>
<p>
Tom
had
the
choice
of
two
routes
in
making
his
voyage
to
far-off
Siberia
.
He
could
have
crossed
the
United
States
,
sailed
over
the
Pacific
ocean
,
and
approached
the
land
of
the
Czar
from
the
western
coast
above
Manchuria
.
But
he
preferred
to
take
the
Atlantic
route
,
crossing
Europe
,
and
so
sailing
over
Russia
proper
to
get
to
his
destination
.
There
were
several
reasons
for
this
.
</p>
<p>
The
water
voyage
was
somewhat
shorter
,
and
this
was
an
important
consideration
when
there
was
no
telling
when
he
might
have
an
accident
that
would
compel
him
to
descend
.
On
the
Atlantic
he
knew
there
would
be
more
ships
to
render
assistance
if
it
was
needed
,
although
he
hoped
he
would
not
have
to
ask
for
it
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Then
,
too
,
&quot;
he
said
to
Ned
,
when
they
were
discussing
the
matter
,
&quot;
we
will
have
a
chance
to
see
some
civilized
countries
if
we
cross
Europe
,
and
we
may
land
near
Paris
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Paris
!
&quot;
cried
Ned
.
&quot;
What
for
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
To
renew
our
supply
of
gasolene
,
for
one
thing
,
&quot;
replied
the
young
inventor
.
&quot;
Not
that
we
will
be
out
when
we
arrive
,
but
if
we
take
on
more
there
we
may
not
have
to
get
any
in
Russia
.
Besides
,
they
have
a
very
good
quality
in
France
,
so
all
told
,
I
think
the
route
over
Europe
to
be
the
best
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Ned
agreed
with
him
,
and
so
did
Mr.
Petrofsky
.
As
for
Mr.
Damon
,
he
was
so
busy
getting
his
sleeping
room
in
order
,
and
blessing
everything
he
could
think
of
,
that
he
did
not
have
time
to
talk
much
.
So
the
eastern
route
was
decided
on
,
and
as
the
big
airship
,
carrying
our
friends
,
their
supplies
,
and
the
wonderful
air
glider
rose
higher
and
higher
,
Tom
gradually
brought
her
around
so
that
the
pointed
nose
of
the
gas
bag
aimed
straight
across
the
Atlantic
.
</p>
<p>
They
were
over
the
ocean
on
the
second
day
out
,
for
Tom
did
not
push
the
craft
to
her
limit
of
speed
,
now
they
had
time
to
consider
matters
at
their
leisure
,
for
they
had
been
rather
hurried
on
leaving
.
</p>
<p>
The
machinery
was
working
as
nearly
to
perfection
as
it
could
be
brought
,
and
Tom
,
after
finding
out
that
his
craft
would
answer
equally
well
as
a
dirigible
balloon
or
an
aeroplane
,
let
it
sail
along
as
the
latter
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
For
,
&quot;
he
said
,
&quot;
we
have
a
long
trip
ahead
of
us
and
we
need
to
save
all
the
elevating
gas
we
can
save
.
If
worst
comes
to
worst
,
and
we
ca
n't
navigate
as
an
aeroplane
any
more
,
we
can
even
drift
along
as
a
dirigible
.
But
while
we
have
the
gasolene
we
might
as
well
make
speed
and
be
an
aeroplane
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
others
agreed
with
him
,
and
so
it
was
arranged
.
Tom
,
when
he
had
seen
to
it
that
his
craft
was
working
well
,
let
Ned
take
charge
and
devoted
himself
to
seeing
that
all
the
stores
and
supplies
were
in
order
for
quick
use
.
</p>
<p>
Of
course
,
until
they
were
nearer
the
land
of
the
Czar
,
and
that
part
of
Siberia
where
Mr.
Petrofsky
's
brother
was
held
as
an
exile
,
they
could
do
little
save
make
themselves
as
comfortable
as
possible
in
the
airship
.
And
this
was
not
hard
to
do
.
</p>
<p>
Naturally
,
in
a
craft
that
had
to
carry
a
heavy
load
,
and
lift
itself
into
the
air
,
as
well
as
propel
itself
along
,
not
many
things
could
be
taken
.
Every
ounce
counted
.
Still
our
friends
were
not
without
their
comforts
.
There
was
a
well
stocked
kitchen
,
and
Mr.
Damon
insisted
on
installing
himself
as
cook
.
This
had
been
Eradicate
's
work
but
the
eccentric
man
knew
how
to
do
almost
everything
from
making
soup
to
roasting
a
chicken
,
and
he
liked
it
.
So
he
was
allowed
free
run
of
the
galley
.
</p>
<p>
Tom
and
Ned
spent
much
time
in
the
steering
tower
or
engine
room
,
for
,
though
all
of
the
machinery
was
automatic
,
there
was
need
of
almost
constant
attention
,
though
there
was
an
arrangement
whereby
in
case
of
emergency
,
the
airship
would
steer
herself
in
any
set
direction
for
a
certain
number
of
hours
.
</p>
<p>
There
were
ample
sleeping
quarters
for
six
persons
,
a
living
room
and
a
dining
saloon
.
In
short
the
Falcon
was
much
like
Tom
's
Red
Cloud
,
only
bigger
and
better
.
There
was
even
a
phonograph
on
board
so
that
music
,
songs
,
and
recitations
could
be
enjoyed
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Bless
my
napkin
!
but
this
is
great
!
&quot;
exclaimed
Mr.
Damon
,
about
noon
of
the
second
day
,
when
they
had
just
finished
dinner
and
looked
down
through
the
glass
windows
in
the
bottom
of
the
cabin
at
the
rolling
ocean
below
them
.
&quot;
I
do
n't
believe
many
persons
have
such
opportunities
as
we
have
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
'm
sure
they
do
not
,
&quot;
added
Mr.
Petrofsky
.
&quot;
I
can
hardly
think
it
true
,
that
I
am
on
my
way
back
to
Siberia
to
rescue
my
dear
brother
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
And
such
good
weather
as
we
're
having
,
&quot;
spoke
Ned
.
&quot;
I
'm
glad
we
did
n't
start
off
in
a
storm
,
for
I
do
n't
exactly
like
them
when
we
're
over
the
water
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
We
may
get
one
yet
,
&quot;
said
Tom
.
&quot;
I
do
n't
just
like
the
way
the
barometer
is
acting
.
It
's
falling
pretty
fast
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Bless
my
mercury
tube
!
&quot;
cried
Mr.
Damon
.
&quot;
I
hope
we
have
no
bad
luck
on
this
trip
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Oh
,
we
ca
n't
help
a
storm
or
two
,
&quot;
answered
Tom
.
&quot;
I
guess
it
wo
n't
do
any
harm
to
prepare
for
it
.
