Introduction

<p>
Adult
spinal
deformity
(
ASD
)
is
a
broad
diagnosis
referring
to
stable
asymptomatic
curves
and
disabling
deformities
in
the
spine
that
contribute
to
pain
,
weakness
,
and
low
health-related
quality
of
life
(
HRQOL
)
.
Although
ASD
is
quite
common
,
the
variation
and
unique
pattern
of
each
spinal
deformity
make
reproducible
measurement
difficult
.
Previous
studies
investigating
the
correlation
between
radiographic
appearances
and
clinical
symptoms
yielded
rather
low
predictive
power
due
to
highly
variable
health
status
.
Little
correlation
between
radiographic
assessment
and
questionnaire
scores
was
found
for
adolescent
idiopathic
scoliosis
.
However
,
in
2005
,
Glassman
et
al.
showed
that
sagittal
plane
balance
is
the
most
reliable
predictor
of
clinical
symptoms
in
adults
with
spinal
deformity
.
Even
mild
positive
sagittal
balance
results
in
destructive
spinal
deformity
,
clinical
symptoms
of
which
deteriorate
linearly
.
Therefore
,
a
surgical
plan
for
restoring
sagittal
balance
is
crucial
in
all
spinal
reconstructive
surgeries
.
</p>
<p>
Parameters
to
describe
the
sagittal
alignment
of
the
spine
include
the
sagittal
vertical
axis
(
SVA
)
,
thoracic
kyphosis
,
lumbar
lordosis
,
pelvic
incidence
,
pelvic
tilt
,
and
sacral
slope
.
SVA
,
which
is
the
most
commonly
used
measure
of
the
sagittal
plane
,
is
obtained
from
standing
lateral
radiographs
and
is
defined
as
the
horizontal
distance
between
two
landmarks
:
the
center
of
C7
vertebral
body
and
the
posterior
superior
aspect
of
the
S1
vertebral
body
.
According
to
Schwab
’s
classification
based
on
Jean
Dubousset‘s
cone
of
economy
,
the
realignment
of
the
spine
should
aim
to
meet
the
criteria
of
SVA
&lt;
50
mm
to
alleviate
sensations
of
falling
over
.
Consequently
,
formulating
a
patient-specific
surgical
plan
requires
SVA
measurement
both
preoperatively
and
postoperatively
,
using
whole-spine
lateral
radiographs
.
However
,
manual
SVA
estimation
on
radiographs
is
rather
inconvenient
due
to
lack
of
easy-to-use
tools
.
To
solve
this
issue
,
we
propose
using
deep-learning
models
for
fully
automatic
estimation
of
SVA
.
</p>
<p>
A
well-known
family
of
deep-learning
models
is
the
convolutional
neural
networks
(
CNNs
)
.
CNNs
have
drawn
considerable
attention
since
2012
,
as
they
were
found
to
outperform
traditional
image
processing
algorithms
on
image
classification
tasks
.
Since
then
,
CNNs
have
been
increasingly
used
for
medical
image
analysis
.
A
CNN
is
primarily
made
of
stacked
convolution
layers
,
which
can
be
regarded
as
a
series
of
learnable
feature
extractors
designed
for
acquiring
low-to-high-level
features
of
an
image
.
In
general
,
basic
image
features
,
such
as
blob
of
colors
or
edges
of
different
orientations
,
are
learnable
by
the
shallow
convolution
layers
.
On
the
other
hand
,
complex
image
features
,
such
as
appearances
of
objects
,
are
learnable
by
the
deep
convolution
layers
.
Therefore
,
well-trained
convolution
layers
can
be
used
to
extract
informative
features
that
are
useful
for
landmark
localization
or
other
specific
tasks
.
</p>
<p>
Automatic
SVA
estimation
can
generally
be
regarded
as
the
task
of
landmark
localization
,
as
SVA
was
defined
as
the
horizontal
difference
between
two
anatomical
landmarks
.
In
this
study
,
we
investigated
the
performance
of
ResUNet
for
automatic
vertebrae
localization
on
radiographs
.
ResUNet
is
a
variant
of
CNN
.
Its
UNet-like
structure
combines
the
contextual
information
produced
by
deep
layers
and
better
location
information
produced
by
shallow
layers
,
allowing
better
utilization
of
low-
and
high-level
features
.
In
addition
,
the
encapsulated
residual
blocks
of
ResUNet
enable
better
flow
of
information
and
can
avoid
performance
deterioration
as
the
network
goes
deeper
.
ResUNet
has
been
used
for
cell
segmentation
from
biomedical
images
and
road
extraction
from
satellite
images
.
To
the
best
of
our
knowledge
,
our
study
is
the
first
to
utilize
ResUNet
for
anatomical
landmark
localization
.
</p>
<p>
Some
previous
works
use
CNN
for
vertebrae
segmentation
or
localization
.
For
example
,
for
3D
CT
and
MR
images
,
Lessmann
et
al.
used
a
3D
UNet-like
model
for
vertebrae
segmentation
.
In
addition
,
Wimmer
et
al.
used
3D
CNN
for
vertebrae
localization
.
There
were
also
studies
on
radiographs
:
for
biplanar
radiographs
,
including
A-P
and
lateral
view
,
Gallbusera
et
al.
used
a
database
collected
using
the
EOS™
imaging
system
and
trained
CNN
models
for
each
of
the
landmarks
.
For
lateral
spine
radiographs
,
Al
Arif
et
al.
applied
a
UNet
model
for
the
localization
of
cervical
vertebral
centers
.
</p>
<p>
In
this
study
,
we
applied
ResUNet
on
plain
lateral
spine
radiographs
.
Although
our
algorithm
is
similar
to
the
one
in
,
there
are
some
major
differences
.
First
,
we
did
not
split
images
into
patches
,
as
patching
leads
to
extra
pre-
and
post-processing
steps
,
and
the
correlation
between
landmarks
of
different
patches
will
be
ignored
completely
.
However
,
if
patching
was
not
performed
,
the
large
image
size
would
lead
to
insufficient
amount
of
RAM
on
GPU
.
To
alleviate
this
issue
,
we
used
a
small
batch
size
(
batch
size
=
2
)
and
replaced
the
widely
used
batch
normalization
with
the
group
normalization
in
our
network
.
Group
normalization
is
known
to
perform
well
even
when
the
batch
size
is
small
,
as
it
does
not
perform
normalization
along
the
batch
axis
.
Secondly
,
we
let
probability
maps
of
landmarks
to
be
predicted
separately
.
Thus
,
predictions
were
not
on
the
same
map
and
further
post-processing
steps
involving
separation
and
identification
of
the
landmarks
can
be
eliminated
.
