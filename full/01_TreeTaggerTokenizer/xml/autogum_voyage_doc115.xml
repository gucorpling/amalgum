<p>
When
they
started
spreading
Christianity
in
Japan
,
priests
were
particularly
successful
in
Gotō
.
Even
when
a
ban
on
religion
entered
in
effect
,
many
believers
did
not
change
their
faith
and
continued
worshipping
secretly
for
two
centuries
.
After
the
ban
on
Christianity
was
lifted
on
the
18th
Century
,
many
churches
were
constructed
.
They
constitute
one
of
the
main
attractions
of
Gotō
,
along
with
its
beautiful
nature
and
fresh
produce
,
especially
fish
.
