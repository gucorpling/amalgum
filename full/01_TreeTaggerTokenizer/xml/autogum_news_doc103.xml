protesting
what

Zimbabwe
state
media
reported
on
Tuesday
that
President
Mugabe
will
not
recognise
Tsvangirai
's
suspension
of
ties
with
the
government
until
he
is
formally
informed
.
The
state-owned
daily
newspaper
,
The
Herald
,
quoted
Mugabe
's
spokesman
,
George
Charamba
,
as
saying
Tsvangirai
is
still
prime
minister
and
is
expected
to
attend
cabinet
meetings
.
<p>
“
Government
is
not
run
through
media
statements
.
In
the
same
way
that
President
Mugabe
formally
appointed
him
to
the
post
of
Prime
Minister
he
must
also
communicate
any
decision
to
disengage
or
whatever
it
is
they
are
calling
it
,
in
a
formal
manner
,
&quot;
Charamba
said
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
This
can
be
done
orally
or
in
writing
but
in
a
formal
manner
.
From
that
point
of
view
nothing
has
happened
.
Until
the
communication
is
done
formally
the
president
has
no
reason
or
any
grounds
to
think
or
know
otherwise
,
”
he
said
.
</p>
<p>
Tsvangirai
,
who
&quot;
disengaged
&quot;
from
the
country
's
unity
government
last
week
,
was
accused
by
the
newspaper
of
traveling
without
cabinet
approval
.
The
leader
of
the
MDC
party
is
on
a
ten-day
trip
of
Southern
African
Development
Community
countries
,
who
helped
to
negotiate
the
troubled
power
sharing
agreement
in
Zimbabwe
.
Tsvangirai
is
not
due
to
return
to
Zimbabwe
until
sometime
next
week
.
</p>
<p>
According
to
The
Herald
,
government
officials
said
that
Tsvangirai
had
attempted
to
obtain
cabinet
authority
for
his
trip
while
en
route
to
the
airport
,
but
was
told
that
it
was
too
late
to
receive
it
.
</p>
<p>
However
,
University
of
Zimbabwe
political
science
professor
John
Makumbe
said
he
believed
Tsvangirai
's
partial
withdrawal
from
the
national
unity
government
was
long
overdue
and
ZANU-PF
's
reaction
is
mere
posturing
.
&quot;
Morgan
Tsvangirai
has
done
the
right
thing
,
he
must
light
fires
and
make
ZANU-PF
run
around
putting
the
fires
out
.
What
he
has
been
doing
to
date
is
agreeing
to
be
treated
like
a
tea-boy
,
he
has
been
told
what
to
do
and
he
has
done
it
without
asking
questions
,
&quot;
Makumbe
said
.
</p>
<p>
He
said
that
Mugabe
's
ZANU-PF
party
could
n't
risk
going
it
alone
,
as
Tsvangirai
has
a
stronger
claim
to
legitimacy
as
his
party
won
the
elections
in
March
2008
.
</p>
<p>
Ministers
from
a
splinter
faction
of
the
MDC
led
by
Arthur
Mutambara
attended
the
cabinet
meeting
.
Mutambara
,
who
is
one
of
two
deputy
prime
ministers
,
said
at
a
news
conference
on
Monday
that
he
was
talking
to
both
Mugabe
and
Tsvangirai
.
He
said
the
national
unity
government
is
Zimbabwe
's
only
hope
of
moving
forward
.
&quot;
We
are
determined
to
give
this
government
a
fighting
chance
because
in
our
mind
there
is
no
plan
B
,
&quot;
Mutambara
said
.
</p>
<p>
Tsvangirai
announced
last
week
that
his
party
would
not
withdraw
from
the
unity
government
altogether
,
but
would
boycott
the
executive
branch
whose
ministries
it
shares
with
the
ZANU-PF
party
.
He
cited
the
reluctance
of
Mugabe
to
implement
matters
that
had
been
agreed
to
in
the
so-called
Global
Political
Agreement
,
which
brought
the
national
unity
government
to
power
.
</p>
<p>
Among
the
outstanding
issues
is
the
appointment
of
governors
and
the
alleged
harassment
of
his
party
members
and
Members
of
Parliament
.
His
announcement
came
two
days
after
agriculture
deputy
minister
designate
Roy
Bennett
was
arrested
and
re-detained
on
charges
of
insurgency
and
terror
.
Bennett
has
since
been
released
on
bail
,
but
Tsvangirai
has
said
his
party
will
not
participate
in
government
until
all
the
issues
he
raised
have
been
resolved
.
