What
it
showed
me
is
that
the
mentality
in
Atlanta
is
that
much
of
their
history
means
nothing
.
For
so
many
years
they
did
a
good
job
preserving
.
Do
n’t
get
me
wrong
,
I
’m
not
a

.
It
’s
just
an
interesting
observation

In
2004
when
you
released
your
third
album
,
<hi rend="italic">
Red
Hot
</hi>
,
it
received
a
good
deal
of
play
in
the
clubs
and
on
dance
radio
,
but
very
little
press
coverage
.
On
your
blog
you
discussed
how
you
felt
betrayed
by
the
entertainment
industry
and
,
in
particular
,
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gay%20press">
gay
press
</ref>
.
What
happened
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
RP
:
</hi>
Well
,
betrayed
might
be
the
wrong
word
.
‘
Betrayed
’
alludes
to
an
idea
that
there
was
some
kind
of
a
promise
made
to
me
,
and
there
never
was
.
More
so
,
I
was
disappointed
.
I
do
n’t
feel
like
it
was
a
betrayal
.
Nobody
promises
anything
in
show
business
and
you
understand
that
from
day
one
.
</p>
<p>
But
,
I
do
n’t
know
what
happened
.
It
seemed
I
could
n’t
get
press
on
my
album
unless
I
was
willing
to
play
into
the
role
that
the
mainstream
press
has
assigned
to
gay
people
,
which
is
as
servants
of
straight
ideals
.

Do
you
mean
as

?

</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">

</hi>
Not
court
jesters
,
because
that
also
plays
into
that
mentality
.
We
as
humans
find
it
easy
to
categorize
people
so
that
we
know
how
to
feel
comfortable
with
them
;
so
that
we
do
n’t
feel
threatened
.
If
someone
falls
outside
of
that
categorization
,
we
feel
threatened
and
we
search
our
psyche
to
put
them
into
a
category
that
we
feel
comfortable
with
.
The
mainstream
media
and
the
gay
press
find
it
hard
to
accept
me
as
...
just
...

It
seems
like
years
ago
,
and
my
recollection
might
be
fuzzy
,
but
it
seems
like
I
read
a
mainstream
media
piece
that
talked
about
how
you
wanted
to
break
out
of
the
RuPaul
'
character
'
and
be
seen
as
more
than
just
<hi rend="italic">
RuPaul
</hi>
.

</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
RP
:
</hi>
Well
,
RuPaul
is
my
real
name
and
that
’s
who
I
am
and
who
I
have
always
been
.
There
’s
the
product
<hi rend="italic">
RuPaul
</hi>
that
I
have
sold
in
business
.
Does
the
product
feel
like
it
’s
been
put
into
a
box
?
Could
you
be
more
clear
?
It
’s
a
hard
question
to
answer
.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">

That
you
wanted
to
be
seen
as
more
than
just
RuPaul
the
drag
queen
,
but
also
for
the
man
and
versatile
artist
that
you
are
.
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
RP
:
</hi>
That
’s
not
on
target
.
What
other
people
think
of
me
is
not
my
business
.
What
I
do
is
what
I
do
.
How
people
see
me
does
n’t
change
what
I
decide
to
do
.
I
do
n’t
choose
projects
so
people
do
n’t
see
me
as
one
thing
or
another
.
I
choose
projects
that
excite
me
.
I
think
the
problem
is
that
people
refuse
to
understand
what
drag
is
outside
of
their
own
belief
system
.
A
friend
of
mine
recently
did
the
<hi rend="italic">
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Oprah%20Winfrey%20Show">
Oprah
</ref>
</hi>
show
about
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transgender">

</ref>
youth
.
It
was
obvious
that
we
,
as
a
culture
,
have
a
hard
time
trying
to
understand
the
difference
between
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/drag%20queen">

queen
</ref>
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transsexual">

</ref>
,
and
a
transgender
,
yet
we
find
it
very
easy
to
know
the
difference
between
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American%20League">
American
baseball

</ref>
and
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National%20League">

</ref>
,
when
they
are
both
so
similar
.
We
’ll
learn
the
difference
to
that
.
One
of
my
hobbies
is
to
research
and
go
underneath
ideas
to
discover
why
certain
ones
stay
in
place
while
others
do
not
.
Like
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam%20and%20Eve">

</ref>
,
which
is
a

,
yet
it
is
something
that
people
believe
;
what
,
exactly
,
keeps
it
in
place
?
