Introduction

<p>
Stereo-digital
image
correlation
(
stereo-DIC
)
is
an
image-based
non-contact
optical
technique
for
retrieving
full-field
3D
shape
,
displacement
and
deformation
of
materials
,
structures
,
and
biological
trusses
.
In
recent
years
,
significant
advances
have
been
made
to
various
aspects
of
stereo-DIC
to
improve
its
robustness
,
applicability
,
measurement
accuracy
,
and
computational
efficiency
.
As
a
matter
of
fact
,
stereo-DIC
has
been
widely
accepted
as
the
most
powerful
tool
in
the
experimental
mechanics
community
,
and
it
offers
several
prominent
advantages
over
competing
interferometric
optical
techniques
(
e.
g.
,
electronic
speckle
pattern
interferometry
and
Moir√©
interferometry
)
,
such
as
being
easy-to-use
,
a
robustness
against
ambient
vibrations
,
and
a
wide
range
of
applicability
.
</p>
<p>
The
conventional
stereo-DIC
technique
uses
two
synchronized
digital
cameras
to
acquire
digital
images
of
a
test
object
from
different
views
and
then
retrieves
the
3D
information
from
the
stereo
pairs
using
image
registration
algorithm
and
triangulation
.
However
,
the
requirement
of
two
synchronized
cameras
usually
makes
the
system
both
expensive
and
complicated
,
especially
for
the
high-speed
stereo-DIC
measurements
.
To
improve
the
stereo-DIC
,
various
single-camera
stereo-DIC
techniques
using
diffraction-based
,
refraction-based
,
and
reflection-based
optical
configurations
have
been
developed
and
advocated
.
Among
these
techniques
,
full-frame
single-camera
stereo-DIC
technique
using
a
color
separation
device
and
a
color
camera
has
been
considered
the
most
practical
one
,
since
it
can
realize
full-frame
measurements
without
any
loss
of
spatial
resolution
of
the
camera
,
while
maintaining
the
prominent
advantages
of
other
single-camera
stereo-DIC
techniques
such
as
cost-effectiveness
,
compactness
,
and
the
avoidance
of
the
complicated
camera
synchronization
.
</p>
<p>
The
full-frame
single-camera
stereo-DIC
technique
using
a
single-color
camera
was
originally
proposed
by
Yu
and
Pan
.
Specifically
,
they
designed
an
innovative
color
separation
device
to
facilitate
a
color
camera
to
acquire
images
of
blue
and
red
colors
from
different
optical
paths
,
and
then
the
3D
information
could
be
retrieved
from
the
extracted
two-channel
sub-images
.

a
gives
the
optical
setup
of
the
method
,
where
a
cube
beam
splitter
(
CBS
)
is
used
to
combine
two
different
views
reflected
from
two
plane
mirrors
(
M
)
and
the
color
filters
(
Fb
and
Fr
)
arranged
in
front
of
the
CBS
is
used
to
remove
the
color
cross-talk
between
the
two
views
.
Benefitting
from
its
full-frame
3D
measurement
capability
,
the
technique
was
then
successfully
employed
for
high-speed
displacement
and
deformation
measurements
in
rotation
,
vibration
,
and
explosion
tests
.
Very
recently
,
this
technique
was
further
extended
to
microscopic
scales
for
characterizing
mechanical
behaviors
of
small-size
specimens
with
micro
features
.
Inspired
by
the
novel
idea
proposed
in
,
several
alternative
full-frame
single-camera
stereo-DIC
systems
were
also
established
,
which
use
other
forms
of
light
separation
devices
instead
of
using
a
CBS
and
two-color
filters
.
For
instance
,
a
polarization
camera
and
two
polarizers
were
used
to
achieve
the
same
function
(
i.
e.
,
full-frame
stereo-DIC
measurement
using
a
single
camera
)
.
As
shown
in
<figure>
Figure
1
</figure>
b
,
the
optical
setup
of
the
method
is
similar
to
the
color
separation
device
assisted
one
,
but
it
uses
two
polarizers
with
different
polarization
angles
to
remove
the
interference
between
the
two
views
.
Recently
,
a
seemingly
simpler
dichroic
filter
(
DF
)
was
also
used
as
a
color
separation
device
to
realize
full-frame
single-camera
stereo-DIC
measurement
as
shown
in
<figure>
Figure

<p>
Despite
the
fact
that
the
feasibility
and
functionality
of
these
existing
single-camera
stereo-DIC
systems
have
been
well
demonstrated
in
previous
works
,
they
do
have
several
following
shortcomings
.
Regarding
the
first
optical
configuration
shown
in
<figure>
Figure
1
</figure>
a
,
it
involves
too
many
optical
elements
,
which
makes
the
optical
system
both
cumbersome
and
not
easy
to
use
.
In
respect
to
the
polarization-based
color
separation
device
shown
in
<figure>
Figure
1
</figure>
b
,
the
practicality
and
applicability
of
the
technique
are
very
limited
because
of
the
high
cost
of
,
and
inaccessibility
to
,
high-speed
polarization
cameras
.
As
for
the
dichroic
filter-assisted
color
separation
device
,
this
simplification
brings
serious
imaging
problems
.
First
,
the
ghost
image
reflected
from
the
rear
surface
of
the
DF
will
degrade
the
imaging
quality
of
the
blue
channel
.
Second
,
the
refraction
effect
presented
when
the
blue
light
passes
through
the
DF
can
lead
to
considerable
measurement
error
.
</p>
<p>
To
overcome
the
limitations
of
the
existing
single-camera
stereo-DIC
systems
,
a
simple
and
practical
solution
based
on
the
use
of
X-cube
prism
is
proposed
in
this
work
,
which
greatly
improves
the
compactness
and
operability
of
the
full-frame
single-camera
stereo-DIC
system
.
First
,
it
overcomes
the
imaging
problems
existed
in
the
DF-assisted
system
while
maintains
its
extreme
simple
optical
setup
.
Second
,
the
symmetrical
structure
of
the
X-cube
prism-based
color
separation
device
also
makes
the
system
very
compact
and
easy
to
adjust
.
Because
both
the
performance
and
operability
of
this
newly
developed
single-camera
stereo-DIC
are
very
close
to
that
of
the
conventional
binocular
one
,
this
technique
can
be
considered
as
the
best
single-camera
solution
for
stereo-DIC
measurements
.
</p>
<p>
In
the
remainder
of
this
manuscript
,
the
system
configuration
and
implementation
procedure
of
the
technique
are
first
introduced
.
After
that
,
X-cube
prism
assisted
single-camera
stereo-DIC
systems
are
established
and
the
validation
experiments
are
detailed
.
Finally
,
the
contours
of
curved
surfaces
with
complex
structures
and
the
deformation
fields
of
specimens
under
different
loadings
are
successfully
measured
to
exhibit
the
practicability
of
the
method
.
