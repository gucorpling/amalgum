Warli
Painting
</head>
<head>
Introduction
</head>
<p>
Warli
paintings
are
rudimentary
wall
paintings
made
by
the
Warli
tribe
of
India
.
The
central
motif
in
this
painting
is
surrounded
by
scenes
portraying
hunting
,
fishing
,
and
farming
,
festivals
,
dances
,
trees
and
animals
.
Although
these
paintings
were
traditionally
wall
paintings
,
you
can
draw
them
on
paper
,
pots
,
canvas
etc.
You
should
also
not
limit
yourself
to
paints
and
can
use
other
mediums
such
as
color
pencils
and
crayons
.
Warli
painting
depict
the
activities
of
a
tribal
village
.
So
,
your
scene
can
be
a
bonfire
with
people
dancing
around
it
,
or
people
doing
their
day
to
day
activities
like
cooking
,
farming
,
kids
playing
,
carrying
water
from
the
river
etc.
Once
you
decide
what
you
want
to
show
,
paint
accordingly
.

the

This
is
the
color
used
traditionally
to
paint
the
background
in
Warli
paintings
.
The
figures
are
painted
in
white
.
However
,
you
can
also
use
black

any
dark

.
In
contemporary
paintings
,
a
white
background
with
brown
or
black
figures
has
also
been
observed
.
You
can
pick
either
one
,
as
long
as
you
have
a
contrast
between
the
background
and
the
figures
