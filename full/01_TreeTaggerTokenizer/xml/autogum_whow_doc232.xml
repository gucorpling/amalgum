Find
Information
on
Money
Market
Accounts
</head>
<p>
Money
market
accounts
are
insured
by
the
government
,
which
makes
them
safe
places
where
risk-averse
individuals
can
keep
extra
cash
that
wo
n't
lose
value
when
the
stock
market
declines
.
This
type
of
savings
vehicle
is
similar
to
a
savings
account
,
only
it
usually
has
a
better
interest
rate
for
investors
.
In
return
for
a
higher
interest
rate
,
the
account
holder
must
keep
a
higher
average
balance
and
agree
to
somewhat
restricted
access
to
the
money
.
To
find
information
on
money
market
accounts
,
ask
representatives
at
your
regular
banking
institution
and
compare
interest
rates
online
at
investment
education
and
banking
comparison
websites
.

Ask

restrictions

example
,
some
money
market
funds

transactions

The

APY

APY
results

Remember
that
money
market
accounts
are
best
used
as
short-term
investment
vehicles
of
1
year
or
less
.
Although
these
accounts
pay
interest
,
you
'll
find
higher
earnings
by
placing
your
money
in
a
Certificate
of
Deposit
(
CD
)
account
,
if
you
agree
to
forgo
access
to
your
money
during
a
specific
time
frame

researching
money
market
accounts
,
utilize
financial
education
websites

Avoid
conducting
research

since
their
main
goal
is
to
attract
customers
.
