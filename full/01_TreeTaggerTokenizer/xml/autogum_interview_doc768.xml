Stardust@home
is
a
highly
distributed
project
using
a
&quot;
Virtual
Microscope
&quot;
that
is
written
in
html
and
javascript
and
runs
on
most
browsers
—
no
downloads
are
required
.
Using
the
Virtual
Microscope
volunteers
can
search
over
the
collector
for
the
tracks
of
the
interstellar
dust
particles
.

<hi rend="bold">
How
many
samples
do
you
anticipate
being
found
during
the
course
of
the
project
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
Great
question
.
The
short
answer
is
that
we
do
n't
know
.
The
long
answer
is
a
bit
more
complicated
.
Here
's
what
we
know
.
The
Galileo
and
Ulysses
spacecraft
carried
dust
detectors
onboard
that
Eberhard
Gruen
and
his
colleagues
used
to
first
detect
and
them
measure
the
flux
of
interstellar
dust
particles
streaming
into
the
solar
system
.
(
This
is
a
kind
of
&quot;
wind
&quot;
of
interstellar
dust
,
caused
by
the
fact
that
our
solar
system
is
moving
with
respect
to
the
local
interstellar
medium
.
)
Markus
Landgraf
has
estimated
the
number
of
interstellar
dust
particles
that
should
have
been
captured
by
Stardust
during
two
periods
of
the
&quot;
cruise
&quot;
phase
of
the
interplanetary
orbit
in
which
the
spacecraft
was
moving
with
this
wind
.
He
estimated
that
there
should
be
around
45
particles
,
but
this
number
is
very
uncertain
—
I
would
n't
be
surprised
if
it
is
quite
different
from
that
.
That
was
the
long
answer
!
One
thing
that
I
should
say
...
is
that
like
all
research
,
the
outcome
of
what
we
are
doing
is
highly
uncertain
.
There
is
a
wonderful
quote
attributed
to
Einstein
—
&quot;
If
we
knew
what
we
were
doing
,
it
would
n't
be
called
&quot;
research
&quot;
,
would
it
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
How
big
would
the
samples
be
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
We
expect
that
the
particles
will
be
of
order
a
micron
in
size
.
(
A
millionth
of
a
meter
.
)
When
people
are
searching
using
the
virtual
microscope
,
they
will
be
looking
not
for
the
particles
,
but
for
the
tracks
that
the
particles
make
,
which
are
much
larger
—
several
microns
in
diameter
.
Just
yesterday
we
switched
over
to
a
new
site
which
has
a
demo
of
the
VM
(
virtual
microscope
)
I
invite
you
to
check
it
out
.
The
tracks
in
the
demo
are
from
submicron
carbonyl
iron
particles
that
were
shot
into
aerogel
using
a
particle
accelerator
modified
to
accelerate
dust
particles
to
very
high
speeds
,
to
simulate
the
interstellar
dust
impacts
that
we
're
looking
for
.

<hi rend="bold">
And
that
's
on
the
main
Stardust@home
website
[
see
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Main_Page#External_links">
below
</ref>
]
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
Yes
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
How
long
will
the
project
take
to
complete
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
Partly
the
answer
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
&quot;
the
project
&quot;
.
The
search
will
take
several
months
.
The
bottleneck
,
we
expect
(
but
do
n't
really
know
yet
)
is
in
the
scanning
—
we
can
only
scan
about
one
tile
per
day
and
there
are
130
tiles
in
the
collector
…
.
These
particles
will
be
quite
diverse
,
so
we
're
hoping
that
we
'll
continue
to
have
lots
of
volunteers
collaborating
with
us
on
this
after
the
initial
discoveries
.
It
may
be
that
the
50th
particle
that
we
find
will
be
the
real
Rosetta
stone
that
turns
out
to
be
critical
to
our
understanding
of
interstellar
dust
.
So
we
really
want
to
find
them
all
!
Enlarging
the
idea
of
the
project
a
little
,
beyond
the
search
,
though
is
to
actually
analyze
these
particles
.
That
's
the
whole
point
,
obviously
!
