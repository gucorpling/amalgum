Become
a
Wildlife
Rehabilitator
</head>
<p>
Wild
animals
that
are
hurt
or
sick
need
care
,
just
like
any
other
animal
.
Some
veterinarians
specialize
in
this
kind
of
work
,
but
the
main
group
of
people
responsible
for
healing
wild
animals
are
wildlife
rehabilitators
.
Becoming
a
wildlife
rehabilitator
can
take
a
long
time
--
you
will
need
to
be
properly
trained
and
licensed
to
work
with
wild
animals
--
but
can
be
a
very
rewarding
career
.

Get
vaccinated
.
Be
prepared
,
because
the
rehabilitation
center
will
ask
you
to
get
certain
vaccinations
,
and
provide
the
paperwork
for
them
.
A
Rabies
vaccine
is
a
must
.

Find
a
center
where
you
can
volunteer
.

area

If
you
ca
n’t
locate
any
on
that
site
,
call
your
state
Game
and
Wildlife
Commission
for
a
list
of
rehabilitators
in
your
state
.
The
&quot;
busy
season
&quot;
for
wildlife
centers
starts
in
the
spring
.
This
is
when
baby
animals
are
born
,
and
the
boom
continues
through
the
summer
.
Most
places
have
limited
acceptance
periods
,
so
they
can
have
a
trained
staff
on
hand
for
spring
.
Think
about
volunteering
at
a
couple
different
places
to
see
which
kinds
of
animals
you
’d
like
to
work
with
.

Volunteer
at
a
wildlife
rehabilitation
center
.
Your
experience
might
include
doing
office
work
,
helping
to
fundraise
,
or
assisting
with
some
of
the
animal
care
.
At
first
,
you
will
not
be
doing
much
with
animals
,
but
you
might
be
helping
to
prepare
food
or
ready
or
clean
cages
or
bedding
.
As
you
get
more
experience
,
you
might
be
able
to
do
more
hands-on
work
with
the
animals
.
You
will
need
to
meet
these
basic
criteria
before
beginning

might

rehabilitator
,

it
might
be
different
than

Ask

her
to
get
a
sense
of

do
every

Get
a
college
degree
in
biology
or
ecology
.
Even
though
for
some
positions
a
college
degree
is
not
required
,
it
is
for
most
.
A
major
in
a
biology-related
field
,
including
coursework
on
mammalogy
,
ornithology
,
animal
behavior
,
and
ecology
would
be
the
best
preparation
for
becoming

These
courses
would
give
you
a
background
in
the
way
animals
function
and
their
environment

Approach
the

This
is
a
year(or
more
)
in

your
hours
are
carefully
documented

cataloged

followed

Hopefully
you
’ve
been
able
to
network
and
meet
enough
people
during
the
time
you
were
volunteering
and
training
that
you
have
a

that

you

Keep
up

If
you
want
to
work
at
one
particular

,
keep

Work
hard
rehabilitating
wildlife
.
Most
wildlife
rehabilitators
work
closely
with
a
veterinarian
to
care
for
wild
animals
in
their
care
.
As
a
wildlife
rehabilitator
,
each
day
is
likely
to
be
different
as
you
care
for
a
variety
of
hurt
and
sick
animals
.
You
will
be
caring
for
traumatized
or
wounded
animals
,
new
babies
whose
parents
cannot
care
for
them
,
animals
who
are
disabled
in
some
way
,
all
of
whom
are
wild
and
undomesticated
.
Each
case
will
require
strong
knowledge
of
animal
behavior
and
biology
as
well
as
a
medical
expertise
to
make
a
diagnosis
and
create
a
treatment
plan
.

Keep
up
with
the
field
.
Stay
in
touch
with
the
other
people
in
your
network
involved
in
wildlife
rehabilitation
.
Take
courses
to
stay
current
in
your
licensing
.
Read
about
the
latest
innovations
and
discoveries
.
Think
about
whether
you
want
to
stay
in
your
current
position
,
or
if
you
want
to
change
in
the
future
--
perhaps
to
open
your
own
center
once
you
’re
an
experienced
wildlife
rehabilitator
.
