CHAPTER
XLIII
</head>
<p>
October
10th
.
—
Mr.
Huntingdon
returned
about
three
weeks
ago
.
His
appearance
,
his
demeanour
and
conversation
,
and
my
feelings
with
regard
to
him
,
I
shall
not
trouble
myself
to
describe
.
The
day
after
his
arrival
,
however
,
he
surprised
me
by
the
announcement
of
an
intention
to
procure
a
governess
for
little
Arthur
:
I
told
him
it
was
quite
unnecessary
,
not
to
say
ridiculous
,
at
the
present
season
:
I
thought
I
was
fully
competent
to
the
task
of
teaching
him
myself
—
for
some
years
to
come
,
at
least
:
the
child
’s
education
was
the
only
pleasure
and
business
of
my
life
;
and
since
he
had
deprived
me
of
every
other
occupation
,
he
might
surely
leave
me
that
.
</p>
<p>
He
said
I
was
not
fit
to
teach
children
,
or
to
be
with
them
:
I
had
already
reduced
the
boy
to
little
better
than
an
automaton
;
I
had
broken
his
fine
spirit
with
my
rigid
severity
;
and
I
should
freeze
all
the
sunshine
out
of
his
heart
,
and
make
him
as
gloomy
an
ascetic
as
myself
,
if
I
had
the
handling
of
him
much
longer
.
And
poor
Rachel
,
too
,
came
in
for
her
share
of
abuse
,
as
usual
;
he
cannot
endure
Rachel
,
because
he
knows
she
has
a
proper
appreciation
of
him
.
</p>
<p>
I
calmly
defended
our
several
qualifications
as
nurse
and
governess
,
and
still
resisted
the
proposed
addition
to
our
family
;
but
he
cut
me
short
by
saying
it
was
no
use
bothering
about
the
matter
,
for
he
had
engaged
a
governess
already
,
and
she
was
coming
next
week
;
so
that
all
I
had
to
do
was
to
get
things
ready
for
her
reception
.
This
was
a
rather
startling
piece
of
intelligence
.
I
ventured
to
inquire
her
name
and
address
,
by
whom
she
had
been
recommended
,
or
how
he
had
been
led
to
make
choice
of
her
.
</p>
<p>
‘
She
is
a
very
estimable
,
pious
young
person
,
’
said
he
;
‘
you
need
n’t
be
afraid
.
Her
name
is
Myers
,
I
believe
;
and
she
was
recommended
to
me
by
a
respectable
old
dowager
:
a
lady
of
high
repute
in
the
religious
world
.
I
have
not
seen
her
myself
,
and
therefore
cannot
give
you
a
particular
account
of
her
person
and
conversation
,
and
so
forth
;
but
,
if
the
old
lady
’s
eulogies
are
correct
,
you
will
find
her
to
possess
all
desirable
qualifications
for
her
position
:
an
inordinate
love
of
children
among
the
rest
.
’
</p>
<p>
All
this
was
gravely
and
quietly
spoken
,
but
there
was
a
laughing
demon
in
his
half-averted
eye
that
boded
no
good
,
I
imagined
.
However
,
I
thought
of
my
asylum
in
—
shire
,
and
made
no
further
objections
.
</p>
<p>
When
Miss
Myers
arrived
,
I
was
not
prepared
to
give
her
a
very
cordial
reception
.
Her
appearance
was
not
particularly
calculated
to
produce
a
favourable
impression
at
first
sight
,
nor
did
her
manners
and
subsequent
conduct
,
in
any
degree
,
remove
the
prejudice
I
had
already
conceived
against
her
.
Her
attainments
were
limited
,
her
intellect
noways
above
mediocrity
.
She
had
a
fine
voice
,
and
could
sing
like
a
nightingale
,
and
accompany
herself
sufficiently
well
on
the
piano
;
but
these
were
her
only
accomplishments
.
There
was
a
look
of
guile
and
subtlety
in
her
face
,
a
sound
of
it
in
her
voice
.
She
seemed
afraid
of
me
,
and
would
start
if
I
suddenly
approached
her
.
In
her
behaviour
she
was
respectful
and
complaisant
,
even
to
servility
:
she
attempted
to
flatter
and
fawn
upon
me
at
first
,
but
I
soon
checked
that
.
Her
fondness
for
her
little
pupil
was
overstrained
,
and
I
was
obliged
to
remonstrate
with
her
on
the
subject
of
over-indulgence
and
injudicious
praise
;
but
she
could
not
gain
his
heart
.
Her
piety
consisted
in
an
occasional
heaving
of
sighs
,
and
uplifting
of
eyes
to
the
ceiling
,
and
the
utterance
of
a
few
cant
phrases
.
She
told
me
she
was
a
clergyman
’s
daughter
,
and
had
been
left
an
orphan
from
her
childhood
,
but
had
had
the
good
fortune
to
obtain
a
situation
in
a
very
pious
family
;
and
then
she
spoke
so
gratefully
of
the
kindness
she
had
experienced
from
its
different
members
,
that
I
reproached
myself
for
my
uncharitable
thoughts
and
unfriendly
conduct
,
and
relented
for
a
time
,
but
not
for
long
:
my
causes
of
dislike
were
too
rational
,
my
suspicions
too
well
founded
for
that
;
and
I
knew
it
was
my
duty
to
watch
and
scrutinize
till
those
suspicions
were
either
satisfactorily
removed
or
confirmed
.
</p>
<p>
I
asked
the
name
and
residence
of
the
kind
and
pious
family
.
She
mentioned
a
common
name
,
and
an
unknown
and
distant
place
of
abode
,
but
told
me
they
were
now
on
the
Continent
,
and
their
present
address
was
unknown
to
her
.
I
never
saw
her
speak
much
to
Mr.
Huntingdon
;
but
he
would
frequently
look
into
the
school-room
to
see
how
little
Arthur
got
on
with
his
new
companion
,
when
I
was
not
there
.
In
the
evening
,
she
sat
with
us
in
the
drawing-room
,
and
would
sing
and
play
to
amuse
him
or
us
,
as
she
pretended
,
and
was
very
attentive
to
his
wants
,
and
watchful
to
anticipate
them
,
though
she
only
talked
to
me
;
indeed
,
he
was
seldom
in
a
condition
to
be
talked
to
.
Had
she
been
other
than
she
was
,
I
should
have
felt
her
presence
a
great
relief
to
come
between
us
thus
,
except
,
indeed
,
that
I
should
have
been
thoroughly
ashamed
for
any
decent
person
to
see
him
as
he
often
was
.
