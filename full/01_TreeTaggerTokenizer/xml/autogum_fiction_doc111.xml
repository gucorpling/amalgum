The
Devil
's
Trade
Mark
</head>
<p>
One
day
when
John
and
I
had
been
out
on
some
business
of
our
master
's
,
and
were
returning
gently
on
a
long
,
straight
road
,
at
some
distance
we
saw
a
boy
trying
to
leap
a
pony
over
a
gate
;
the
pony
would
not
take
the
leap
,
and
the
boy
cut
him
with
the
whip
,
but
he
only
turned
off
on
one
side
.
He
whipped
him
again
,
but
the
pony
turned
off
on
the
other
side
.
Then
the
boy
got
off
and
gave
him
a
hard
thrashing
,
and
knocked
him
about
the
head
;
then
he
got
up
again
and
tried
to
make
him
leap
the
gate
,
kicking
him
all
the
time
shamefully
,
but
still
the
pony
refused
.
When
we
were
nearly
at
the
spot
the
pony
put
down
his
head
and
threw
up
his
heels
,
and
sent
the
boy
neatly
over
into
a
broad
quickset
hedge
,
and
with
the
rein
dangling
from
his
head
he
set
off
home
at
a
full
gallop
.
John
laughed
out
quite
loud
.
“
Served
him
right
,
”
he
said
.
</p>
<p>
“
Oh
,
oh
,
oh
!
”
cried
the
boy
as
he
struggled
about
among
the
thorns
;
“
I
say
,
come
and
help
me
out
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Thank
ye
,
”
said
John
,
“
I
think
you
are
quite
in
the
right
place
,
and
maybe
a
little
scratching
will
teach
you
not
to
leap
a
pony
over
a
gate
that
is
too
high
for
him
,
”
and
so
with
that
John
rode
off
.
“
It
may
be
,
”
said
he
to
himself
,
“
that
young
fellow
is
a
liar
as
well
as
a
cruel
one
;
we
'll
just
go
home
by
Farmer
Bushby
's
,
Beauty
,
and
then
if
anybody
wants
to
know
you
and
I
can
tell
'
em
,
ye
see
.
”
So
we
turned
off
to
the
right
,
and
soon
came
up
to
the
stack-yard
,
and
within
sight
of
the
house
.
The
farmer
was
hurrying
out
into
the
road
,
and
his
wife
was
standing
at
the
gate
,
looking
very
frightened
.
</p>
<p>
“
Have
you
seen
my
boy
?
”
said
Mr.
Bushby
as
we
came
up
;
“
he
went
out
an
hour
ago
on
my
black
pony
,
and
the
creature
is
just
come
back
without
a
rider
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
should
think
,
sir
,
”
said
John
,
“
he
had
better
be
without
a
rider
,
unless
he
can
be
ridden
properly
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
What
do
you
mean
?
”
said
the
farmer
.
</p>
<p>
“
Well
,
sir
,
I
saw
your
son
whipping
,
and
kicking
,
and
knocking
that
good
little
pony
about
shamefully
because
he
would
not
leap
a
gate
that
was
too
high
for
him
.
The
pony
behaved
well
,
sir
,
and
showed
no
vice
;
but
at
last
he
just
threw
up
his
heels
and
tipped
the
young
gentleman
into
the
thorn
hedge
.
He
wanted
me
to
help
him
out
,
but
I
hope
you
will
excuse
me
,
sir
,
I
did
not
feel
inclined
to
do
so
.
There
's
no
bones
broken
,
sir
;
he
'll
only
get
a
few
scratches
.
I
love
horses
,
and
it
riles
me
to
see
them
badly
used
;
it
is
a
bad
plan
to
aggravate
an
animal
till
he
uses
his
heels
;
the
first
time
is
not
always
the
last
.
”
</p>
<p>
During
this
time
the
mother
began
to
cry
,
“
Oh
,
my
poor
Bill
,
I
must
go
and
meet
him
;
he
must
be
hurt
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
You
had
better
go
into
the
house
,
wife
,
”
said
the
farmer
;
“
Bill
wants
a
lesson
about
this
,
and
I
must
see
that
he
gets
it
;
this
is
not
the
first
time
,
nor
the
second
,
that
he
has
ill-used
that
pony
,
and
I
shall
stop
it
.
I
am
much
obliged
to
you
,
Manly
.
Good-evening
.
”
</p>
<p>
So
we
went
on
,
John
chuckling
all
the
way
home
;
then
he
told
James
about
it
,
who
laughed
and
said
,
“
Serve
him
right
.
I
knew
that
boy
at
school
;
he
took
great
airs
on
himself
because
he
was
a
farmer
's
son
;
he
used
to
swagger
about
and
bully
the
little
boys
.
Of
course
,
we
elder
ones
would
not
have
any
of
that
nonsense
,
and
let
him
know
that
in
the
school
and
the
playground
farmers
'
sons
and
laborers
'
sons
were
all
alike
.
I
well
remember
one
day
,
just
before
afternoon
school
,
I
found
him
at
the
large
window
catching
flies
and
pulling
off
their
wings
.
He
did
not
see
me
and
I
gave
him
a
box
on
the
ears
that
laid
him
sprawling
on
the
floor
.
Well
,
angry
as
I
was
,
I
was
almost
frightened
,
he
roared
and
bellowed
in
such
a
style
.
The
boys
rushed
in
from
the
playground
,
and
the
master
ran
in
from
the
road
to
see
who
was
being
murdered
.
Of
course
I
said
fair
and
square
at
once
what
I
had
done
,
and
why
;
then
I
showed
the
master
the
flies
,
some
crushed
and
some
crawling
about
helpless
,
and
I
showed
him
the
wings
on
the
window
sill
.
I
never
saw
him
so
angry
before
;
but
as
Bill
was
still
howling
and
whining
,
like
the
coward
that
he
was
,
he
did
not
give
him
any
more
punishment
of
that
kind
,
but
set
him
up
on
a
stool
for
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
,
and
said
that
he
should
not
go
out
to
play
for
that
week
.
Then
he
talked
to
all
the
boys
very
seriously
about
cruelty
,
and
said
how
hard-hearted
and
cowardly
it
was
to
hurt
the
weak
and
the
helpless
;
but
what
stuck
in
my
mind
was
this
,
he
said
that
cruelty
was
the
devil
's
own
trade-mark
,
and
if
we
saw
any
one
who
took
pleasure
in
cruelty
we
might
know
who
he
belonged
to
,
for
the
devil
was
a
murderer
from
the
beginning
,
and
a
tormentor
to
the
end
.
On
the
other
hand
,
where
we
saw
people
who
loved
their
neighbors
,
and
were
kind
to
man
and
beast
,
we
might
know
that
was
God
's
mark
.
