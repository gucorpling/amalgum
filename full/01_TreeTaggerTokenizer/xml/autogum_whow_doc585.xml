Be
Human
(
Philosophy
)
</head>
Being
human
is
a
lot
more
complicated
than
just
surviving
long
enough
to
reproduce
.
We
all
seek
a
purpose
in
life
and
hope
to
thrive
.
This
will
show
you
step
by
step
what
you
have
to
do
to
be
human
.
These
steps/parts
do
n’t
need
to
be
followed
in
any
particular
order
(
with
the
exception
of
part
0
being
first
)
.

Before
you
worry
about
the
semantics
of
the
human
condition
,
make
sure
you
can
take
care
of
your
physical
and
safety
needs
first
.
These
requirements
are
the
first
two
levels
of
Maslov
’s
Hierarchy
of
Needs
,
which
is
another
important
aspect
in
being
human
.
You
need
to
make
sure
you
are
able
to
get
sufficient
daily
nutrients
and
water
,
along
with
appropriate
shelter
for
you
environment
.
Once
you
physical
needs
are
taken
care
of
you
need
to
make
sure
you
are
as
safe
as
possible
.
Living
in
an
area
plagued
with
crime
or
war
will
jeopardize
your
survival
,
so
it
’s
important
to
live
in
a
safe
and
stable
place
.

Establish
A
Sense
Of
Self
</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Begin
to
worry
about
being
not
just
another
animal
,
but
a
human
being
.
And
to
be
a
human
you
need
to
have
an
identity
.
Being
human
is
a
lot
more
than
just
being
another
member
of
a
group
of
animals
working
together
for
survival
,
it
’s
about
being
your
own
individual
person
.
Figuring
out
exactly
who
you
are
can
be
tricky
though
,
and
is
often
something
that
takes
a
long
time
.
It
is
important
not
to
rush
in
deciding
who
you
are
.
Always
remember
that
people
can
change
,
it
’s
very
likely
you
will
be
a
different
person
at
different
times
in
your
life
and
that
’s
okay
.
The
step
below
outline
how
you
can
go
about
finding
out
who
you
are
</item>
<item>
Figure
out
what
you
like
and
potentially
what
you
want
to
do
with
your
life
.
Find
something
your
passionate
about
and
ask
if
it
’s
something
you
could
gear
your
life
towards
.
Spend
time
reading
and
explore
different
environments
to
see
what
you
like
.
For
example
,
if
you
know
you
love
food
and
preparing
food
,
maybe
consider
taking
some
cooking
classes
,
and
if
you
’re
still
young
,
consider
studying
culinary
arts
after
high
school
.
</item>
<item>
Travel
.
Travel
is
very
important
in
developing
a
sense
of
self
because
it
exposes
you
to
a
large
variety
of
cultures
and
environments
.
After
seeing
different
cultures
and
areas
,
you
can
decide
where
you
think
you
belong
.
Maybe
a
certain
country
would
be
a
more
appropriate
place
for
you
to
live
in
than
the
one
you
currently
reside
in
.
</item>
<item>
Find
role
models
.
It
’s
hard
to
figure
out
who
you
want
to
be
from
scratch
,
having
role
models
can
help
you
to
understand
who
you
might
want
to
be
.

Develop
Relationships
</head>
<p>
Relationships
are
incredibly
important
and
one
of
the
most
fundamental
parts
of
the
human
experience
.
No
Man
is
an
island
,
it
’s
important
to
have
people
you
can
trust
and
have
fun
with
.
</p>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Find
like-minded
people
who
share
your
interests
.
One
of
the
best
ways
to
start
a
friendship
is
to
find
something
to
do
together
.
This
allows
for
bonding
and
can
make
an
activity
a
lot
more
enjoyable
.
A
good
way
to
meet
people
with
similar
interests
is
to
join
a
club
or
sports
team
.
</item>
<item>
Develop
strong
relationships
with
your
family
.
Your
family
is
a
good
place
to
develop
lasting
relationships
since
most
people
are
very
close
with
their
families
and
live
with
them
.
Find
something
you
like
to
do
or
something
you
like
to
talk
about
with
someone
in
your
family
.
For
example
,
if
your
grandfather
likes
to
play
the
same
kinds
of
board
games
you
do
,
set
some
time
aside
to
create
a
game
night
.
</item>
<item>
Find
love
and
consider
starting
a
family
.
Friends
and
family
are
great
,
but
it
’s
also
important
to
have
someone
in
your
life
that
you
love
romantically
and
can
share
your
life
with
.
Love
is
a
very
important
part
of
the
human
experience
,
and
people
who
are
married
often
have
benefits
that
other
people
do
not
.

Find
Your
Purpose
In
Life
</head>
<p>
Finding
purpose
can
be
a
difficult
thing
to
do
,
especially
when
there
’s
the
possibility
that
we
live
in
a
purposeless
world
.
It
’s
important
to
find
a
reason
for
your
existence
,
and
something
that
fulfills
you
as
a
person
.
</p>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Think
about
how
you
want
to
be
remembered
.
A
good
way
to
figure
out
what
your
purpose
should
be
is
to
think
about
how
people
will
view
what
you
’ve
done
after
you
’ve
died
.
This
will
give
you
an
idea
of
what
you
should
gear
your
life
towards
.
For
example
,
if
you
think
the
most
important
thing
you
could
do
for
society
is
to
contribute
to
scientific
understanding
,
then
find
some
way
to
work
in
a
setting
devoted
towards
scientific
progress
.
</item>
<item>
Find
something
that
’s
fulfilling
and
enjoyable
.
Everyone
does
n’t
need
to
be
or
aspire
to
be
the
man
who
cures
cancer
,
or
solves
world
hunger
,
your
purpose
can
be
found
in
what
you
love
to
do
.
For
example
,
if
you
love
computers
and
video
games
maybe
consider
making
a
blog
or
writing
reviews
.
