Colorectal
cancer
(
CRC
)
,
the
most
prevalent
cancer
of
the
GI
tract
,
represents
the
third
most
commonly
diagnosed
malignancy
worldwide
in
men
and
women
and
the
second
largest
cause
of
death
in
Europe
related
to
cancer
.
Growth
factors
,
oncogenes
and
receptors
play
a
critical
role
in
the
tumorigenesis
,
and
the
propagation
of
CRC
.
However
,
other
environmental
and
genetic
factors
play
significant
roles
in
the
development
of
CRC
.
Over
the
last
two
decades
,
accumulating
evidence
has
demonstrated
that
several
members
of
the
TRP
family
channels
show
altered
expression
and
activity
in
cancer
cells
.
Levels
of
expression
of
TRPC
,
TRPM
,
and
TRPV
proteins
depend
on
the
cancer
stage
.
Those
differences
have
been
recognized
mainly
in
melanoma
,
glioma
and
prostate
,
breast
,
kidney
,
and
bladder
cancers
,
suggesting
an
oncogenic
role
for
some
TRPs
while
others
may
function
as
tumor
suppressors
.
TRPs
activity
implicates
many
aspects
of
cancer
development
or
“
hallmarks
of
cancer
”
,
such
as
tumor
migration
and
invasion
,
exaggerated
cell
proliferation
,
cell
survival
,
angiogenesis
,
and
enhanced
resistance
to
cell
death
.
</p>
<p>
To
date
,
TRPV1
and
TRPV6
have
been
exclusively
recognized
as
relevant
in
CRC
carcinogenesis
.
As
mentioned
above
,
the
TRPV1
channel
is
also
involved
in
IBD
,
a
chronic
disorder
strongly
correlated
with
risk
of
CRC
.
Animal
models
have
demonstrated
a
protective
role
for
TRPV1
in
the
tumorigenesis
of
colon
cancer
,
indeed
TRPV1-
Knockout
mice
exhibited
lower
expression
of
anti-inflammatory
neuropeptides
and
greater
occurrence
and
number
of
CRC
compared
with
controls
.
In
accordance
with
these
data
,
Sung
and
colleagues
demonstrated
that
agonist-mediated
activation
of
TRPV1
induced
apoptosis
of
CRC
cells
.
On
the
other
hand
,
an
overexpression
of
TRPV6
in
SW480
colorectal
cancer
cell
lines
and
colon
carcinomas
have
been
associated
with
an
enhanced
proliferation
of
malignant
cells
.
In
a
recent
report
,
Pérez-Riesgo
et
al.
have
assessed
differential
gene
expression
of
all
human
TRP
channels
by
Next
Generation
Sequencing
(
NGS
)
to
investigate
differences
in
expression
of
several
genes
involved
in
intracellular
Ca2+
transport
in
CRC
.
The
results
obtained
,
comparing
human
normal
colonic
cells
versus
human
colon
cancer
lines
,
revealed
that
only
a
dozen
of
the
TRPs
are
expressed
in
colonic
cells
,
either
normal
or
tumor
.
The
data
also
indicated
that
TRPV6
was
the
unique
TRP
gene
significantly
overexpressed
in
CRC
cells
,
resembling
the
previously
reported
enhanced
levels
of
TRPV6
in
prostate
cancer
.
Notwithstanding
,
the
functional
consequences
of
changes
in
expression
of
TRPV1
and
TRPV6
channels
in
CRC
remain
to
be
established
.
