The
Story
of
Weng
Cho
;
or
,
the
One
Devoid
of
Name
</head>
<p>
There
was
peach-blossom
in
the
orchards
of
Kien-fi
,
a
blue
sky
above
,
and
in
the
air
much
gladness
;
but
in
Wu
Chi
’s
yamen
gloom
hung
like
the
herald
of
a
thunderstorm
.
At
one
end
of
a
table
in
the
ceremonial
hall
sat
Wu
Chi
,
heaviness
upon
his
brow
,
deceit
in
his
eyes
,
and
a
sour
enmity
about
the
lines
of
his
mouth
;
at
the
other
end
stood
his
son
Weng
,
and
between
them
,
as
it
were
,
his
whole
life
lay
.
</p>
<p>
Wu
Chi
was
an
official
of
some
consequence
and
had
two
wives
,
as
became
him
.
His
union
with
the
first
had
failed
in
its
essential
purpose
;
therefore
he
had
taken
another
to
carry
on
the
direct
line
which
alone
could
bring
him
contentment
in
this
world
and
a
reputable
existence
in
the
next
.
This
degree
of
happiness
was
supplied
by
Weng
’s
mother
,
yet
she
must
ever
remain
but
a
“
secondary
wife
,
”
with
no
rights
and
a
very
insecure
position
.
In
the
heart
of
the
chief
wife
smouldered
a
most
bitter
hatred
,
but
the
hour
of
her
ascendancy
came
,
for
after
many
years
she
also
bore
her
lord
a
son
.
Thenceforward
she
was
strong
in
her
authority
;
but
Weng
’s
mother
remained
,
for
she
was
very
beautiful
,
and
despite
all
the
arts
of
the
other
woman
Wu
Chi
could
not
be
prevailed
upon
to
dismiss
her
.
The
easy
solution
of
this
difficulty
was
that
she
soon
died
--
the
“
white
powder
death
”
was
the
shrewd
comment
of
the
inner
chambers
of
Kien-fi
.
</p>
<p>
Wu
Chi
put
on
no
mourning
,
custom
did
not
require
it
;
and
now
that
the
woman
had
Passed
Beyond
he
saw
no
necessity
to
honour
her
memory
at
the
expense
of
his
own
domestic
peace
.
His
wife
donned
her
gayest
robes
and
made
a
feast
.
Weng
alone
stood
apart
,
and
in
funereal
sackcloth
moved
through
the
house
like
an
accusing
ghost
.
Each
day
his
father
met
him
with
a
frown
,
the
woman
whom
alone
he
must
regard
as
his
mother
with
a
mocking
smile
,
but
he
passed
them
without
any
word
of
dutiful
and
submissive
greeting
.
The
period
of
all
seemly
mourning
ended
--
it
touched
that
allotted
to
a
legal
parent
;
still
Weng
cast
himself
down
and
made
no
pretence
to
hide
his
grief
.
His
father
’s
frown
became
a
scowl
,
his
mother
’s
smile
framed
a
biting
word
.
A
wise
and
venerable
friend
who
loved
the
youth
took
him
aside
one
day
and
with
many
sympathetic
words
counselled
restraint
.
</p>
<p>
“
For
,
”
he
said
,
“
your
conduct
,
though
affectionate
towards
the
dead
,
may
be
urged
by
the
ill-disposed
as
disrespectful
towards
the
living
.
If
you
have
a
deeper
end
in
view
,
strive
towards
it
by
a
less
open
path
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
You
are
subtle
and
esteemed
in
wisdom
,
”
replied
Weng
,
“
but
neither
of
those
virtues
can
restore
a
broken
jar
.
The
wayside
fountain
must
one
day
dry
up
at
its
source
,
but
until
then
not
even
a
mountain
placed
upon
its
mouth
can
pen
back
its
secret
stores
.
So
is
it
with
unfeigned
grief
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
The
analogy
may
be
exact
,
”
replied
the
aged
friend
,
shaking
his
head
,
“
but
it
is
no
less
truly
said
:
‘
The
wise
tortoise
keeps
his
pain
inside
.
’
Rest
assured
,
on
the
disinterested
advice
of
one
who
has
no
great
experience
of
mountains
and
hidden
springs
,
but
a
life-long
knowledge
of
Wu
Chi
and
of
his
amiable
wife
,
that
if
you
mourn
too
much
you
will
have
reason
to
mourn
more
.
”
</p>
<p>
His
words
were
pointed
to
a
sharp
edge
.
At
that
moment
Wu
Chi
was
being
confronted
by
his
wife
,
who
stood
before
him
in
his
inner
chamber
.
“
Who
am
I
?
”
she
exclaimed
vehemently
,
“
that
my
authority
should
be
denied
before
my
very
eyes
?
Am
I
indeed
Che
of
the
house
of
Meng
,
whose
ancestors
wore
the
Yellow
Scabbard
,
or
am
I
some
nameless
one
?
Or
does
my
lord
sleep
,
or
has
he
fallen
blind
upon
the
side
by
which
Weng
approaches
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
His
heart
is
bad
and
his
instincts
perverted
,
”
replied
Wu
Chi
dully
.
“
He
ignores
the
rites
,
custom
,
and
the
Emperor
’s
example
,
and
sets
at
defiance
all
the
principles
of
domestic
government
.
Do
not
fear
that
I
shall
not
shortly
call
him
to
account
with
a
very
heavy
call
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Do
so
,
my
lord
,
”
said
his
wife
darkly
,
“
or
many
valiant
champions
of
the
House
of
Meng
may
press
forward
to
make
a
cast
of
that
same
account
.
To
those
of
our
ancient
line
it
would
not
seem
a
trivial
thing
that
their
daughter
should
share
her
rights
with
a
purchased
slave
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Peace
,
cockatrice
!
the
woman
was
well
enough
,
”
exclaimed
Wu
Chi
,
with
slow
resentment
.
“
But
the
matter
of
this
obstinacy
touches
the
dignity
of
my
own
authority
,
and
before
to-day
has
passed
Weng
shall
bring
up
his
footsteps
suddenly
before
a
solid
wall
.
”
</p>
<p>
Accordingly
,
when
Weng
returned
at
his
usual
hour
he
found
his
father
awaiting
him
with
curbed
impatience
.
That
Wu
Chi
should
summon
him
into
his
presence
in
the
great
hall
was
of
itself
an
omen
that
the
matter
was
one
of
moment
,
but
the
profusion
of
lights
before
the
Ancestral
Tablets
and
the
various
symbols
arranged
upon
the
table
showed
that
the
occasion
was
to
be
regarded
as
one
involving
irrevocable
issues
.
</p>
<p>
“
Weng
Cho
,
”
said
his
father
dispassionately
,
from
his
seat
at
the
head
of
the
table
,
“
draw
near
,
and
first
pledge
the
Ancient
Ones
whose
spirits
hover
above
their
Tablets
in
a
vessel
of
wine
.
