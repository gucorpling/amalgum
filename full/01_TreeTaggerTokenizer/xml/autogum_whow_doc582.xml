Understand
Life
</head>
<p>
So
far
,
I
have
finished
one
way
to
develop
life
and
universe
understanding
.
More
are
coming
.
Please
comment
on
anything
you
think
is
a
good
method
.
Or
,
put
you
method
into
the
comments
box
.
Which
way
?
Who
knows
?
Do
you
even
understand
the
questions
you
are
asking
about
questions
?
But
is
the
question
really
about
questions
?
Dig
deep
,
always
deep
.
Unless
,
it
's
digging
you
in
deep
.
Understand
the
universe
and
all
it
's
life
,
let
it
understand
you
.

I
also
at
a
point
thought
that
yoga
was
pointless
.
Then
,
I
realized
how
much
it
it
helped
me
and
gave
me
a
way
to
stay
peaceful
and
calm
the
rest
of
the
day
.
However
if
this
does
n't
work
for
you
,
then
there
are
other
ways
.
However
,
I
encourage
trying
it
at
least
once
.

Find
a
wide
and
spacious
area
where
you
can
set
up
.
This
is
a
very
important
step
,
because
small
areas
can
do
the
opposite
of
give
you
meaning
,
and
instead
just
make
you
feel
stuck
and
unimportant
.
This
is
not
what
you
want
.
</item>
<item>
Lay
down
several
mats
,
even
if
it
is
just
you
.
Having
more
room
than
you
need
is
a
good
thing
,
and
maybe
even
essential
,
depending
on
the
person
.
Make
sure
that
the
mats
are
both
thick
,
and
soft
,
as
if
you
could
dig
into
the
endless
meaning
of
life
through
it
.

Turn
on
some
soothing
music
.
Now
,
when
I
say
&quot;
soothing
music
&quot;
,
I
mean
soothing
to
you
.
If
rock
and
roll
or
heavy
metal
are
your
favorite
kinds
of
music
,
go
for
it
!
It
does
not
have
to
be
slow
,
or
quiet
.
</item>
<item>
Create
a
motivation
.
Do
not
buy
therapy
cards
,
or
any
kind
of
idea
givers
.
Think
of
one
yourself
,
otherwise
you
'll
find
that
you
are
convincing
yourself
that
something
someone
else
said
is
you
.
That
is
not
always
true
,
and
it
takes
a
lot
to
figure
out
what
exactly
is
real
,
and
what
is
just
a
mindset
.
</item>
<item>
Either
do
poses
,
or
lie
down
thinking
.
Ask
yourself
questions
like
,
How
important
to
me
is
my
motavation
?
What
would
change
in
the
world
without
me
?
Suppose
I
put
all
my
effort
into
improving
the
world
.
How
would
it
change
?
How
much
am
I
capable
of
?
Do
I
have
any
beliefs
or
religions
?
How
do
they
effect
how
I
think
or
act
?
This
should
lead
to
more
questions
,
unless
you
are
n't
really
thinking
.
Do
n't
think
too
hard
,
or
it
will
tire
you
and
distract
you
from
obvious
answers
.
If
this
takes
you
hours
,
it
is
OK
.
Do
n't
worry
about
work
,
or
appointments
,
anything
you
are
late
for
.
It
is
just
you
.
What
is
more
important
?
Full
Meaning
or
Jobs
?
