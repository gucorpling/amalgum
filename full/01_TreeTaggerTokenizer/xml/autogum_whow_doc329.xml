Eat
warm
foods
.
Staying
warm
and
cozy
means
burning
more
calories
.
You
can
stay
happy
and
healthy
during
the
winter
by
eating
hearty
stews
and
warm
chilis
.
If
your
belly
is
nice
and
full
of
good
warm
stuff
,
you
are
less
likely
to
be
affected
by
cabin
fever

Get
some
vitamin
D.
The
number
one
cause
of
seasonal
depression
is
lack
of
sunlight
(
or
vitamin
D
)
.
Add
some
vitamin
D
to
your
diet
by
eating
fish
,
mushroom
,
fortified
milk
,
or
taking
supplements
.
Also
,
look
for
the
sun
anywhere
you
can
!
Sit
in
front
of
a
window
or
bundle
up
and
head
out
onto
your
porch
for
a
few
minutes
.
If
you
live
in
a
region
with
very
little
natural
sunlight
,
consider
investing
in
a
sunlamp
.

Eat
healthy
sugar
.
Lack
of
sunlight
can
cause
us
to
crave
high-sugar
foods
.
Give
yourself
a
sweet
sugar
boost
in
a
healthy
way
to
help
keep
cabin
fever
away
.
Try
dark
chocolate
covered
cherries
,
dried
mangoes
,
or
carrots
roasted
with
a
little
honey
to
satisfy
your
sugar
cravings
and
boost
your
mood

Avoid
binging
on
TV
or
movies
.
Watching
a
movie
or
a
few
episodes
of
a
TV
show
can
be
a
great
way
to
pass
the
time
indoors
.
But
spending
the
whole
day
(
or
night
)
binge
watching
,
is
likely
to
contribute
to
feelings
of
listlessness
and
depression
,
inviting
cabin
fever
in
to
stay
.
Limit
yourself
to
an
hour
or
two
of
TV
time
each
day
,
or
less
.

Avoid
binging
on
food
.
When
there
is
nothing
much
to
do
,
people
have
a
tendency
to
stuff
themselves
full
of
high-carb
,
high-calorie
foods
.
While
snacking
can
be
fun
and
uplifting
,
overdoing
it
will
make
you
feel
heavy
,
and
put
you
in
a
bad
mood
.
Exercise
some
portion
control
when
snacking
.
Endlessly
eating
in
front
of
the
TV
actually
encourages
feelings
of
cabin
fever
.

Engage
your
mind
.
Doing
anything
that
stimulates
your
cognitive
capacities
is
wonderful
for
banishing
cabin
fever
.
Try
doing
a
crossword
puzzle
,
Sudoku
,
or
just
reading
a
book
.
If
you
can
do
this
activity
while
sitting
in
front
of
a
window
,
even
better
!
