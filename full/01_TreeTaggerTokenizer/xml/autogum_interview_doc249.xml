DS
:
With
obsessions
such
as
paraphilias
,
a
person
presents
things
to
themselves
in
a
series
of
questions
.
What
if
I
'm
really
gay
?
What
if
I
really
want
to
seduce
my
patient
?
What
if
I
really
was
aroused
by
a
picture
of
that
child
?
If
someone
comes
to
you
and
says
,
'
I
just
ca
n't
get
out
of
my
head
the
thought
that
I
want
to
kill
my
baby
'
,
how
do
you
handle
such
a
challenging
problem
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
JM
:
</hi>
It
is
very
challenging
.
Obviously
,
the
risk
of
potential
outcome
judges
how
intense
the
intervention
has
to
be
.
For
example
,
someone
who
is
thinking
a
lot
about
wanting
to
kill
his
or
her
child
,
that
is
a
very
serious
thing
.
An
evaluation
would
have
to
look
very
carefully
at
what
is
the
likelihood
of
such
a
thing
happening
,
is
it
really
a
symbolic
way
of
expressing
something
?
For
example
,
'
Susie
pissed
me
off
so
much
I
could
kill
her
.
'
As
opposed
to
having
a
vision
of
slashing
her
throat
,
burning
her
body
and
tossing
her
into
the
ocean
.
That
would
be
considered
a
very
serious
concern
.
</p>
<p>

DS
:
The
difference
is
between
having
a
thought
occur
,
and
actually
acting
it
out
in
one
's
head
?
It
's
&quot;
I
thought
about
wanting
to
kill
my
baby
,
&quot;
versus
,
&quot;
I
'm
picturing
drowning
my
baby
in
the
bathtub
almost
every
night
I
wash
her
.
&quot;
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
JM
:
</hi>
Yes
,
that
is
the
very
important
differential
.
Many
of
us
have
all
kinds
of
thoughts
,
like
the
seduction
of
a
student
by
a
teacher
,
or
those
kinds
of
things
.
We
have
them
,
it
's
part
of
our
humanity
.
The
taboo
nature
makes
it
alluring
.
But
it
's
when
the
person
<hi rend="italic">
fears
</hi>
losing
control
,
and
the
ability
to
control
the
thinking
.
There
's
a
very
big
difference
between
a
thought
and
an
action
.

DS
:
I
have
a
personal
example
that
makes
me
laugh
.
There
is
a
60-year-old
woman
at
work
named
Barbara
who
I
have
never
met
,
but
to
whom
I
have
spoken
on
the
phone
.
I
do
n't
know
many
Barbaras
,
but
I
remember
the
opening
scene
of
<hi rend="italic">
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night%20of%20the%20Living%20Dead">
Night
of
the
Living
Dead
</ref>
</hi>
where
the
brother
and
sister
are
in
the
cemetery
and
to
give
the
sister
,
Barbara
,
a
scare
,
the
brother
starts
going
,
&quot;
Baahbarah
,
Baaahbarah
,
they
are
coming
to
get
you
,
Barbara
.
&quot;
It
makes
me
laugh
to
imagine
a
scenario
of
calling
this
60-year-old
Barbara
at
work
and
saying
that
into
the
phone
.
I
have
acted
this
out
many
,
many
times
with
my
office
mates
,
and
it
makes
us
laugh
.
It
's
making
me
laugh
now
,
the
thought
of
doing
something
that
bizarre
—

JM

</hi>
[

Laughs

And
behind
this
is
what
?

<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
Behind
it
is
the
idea
...
I
would
never
...

Barbara
's
the
boss
?
