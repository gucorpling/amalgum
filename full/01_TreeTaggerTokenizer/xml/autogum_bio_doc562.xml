He
came

rule

.
When

died

before

,
he
repeatedly
addressed
the
populace
to
overthrow
the
papal

to
replace

by
one
based
on
the
ancient
Roman

against

government

led
the

to
exile

Roberto
Cessi
suggests
that
if
this
was
taken
as
anything
more
than
a
criticism
of
the
local
city
administrators
,
he
would
have
been

he
organized
an
insurrection

result
would
be
the
proclamation
of
the
Republic
and
,
for
Porcari
,
the
title
of
tribune
,
the
same
held
by

The
action
was
set

and
would
be
backed
by
some
three
