Q
:
</hi>
What
does
Toronto
mean
to
you
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
A
:
</hi>
For
me
,
Toronto
means
unique
communities
working
together
to
make
a
great
City
.
I
love
living
in
east
Scarborough
with
the
Rouge
Park
and
the
waterfront
trail
on
my
doorstep
.
While
I
think
my
own
community
is
a
pretty
remarkable
place
,
I
ca
n't
imagine
Toronto
with
the
Taste
of
the
Danforth
,
the
jazz
festivals
,
the
energy
of
downtown
,
all
its
restaurants
,
or
the
tranquility
of
High
Park
.
Each
community
has
something
to
offer
and
together
they
combine
to
make
our
City
a
vibrant
place
to
live
.

Q
:
</hi>
Describe
the
three
most
important
issues
in
your
campaign
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
A
:
</hi>
Transportation
is
a
crucial
issue
for
the
people
of
Ward
44
as
our
ward
is
the
most
eastern
section
of
Toronto
and
many
people
,
including
seniors
and
students
,
find
that
there
is
simply
insufficient
bus
and
transit
service
to
cover
the
growing
population
of
the
ward
.
The
Scarborough
Subway
needs
to
be
expanded
but
unfortunately
,
due
to
political
agendas
North
York
continues
to
receive
all
the
subway
infrastructure
dollars
while
Scarborough
continues
to
be
denied
a
proper
transportation
network
.
</p>
<p>
Subsidized
Housing
v.
Green
Space
and
the
loss
of
valuable
green
space
is
of
particular
interest
to
Ward
44
residents
who
feel
betrayed
by
downtown
politicians
and
their
own
retiring
councillor
who
approved
a
fairly
large
subsidized
housing
project
(
Manse
Valley
)
that
is
slated
to
be
built
in
the
ward
.
The
City
of
Toronto
has
a
horrendous
record
when
it
gets
involved
in
subsidized
housing
often
turning
beautiful
neighbourhoods
into
cesspools
of
criminality
in
the
process
.
</p>
<p>
Community
Services
are
important
to
a
great
many
people
in
Ward
44
to
address
the
needs
of
youth
,
seniors
and
special
needs
residents
.
Youth
services
are
crucial
in
order
to
engage
teenagers
and
to
teach
them
the
value
and
duty
of
community
living
.
Senior
citizens
for
example
,
have
given
so
much
to
the
community
and
are
still
contributing
members
and
we
must
do
everything
in
our
power
to
make
their
'
golden
years
'
truly
golden
.
Additionally
,
people
with
special
needs
are
extremely
vulnerable
and
need
our
community
support
in
order
to
give
them
the
opportunity
to
be
the
best
that
they
can
be
.
To
this
end
an
ultra
modern
Community
Centre
in
the
Highland
Creek
section
of
Ward
44
would
be
extremely
beneficial
in
addressing
the
community
needs
of
everyone
living
in
Ward
44
.

Q
:
</hi>
What
one
election
issue
do
you
feel
is
most
relevant
to
your
ward
in
this
election
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
A
:
</hi>
Commitment
to
our
community
is
the
biggest
issue
.
The
people
of
Ward
44
feel
abandoned
since
the
last
two
councillors
that
they
elected
refused
to
represent
them
to
the
fullest
extent
of
their
abilities
.
The
incumbent
,
Gay
Cowbourne
,
has
now
resigned
after
allowing
her
assistants
to
run
the
ward
(
to
which
they
failed
miserably
)
.
The
previous
councillor
,
Ron
Moeser
missed
almost
half
of
all
crucial
votes
at
City
Hall
during
his
lethargic
tenure
.
Voters
want
someone
who
will
represent
them
at
City
Hall
and
not
someone
who
cannot
even
be
bothered
to
show
up
except
to
collect
their
paycheques
.
