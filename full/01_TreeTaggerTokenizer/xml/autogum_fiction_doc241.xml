The
Essen
Barges
</head>
<p>
I
lay
for
four
days
like
a
log
in
that
garret
bed
.
The
storm
died
down
,
the
thaw
set
in
,
and
the
snow
melted
.
The
children
played
about
the
doors
and
told
stories
at
night
round
the
fire
.
Stumm
's
myrmidons
no
doubt
beset
every
road
and
troubled
the
lives
of
innocent
wayfarers
.
But
no
one
came
near
the
cottage
,
and
the
fever
worked
itself
out
while
I
lay
in
peace
.
</p>
<p>
It
was
a
bad
bout
,
but
on
the
fifth
day
it
left
me
,
and
I
lay
,
as
weak
as
a
kitten
,
staring
at
the
rafters
and
the
little
skylight
.
It
was
a
leaky
,
draughty
old
place
,
but
the
woman
of
the
cottage
had
heaped
deerskins
and
blankets
on
my
bed
and
kept
me
warm
.
She
came
in
now
and
then
,
and
once
she
brought
me
a
brew
of
some
bitter
herbs
which
greatly
refreshed
me
.
A
little
thin
porridge
was
all
the
food
I
could
eat
,
and
some
chocolate
made
from
the
slabs
in
my
rucksack
.
</p>
<p>
I
lay
and
dozed
through
the
day
,
hearing
the
faint
chatter
of
children
below
,
and
getting
stronger
hourly
.
Malaria
passes
as
quickly
as
it
comes
and
leaves
a
man
little
the
worse
,
though
this
was
one
of
the
sharpest
turns
I
ever
had
.
As
I
lay
I
thought
,
and
my
thoughts
followed
curious
lines
.
One
queer
thing
was
that
Stumm
and
his
doings
seemed
to
have
been
shot
back
into
a
lumber-room
of
my
brain
and
the
door
locked
.
He
did
n't
seem
to
be
a
creature
of
the
living
present
,
but
a
distant
memory
on
which
I
could
look
calmly
.
I
thought
a
good
deal
about
my
battalion
and
the
comedy
of
my
present
position
.
You
see
I
was
getting
better
,
for
I
called
it
comedy
now
,
not
tragedy
.
</p>
<p>
But
chiefly
I
thought
of
my
mission
.
All
that
wild
day
in
the
snow
it
had
seemed
the
merest
farce
.
The
three
words
Harry
Bullivant
had
scribbled
had
danced
through
my
head
in
a
crazy
fandango
.
They
were
present
to
me
now
,
but
coolly
and
sanely
in
all
their
meagreness
.
</p>
<p>
I
remember
that
I
took
each
one
separately
and
chewed
on
it
for
hours
.
<hi rend="italic">
Kasredin
</hi>
--
there
was
nothing
to
be
got
out
of
that
.
<hi rend="italic">
Cancer
</hi>
--
there
were
too
many
meanings
,
all
blind
.
<hi rend="italic">
V.
I.
</hi>
--
that
was
the
worst
gibberish
of
all
.
</p>
<p>
Before
this
I
had
always
taken
the
I
as
the
letter
of
the
alphabet
.
I
had
thought
the
v.
must
stand
for
von
,
and
I
had
considered
the
German
names
beginning
with
I
--
Ingolstadt
,
Ingeburg
,
Ingenohl
,
and
all
the
rest
of
them
.
I
had
made
a
list
of
about
seventy
at
the
British
Museum
before
I
left
London
.
</p>
<p>
Now
I
suddenly
found
myself
taking
the
I
as
the
numeral
One
.
Idly
,
not
thinking
what
I
was
doing
,
I
put
it
into
German
.
</p>
<p>
Then
I
nearly
fell
out
of
the
bed
.
<hi rend="italic">
Von
Einem
</hi>
--
the
name
I
had
heard
at
Gaudian
's
house
,
the
name
Stumm
had
spoken
behind
his
hand
,
the
name
to
which
Hilda
was
probably
the
prefix
.
It
was
a
tremendous
discovery
--
the
first
real
bit
of
light
I
had
found
.
Harry
Bullivant
knew
that
some
man
or
woman
called
von
Einem
was
at
the
heart
of
the
mystery
.
Stumm
had
spoken
of
the
same
personage
with
respect
and
in
connection
with
the
work
I
proposed
to
do
in
raising
the
Moslem
Africans
.
If
I
found
von
Einem
I
would
be
getting
very
warm
.
What
was
the
word
that
Stumm
had
whispered
to
Gaudian
and
scared
that
worthy
?
It
had
sounded
like
<hi rend="italic">
uhnmantl
</hi>
.
If
I
could
only
get
that
clear
,
I
would
solve
the
riddle
.
</p>
<p>
I
think
that
discovery
completed
my
cure
.
At
any
rate
on
the
evening
of
the
fifth
day
--
it
was
Wednesday
,
the
29th
of
December
--
I
was
well
enough
to
get
up
.
When
the
dark
had
fallen
and
it
was
too
late
to
fear
a
visitor
,
I
came
downstairs
and
,
wrapped
in
my
green
cape
,
took
a
seat
by
the
fire
.
</p>
<p>
As
we
sat
there
in
the
firelight
,
with
the
three
white-headed
children
staring
at
me
with
saucer
eyes
,
and
smiling
when
I
looked
their
way
,
the
woman
talked
.
Her
man
had
gone
to
the
wars
on
the
Eastern
front
,
and
the
last
she
had
heard
from
him
he
was
in
a
Polish
bog
and
longing
for
his
dry
native
woodlands
.
The
struggle
meant
little
to
her
.
It
was
an
act
of
God
,
a
thunderbolt
out
of
the
sky
,
which
had
taken
a
husband
from
her
,
and
might
soon
make
her
a
widow
and
her
children
fatherless
.
She
knew
nothing
of
its
causes
and
purposes
,
and
thought
of
the
Russians
as
a
gigantic
nation
of
savages
,
heathens
who
had
never
been
converted
,
and
who
would
eat
up
German
homes
if
the
good
Lord
and
the
brave
German
soldiers
did
not
stop
them
.
I
tried
hard
to
find
out
if
she
had
any
notion
of
affairs
in
the
West
,
but
she
had
n't
,
beyond
the
fact
that
there
was
trouble
with
the
French
.
I
doubt
if
she
knew
of
England
's
share
in
it
.
She
was
a
decent
soul
,
with
no
bitterness
against
anybody
,
not
even
the
Russians
if
they
would
spare
her
man
.
</p>
<p>
That
night
I
realized
the
crazy
folly
of
war
.
When
I
saw
the
splintered
shell
of
Ypres
and
heard
hideous
tales
of
German
doings
,
I
used
to
want
to
see
the
whole
land
of
the
Boche
given
up
to
fire
and
sword
.
I
thought
we
could
never
end
the
war
properly
without
giving
the
Huns
some
of
their
own
medicine
.
But
that
woodcutter
's
cottage
cured
me
of
such
nightmares
.
I
was
for
punishing
the
guilty
but
letting
the
innocent
go
free
.
It
was
our
business
to
thank
God
and
keep
our
hands
clean
from
the
ugly
blunders
to
which
Germany
's
madness
had
driven
her
.
What
good
would
it
do
Christian
folk
to
burn
poor
little
huts
like
this
and
leave
children
's
bodies
by
the
wayside
?
To
be
able
to
laugh
and
to
be
merciful
are
the
only
things
that
make
man
better
than
the
beasts
.
