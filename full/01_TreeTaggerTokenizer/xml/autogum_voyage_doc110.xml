Boston/Outer
Neighborhoods
</head>
<p>
The
<hi rend="bold">
Outer
Neighborhoods
</hi>
of
<ref target="Boston">
Boston
</ref>
are
four
distinct
neighborhoods
that
have
been
consolidated
here
for
the
visitor
.
These
areas
are
a
bit
further
from
the
city
center
and
can
take
a
little
planning
to
investigate
,
but
gems
abound
for
the
adventurous
!
Many
Bostonians
prize
the
residences
in
these
areas
for
their
suburban
feel
while
remaining
within
city
limits
.
</p>
<head>
Hyde
Park
</head>
<p>
The
southernmost
neighborhood
of
Boston
,
Hyde
Park
is
home
to
a
diverse
range
of
people
,
housing
types
and
social
groups
.
The
area
was
established
in
the
1660s
and
grew
into
a
hub
of
paper
and
cotton
manufacturing
in
the
eighteenth
century
.
The
extension
of
rail
lines
from
Boston
in
the
1850s
spurred
the
area
's
residential
development
.
</p>
<p>
Hyde
Park
was
once
home
to
the
first
all
African-American
army
unit
,
the
54th
Massachusetts
Infantry
Regiment
.
They
assembled
and
trained
at
Camp
Meigs
in
Readville
.
The
area
would
later
briefly
become
a
race
track
during
dawn
of
the
20th
century
,
before
being
used
as
an
air
combat
testing
facility
during
WWI
.
Today
it
is
a
series
of
light
industrial
buildings
near
the
Neponset
river
.
</p>
<head>
Mattapan
</head>
<p>
Historically
a
section
of
neighboring
Dorchester
,
Mattapan
became
a
part
of
Boston
when
Dorchester
was
annexed
in
1870
.
Predominantly
residential
,
Mattapan
is
a
mix
of
public
housing
,
triple
deckers
,
and
single-family
homes
.
Mattapan
Square
,
where
Blue
Hill
Avenue
,
River
Street
,
and
Cummins
Highway
meet
,
is
the
commercial
heart
of
the
neighborhood
,
home
to
banks
,
law
offices
,
restaurants
,
and
retail
shops
.
Mattapan
now
has
the
largest
Haitian
community
in
Massachusetts
,
and
is
also
largely
made
up
of
African
Americans
and
immigrants
from
other
Caribbean
countries
.
</p>
<head>
Roslindale
</head>
<p>
Roslindale
is
a
primarily
residential
neighborhood
six
miles
southwest
of
downtown
Boston
.
Originally
part
of
Roxbury
,
and
after
seceding
in
1851
—
the
town
then
voted
in
1873
to
be
annexed
to
the
City
of
Boston
.
Roslindale
grew
residentially
as
a
classic
streetcar
suburb
.
Railways
were
built
after
the
American
Civil
War
,
which
spawned
a
new
round
of
commercial
development
.
In
the
1920s
,
Roslindale
Village
took
the
shape
it
has
today
,
with
tree-lined
Adams
Park
at
its
center
.
</p>
<p>
That
tree
lined
park
surrounded
by
local
businesses
remains
attractive
to
Bostonians
in
the
21st
century
.
This
walkable
area
has
become
a
haven
for
those
priced
out
of
JP
and
other
areas
affected
by
gentrification
issues
.
Even
here
prices
have
seen
dramatic
rises
recently
,
and
residents
are
working
together
to
maintain
the
fabric
of
their
community
.
</p>
<head>
West
Roxbury
</head>
<p>
Founded
in
1630
,
West
Roxbury
is
nine
miles
from
downtown
Boston
,
and
was
originally
used
as
farm
land
by
the
then
independent
town
of
Roxbury
.
Seceding
in
1851
,
West
Roxbury
was
annexed
by
Boston
in
1874
.
Due
to
this
quirk
of
history
,
it
's
often
confused
with
Roxbury
,
although
the
two
are
not
connected
and
do
n't
share
a
border
.
</p>
<p>
This
neighborhood
's
claim
to
fame
is
that
it
once
played
host
to
an
experimental
Utopian
community
during
the
mid
19th
century
.
Called
<hi rend="italic">
Brook
Farm
</hi>
,
members
(
like
Nathaniel
Hawthorne
)
were
inspired
by
the
ideals
of
Transcendentalism
,
a
religious
and
cultural
philosophy
based
in
New
England
.
Ultimately
the
experiment
was
financially
unsuccessful
,
although
many
members
looked
back
on
their
experience
positively
.
Unfortunately
all
buildings
from
this
era
have
since
been
lost
to
fire
,
but
the
grounds
are
now
a
park
and
available
for
tours
.
</p>
<head>
By
car
</head>
<p>
The
car
is
the
premiere
way
to
get
around
in
these
neighborhoods
.
You
will
be
further
from
the
city
center
,
so
traffic
and
congestion
will
be
(
comparatively
)
less
of
an
issue
.
On
street
parking
is
cheap
and
easy
to
find
.
Most
attractions
here
are
further
apart
and
not
well
served
by
public
transit
.
While
not
necessary
,
a
car
will
make
your
life
easier
while
here
.
</p>
<head>
By
public
transit
</head>
<p>
Forest
Hills
station
on
the
Orange
line
in
Roslindale
is
the
only
option
for
direct
rapid
transit
into
the
city
.
The
next
closest
option
is
the
Ashmont
–
Mattapan
High
Speed
Line
,
a
historic
trolley
and
part
of
the
Red
line
.
The
last
stop
on
this
line
serves
Mattapan
.
Used
by
locals
daily
,
the
current
rolling
stock
was
built
at
the
end
of
WWII
and
is
a
tourist
attraction
for
any
train
enthusiast
.
</p>
<p>
Other
than
those
two
options
,
you
're
going
to
need
to
ride
the
commuter
rail
.
For
Hyde
Park
and
Mattapan
,
take
a
train
from
South
Station
on
the
Fairmount
,
Franklin
,
or
Providence/Stoughton
lines
.
For
Roslindale
or
West
Roxbury
get
on
the
Needham
line
,
also
from
South
Station
.
