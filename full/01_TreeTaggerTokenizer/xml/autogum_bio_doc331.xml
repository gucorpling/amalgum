a
seventeenth-century

considers
that
Coppe
took
most
of
his
theology
from
Coppin
.
After
the
suppression
of
episcopacy
(
9
October
1646
)
he
had
attached
himself
for
a
short
time
to
the
presbyterians
in
London
.
He
afterwards
was
an
Independent
.
Based
on
an
inward
experience
in
1648
he
was
not
to
exercise
a
settled
ministry
.
He
began
to
preach
in
Berkshire
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-DNB-4">
[

</ref>
</p>
<p>
He
was
constantly
in
trouble
,
well
documented
in
pamphlets
,
arising
from
the
1650
Blasphemy
Act
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-5">

</ref>
The
authorities
treated
him
leniently
in
the
period
1651
to
1655
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-6">
[

</ref>
</p>
<p>
He
first
got
into
serious
trouble
by
preaching
on
four
successive
days
in
the
parish
church
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evenlode">
Evenlode
</ref>
,
Worcestershire
.
He
had
been
invited
by
parishioners
,
with
the
consent
of
the
rector
,
Ralph
Nevil
.
Nevil
,
however
,
brought
neighbouring
clergy
to
discuss
matters
with
Coppin
in
the
church
,
and
eventually
got
a
warrant
against
him
for
blasphemy
.
Coppin
was
tried
before
Chief
Baron
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wilde_(jurist)">
John
Wilde
</ref>
at
the
Worcester
assizes
on
23
March
1652
.
The
jury
found
him
guilty
of
denying
heaven
and
hell
;
but
Wilde
reproved
them
for
their
verdict
,
and
bound
over
Coppin
to
appear
for
judgment
at
the
next
assize
.
By
that
time
his
accusers
had
fresh
evidence
,
relating
to
Coppin
's
proceedings
at
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enstone">
Enstone
</ref>
,
Oxfordshire
,
whereupon
Judge
Nicholes
bound
him
to
appear
at

Oxford
assize

On

he
was
tried
at

before
Serjeant
Green
;
the
jury
at
first
disagreed
,

eventually
found
him
guilty

Green
bound
him
over

About

Joseph

,

had
set

of
Sunday
preaching
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochester_Cathedral">

.
Salmon
was
an
allegorist
,
and
is
said
to
have
'
sowed
the
seeds
of
ranting
familism
.
'
In
midsummer
1655
Salmon
went
abroad
,
and
his
followers
brought
Coppin
from
London
to
fill
his
place
.
It
is
probable
that
his
acquaintance
with
Abiezer
Coppe
introduced
him
to
the
sectaries
of
Rochester
.

went
to
hear
Coppin
preach
,
and
gained
the
impression
that
he
affirmed
the
peccability
of
Christ
and
denied
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resurrection_of_the_dead">

</ref>
.
Rosewell
,
with
other
presbyterians
,
agreed
to
conduct
a
Tuesday
lecture
in
the
cathedral
to
counteract
Coppin
's
heresies
.
A
public
discussion
was
held
in
the
cathedral
(
from
3
to
13
December
)
between
Coppin
and
Rosewell
,
assisted
by
Daniel

,
minister
of

mayor
presiding
;
before
it
ended
,
Gaman
,
an
anabaptist
,
put
himself
forward
to
oppose
both
parties
.
On
Saturday
night
,
22
December
,
Coppin
was
served
with
a
warrant
forbidding
him
to
preach
next
day
,
and
requiring
his
attendance
before
the
magistrates
on
Monday
.
He
preached
,
not
in
the
cathedral
,
where
a
guard
of
soldiers
was
set
,
but
in
the
college-yard
,
and
in
