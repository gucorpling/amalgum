THE
MESSAGE
</head>
<p>
I
have
always
longed
to
tell
a
simple
and
true
story
,
which
should
strike
terror
into
two
young
lovers
,
and
drive
them
to
take
refuge
each
in
the
other
's
heart
,
as
two
children
cling
together
at
the
sight
of
a
snake
by
a
woodside
.
At
the
risk
of
spoiling
my
story
and
of
being
taken
for
a
coxcomb
,
I
state
my
intention
at
the
outset
.
</p>
<p>
I
myself
played
a
part
in
this
almost
commonplace
tragedy
;
so
if
it
fails
to
interest
you
,
the
failure
will
be
in
part
my
own
fault
,
in
part
owing
to
historical
veracity
.
Plenty
of
things
in
real
life
are
superlatively
uninteresting
;
so
that
it
is
one-half
of
art
to
select
from
realities
those
which
contain
possibilities
of
poetry
.
</p>
<p>
In
1819
I
was
traveling
from
Paris
to
Moulins
.
The
state
of
my
finances
obliged
me
to
take
an
outside
place
.
Englishmen
,
as
you
know
,
regard
those
airy
perches
on
the
top
of
the
coach
as
the
best
seats
;
and
for
the
first
few
miles
I
discovered
abundance
of
excellent
reasons
for
justifying
the
opinion
of
our
neighbors
.
A
young
fellow
,
apparently
in
somewhat
better
circumstances
,
who
came
to
take
the
seat
beside
me
from
preference
,
listened
to
my
reasoning
with
inoffensive
smiles
.
An
approximate
nearness
of
age
,
a
similarity
in
ways
of
thinking
,
a
common
love
of
fresh
air
,
and
of
the
rich
landscape
scenery
through
which
the
coach
was
lumbering
along
,
--
these
things
,
together
with
an
indescribable
magnetic
something
,
drew
us
before
long
into
one
of
those
short-lived
traveller
's
intimacies
,
in
which
we
unbend
with
the
more
complacency
because
the
intercourse
is
by
its
very
nature
transient
,
and
makes
no
implicit
demands
upon
the
future
.
</p>
<p>
We
had
not
come
thirty
leagues
before
we
were
talking
of
women
and
love
.
Then
,
with
all
the
circumspection
demanded
in
such
matters
,
we
proceeded
naturally
to
the
topic
of
our
lady-loves
.
Young
as
we
both
were
,
we
still
admired
&quot;
the
woman
of
a
certain
age
,
&quot;
that
is
to
say
,
the
woman
between
thirty-five
and
forty
.
Oh
!
any
poet
who
should
have
listened
to
our
talk
,
for
heaven
knows
how
many
stages
beyond
Montargis
,
would
have
reaped
a
harvest
of
flaming
epithet
,
rapturous
description
,
and
very
tender
confidences
.
Our
bashful
fears
,
our
silent
interjections
,
our
blushes
,
as
we
met
each
other
's
eyes
,
were
expressive
with
an
eloquence
,
a
boyish
charm
,
which
I
have
ceased
to
feel
.
One
must
remain
young
,
no
doubt
,
to
understand
youth
.
</p>
<p>
Well
,
we
understood
one
another
to
admiration
on
all
the
essential
points
of
passion
.
We
had
laid
it
down
as
an
axiom
at
the
very
outset
,
that
in
theory
and
practice
there
was
no
such
piece
of
driveling
nonsense
in
this
world
as
a
certificate
of
birth
;
that
plenty
of
women
were
younger
at
forty
than
many
a
girl
of
twenty
;
and
,
to
come
to
the
point
,
that
a
woman
is
no
older
than
she
looks
.
</p>
<p>
This
theory
set
no
limits
to
the
age
of
love
,
so
we
struck
out
,
in
all
good
faith
,
into
a
boundless
sea
.
At
length
,
when
we
had
portrayed
our
mistresses
as
young
,
charming
,
and
devoted
to
us
,
women
of
rank
,
women
of
taste
,
intellectual
and
clever
;
when
we
had
endowed
them
with
little
feet
,
a
satin
,
nay
,
a
delicately
fragrant
skin
,
then
came
the
admission
--
on
his
part
that
Madame
Such-an-one
was
thirty-eight
years
old
,
and
on
mine
that
I
worshiped
a
woman
of
forty
.
Whereupon
,
as
if
released
on
either
side
from
some
kind
of
vague
fear
,
our
confidences
came
thick
and
fast
,
when
we
found
that
we
were
in
the
same
confraternity
of
love
.
It
was
which
of
us
should
overtop
the
other
in
sentiment
.
</p>
<p>
One
of
us
had
traveled
six
hundred
miles
to
see
his
mistress
for
an
hour
.
The
other
,
at
the
risk
of
being
shot
for
a
wolf
,
had
prowled
about
her
park
to
meet
her
one
night
.
Out
came
all
our
follies
in
fact
.
If
it
is
pleasant
to
remember
past
dangers
,
is
it
not
at
least
as
pleasant
to
recall
past
delights
?
We
live
through
the
joy
a
second
time
.
We
told
each
other
everything
,
our
perils
,
our
great
joys
,
our
little
pleasures
,
and
even
the
humors
of
the
situation
.
My
friend
's
countess
had
lighted
a
cigar
for
him
;
mine
made
chocolate
for
me
,
and
wrote
to
me
every
day
when
we
did
not
meet
;
his
lady
had
come
to
spend
three
days
with
him
at
the
risk
of
ruin
to
her
reputation
;
mine
had
done
even
better
,
or
worse
,
if
you
will
have
it
so
.
Our
countesses
,
moreover
,
were
adored
by
their
husbands
;
these
gentlemen
were
enslaved
by
the
charm
possessed
by
every
woman
who
loves
;
and
,
with
even
supererogatory
simplicity
,
afforded
us
that
just
sufficient
spice
of
danger
which
increases
pleasure
.
Ah
!
how
quickly
the
wind
swept
away
our
talk
and
our
happy
laughter
!
</p>
<p>
When
we
reached
Pouilly
,
I
scanned
my
new
friend
with
much
interest
,
and
truly
,
it
was
not
difficult
to
imagine
him
the
hero
of
a
very
serious
love
affair
.
Picture
to
yourselves
a
young
man
of
middle
height
,
but
very
well
proportioned
,
a
bright
,
expressive
face
,
dark
hair
,
blue
eyes
,
moist
lips
,
and
white
and
even
teeth
.
A
certain
not
unbecoming
pallor
still
overspread
his
delicately
cut
features
,
and
there
were
faint
dark
circles
about
his
eyes
,
as
if
he
were
recovering
from
an
illness
.
Add
,
furthermore
,
that
he
had
white
and
shapely
hands
,
of
which
he
was
as
careful
as
a
pretty
woman
should
be
;
add
that
he
seemed
to
be
very
well
informed
,
and
was
decidedly
clever
,
and
it
should
not
be
difficult
for
you
to
imagine
that
my
traveling
companion
was
more
than
worthy
of
a
countess
.
Indeed
,
many
a
girl
might
have
wished
for
such
a
husband
,
for
he
was
a
Vicomte
with
an
income
of
twelve
or
fifteen
thousand
livres
,
&quot;
to
say
nothing
of
expectations
.
