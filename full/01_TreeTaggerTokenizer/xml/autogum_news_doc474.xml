on
Tuesday
with
a
2-0
victory
over

.
The
Blades
are
stuck
in
the
relegation
battle
in
the
league
,
having
only
jumped
out
of
the
bottom
three
this
past
weeking
after
a
3-0
thumping
of
fellow
strugglers
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West%20Ham">

.
The
Red
Devils
on
the
other
hand
came
into
the
game
on
a
two
game
winning
streak
,
having
scored
11
goals
in
those
two
matches
.
Man
United
started
with
the
same
striking
pair
used
in
the
last
two
games
in
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Wayne_Rooney">
Wayne
Rooney
</ref>
and
Alan
Smith
.
Sheffield
United
boss
Neil
Warnock
played
Colin
Kazim-Richards
up
front
with
Luton
Shelton
,
who
was
earning
his
first
start
,
on
the
attack
.
</p>
<p>
The
first
chance
of
the
match
fell
to
the
Yorkshire
side
as
a
free
Kick
by
Tonge
was
driven
low
,
but
lacked
the
power
to
beat
Reds
keeper
,
Tomasz
Kuszczak
.
The
Premiership
leaders
quickly
made
the
Blades
pay
,
and
on
4
minutes
,
Michael
Carrick
received
a
pass
from
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Cristiano_Ronaldo">
Cristiano
Ronaldo
</ref>
,
and
chipped
the
ball
over
the
sprawling
Paddy
Kenny
.
Wayne
Rooney
then
had
a
chance
to
double
the
Red
Devils
lead
,
but
his
shot
lacked
power
and
Kenny
patted
the
ball
away
.
Another
free
kick
was
taken
by
Tonge
for
the
Blades
,
and
this
one
packed
more
power
,
but
Kuszczak
sprawled
to
make
the
stop
.
Patrice
Evra
then
had
to
be
substituted
for
the
Reds
when
he
took
a
high
challenge
from
Kazim-Richards
,
and
was
replaced
by
Keiron
Richardson
.
Smith
was
then
forced
to
change
his
shorts
after
being
caught
by
Matthew
Kilgallon
.
Luton
Shelton
continued
to
make
an
impact
for
Sheffield
United
as
he
blasted
a
shot
just
wide
.
</p>
<p>
After
the
break
,
Rooney
again
had
a
chance
to
double
United
's
lead
,
but
he
was
stopped
by
a
well
timed
tackle
from
Chris
Morgan
.
Shelton
meanwhile
caused
unrest
in
the
Man
United
defence
with
strong
runs
,
but
no
goals
came
of
them
.
Rooney
finally
scored
his
goal
on
5
minutes
when
his
run
was
met
by
Ryan
Giggs
'
pass
,
and
the
young
Englishman
blasted
the
ball
far
side
on
Kenny
.
Shelton
again
threatened
as
he
turned
away
from
Wes
Brown
,
but
he
then
scooped
the
ball
over
the
bar
.
Danny
Webber
then
had
a
chance
for
the
Blades
after
beating
out
Heinze
,
but
he
raked
his
shot
wide
.
Kenny
was
then
forced
into
action
to
make
saves
off
both
Ronaldo
and
Rooney
,
to
keep
the
game
at
a
respectable
scoreline
.
Shelton
then
had
a
legitimate
claim
for
a
penalty
when
he
was
brought
down
by
Heinze
in
the
area
,
but
referee
Rob
Styles
waved
play
on
.
The
decision
all
but
ended
the
Blades
hopes
of
a
comeback
,
but
they
still
continued
to
press
as
Tonge
hit
the
post
with
a
curling
shot
.
Kuszczak
kept
his
clean
sheat
,
however
,
and
the
Red
Devils
earned
a
valuable
three
points
in
the
title
race
.
</p>
<p>
Manchester
United
's
next
match
will
be
another
Premiership
game
against
Middlesbrough
at
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old%20Trafford">
Old
Trafford
</ref>
.
Sheffield
United
's
next
,
also
in
the
Premiership
,
will
be
against
main
relegation
rivals
Charlton
Athletic
,
and
that
match
will
be
very
important
for
both
teams
.
