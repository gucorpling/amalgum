My
research
indicates
that
this
is
the
case
for
other
Internet
services
but
I
cannot
tell
whether
it
is
the
case
for
Twitter
.
</p>
<p>
Note
that
even
though
IP
logging
,
as
done
by
Twitter
,
is
similar
to
the
logging
done
by
GSM
[
mobile
phone
]
operators
,
the
major
difference
seems
to
be
that
Twitter
is
subject
to
US
regulation
,
no
matter
the
citizenship
of
its
users
.
I
find
this
rather
disturbing
.

Using

,
one
could
search
for
Birgitta
on
other
Internet
services
,
such
as
social
networks
,
to
find
more
information
on
her
(
e.
g.
,
hidden
accounts
)
.
Recent
research
on
privacy
shows
that
people
tend
to
use
the
same
e-mail
address
to
register
an
account
on
different
social
networks
(
even
when
they
do
n't
want
these
accounts
to
be
linked
together
)
.
Obviously
,
one
could
then
issue
subpoenas
for
these
accounts
as
well
.

As
I
believe
Jonsdottir
to
be
involved
in
the
Icelandic
Modern
Media
Initiative
(
IMMI
)
,
what
are
the
wider
implications
beyond
the

WikiLeaks
witchhunt

Having
been
alerted
to
the
ongoing
case
through
a
joint
press
release
by
the
ACLU
and
EFF
,
<hi rend="italic">
Wikinews

sought
clarification
on
the
primary
issues
which
the
two
non-profits
saw
as
particularly
important
in
challenging
the
U.S.
Government
over
the
'
secret
'
court
orders
.

the
points

As
a
worse-case
,
what
precedents
would
be
considered
if
this
went
to
the
Supreme
Court
?

It
's
extremely
hard
to
know
at
this
stage
if
this
would
go
to
the
Supreme
Court
,
and
if
it
did
,
what
would
be
at
issue
.
However
,
some
of
the
interesting
questions
about
this
case
center
on
the
rights
of
people
around
the
world
when
they
use
US
Internet
services
.
This
case
questions
the
limits
of
US
law
enforcement
,
which
may
turn
out
to
be
very
different
from
the
limits
in
other
countries
.

Since
this
is
clearly
a
politicised
attack
on
free
speech
with
most
chilling
potential
repercussions
for
the
press
,
whistleblowers
,
and
by-and-large
anyone
the
relevant
U.S.
Government
departments
objects
to
the
actions
of
,
what
action
do
you
believe
should
be
taken
to
protect
free
speech
rights
?

We
believe
that
,
except
in
very
rare
circumstances
,
the
government
should
not
be
permitted
to
obtain
information
about
individuals
'
private
Internet
communications
in
secret
.
We
also
believe
that
Internet
companies
should
,
whenever
possible
,
take
steps
to
ensure
their
customers
are
notified
about
requests
for
information
and
have
the
opportunity
to
respond
.
