Ali
Shah
,
surnamed
Shah
Murad
or
Murad
Mirza
lived
in
Anjudan
.
He
had
also
retained
his
close
relations
with
Shah
Ismail
cemented
by
his
father
.
His
mode
of
living
,
his
dress
and
food
were
characterised
by
a
rare
simplicity
.

<p>
The
Ottoman
sultan
Salim
(
1512-1520
)
began
his
long
march
to
northern
Azerbaijan
after
putting
40,000
Shias
to
death
in
his
dominions
.
He
reached
the
plain
of
Chaldiran
and
the
outbreak
of
war
occurred
in
920/1514
.
He
inflicted
a
defeat
to
Shah
Ismail
.
The
Ottoman
firepower
,
consisting
of
200
cannon
and
100
mortars
was
brought
into
play
with
devastating
effect
.
After
suffering
heavy
casualties
,
the
Safavid
artilleries
were
forced
to
break
off
the
engagement
.
When
Shah
Ismail
left
the
battlefield
,
sultan
Salim
did
not
pursue
him
.
Later
,
he
marched
to
Tabriz
,
the
Safavid
capital
,
which
he
occupied
in
922/1517
.
Caterino
Zeno
,
the
Venetian
ambassador
writes
in
&quot;
Travels
in
Persia
&quot;
(
p.
61
)
that
,
&quot;
If
the
Turk
had
been
beaten
in
the
battle
of
Chaldiran
,
the
power
of
Ismail
would
have
become
greater
than
that
of
Tamerlane
,
as
by
the
fame
alone
of
such
a
victory
he
would
have
made
himself
absolute
lord
of
the
East
.
&quot;
Later
,
the
Mamluks
of
Syria
and
Egypt
similarly
remained
wedded
to
their
cavalry
,
and
were
also
defeated
by
the
Ottomans
.
</p>
<p>
The
effect
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safavid">
Safavid
</ref>
defeat
at
Chaldiran
was
the
loss
of
the
province
of
Diyar
Bakr
,
which
was
annexed
to
the
Ottoman
empire
in
921/1516
.
Shah
Ismail
went
into
mourning
after
his
defeat
.
During
the
remaining
ten
years
of
his
reign
,
he
never
once
led
his
troops
into
action
in
person
.
He
did
not
devote
his
attention
to
the
affairs
of
the
state
as
in
the
past
.
On
the
contrary
,
he
seems
to
have
tried
to
drown
his
sorrows
by
wine
.
His
abdication
of
his
responsibilities
in
regard
to
the
personal
direction
of
the
affairs
of
state
gave
certain
officials
the
opportunity
to
increase
their
own
power
.
The
clash
between
the
Kizilbash
and
the
Iranian
soldiers
began
to
be
a
threat
to
the
Safavid
kingdom
.
</p>
<p>
Kizilbash
were
the
Turkomans
,
who
were
distinguished
for
wearing
red
pointed
caps
,
which
they
had
begun
to
wear
in
the
time
of
Shaikh
Hyder
(
1456-
1488
)
,
the
father
of
Shah
Ismail
;
and
thus
they
became
known
as
Kizil-Bash
(
red
heads
)
,
and
in
its
Iranian
form
,
Qizilbash
,
or
Red
Heads
.
They
shaved
their
beards
but
let
their
moustaches
grow
.
The
Kizilbash
constituted
the
backbone
of
the
Safavid
army
.
It
seems
probable
on
that
juncture
that
Shah
Ismail
had
generated
a
close
tie
with
the
Ismaili
Imams
in
Anjudan
,
and
granted
them
the
title
of
Amir
al-Umra
.
There
is
its
another
reason
that
the
Ismailis
had
joined
the
Safavid
army
in
Khorasan
,
who
had
repulsed
the
aggressive
advance
of
the
Uzbeks
in
916/1510
.
Shah
Ismail
had
most
possibly
planned
to
seek
the
martial
aids
from
the
Khorasani
Ismaili
warriors
to
crush
the
uprising
in
his
military
if
required
.
He
therefore
,
maintained
cordial
relation
with
the
Imams
of
Anjudan
.
Shah
Ismail
however
died
in
930/1524
.
</p>
<p>
It
is
said
that
the
Muharram
was
an
ideal
month
for
the
Ismaili
pilgrims
visiting
Anjudan
.
They
carried
usually
a
small
taziyah
(
replica
of
Imam
Hussain
's
tomb
)
,
and
placed
it
in
front
of
the
caravan
and
passed
through
the
teeth
of
the
bitterest
and
aggressive
places
in
the
Shiite
garbs
.
They
put
the
taziyah
at
the
entrance
of
Anjudan
,
and
took
it
again
while
leaving
the
town
.

<p>
Imam
Murad
Mirza
died
in
920/1574
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anjudan">

and
was

Capture
and
execution
</head>
<p>
In
1573
,
due
to
the
threat
posed
by
the
Imam
,
the
2nd
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safavid">
Safavid
</ref>
monarch
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shah_Tahmasp">
Shah
Tahmasp
</ref>
,
ordered
the
governor
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamadan">
Hamadan
</ref>
,
Amir
Khan
Musilu
,
to
go
to
Anjudan
to
capture
Murad
Mirza
.
Amir
Khan
proceeded
to
Anjudan
,
and
while
killing
a
large
number
of
the
Imam
's
followers
and
taking
much
booty
,
was
unable
to
capture
him
.
However
,
the
Imam
was
soon
captured
and
imprisoned
,
but
again
escaped
,
this
time
with
the
aid
of
a
sympathetic
high-ranking
Safavid
official
named
Muhammad
Muqim
.
With
the
help
of
his
followers
,
the
Imam
was
able
to
escape
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kandahar">
Kandahar
</ref>
.
However
,
while
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan">
Afghanistan
</ref>
,
he
was
once
again
captured
by
the
Safavids
.
This
time
there
would
be
no
escape
,
and
after
being
brought
before
Shah
Tahmasp
he
was
executed
alongside
Muhammad
Muqim
in
1574
.
