,
NATO
's
military
operation
in
Afghanistan
,
have
been
committed
to
full
transition
of
security
responsibilities
to
Afghan
forces
by
the
end
of
2014
.
This
would
mark
the
end
of
ISAF
's
13
year
mission
in
Afghanistan
,
with
troops
changing
to
a
training
and

<p>
Plans
had
originally
intended
for
Afghanistan
's
new
President
,
or
President-elect
,
to
attend
this
year
's
summit
,
but
due
to
the
political
situation
and
ongoing
election
process
it
is
still
unknown
who
will
replace
outgoing
President

.
Bismullah
Khan
Muhammadi
,
the
country
's
defence
minister
,
instead
attended
the
summit
in
the
absence
of
a
President
.
</p>
<p>
This
political
stalemate
has
put
at
risk
NATO
plans
for
a
continuing
military
presence
in
the
country
,
with
troops
expected
to
pull
out
at
the
end
of
the
year
without
new
security
agreements
being
signed
,
signature
not
possible
without
a
new
President
in
place
.
NATO
members
have
urged
Afghanistan
's
presidential
candidates
to
reach
an
agreement
,
with
officials
indicating
that
if
no
agreement
can
be
reached
by
the
end
of
the
month
,
then
troops
would
begin
to
leave
.

ahead

talks

Plans
for
a
Readiness
Action
Plan
were
agreed
at
the
summit
.
Speaking
on
Monday
before
the
summit
,
NATO
's
secretary
general
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders%20Fogh%20Rasmussen">
Anders
Fogh
Rasmussen
</ref>
,
described
this
as
a
response
to
&quot;
Russia
's
aggressive
behaviour
&quot;
,
but
outlined
how
he
hoped
it
would
increase
the
responsiveness
of
the
alliance
to
face
any
security
challenge
.
</p>
<p>
These
plans
aim
to
allow
reinforcements
to
reach
any
NATO
member
state
within
48
hours
,
in
what
Rasmussen
described
as
a
&quot;
spearhead
&quot;
of
the
preexisting
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO%20Response%20Force">
Response
Force
</ref>
.
This
requires
logistical
,
and
headquarters
facilities
to
be
set
up
in
Eastern
European
countries
,
the
ones
most
under
threat
from
an
attack
by
Russia
,
or
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Islamic_State">
Islamic
State
</ref>
.
These
plans
are
also
to
be
rehearsed
through
joint
military
exercises
.
