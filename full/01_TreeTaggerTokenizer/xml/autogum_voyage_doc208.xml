Raleigh
</ref>
</hi>
is
the
primary
political
and
economic
driver
of
the
metro
area
.
Indeed
,
business
and
politics
are
the
main
draws
to
Raleigh
,
which
lacks
the
more
trendy
feel
or
active
arts
scene
of
<ref target="Durham%20%28North%20Carolina%29">
Durham
</ref>
or
<ref target="Chapel%20Hill">
Chapel
Hill
</ref>
to
the
west
.
However
,
a
concerted
effort
to
expand
the
residential
base
and
move
events
downtown
has
led
to
significantly
expanded
retail
and
restaurant
options
in
the
downtown
core
.
Also
,
visitors
will
find
many
of
the
state
's
cultural
institutions
here
,
namely
a
major
performing
arts
center
downtown
and
three
state
museums
,
and
a
college
town
atmosphere
in
the
neighborhood
around
the
campus
of
North
Carolina
State
University
,
the
state
's
largest
university
.

History
</head>
<p>
Raleigh
is
one
of
the
few
U.S.
state
capitals
that
was
specifically
established
and
planned
to
serve
as
a
capital
.
Its
location
was
chosen
partly
for
being
near
the
center
of
the
state
and
partly
because
it
was
close
to
Isaac
Hunter
's
Tavern
,
where
North
Carolina
legislators
and
other
government
officials
liked
to
stay
.
The
story
goes
that
the
commissioners
could
n't
decide
on
an
exact
plot
of
land
until
Isaac
Hunter
and
his
friend
Joel
Lane
had
the
idea
of
throwing
a
big
party
with
plenty
of
local
jam
and
whiskey
.
The
next
morning
,
the
hungover
commissioners
voted
5
–
1
for
a
plot
owned
by
Joel
Lane
himself
.
</p>
<p>
The
new
city
was
officially
established
as
the
state
capital
in
1792
and
was
named
for
Sir
Walter
Raleigh
.

area

The
North
Raleigh
neighborhoods
are
aligned
along
the
&quot;
spokes
of
the
wheel
&quot;
—
major
thoroughfares
emanating
from
the
I-440
Loop
and
passing
through
the
northern
edge
of
the
much
larger
I-540
loop

<p>
Downtown
Raleigh
provides
easy
travel
and
access
through
its
grid
of
one-way
streets
.
If
you
're
just
passing
through
,
the
major
thoroughfare
is
Capital
Boulevard
(
US
401
)
,
which
splits
into
Dawson
Street
heading
south
and
McDowell
Street
heading
north
.
From
the
west
,
it
is
Hillsborough
Street
,
interrupted
midway
by
the
state
Capitol
building
.
To
the
east
,
it
continues
as
New
Bern
Avenue
(
US

The
I-440
Beltline
was
once
denoted
with
&quot;
Inner
&quot;
and
&quot;
Outer
&quot;
labels
,
but
they
have
been
phased
out
in
favor
of
&quot;
East
&quot;
and
&quot;
West
.
&quot;
I-440
West
was
previously
the
Outer
Beltline
,
and
I-440
East
was
previously
the
Inner
Beltline
.
I-440
's
concurrency
with
I-40
through
the
souther
portion
of
Raleigh
has
also
been
removed
;
therefore
,
the
Beltline
no
longer
loops
back
on
itself
.
</p>
<p>
Raleigh
is
known
for
particularly
aggressive
parking
enforcement
and
towing
,
so
be
sure
to
follow
all
parking
signs
and
rules
.
Most
parking
meters
have
been
converted
to
electronic
pay
stations
that
accept
coins
and
MasterCard/Visa
.
Most
metered
areas
are
only
enforced
on
Mon
-
Fri
from
8AM-5PM
.
Some
parking
garages
are
free
on
evenings
and
weekends
as
well
,
but
&quot;
special
event
&quot;
rates
are
common
during
major
downtown
events
regardless
of
the
time
or
day
