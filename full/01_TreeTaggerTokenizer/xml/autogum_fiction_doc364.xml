<p>
“
Stern
Lawgiver
!
yet
thou
dost
wear
The
Godhead
’s
most
benignant
grace
;
Nor
know
we
anything
so
fair
As
is
the
smile
upon
thy
face
:
Flowers
laugh
before
thee
on
their
beds
And
fragrance
in
thy
footing
treads
;
Thou
dost
preserve
the
stars
from
wrong
;
And
the
most
ancient
heavens
,
through
Thee
,
are
fresh
and
strong
.

BUT
what
became
of
little
Tom
?
</p>
<p>
He
slipped
away
off
the
rocks
into
the
water
,
as
I
said
before
.
But
he
could
not
help
thinking
of
little
Ellie
.
He
did
not
remember
who
she
was
;
but
he
knew
that
she
was
a
little
girl
,
though
she
was
a
hundred
times
as
big
as
he
.
That
is
not
surprising
:
size
has
nothing
to
do
with
kindred
.
A
tiny
weed
may
be
first
cousin
to
a
great
tree
;
and
a
little
dog
like
Vick
knows
that
Lioness
is
a
dog
too
,
though
she
is
twenty
times
larger
than
herself
.
So
Tom
knew
that
Ellie
was
a
little
girl
,
and
thought
about
her
all
that
day
,
and
longed
to
have
had
her
to
play
with
;
but
he
had
very
soon
to
think
of
something
else
.
And
here
is
the
account
of
what
happened
to
him
,
as
it
was
published
next
morning
,
in
the
Water-proof
Gazette
,
on
the
finest
watered
paper
,
for
the
use
of
the
great
fairy
,
Mrs.
Bedonebyasyoudid
,
who
reads
the
news
very
carefully
every
morning
,
and
especially
the
police
cases
,
as
you
will
hear
very
soon
.
</p>
<p>
He
was
going
along
the
rocks
in
three-fathom
water
,
watching
the
pollock
catch
prawns
,
and
the
wrasses
nibble
barnacles
off
the
rocks
,
shells
and
all
,
when
he
saw
a
round
cage
of
green
withes
;
and
inside
it
,
looking
very
much
ashamed
of
himself
,
sat
his
friend
the
lobster
,
twiddling
his
horns
,
instead
of
thumbs
.
</p>
<p>
[

,
the

and

</p>
<p>
“
What
,
have
you
been
naughty
,
and
have
they
put
you
in
the
lock-up
?
”
asked
Tom
.
</p>
<p>
The
lobster
felt
a
little
indignant
at
such
a
notion
,
but
he
was
too
much
depressed
in
spirits
to
argue
;
so
he
only
said
,
“
I
ca
n’t
get
out
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Why
did
you
get
in
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
After
that
nasty
piece
of
dead
fish
.
”
He
had
thought
it
looked
and
smelt
very
nice
when
he
was
outside
,
and
so
it
did
,
for
a
lobster
:
but
now
he
turned
round
and
abused
it
because
he
was
angry
with
himself
.
</p>
<p>
“
Where
did
you
get
in
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Through
that
round
hole
at
the
top
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Then
why
do
n’t
you
get
out
through
it
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Because
I
ca
n’t
:
”
and
the
lobster
twiddled
his
horns
more
fiercely
than
ever
,
but
he
was
forced
to
confess
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
have
jumped
upwards
,
downwards
,
backwards
,
and
sideways
,
at
least
four
thousand
times
;
and
I
ca
n’t
get
out
:
I
always
get
up
underneath
there
,
and
ca
n’t
find
the
hole
.
”
</p>
<p>
Tom
looked
at
the
trap
,
and
having
more
wit
than
the
lobster
,
he
saw
plainly
enough
what
was
the
matter
;
as
you
may
if
you
will
look
at
a
lobster-pot
.
</p>
<p>
“
Stop
a
bit
,
”
said
Tom
.
“
Turn
your
tail
up
to
me
,
and
I
’ll
pull
you
through
hindforemost
,
and
then
you
wo
n’t
stick
in
the
spikes
.
”
</p>
<p>
But
the
lobster
was
so
stupid
and
clumsy
that
he
could
n’t
hit
the
hole
.
Like
a
great
many
fox-hunters
,
he
was
very
sharp
as
long
as
he
was
in
his
own
country
;
but
as
soon
as
they
get
out
of
it
they
lose
their
heads
;
and
so
the
lobster
,
so
to
speak
,
lost
his
tail
.
</p>
<p>
Tom
reached
and
clawed
down
the
hole
after
him
,
till
he
caught
hold
of
him
;
and
then
,
as
was
to
be
expected
,
the
clumsy
lobster
pulled
him
in
head
foremost
.
</p>
<p>
“
Hullo
!
here
is
a
pretty
business
,
”
said
Tom
.
“
Now
take
your
great
claws
,
and
break
the
points
off
those
spikes
,
and
then
we
shall
both
get
out
easily
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Dear
me
,
I
never
thought
of
that
,
”
said
the
lobster
;
“
and
after
all
the
experience
of
life
that
I
have
had
!
”
</p>
<p>
You
see
,
experience
is
of
very
little
good
unless
a
man
,
or
a
lobster
,
has
wit
enough
to
make
use
of
it
.
For
a
good
many
people
,
like
old
Polonius
,
have
seen
all
the
world
,
and
yet
remain
little
better
than
children
after
all
.
</p>
<p>
But
they
had
not
got
half
the
spikes
away
when
they
saw
a
great
dark
cloud
over
them
:
and
lo
,
and
behold
,
it
was
the
otter
.
</p>
<p>
How
she
did
grin
and
grin
when
she
saw
Tom
.
“
Yar
!
”
said
she
,
“
you
little
meddlesome
wretch
,
I
have
you
now
!
I
will
serve
you
out
for
telling
the
salmon
where
I
was
!
”
And
she
crawled
all
over
the
pot
to
get
in
.
</p>
<p>
Tom
was
horribly
frightened
,
and
still
more
frightened
when
she
found
the
hole
in
the
top
,
and
squeezed
herself
right
down
through
it
,
all
eyes
and
teeth
.
But
no
sooner
was
her
head
inside
than
valiant
Mr.
Lobster
caught
her
by
the
nose
and
held
on
.
</p>
<p>
And
there
they
were
all
three
in
the
pot
,
rolling
over
and
over
,
and
very
tight
packing
it
was
.
And
the
lobster
tore
at
the
otter
,
and
the
otter
tore
at
the
lobster
,
and
both
squeezed
and
thumped
poor
Tom
till
he
had
no
breath
left
in
his
body
;
and
I
do
n’t
know
what
would
have
happened
to
him
if
he
had
not
at
last
got
on
the
otter
’s
back
,
and
safe
out
of
the
hole
.
