<p>
The
teachers
explained
how
difficult
it
is
to
integrate
careers
in
science
education
and
needed
novel
educational
methods
to
overcome
this
challenge
.
Thus
,
their
goals
and
interests
(
cf.
)
and
their
need
for
change
led
them
to
co-designing
an
educational
innovation
.
They
wanted
to
involve
the
researcher
and
a
real
professional
in
designing
the
instruction
combining
science
knowledge
with
the
career
of
a
dentist
and
her
explanations
about
the
chemistry
issues
with
teeth
.
It
was
important
for
them
to
include
this
information
in
their
local
curriculum
as
proposed
in
previous
research
.
The
teachers
experienced
a
high
sense
of
ownership
and
agency
towards
the
instruction
,
even
though
they
were
not
involved
in
all
phases
of
the
co-design
process
.
The
results
of
teachers
’
high
ownership
and
agency
aligns
with
the
students
’
perception
of
a
successfully
implemented
co-designed
career-related
instruction
.
</p>
<p>
The
teachers
highlighted
the
visual
and
informative
appearance
of
the
co-designed
scenario
and
agreed
that
the
virtual
and
personal
contact
with
the
dentist
through
video
engaged
students
in
following
science
inquiries
.
Thus
,
the
design
and
other
ideas
of
the
co-designers
were
supported
.
Retrospective
interviews
revealed
that
they
have
continued
to
use
and
develop
the
scenario
further
.
In
addition
,
they
have
shared
it
and
discussed
it
with
their
colleagues
.
This
is
a
sign
of
feeling
ownership
as
Pierce
et
al.
argues
.
</p>
<p>
When
teachers
are
free
to
implement
the
co-designed
scenario
and
the
rest
of
the
learning
unit
in
their
own
way
,
it
promotes
their
autonomy
and
further
experiences
of
agency
,
which
is
particularly
important
when
the
teachers
are
used
to
high
autonomy
in
their
work
.
After
all
,
the
results
of
the
co-design
process
show
that
the
teachers
participated
in
all
the
phases
except
creating
videos
for
the
scenario
and
career-related
activities
.
However
,
the
teachers
need
the
freedom
to
change
everything
in
the
scenario
and
learning
unit
and
in
this
case
,
they
used
this
possibility
a
few
times
when
they
felt
it
was
necessary
.
The
teachers
perceived
that
it
was
easy
to
implement
the
scenario
and
it
was
successful
.
Nevertheless
,
in
such
a
co-design
process
teacher
can
lose
some
aspects
,
for
example
,
feelings
of
control
and
autonomy
,
but
gain
others
such
as
a
professional
’s
viewpoint
and
new
knowledge
.
In
the
end
,
the
teachers
appreciated
that
the
learning
unit
was
relevant
and
interesting
for
the
students
,
but
they
were
also
interested
in
the
students
’
perceptions
.
</p>
<p>
The
results
reveal
that
the
students
found
that
the
scenario
starting
the
instruction
was
relevant
for
them
personally
and
for
society
.
Their
perceived
high
vocational
relevance
,
particularly
with
vocational
knowledge
,
suggests
that
it
is
possible
for
this
kind
of
instruction
to
correct
possibly
existing
career
stereotypes
.
According
to
the
teachers
and
students
,
it
seems
that
the
problem
assigned
to
the
students
personally
by
the
dentist
had
an
impact
on
students
’
interest
in
the
following
learning
activities
.
Earlier
studies
confirm
that
these
kinds
of
real-world
connections
and
student-scientist
partnership
are
relevant
and
increase
students
’
interest
in
science
.
The
results
and
previous
research
reveal
it
is
not
always
easy
or
possible
to
create
and
implement
this
kind
of
authentic
environment
.
However
,
the
artificially
created
interaction
between
students
and
professional
in
the
designed
instruction
helps
with
the
problem
of
resources
and
access
to
experts
.
</p>
<p>
Even
though
the
career
of
a
dentist
probably
was
familiar
to
the
students
before
,
the
students
perceived
that
they
learned
more
about
the
skills
and
responsibilities
needed
in
the
career
.
Thus
,
career-related
instruction
gives
students
new
knowledge
,
not
only
about
scientific
topics
,
but
also
about
careers
and
needed
working
life
skills
and
responsibilities
in
a
career
.
All
these
raise
students
’
career
awareness
and
gives
them
accurate
perceptions
of
STEM
careers
,
which
is
assumed
to
increase
the
number
of
students
choosing
STEM
studies
and
careers
.
Considering
that
generally
Finnish
secondary
school
students
are
not
that
interested
in
science
studies
or
science-related
careers
,
their
future
career
aspirations
were
moderate
.
The
students
’
interest
in
the
scenario
was
high
and
it
might
raise
their
interest
towards
learning
science
.
</p>
<p>
As
said
,
teachers
,
but
also
students
,
appreciated
the
scenario
’s
attributes
and
appearance
.
Something
new
and
different
always
arouses
interest
.
Videos
,
connection
with
a
professional
,
freedom
to
choose
and
create
inquiries
,
and
using
creativity
in
reporting
results
makes
science
learning
relevant
and
interesting
for
the
students
and
involves
them
in
scientific
processes
and
decision
making
.
Without
the
career
introduction
and
interaction
with
the
professional
,
students
might
learn
the
same
scientific
knowledge
and
skills
but
lose
connections
and
understanding
how
and
why
their
knowledge
and
skills
are
relevant
outside
the
school
context
.
