Buy
the
Copyright
for
an
Old
Book
</head>
<p>
If
an
old
book
still
has
a
following
but
is
no
longer
in
print
,
buying
the
copyright
is
a
good
way
for
writers
or
publishers
to
meet
the
demand
and
earn
extra
money
.
Obtaining
the
copyright
to
old
books
is
also
a
good
way
to
start
an
online
collection
of
books
to
share
or
sell
.
However
,
it
is
essential
to
understand
copyright
law
and
to
follow
the
proper
procedure
in
order
to
avoid
possible
legal
objections
from
the
original
copyright
holder
or
his
or
her
heirs
.
The
process
to
transfer
copyright
is
straightforward
,
but
it
can
be
time
consuming
.

author

wo
n't

Track
down
the
copyright
holder
or
his
or
her
heirs
.
Copyright
extends
beyond
the
death
of
the
author
,

you
need
to
find
the
person
who
has
the
authority
to
transfer
copyright
to
you
.

Negotiate
the
terms
to
purchase
the
copyright
.
You
and
the
copyright
holder
can
decide
on
terms
that
are
beneficial
to
both
parties
.
You
do
n't
necessarily
need
to
hire
a
copyright
attorney
.
However
,
if
the
copyright
transfer
involves
a
large
amount
of
money
or
the
copyright
owner
has
specific
demands
,
it
may
be
best
to
have
an
attorney
draft
a
contract
for
the
purchase
.

Not
all
countries
require
authors
to
file
copyright
notices
with
the
government
.
For
example
,
Australia
does
not
have
a
system
for
copyright
registration
;
all
works
have
a
copyright
upon
creation
.
If
you
cannot
locate
the
copyright
holder
and
the
copyright
office
cannot
provide
the
copyright
information
,
you
will
need
to
do
more
research
to
try
to
find
the
original
author
or
his
or
her
heirs
.

Orphan
works
are
copyrighted
pieces
of
work
whose
copyright
owner
cannot
be
found
.
It
may
be
risky
to
re-publish
orphan
works
since
the
original
copyright
holder
may
come
forward
later
and
assert
a
claim
.
