LOST
ON
PELLUCIDAR
</head>
<p>
The
Arabs
,
of
whom
I
wrote
you
at
the
end
of
my
last
letter
(
Innes
began
)
,
and
whom
I
thought
to
be
enemies
intent
only
upon
murdering
me
,
proved
to
be
exceedingly
friendly
--
they
were
searching
for
the
very
band
of
marauders
that
had
threatened
my
existence
.
The
huge
rhamphorhynchus-like
reptile
that
I
had
brought
back
with
me
from
the
inner
world
--
the
ugly
Mahar
that
Hooja
the
Sly
One
had
substituted
for
my
dear
Dian
at
the
moment
of
my
departure
--
filled
them
with
wonder
and
with
awe
.
</p>
<p>
Nor
less
so
did
the
mighty
subterranean
prospector
which
had
carried
me
to
Pellucidar
and
back
again
,
and
which
lay
out
in
the
desert
about
two
miles
from
my
camp
.
</p>
<p>
With
their
help
I
managed
to
get
the
unwieldy
tons
of
its
great
bulk
into
a
vertical
position
--
the
nose
deep
in
a
hole
we
had
dug
in
the
sand
and
the
rest
of
it
supported
by
the
trunks
of
date-palms
cut
for
the
purpose
.
</p>
<p>
It
was
a
mighty
engineering
job
with
only
wild
Arabs
and
their
wilder
mounts
to
do
the
work
of
an
electric
crane
--
but
finally
it
was
completed
,
and
I
was
ready
for
departure
.
</p>
<p>
For
some
time
I
hesitated
to
take
the
Mahar
back
with
me
.
She
had
been
docile
and
quiet
ever
since
she
had
discovered
herself
virtually
a
prisoner
aboard
the
&quot;
iron
mole
.
&quot;
It
had
been
,
of
course
,
impossible
for
me
to
communicate
with
her
since
she
had
no
auditory
organs
and
I
no
knowledge
of
her
fourth-dimension
,
sixth-sense
method
of
communication
.
</p>
<p>
Naturally
I
am
kind-hearted
,
and
so
I
found
it
beyond
me
to
leave
even
this
hateful
and
repulsive
thing
alone
in
a
strange
and
hostile
world
.
The
result
was
that
when
I
entered
the
iron
mole
I
took
her
with
me
.
</p>
<p>
That
she
knew
that
we
were
about
to
return
to
Pellucidar
was
evident
,
for
immediately
her
manner
changed
from
that
of
habitual
gloom
that
had
pervaded
her
,
to
an
almost
human
expression
of
contentment
and
delight
.
</p>
<p>
Our
trip
through
the
earth
's
crust
was
but
a
repetition
of
my
two
former
journeys
between
the
inner
and
the
outer
worlds
.
This
time
,
however
,
I
imagine
that
we
must
have
maintained
a
more
nearly
perpendicular
course
,
for
we
accomplished
the
journey
in
a
few
minutes
'
less
time
than
upon
the
occasion
of
my
first
journey
through
the
five-hundred-mile
crust
.
Just
a
trifle
less
than
seventy-two
hours
after
our
departure
into
the
sands
of
the
Sahara
,
we
broke
through
the
surface
of
Pellucidar
.
</p>
<p>
Fortune
once
again
favored
me
by
the
slightest
of
margins
,
for
when
I
opened
the
door
in
the
prospector
's
outer
jacket
I
saw
that
we
had
missed
coming
up
through
the
bottom
of
an
ocean
by
but
a
few
hundred
yards
.
</p>
<p>
The
aspect
of
the
surrounding
country
was
entirely
unfamiliar
to
me
--
I
had
no
conception
of
precisely
where
I
was
upon
the
one
hundred
and
twenty-four
million
square
miles
of
Pellucidar
's
vast
land
surface
.
</p>
<p>
The
perpetual
midday
sun
poured
down
its
torrid
rays
from
zenith
,
as
it
had
done
since
the
beginning
of
Pellucidarian
time
--
as
it
would
continue
to
do
to
the
end
of
it
.
Before
me
,
across
the
wide
sea
,
the
weird
,
horizonless
seascape
folded
gently
upward
to
meet
the
sky
until
it
lost
itself
to
view
in
the
azure
depths
of
distance
far
above
the
level
of
my
eyes
.
</p>
<p>
How
strange
it
looked
!
How
vastly
different
from
the
flat
and
puny
area
of
the
circumscribed
vision
of
the
dweller
upon
the
outer
crust
!
</p>
<p>
I
was
lost
.
Though
I
wandered
ceaselessly
throughout
a
lifetime
,
I
might
never
discover
the
whereabouts
of
my
former
friends
of
this
strange
and
savage
world
.
Never
again
might
I
see
dear
old
Perry
,
nor
Ghak
the
Hairy
One
,
nor
Dacor
the
Strong
One
,
nor
that
other
infinitely
precious
one
--
my
sweet
and
noble
mate
,
Dian
the
Beautiful
!
</p>
<p>
But
even
so
I
was
glad
to
tread
once
more
the
surface
of
Pellucidar
.
Mysterious
and
terrible
,
grotesque
and
savage
though
she
is
in
many
of
her
aspects
,
I
can
not
but
love
her
.
Her
very
savagery
appealed
to
me
,
for
it
is
the
savagery
of
unspoiled
Nature
.
</p>
<p>
The
magnificence
of
her
tropic
beauties
enthralled
me
.
Her
mighty
land
areas
breathed
unfettered
freedom
.
</p>
<p>
Her
untracked
oceans
,
whispering
of
virgin
wonders
unsullied
by
the
eye
of
man
,
beckoned
me
out
upon
their
restless
bosoms
.
</p>
<p>
Not
for
an
instant
did
I
regret
the
world
of
my
nativity
.
I
was
in
Pellucidar
.
I
was
home
.
And
I
was
content
.
</p>
<p>
As
I
stood
dreaming
beside
the
giant
thing
that
had
brought
me
safely
through
the
earth
's
crust
,
my
traveling
companion
,
the
hideous
Mahar
,
emerged
from
the
interior
of
the
prospector
and
stood
beside
me
.
For
a
long
time
she
remained
motionless
.
</p>
<p>
What
thoughts
were
passing
through
the
convolutions
of
her
reptilian
brain
?
</p>
<p>
I
do
not
know
.
</p>
<p>
She
was
a
member
of
the
dominant
race
of
Pellucidar
.
By
a
strange
freak
of
evolution
her
kind
had
first
developed
the
power
of
reason
in
that
world
of
anomalies
.
</p>
<p>
To
her
,
creatures
such
as
I
were
of
a
lower
order
.
As
Perry
had
discovered
among
the
writings
of
her
kind
in
the
buried
city
of
Phutra
,
it
was
still
an
open
question
among
the
Mahars
as
to
whether
man
possessed
means
of
intelligent
communication
or
the
power
of
reason
.
</p>
<p>
Her
kind
believed
that
in
the
center
of
all-pervading
solidity
there
was
a
single
,
vast
,
spherical
cavity
,
which
was
Pellucidar
.
This
cavity
had
been
left
there
for
the
sole
purpose
of
providing
a
place
for
the
creation
and
propagation
of
the
Mahar
race
.
Everything
within
it
had
been
put
there
for
the
uses
of
the
Mahar
.
