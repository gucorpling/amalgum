West
Lombok
is
the
principal
area
of
tourist
activity
and
endeavour
in
Lombok
.
It
has
the
most
facilities
including
hotels
,
restaurants
,
tour
companies
,
car
and
motorbike
rental
operators
,
western
and
locally
oriented
bars
,
clubs
and
restaurants
.
</p>
<p>
The
focus
of
this
activity
is
upon
the
township
Senggigi
including
it
's
lineal
satellites
along
the
coast
north
to
the
quieter
and
pretty
Mangsit
beach
and
Klui
beach
,
and
south
to
Batu
Bolong
,
Batu
Layar
and
Monton
</p>
<p>
The
Senggigi
area
and
in
particular
the
township
itself
serves
as
the
principal
gateway
to
the
other
attractions
of
Lombok
northward
up
the
west
coast
including
the
Gili
Islands
and
to
Tanjung
with
it
's
upmarket
resorts
and
rental
villas
at
Sire
Beach
and
Medana
beach
.
Tanjung
in
the
north
of
the
district
is
the
gateway
to
the
North
Lombok
region
including
Senaru
,
Mount
Rinjani
and
further
on
to
the
historic
villages
of
Bayan

<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Bahasa

is
the
language

</p>
<p>
In
western
Lombok
the
local
people
speak
in
varying
dialects
of
the
indigenous
language
of
Lombok
.
Informal
versions
of
Bahasa
Indonesian
are
also
spoken
by
many
people
especially
amongst
the
younger
generations
who
may
also
introduce
elements
of
Javanese
or
Jakarta
slang
into
their
conversations
.
In
the
hotels
,
larger
shops
and
offices
of
the
district
people
will
normally
speak
in
more
formal
versions
of
<ref target="Bahasa%20Indonesia">
Bahasa

.
In
the
tourism
areas
along
the
west
coast
some
people
may
speak
English
,
especially
those
associated
in
some
way
with
tourism
activities
.
In
tourist
venues
such
as
hotels
and
restaurants
catering
to
overseas
tourists
there
is
more
likelihood
of
English
speakers
being
available
most
especially
in
the
major
hotels
,
restaurants
and
other
establishments
