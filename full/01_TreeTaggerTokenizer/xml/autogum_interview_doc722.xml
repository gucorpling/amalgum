:
These
were
all
great
shows
.
I
went
to
the
&quot;
Unauthorized
Children
’s
Scientology
Pageant
&quot;
,
with
my
youngest
son
who
had
been
through
the
roughest
parts
of
my
mental
collapse
with
me
,
and
we
just
laughed
and
laughed
.
It
was
so
great
.
If
it
’s
in
your
town
,
do
n’t
miss
it
.
</p>
<p>
The
<hi rend="italic">
South
Park
</hi>
episode
was
great
.
I
kept
it
on
my
replay
for
months
so
I
could
watch
again
with
friends
(
ex
Scn
or
never
Scn
)
who
had
missed
it
.

<hi rend="bold">
I
wish
the
public
,
especially
America
,
would
not
be
so
star
struck
that
they
ignore
the
Human
Rights
Abuses
happening
within
our

borders

Do
you
have
any
thoughts
or
advice
for
others
either
curious
to
find
out
more
information
about
Scientology
or
those
seeking
to
leave
the
organization
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
NM
</hi>
:
If
you
are
thinking
about
joining
,
stick
to
the
internet
for
a
while
,
a
long
while
–
they
have
their
own
websites
,
so
you
can
see
both
sides
.
</p>
<p>
For
those
seeking
to
leave
the
Sea
Organization
,
just
get
up
and
walk
out
.
If
they
touch
you
you
have
a
million
dollar
lawsuit
–
but
how
to
get
the
information
inside
to
you
?
?
?

come
