Creative
?
Yes
,
You
!
If
you
do
n’t
think
so
,
think
back
to
your
childhood
days
when
you
made
meals
out
of
dirt
and
water
:
Yummy
MUD
PIES
…
Think
back
to
times
when
your
family
was
hungry
and
you
had
n’t
gone
shopping
yet
and
you
made
real
meals
out
of
whatever
was
in
your
refrigerator
.
That
’s
simple
creativity
and
some
of
the
best
recipes
come
from
days
like
that
!
You
do
n’t
have
to
be
born
with
paint
running
through
your
veins
to
be
an
artist
.

When
we
open
our
hearts
and
lives
to
creativity
,
we
also
invite
other
feelings
in
like

As
a
parent
,
it
is
not
only
important
for
you
to
live
a
creative
lifestyle
,
it
is
equally
important
for
you
to
teach
it
to
your
children
.
Your
child
’s
love
for
the
arts
will
depend
a
lot
upon
how
you
feel
about
it
.
Through
the
process
of
creating
art
,
children
can

Be
specific
with
your
encouragement
.
Instead
of
simply
saying
“
I
like
your
painting
”
,
say
,
“
I
like
how
you
used
blue
for
the
color
of
your
sun
,
and
the
stripes
on
your
frog
are
amazing
!

creativity

If

time
allotted

let
them
finish
it
later
.
Be
sure
to
follow
through
with
the
finish
day
and
time
you
both
decide
on

Now
,
you
are
ready
to
make
a
self
portrait
of
your
creative
self
.
Here
’s
how
:
<list type="unordered">
<item>
You
will
need
a
piece
of
paper
for
each
person
,
and
a
pencil
,
scissors
,
glue
,
and
magazines
to
share
.
Have
each
person
sketch
themselves
on
their
piece
of
paper
(
simple
head
,
with
eyes
,
nose
,
mouth
,
etc.
will
do
)
.
Cut
magazine
pages
in
various
colors
and
small
sizes
.
This
can
be
done
ahead
of
time
.
Form
a
background
behind
the
sketch
with
magazine
pieces
glued
down
.
Next
,
have
them
glue
pieces
onto
their
self-portrait
sketch
.
Place
the
pieces
so
that
they
form
the
eyes
,
nose
,
mouth
and
hair
.
