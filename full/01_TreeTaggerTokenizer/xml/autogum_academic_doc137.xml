Introduction
</head>
<p>
Firms
strive
to
improve
their
value
by
efficiently
utilizing
the
resources
provided
by
interested
parties
,
such
as
shareholders
,
debtors
,
and
regulators
.
In
particular
,
managers
directly
operate
and
manage
their
business
activities
with
fiduciary
responsibilities
.
They
,
in
turn
,
provide
accounting
information
to
outsiders
of
the
company
in
order
to
help
them
make
appropriate
financial
decisions
.
Financial
statements
are
very
important
sources
for
stakeholders
,
especially
when
they
try
to
make
decisions
.
A
firm
’s
annual
report
,
disclosure
,
MD&amp;A
(
Management
Discussion
and
Analysis
)
and
non-financial
report
also
provide
significant
information
to
outsiders
.
Therefore
,
a
firm
’s
financial
performance
as
well
as
the
quality
of
reporting
is
likely
to
reflect
the
fulfillment
of
the
manager
’s
fiduciary
responsibilities
and
reporting
obligation
.
Consequently
,
when
a
company
’s
financial
performance
is
determined
by
the
ability
of
the
manager
,
the
reporting
quality
would
reflect
the
manager
’s
level
of
ethics
.
Such
reporting
quality
is
defined
in
different
aspects
;
they
can
be
interpreted
in
terms
of
reliability
of
accounting
information
,
earning
’s
quality
,
appropriate
audit
activity
and
accounting
transparency
.
It
is
the
quality
of
financial
reporting
that
affects
the
company
’s
cost
of
capital
as
well
as
the
interested
parties
’
decision-making
.
</p>
<p>
Jianu
et
al.
demonstrates
that
sustainability
positively
influences
the
performance
from
the
perspective
of
firms
’
marketing
and
reporting
,
they
argue
that
a
company
’s
market
positioning
can
be
strengthened
by
sustainability
and
marketing
reports
.
If
it
is
true
,
firms
’
reporting
could
be
a
tool
for
marketing
and
public
relations
documents
,
and
its
high
quality
would
lead
to
sustainable
management
as
well
as
better
positioning
on
capital
markets
.
</p>
<p>
Globally
,
a
firm
’s
level
of
ethics
and
its
ethical
characteristics
are
being
recognized
as
important
factors
for
survival
in
the
market
in
recent
years
.
In
the
past
,
corporations
used
to
focus
on
profit
maximization
;
however
,
they
were
required
to
expand
their
role
in
order
to
mediate
the
conflict
among
various
interested
parties
.
Ethical
practice
of
business
has
become
an
important
issue
in
society
with
emphasis
on
firms
’
social
responsibilities
.
Due
to
the
development
of
information
technology
,
deregulation
,
and
the
strengthening
of
consumers
’
rights
,
the
demand
for
ethical
practice
of
business
as
well
as
improving
the
level
of
consciousness
have
increased
.
</p>
<p>
Under
the
circumstances
,
if
a
manager
’s
characteristic
,
morality
,
and
ethicality
affect
various
corporate
activities
,
we
can
predict
that
they
can
also
affect
the
accounting
reporting
quality
.
More
specifically
,
if
a
manager
’s
level
of
ethics
affects
the
reporting
quality
,
which
is
substantial
in
financial
decision-making
for
interested
parties
,
we
need
to
examine
the
relationship
between
the
level
of
a
manager
’s
ethics
and
the
quality
of
financial
reporting
.
In
the
same
context
,
some
literatures
examined
this
relation
.
Jones
and
Loe
et
al.
argue
that
ethics
of
a
corporation
affects
general
corporate
activities
and
a
high
level
of
ethics
prevents
the
manipulation
of
accounting
information
.
The
obvious
example
to
explain
this
relation
can
be
Enron
’s
accounting
scandal
in
2001
.
Considered
as
the
worst
accounting
fraud
in
history
,
Enron
took
advantage
of
the
accounting
flexibility
and
withheld
relevant
information
regarding
its
low
profitability
and
high
risk
,
only
to
go
through
a
bankruptcy
process
.
</p>
<p>
In
South
Korea
,
since
the
late
1990s
,
managerial
ethics
has
been
strongly
emphasized
in
the
realm
of
business
because
the
government
regarded
the
moral
hazard
and
lack
of
transparency
of
financial
reporting
in
corporations
as
the
main
cause
of
the
financial
crisis
at
that
time
.
Accordingly
,
various
researchers
have
attempted
to
examine
the
relation
between
the
level
of
corporate
ethics
and
the
quality
of
accounting
reports
.
Moon
examines
business
ethics
as
to
how
it
affects
the
transparency
of
financial
reporting
by
looking
at
the
discretionary
accruals
.
She
suggests
that
firms
that
established
a
business
ethics
code
conveyed
higher
accounting
reporting
quality
than
those
that
did
not
.
In
addition
,
Pae
and
Choi
provide
the
ECI
(
Ethical
Commitment
Index
)
(
The
Ethical
Commitment
Index
indicates
a
firm
’s
levels
of
ethics
)
and
examine
the
relation
between
business
ethics
and
accounting
report
quality
,
such
as
discretionary
accruals
,
accounting
conservatism
,
and
accruals
quality
.
The
result
also
presents
that
firms
with
higher
ECI
have
higher
reporting
quality
.
Overall
,
these
results
prove
the
reporting
activity
as
one
of
the
manager
’s
activities
as
well
as
reflect
on
the
level
of
their
moralities
and
ethics
.
