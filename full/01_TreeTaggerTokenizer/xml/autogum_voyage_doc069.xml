<p>
Honor
.
Tradition

Loyalty

If
you
're
familiar
with
<hi rend="bold">
South
Boston
</hi>
as
presented
on
the
silver
screen
,
these
values
might
spring
foremost
to
your
mind
.
You
would
n't
be
wrong
,
but
<hi rend="italic">
a
lot
</hi>
has
changed
since
mob
boss
Whitey
Bulger
controlled
his
criminal
underworld
from
here
during
the
1970s
.
The
identity
of
&quot;
Southie
&quot;
,
as
it
's
known
to
locals
,
is
being
reshaped
.
</p>
<head>
Understand
</head>
<p>
Originally
,
South
Boston
was
known
as
&quot;
Dorchester
Neck
&quot;
,
a
small
isthmus
in
northern
Dorchester
.
Once
all
but
disconnected
from
downtown
,
acres
of
land
were
created
throughout
the
19th
century
physically
bringing
the
two
towns
together
.
This
was
a
burgeoning
area
for
maritime
industries
,
and
was
first
annexed
by
Boston
in
1804
,
and
then
again
in
1870
.
Southie
really
distinguished
itself
with
the
arrival
of
the
Irish
after
the
Great
Famine
in
the
mid
19th
century
.
</p>
<p>
The
quintessential
triple
decker
homes
and
their
occupants
of
Irish
decent
remain
.
Neighbors
still
greet
one
another
on
the
street
as
they
go
about
their
daily
routines
.
But
things
are
different
now
.
Money
abounds
in
this
area
so
close
to
downtown
<ref target="Boston">
Boston
</ref>
.
Real
estate
developers
make
million
dollar
offers
to
long
time
residents
,
sight
unseen
.
What
does
it
matter
what
the
insides
look
like
when
you
'll
be
tearing
the
whole
thing
down
anyway
.
</p>
<p>
These
trends
will
continue
into
the
foreseeable
future
,
as
more
of
Southie
has
been
rezoned
to
resemble
the
Seaport
.
In
spite
of
these
challenges
,
pockets
of
the
old-time
community
spirit
persist
.
Some
shops
and
restaurants
have
remained
popular
with
new
residents
.
The
St.
Patrick
's
Day
Parade
continues
each
year
.
The
Neighborhood
character
evolves
as
ideas
from
newcomers
mix
with
the
best
from
the
old
guard
.

The
Seaport
:
</hi>
No
other
neighborhood
in
Boston
(
and
few
in
America
)
have
undergone
so
much
change
in
so
little
time
.
Back
in
2004
,
the
area
was
nothing
more
than
acres
of
windswept
parking
lots
.
By
2014
those
lots
had
been
replaced
by
a
convention
center
,
an
art
gallery
,
scores
of
office
and
residential
towers
,
and
a
mass
transit
system
.
Over
<hi rend="italic">
a
trillion
</hi>
dollars
(
yes
with
a
t
!
)
of
new
real
estate
washed
onto
the
market
during
that
decade
,
and
continues
to
do
so
.
Debate
continues
about
whether
the
redevelopment
of
the
Seaport
is
succeeding
in
turning
the
area
into
a
real
community
.
There
are
no
grocery
stores
or
public
schools
here
yet
,
but
the
area
and
the
idea
is
still
new
.
Give
it
time
to
see
what
Boston
's
newest
incarnation
develops
.

Fort
Point
:
</hi>
Nuzzled
in
below
the
Seaport
,
think
of
Fort
Point
as
its
older
,
smaller
brother
.
When
the
manufacturing
industry
collapsed
,
many
beautiful
brick
factories
along
the
channel
were
simply
too
big
and
expensive
to
tear
down
.
What
was
bad
news
at
the
time
has
turned
out
great
for
today
's
Bostonians
,
as
many
large
industrial
spaces
were
preserved
and
live
on
today
as
fantastic
hotels
and
restaurants
.

of

For
those
trying
to
get
deeper
into
South

,
you
'll
need
to
ride
the
bus

all

City
Point
and
connect

Red

South

,
Broadway
,
and
Andrew
.
It
's
hard
to
overstate
the
impact
of
all
the
construction
,
and
the
neighborhood
has
been
welcoming
scores
of
new
residents
every
month
for
years
.
While
the
number
of
commuters
increases
,
the
number
of
busses
has
not
been
able
to
keep
pace
with
the
demand
.
Beyond
normal
rush
hour
traffic
,
it
can
be
quite
difficult
to
board
busses
headed
downtown
in
the
morning
,
and
leaving
the
city
at
night
.
The
MBTA
is
working
on
addressing
this
issue
,
but
for
now
plan
on
riding
late
,
crowded
busses
.

By

<p>
There
are
actually
quite
a
few
services
available
along
the
waterfront
in
Southie
.
One
of
the
most
popular
and
frequent
are
<hi rend="bold">
Water
Taxis
</hi>
.
These
little
boats
run
all
year
round
and
service
points
of
interest
like
The
Children
's
Museum
,
the
ICA
,
World
Trade
Center
,
and
more
.
You
'll
have
to
call
ahead
in
less
popular
locations
and
times
.
Hop
aboard
a
real
ship
and
take
the
Bay
State
Cruise
Company
's
<hi rend="bold">
Provincetown
Fast
Ferry
</hi>
,
running
from
the
pier
with
the
Seaport
Hotel
during
the
summer
months
.
</p>
<p>
Additionally
,
over
20
cruise
lines
dock
their
mega
ships
at
<hi rend="bold">
Black
Falcon
Pier
</hi>
.
During
the
warmer
months
they
may
arrive
from
ports
as
far
as
Europe
and
the
Caribbean
.
Local
taxis
know
these
schedules
,
so
you
should
have
no
problem
transporting
yourself
and
your
luggage
to
the
hotel
.
Smaller
boats
can
be
found
at
the
<hi rend="bold">
EDIC
Pier
</hi>
and
provide
service
to
and
from
the
<ref target="Boston%20Harbor%20Islands">
Boston
Harbor
Islands
</ref>
.
Keep
your
eyes
peeled
,
because
this
pier
can
easily
be
overlooked
.
It
's
right
next
to
the
bridge
,
do
n't
walk
too
far
down
towards
the
enormous
Black
Falcon
area
.

<p>
Many
parking
lots
have
been
replaced
by
luxury
condos
,
so
think
before
you
drive
,
especially
in
the
seaport
.
There
is
<hi rend="italic">
some
</hi>
on
street
parking
in
the
remaining
industrial-feeling
areas
towards
the
center
of
the
neighborhood
,
but
much
of
it
is
n't
any
more
convenient
than
walking
from
a
T
station
.
Some
two
way
roads
were
converted
to
one
way
during
the
&quot;
snowpocalypse
&quot;
events
of
2015
,
so
know
your
GPS
directions
may
be
incorrect
.
Watch
for
cars
coming
to
a
stop
in
the
middle
of
the
road
,
as
some
residents
feel
entitled
to
double
park
wherever
they
please
,
especially
on
Broadway
.
Do
n't
bother
trying
to
find
parking
out
at
Castle
Island
during
the
summer
,
but
you
might
luck
out
if
you
go
at
odd
times
.
In
wintertime
you
may
find
&quot;
space
savers
&quot;
placed
in
shoveled
out
parking
spots
.
You
are
legally
allowed
to
move
these
items
and
park
,
but
by
doing
so
you
place
your
vehicle
at
risk
of
being
vandalized
.
Exit

<hi rend="bold">

and
Exit

the
area
and
are
found
at
the
extreme
western
edge
