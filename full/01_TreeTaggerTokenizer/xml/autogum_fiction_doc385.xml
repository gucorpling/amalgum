Seven
long
years
and
more
(
Greek)-ing
it
,
at
Greek
and
Latin
;
</head>
<p>
Four
years
at
his
probations
and
his
negations
--
the
fine
statue
still
lying
in
the
middle
of
the
marble
block
,
--
and
nothing
done
,
but
his
tools
sharpened
to
hew
it
out
!
--
'Tis
a
piteous
delay
!
--
Was
not
the
great
Julius
Scaliger
within
an
ace
of
never
getting
his
tools
sharpened
at
all
?
--
Forty-four
years
old
was
he
before
he
could
manage
his
Greek
;
--
and
Peter
Damianus
,
lord
bishop
of
Ostia
,
as
all
the
world
knows
,
could
not
so
much
as
read
,
when
he
was
of
man
's
estate
.
--
And
Baldus
himself
,
as
eminent
as
he
turned
out
after
,
entered
upon
the
law
so
late
in
life
,
that
every
body
imagined
he
intended
to
be
an
advocate
in
the
other
world
:
no
wonder
,
when
Eudamidas
,
the
son
of
Archidamas
,
heard
Xenocrates
at
seventy-five
disputing
about
wisdom
,
that
he
asked
gravely
,
--
If
the
old
man
be
yet
disputing
and
enquiring
concerning
wisdom
,
--
what
time
will
he
have
to
make
use
of
it
?
</p>
<p>
Yorick
listened
to
my
father
with
great
attention
;
there
was
a
seasoning
of
wisdom
unaccountably
mixed
up
with
his
strangest
whims
,
and
he
had
sometimes
such
illuminations
in
the
darkest
of
his
eclipses
,
as
almost
atoned
for
them
:
--
be
wary
,
Sir
,
when
you
imitate
him
.
</p>
<p>
I
am
convinced
,
Yorick
,
continued
my
father
,
half
reading
and
half
discoursing
,
that
there
is
a
North-west
passage
to
the
intellectual
world
;
and
that
the
soul
of
man
has
shorter
ways
of
going
to
work
,
in
furnishing
itself
with
knowledge
and
instruction
,
than
we
generally
take
with
it
.
--
But
,
alack
!
all
fields
have
not
a
river
or
a
spring
running
besides
them
;
--
every
child
,
Yorick
,
has
not
a
parent
to
point
it
out
.
</p>
<p>
--
The
whole
entirely
depends
,
added
my
father
,
in
a
low
voice
,
upon
the
auxiliary
verbs
,
Mr.
Yorick
.
</p>
<p>
Had
Yorick
trod
upon
Virgil
's
snake
,
he
could
not
have
looked
more
surprised
.
--
I
am
surprised
too
,
cried
my
father
,
observing
it
,
--
and
I
reckon
it
as
one
of
the
greatest
calamities
which
ever
befel
the
republic
of
letters
,
That
those
who
have
been
entrusted
with
the
education
of
our
children
,
and
whose
business
it
was
to
open
their
minds
,
and
stock
them
early
with
ideas
,
in
order
to
set
the
imagination
loose
upon
them
,
have
made
so
little
use
of
the
auxiliary
verbs
in
doing
it
,
as
they
have
done
--
So
that
,
except
Raymond
Lullius
,
and
the
elder
Pelegrini
,
the
last
of
which
arrived
to
such
perfection
in
the
use
of
'
em
,
with
his
topics
,
that
,
in
a
few
lessons
,
he
could
teach
a
young
gentleman
to
discourse
with
plausibility
upon
any
subject
,
pro
and
con
,
and
to
say
and
write
all
that
could
be
spoken
or
written
concerning
it
,
without
blotting
a
word
,
to
the
admiration
of
all
who
beheld
him
.
--
I
should
be
glad
,
said
Yorick
,
interrupting
my
father
,
to
be
made
to
comprehend
this
matter
.
You
shall
,
said
my
father
.
</p>
<p>
The
highest
stretch
of
improvement
a
single
word
is
capable
of
,
is
a
high
metaphor
,
--
for
which
,
in
my
opinion
,
the
idea
is
generally
the
worse
,
and
not
the
better
;
--
but
be
that
as
it
may
,
--
when
the
mind
has
done
that
with
it
--
there
is
an
end
,
--
the
mind
and
the
idea
are
at
rest
,
--
until
a
second
idea
enters
;
--
and
so
on
.
</p>
<p>
Now
the
use
of
the
Auxiliaries
is
,
at
once
to
set
the
soul
a-going
by
herself
upon
the
materials
as
they
are
brought
her
;
and
by
the
versability
of
this
great
engine
,
round
which
they
are
twisted
,
to
open
new
tracts
of
enquiry
,
and
make
every
idea
engender
millions
.
</p>
<p>
You
excite
my
curiosity
greatly
,
said
Yorick
.
</p>
<p>
For
my
own
part
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
,
I
have
given
it
up
.
--
The
Danes
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
quoth
the
corporal
,
who
were
on
the
left
at
the
siege
of
Limerick
,
were
all
auxiliaries
.
--
And
very
good
ones
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
.
--
But
the
auxiliaries
,
Trim
,
my
brother
is
talking
about
,
--
I
conceive
to
be
different
things
.
--
</p>
<p>
--
You
do
?
said
my
father
,
rising
up
.
</p>
<p>
Chapter
3
.
XLIII
.
</p>
<p>
My
father
took
a
single
turn
across
the
room
,
then
sat
down
,
and
finished
the
chapter
.
</p>
<p>
The
verbs
auxiliary
we
are
concerned
in
here
,
continued
my
father
,
are
,
am
;
was
;
have
;
had
;
do
;
did
;
make
;
made
;
suffer
;
shall
;
should
;
will
;
would
;
can
;
could
;
owe
;
ought
;
used
;
or
is
wont
.
--
And
these
varied
with
tenses
,
present
,
past
,
future
,
and
conjugated
with
the
verb
see
,
--
or
with
these
questions
added
to
them
;
--
Is
it
?
Was
it
?
Will
it
be
?
Would
it
be
?
May
it
be
?
Might
it
be
?
And
these
again
put
negatively
,
Is
it
not
?
Was
it
not
?
Ought
it
not
?
--
Or
affirmatively
,
--
It
is
;
It
was
;
It
ought
to
be
.
Or
chronologically
,
--
Has
it
been
always
?
Lately
?
How
long
ago
?
--
Or
hypothetically
,
--
If
it
was
?
If
it
was
not
?
What
would
follow
?
--
If
the
French
should
beat
the
English
?
If
the
Sun
go
out
of
the
Zodiac
?
</p>
<p>
Now
,
by
the
right
use
and
application
of
these
,
continued
my
father
,
in
which
a
child
's
memory
should
be
exercised
,
there
is
no
one
idea
can
enter
his
brain
,
how
barren
soever
,
but
a
magazine
of
conceptions
and
conclusions
may
be
drawn
forth
from
it
.
--
Didst
thou
ever
see
a
white
bear
?
cried
my
father
,
turning
his
head
round
to
Trim
,
who
stood
at
the
back
of
his
chair
:
--
No
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
replied
the
corporal
.
--
But
thou
couldst
discourse
about
one
,
Trim
,
said
my
father
,
in
case
of
need
?
--
How
is
it
possible
,
brother
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
,
if
the
corporal
never
saw
one
?
--
'Tis
the
fact
I
want
,
replied
my
father
,
--
and
the
possibility
of
it
is
as
follows
.
