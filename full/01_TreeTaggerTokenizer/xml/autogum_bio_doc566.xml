Chenhao
was
not
a

but
had
literary

and

However

he
was
cunning
and
ambitious
like

all
other
princes
,
aiming
to
become

Zhu
Chenhao
had
long
intended
to
rebel
,
but
he
did
not
have
an
army
or
even
bodyguards
.
This
situation
started
with
his
ancestor
Zhu
Quan
.
At
that
time
,
when
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yongle_Emperor">
Yongle
Emperor
</ref>
acceded
to
the
throne
he
relocated
Zhu
Quan
(
1st
Prince
Of
Ning
)
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing">
Beijing
</ref>
.
Then
,
to
prevent
Zhu
Quan
's
treason
,
his
army
and
bodyguards
were
withdrawn
and
never
restored
until
Zhu
Chenhao
's
reign
.

<p>
In
the
summer
of
1507
,
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhengde_Emperor">
Zhengde
Emperor
</ref>
'
s
era
,
Zhu
Chenhao
sent
a
eunuch
to
Beijing
with
an
enormous
bribe
for
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Jin">
Liu
Jin
</ref>
.
The
prince
wanted
Liu
Jin
to
restore
his
princely
bodyguards
and
its
revenues
in
return
for
the
bribe
.
Although
the
Ministry
Of
War
objected
,
the
princely
bodyguard
was
restored
but
it
was
withdrawn
again
in
September
1510
,
the
day
before
Liu
Jin
was
executed
.
Zhu
Chenhao
was
undaunted
.
He
tried
again
to
restore
his
army
in
1514
through
the
Ministry
Of
War
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lu_Wan_(Ming_dynasty)">

.
Several
years
before
,
Lu
Wan
was
an
officer
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiangxi">
Jiangxi
</ref>
and
supporter
to
the
prince
.
Lu
Wan
agreed
to
do
it
,
but
Grand
Secretary
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fei_Hong">
Fei
Hong
</ref>
refused
to
sign
the
draft
;
in
other
words
he
did
not
approve
the
request
since
he
knew
what
the
prince
would
do
.
However
,
the
prince
had
plotted
with
some
imperial
officials
such
as
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qian_Ning">
Qian
Ning
</ref>
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cang_Xian">
Cang
Xian
</ref>
,
several
eunuchs
and
some
of
Emperor
Zhengde
's
personal
staff
to
cheat
Fei
Hong
.
The
plot
was
a
success
,
Fei
Hong
was
befooled
and
the
Imperial
decree
was
issued
,
the
prince
bodyguards
being
restored
.
</p>
<p>
In
June
1514
,
the
prince
requested
seals
to
give
him
authority
to
control
the
military
army
in
his
region
.
He
also
recruited
hundreds
of
bandits
to
become
his
henchmen
.
In
August
1514
,
Zhu
Chenhao
requested
authority
to
punish
guilty
Imperial
Clansmen
.
With
recommendation
from
Lu
Wan
,
Zhengde
Emperor
agreed
.
By
this
time
,
the
Prince
Of
Ning
referred
to
himself
as
ruler
,
his
bodyguards
as
Imperial
attendants
and
his
order
as
imperial
edicts
.
He
also
order
local
officials
to
wear
formal
court
robes
when
attending
to
him
.
Jiangxi
Governor
,
speaking
on
behalf
of
his
subordinates
,
said
that
it
would
be
improper
and
refused
to
do
it
.
</p>
<p>
Zhu
Chenhao
began
to
recruit
strategists
and
advisors
to
his
cause
.
His
principal
advisor
was
a
provincial
examination
graduate
versed
in
military
strategy
.
Local
officials
who
refused
to
support
the
prince
were
eliminated
.
A
Judicial
Intendant
of
Jiangxi
who
reported
the
prince
's
treason
to
the
court
,
was
arrested
and
killed
.
Under
these
circumstances
,
other
local
officials
cooperated
and
said
nothing
.
In
May
1517
several
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eunuchs">
eunuchs
</ref>
from
Zhu
Chenhao
's
household
secretly
went
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing">
Beijing
</ref>
to
report
his
unlawful
activities
.
Commander
of
Imperial
Bodyguard
Qian
Ning
reported
this
to
the
prince
,
then
the
eunuchs
were
arrested
and
beaten
to
die
before
reaching
their
objective
.

In
July
1519
,
when
Zhu
Chenhao
was
attending
a
banquet
in
honor
of
his
birthday
,
a
spy
arrived
from
Beijing
with
the
news
that
high
officials
had
been
sent
to
arrest
him
,
for
that
was
what
had
been
rumored
in
Beijing
.
He
left
the
banquet
at
once
and
called
an
urgent
meeting
of
his
advisors
.
They
all
agreed
that
the
prince
's
plot
was
known
,
and
could
not
wait
any
longer
to
take
action
.
On
10
July
1519
,
Zhu
Chenhao
assembled
local
officials
and
announced
that
eunuch

</ref>
had
fooled
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hongzhi_Emperor">

Emperor
</ref>
into
thinking
that
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhengde_Emperor">
Zhengde
Emperor
</ref>
was
his
son
.
According
to
him
,
the
person
on
the
throne
was
the
child
of
a
commoner
.
The
prince
also
announced
that
he
had
received
an
edict
from
the
empress
to
punish
those
bandits
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Sui">
Sun
Sui
</ref>
,
governor
of
Jiangxi
asked
the
prince
to
show
the
empress
's
edict
,
but
he
was
rejected
.
Then
Sun
Sui
accused
the
prince
of
treason
.
Sun
Sui
and
several
officials
who
refused
to
cooperate
were
executed
summarily
.
</p>
<p>
The
prince
's
army
issued
out
from
his
headquarters
,
the
city
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanchang">

Wang
Yangming
</ref>
,
governor
of
Southern
Jiangxi
at
that
time
,
he
soon
took
action
.
Wang
Yangming
spread
a
false
report
that
a
huge
Imperial
army
from
Beijing
was
marching
to
Nanchang
.
The
Prince
Of
Ning
did
not
dare
to
leave
his
headquarters
for
several
days
until
he
realized
it
was
a
false
report
.
On

The
prince
's
headquarters
was
not
garrisoned
well
and
only
a
few
soldiers
of
the
army
defended
the
city
.
Soon
after
the
siege
of
Nanchang
news
reached
Zhu
Chenhao
,
he
ordered
a
retreat
from
Anqing
and
back
to
Nanchang

base
.
</p>
<p>
Wang
Yangming
stormed
Nanchang
and
had
a
serious
battle
with
the
Prince
of
Ning
.
Then
on

August
,
the
rebel
Prince
and
his
army
were
totally
defeated
by
Wang
.
The
prince
was
going
to
flee
with
a
small
boat
but
it
was
discovered
by
Wang
.
Wang
burned
the
boat
before
the
prince
reached
it
,
and
soon
the

was
captured
