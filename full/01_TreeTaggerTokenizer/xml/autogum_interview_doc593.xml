But
if
you
're
not
getting
paid
to
be
a
sponsor
for
all
that
is
awesome
in
Australia
,
what
do
you
do
outside
of
skiing
,
and
the
long
jump
,
and
the
javelin
?

Jessica
Gallagher
:
</hi>
I
'm
an
osteopath
.
So
I
finished
my
masters
'
degree
in
2009
.
I
was
completing
a
bachelor
's
and
a
masters
.
I
was
working
for
the
Victorian
Institute
of
Sport
guiding
program
but
with
the
commitment
to
London
having
so
much
travel
I
actually
just
put
everything
on
hold
in
terms
of
my
osteo
career
.
There
's
not
really
enough
time
.
And
then
the
ambassador
role
,
I
had
a
few
commitments
with
that
,
and
I
did
motivational
speaking
.

That
's
very
cool
.
Eric
,
I
've
read
that
you
work
as
a
guide
in
back
country
skiing
,
and
all
sorts
of
crazy
stuff
like
that
.
What
do
you
do
when
you
're
not
leading
Jessica
Gallagher
down
a
ski
slope
?
</p>
<p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Eric
Bickerton
:
</hi>
I
'm
the
Chief
Executive
of
Disabled
Winter
Sports
Australia
.
So
we
look
after
all
the
disability
winter
sports
,
except
for
the
Paralympics
.
</p>

<hi rend="bold">

You
like
that
?
You
find
it
fulfilling
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Eric
Bickerton
:
</hi>
The
skiing
aspect
's
good
.
I
dunno
about
the
corporate
stuff
.
I
could
give
that
a
miss
.
But
I
think
it
is
quite
fulfilling
.
Yeah
,
they
're
a
very
good
group
of
people
there
who
enjoy
themselves
,
both
in
disabilities
and
able
bodied
.
We
really
need
guides
and
support
staff
.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">

</hi>
Has
it
changed
over
the
last
few
years
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Eric
Bickerton

</hi>
For
us
?

</hi>
Being
a
guide
in
general
?
How
things
have
changed
or
improved
,
have
you
been
given
more
recognition
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Eric
Bickerton
:
</hi>
No.
I
do
n't
see
myself
as
an
athlete
.
Legally
we
are
<hi rend="italic">
the
</hi>
athlete
.
If
I
fail
,
she
fails
.
We
ski
the
exact
same
course
.
But
there
's
some
idiosyncrasies
associated
with
it
.
Because
I
'm
a
male
guiding
,
I
have
to
ski
on
male
skis
,
which
are
different
to
female
skis
,
which
means
my
turn
shape
I
have
to
control
differently
so
it
's
the
same
as
her
turn
shape
.
It
's
a
little
bit
silly
.
Whereas
if
I
was
a
female
guiding
,
I
'd
be
on
exactly
the
same
skis
,
and
we
'd
be
able
to
ski
exactly
the
same
all
the
way
through
.
In
that
context
I
think
the
fact
that
Jess
won
the
medal
opened
the
eyes
to
the
APC
about
visual
impairment
as
a
definite
medal
contending
aspect
.
The
biggest
impediment
to
the
whole
process
is
how
the
Hell
do
you
get
a
guide
who
's
(
a
)
capable
,
(
b
)
available
and
(
c
)
able
to
fund
himself
.
So
we
're
fortunate
that
the
APC
pushed
for
the
recognition
of
myself
as
an
athlete
,
and
because
we
have
the
medal
from
the
previous
Olympics
,
we
're
now
tier
one
,
so
we
get
the
government
funding
all
way
through
.
Without
that
two
years
before
the
last
games
,
that
cost
me
fifteen
,
sixteen
months
of
my
time
,
and
$
40,000
of
cash
to
be
the
guide
.
So
while
I
enjoyed
it
,
and
well
I
did
,
it
is
very
very
hard
to
say
that
a
guide
could
make
a
career
out
of
being
a
guide
.
There
needs
to
be
a
little
bit
more
consideration
of
that
,
a
bit
like
the
IPC
saying
no
you
're
not
a
medal
winner
.
It
's
quite
a
silly
situation
where
it
's
written
into
the
rules
that
you
are
both
the
athlete
and
yet
at
the
same
time
you
're
not
a
medal
winner
.
I
think
there
's
evolution
.
It
's
growing
.
It
's
changing
.
It
's
very
,
very
difficult
.
