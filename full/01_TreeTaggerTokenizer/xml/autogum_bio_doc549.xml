frequently

In
recognition
of
Cartagena
's
influence
,
and
in
order
to
please
his
supporters
,
Magellan
named
him
captain
of
the
largest
ship
of
the
expedition
,
the
<hi rend="italic">

only

Tensions
surfaced
between
Cartagena
and
Magellan
as
soon
as
the
fleet
departed
Spain
.
In
councils
between
captains
,
Cartagena
routinely
opposed
Magellan
's
navigation
decisions
and
refused
to
salute
his
superior
when
required
by
custom
to
do
so
.
A
storm
delayed
the
fleet
south
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenerife">
Tenerife
</ref>
,
and
food
had
to
be
rationed
;
Cartagena
took
this
opportunity
to
publicly
criticise
Magellan
and
suggest
he
was
not
competent
to
command
.
Magellan
promptly
had
him
arrested
,
relieved
of
his
command
and
confined
aboard
the
<hi rend="italic">

Victoria
</ref>
</hi>
for
the
remainder
of
the
voyage

Cartagena
remained

until
the

reached

.
On

April

he
secretly
left

where
he
rallied
supporters
among
the
Spanish
crew
and
officers
in
opposition
to
the

In
company
with
<hi rend="italic">

Cartagena
seized
control
of

declared

The

joined
in
the

,
and
on

a
letter
was
sent
to
Magellan
's
flagship
,
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad_(ship)">
<hi rend="italic">

</ref>
demanding
that
the
captain-general
acknowledge
that
the

no
longer

</p>
<p>
Magellan
brought
the

</hi>
alongside
<hi rend="italic">

and
lowered
a

to
carry

When

<hi rend="italic">

they
made
a

handing

a

when
<hi rend="italic">

captain
sought
to
take

the
boat

stabbed
him
to

Simultaneously
,
fifteen
men
from

climbed
aboard
and
attacked
the
mutineers
.

<p>
Cartagena
had
relocated
to
<hi rend="italic">
Concepción
</hi>
prior
to
the
battle
,
and
so
remained
temporarily
free
.
However
,
only
that
vessel
and
<hi rend="italic">
San

</hi>
remained
in
the
mutineer
's
hands
.
Magellan
ranged
his
three
ships
across
the
mouth
of
the
bay
in
which
the
fleet
had
anchored
,
and
cleared
the
decks
for
engagement
with
Cartagena
's
two
vessels
.
In
strong
winds
overnight
on
April

,
<hi rend="italic">
San

dragged
its
anchor
and
drifted
helplessly
toward
<hi rend="italic">

</hi>
Magellan
ordered
a
broadside
fired
,
at
which
the
crew
of
<hi rend="italic">
San

surrendered
and
allowed
the
vessel
to
be
retaken

Realising
the

on

Cartagena
followed
suit
and
surrendered

without
resistance

After
the
mutiny
,
Magellan
held
a
trial
of
the
conspirators
.
Cartagena
's
ally
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaspar_de_Quesada">

(

the

)
was
sentenced
to
death
by
beheading
.
However
,
Magellan
was
reluctant
to
execute
a
close

of
Fonseca
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBergreen2003153-11">

so
Cartagena
was
sentenced
to
be

marooned
</ref>
along
with
another
conspirator
,
the
priest
Pedro
Sánchez
de

.
The
sentence
was
carried
out
on
August

,
1520
,
four
months
after
the
mutiny
,
shortly
before
the
fleet
departed
their
winter
quarters
at
St.
Julian
.

Cartagena
and
the
priest
were
given
a
small
supply
of
ship
's
biscuits
and
drinking
water
and
left
on
a
small
island
off
the
Patagonian
coast

was

from
again
