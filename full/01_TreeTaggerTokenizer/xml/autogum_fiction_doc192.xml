Then
there
was
silence
for
a
time
</head>
<p>
While
Hubert
had
been
in
the
“
Trap
,
”
his
father
and
uncle
had
been
walking
along
the
beach
,
and
the
former
heard
for
the
first
time
the
nature
and
danger
of
the
“
Smuggler
's
Trap
.
”
He
was
at
once
filled
with
anxiety
about
his
son
,
and
had
hurried
to
the
place
to
call
him
back
,
when
to
his
horror
he
found
that
the
tide
had
already
covered
the
only
way
by
which
the
dangerous
place
might
be
approached
.
</p>
<p>
No
sooner
had
he
heard
Hubert
's
answering
cry
than
he
rushed
forward
to
try
and
save
him
.
But
the
next
moment
a
great
wave
came
rolling
in
and
dashed
him
upon
the
cliff
.
Terribly
bruised
,
he
clung
to
the
cliff
till
the
surf
fell
back
,
and
then
ran
on
again
.
</p>
<p>
He
slipped
over
a
rock
and
fell
,
but
instantly
regaining
his
feet
he
advanced
further
,
and
in
his
haste
fell
into
a
hollow
which
was
filled
with
water
.
</p>
<p>
Before
he
could
emerge
another
wave
was
upon
him
.
This
one
beat
him
down
,
and
it
was
only
by
clinging
to
the
seaweed
that
he
escaped
being
sucked
back
by
the
retreating
surge
.
Bold
and
frenzied
though
he
was
,
he
had
to
start
back
from
the
fury
of
such
an
assault
as
this
.
He
rushed
backward
and
waited
.
</p>
<p>
His
eyes
searched
wildly
around
.
He
noticed
that
the
surf
grew
more
violent
every
moment
,
and
every
moment
took
away
hope
.
But
he
would
not
yield
.
</p>
<p>
Once
more
he
rushed
forward
.
The
waves
rolled
in
,
but
he
grasped
the
rocks
and
withstood
the
surf
,
and
still
advanced
.
Another
followed
.
He
bowed
before
it
,
and
clinging
to
the
rocks
as
before
came
forth
triumphant
.
</p>
<p>
Already
he
was
nearly
halfway
.
He
sprang
upon
a
rock
that
rose
above
the
level
of
the
seething
flood
,
and
stood
for
a
moment
panting
and
gasping
.
But
now
a
great
wave
came
rolling
in
upon
him
.
He
fell
on
his
knees
and
clung
to
the
seaweed
.
</p>
<p>
The
wave
struck
.
It
hurled
him
from
the
rock
.
He
rolled
over
and
over
.
Blinded
,
bruised
and
half
drowned
,
he
felt
himself
dashed
against
the
cliff
.
He
threw
his
arms
wildly
about
,
but
found
nothing
which
he
could
seize
.
The
retreating
wave
sucked
him
back
.
But
a
rock
stayed
him
.
This
he
grasped
and
was
saved
.
</p>
<p>
Then
,
hastily
scrambling
to
his
feet
,
he
staggered
back
to
the
place
from
which
he
had
started
.
Before
he
could
get
back
another
wave
threw
him
down
,
and
this
time
he
might
have
been
drowned
had
not
his
brother
plunged
in
and
dragged
him
out
.
</p>
<p>
Of
all
this
Hubert
had
seen
nothing
,
and
known
nothing
.
He
waited
for
some
time
in
silence
,
and
then
called
.
There
was
no
answer
.
He
called
again
and
again
.
But
at
that
time
his
father
was
struggling
with
the
waves
and
did
not
hear
him
.
At
last
,
after
what
seemed
an
interminable
time
,
he
heard
once
more
his
father
's
voice
.
He
shouted
back
.
</p>
<p>
“
Do
n't
be
afraid
!
”
cried
the
voice
.
“
I
'll
get
you
out
.
Wait
.
”
</p>
<p>
And
then
there
were
no
more
voices
.
</p>
<p>
It
was
about
two
o'clock
when
Hubert
had
entered
the
gorge
.
It
was
after
three
when
his
father
had
roused
him
,
and
made
his
vain
effort
to
save
him
.
Hubert
was
now
left
alone
with
the
rising
tide
,
whose
waters
rolled
forward
with
fearful
rapidity
.
The
beach
inside
was
nearly
level
and
he
saw
that
in
an
hour
or
so
it
would
be
covered
with
the
waters
.
He
tried
to
trust
to
his
father
's
promise
,
but
the
precious
moments
passed
and
he
began
to
look
with
terror
upon
the
increasing
storm
;
for
every
moment
the
wind
grew
fiercer
,
and
the
surf
rolled
in
with
ever
increasing
impetuosity
.
</p>
<p>
He
looked
all
around
for
a
place
of
refuge
,
and
saw
nothing
except
the
rock
which
arose
at
the
extremity
of
the
place
,
at
the
foot
of
the
overhanging
cliffs
.
It
was
about
five
feet
high
,
and
was
the
only
place
that
afforded
anything
like
safety
.
</p>
<p>
Up
this
he
clambered
,
and
from
this
he
could
survey
the
scene
,
but
only
to
perceive
the
full
extent
of
his
danger
.
For
the
tide
rushed
in
more
and
more
swiftly
,
the
surf
grew
higher
and
higher
and
he
saw
plainly
that
before
long
the
water
would
reach
the
summit
of
the
rock
,
and
that
even
before
then
the
surf
in
its
violence
would
sweep
him
away
.
</p>
<p>
The
moments
passed
slowly
.
Minutes
seemed
in
his
suspense
to
be
transformed
to
hours
.
The
sky
was
overspread
now
with
black
clouds
;
and
the
gloom
increased
.
At
length
the
waves
rolled
in
until
they
covered
all
the
beach
in
front
,
and
began
to
dash
against
the
rock
on
which
he
had
taken
refuge
.
</p>
<p>
The
precious
moments
passed
.
Higher
and
higher
grew
the
waters
.
They
came
rolling
into
the
cave
,
urged
on
by
the
fury
of
the
billows
outside
,
and
heaping
themselves
up
as
they
were
compressed
into
this
narrow
gorge
.
They
dashed
up
around
the
rock
.
The
spray
was
tossed
in
his
face
.
Already
he
felt
their
inexorable
grasp
.
Death
seemed
so
near
that
hope
left
him
.
He
fell
upon
his
knees
with
his
hands
clasped
,
and
his
white
face
upturned
.
Just
then
a
great
wave
rolled
up
and
flung
itself
over
the
rock
,
and
over
his
knees
as
he
knelt
,
and
over
his
hands
as
he
clasped
them
in
prayer
.
A
few
more
moments
and
all
would
be
over
.
