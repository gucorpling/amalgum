(
about
40
minutes
walk
from

noticeboard

adjacent
to
the
Wirral
Sailing
Centre

Lane
in

Kirby
)
.
The
island
group
consists
of
Hilbre
itself
,
Middle
Eye
and
Little
Eye
.
Walk
out
to
Hilbre
or
its
smaller
(
and
closer
)
outcrop
,
Little
Eye
(
be
VERY
careful
of
tides
-
read
guidance
on
signs
near
the
boathouse
,
at
northern
end
of
the
marine
lake
)
.
A
raincoat
and
wellies
or
sturdy
,
waterproof
walking
boots
are
recommended
for
the
walk
across
.
To
get
to
the
island
accepted
wisdom
is
,
when
the
tide
is
on
the
ebb
to
walk
from
West
Kirby
from
the
northern
end
of
the
Marine
Lake
to
Little
Eye
first
and
then
around
the
&quot;
back
&quot;
of
Middle
Eye
avoiding
what
can
be
impassable
gullies
to
the
&quot;
front
&quot;
of
the
islands
,
and
thence
to
Hilbre
itself
.
Crossing
when
unsure
of
the
tides
can
mean
,
at
best
,
being
isolated
on
the
islands
until
the
tide
ebbs
,
or
at
worst
,
the
risk
of
being
caught
between
fast
flowing
tidal
gullies
.
The
walker
should
not
be
tempted
to
walk
direct
to
Hilbre
from
&quot;
Red
Rocks
&quot;

the
end
of
