PART
I
</head>
<p>
At
the
little
town
of
Vevey
,
in
Switzerland
,
there
is
a
particularly
comfortable
hotel
.
There
are
,
indeed
,
many
hotels
,
for
the
entertainment
of
tourists
is
the
business
of
the
place
,
which
,
as
many
travelers
will
remember
,
is
seated
upon
the
edge
of
a
remarkably
blue
lake
--
a
lake
that
it
behooves
every
tourist
to
visit
.
The
shore
of
the
lake
presents
an
unbroken
array
of
establishments
of
this
order
,
of
every
category
,
from
the
“
grand
hotel
”
of
the
newest
fashion
,
with
a
chalk-white
front
,
a
hundred
balconies
,
and
a
dozen
flags
flying
from
its
roof
,
to
the
little
Swiss
pension
of
an
elder
day
,
with
its
name
inscribed
in
German-looking
lettering
upon
a
pink
or
yellow
wall
and
an
awkward
summerhouse
in
the
angle
of
the
garden
.
One
of
the
hotels
at
Vevey
,
however
,
is
famous
,
even
classical
,
being
distinguished
from
many
of
its
upstart
neighbors
by
an
air
both
of
luxury
and
of
maturity
.
In
this
region
,
in
the
month
of
June
,
American
travelers
are
extremely
numerous
;
it
may
be
said
,
indeed
,
that
Vevey
assumes
at
this
period
some
of
the
characteristics
of
an
American
watering
place
.
There
are
sights
and
sounds
which
evoke
a
vision
,
an
echo
,
of
Newport
and
Saratoga
.
There
is
a
flitting
hither
and
thither
of
“
stylish
”
young
girls
,
a
rustling
of
muslin
flounces
,
a
rattle
of
dance
music
in
the
morning
hours
,
a
sound
of
high-pitched
voices
at
all
times
.
You
receive
an
impression
of
these
things
at
the
excellent
inn
of
the
“
Trois
Couronnes
”
and
are
transported
in
fancy
to
the
Ocean
House
or
to
Congress
Hall
.
But
at
the
“
Trois
Couronnes
,
”
it
must
be
added
,
there
are
other
features
that
are
much
at
variance
with
these
suggestions
:
neat
German
waiters
,
who
look
like
secretaries
of
legation
;
Russian
princesses
sitting
in
the
garden
;
little
Polish
boys
walking
about
held
by
the
hand
,
with
their
governors
;
a
view
of
the
sunny
crest
of
the
Dent
du
Midi
and
the
picturesque
towers
of
the
Castle
of
Chillon
.
</p>
<p>
I
hardly
know
whether
it
was
the
analogies
or
the
differences
that
were
uppermost
in
the
mind
of
a
young
American
,
who
,
two
or
three
years
ago
,
sat
in
the
garden
of
the
“
Trois
Couronnes
,
”
looking
about
him
,
rather
idly
,
at
some
of
the
graceful
objects
I
have
mentioned
.
It
was
a
beautiful
summer
morning
,
and
in
whatever
fashion
the
young
American
looked
at
things
,
they
must
have
seemed
to
him
charming
.
He
had
come
from
Geneva
the
day
before
by
the
little
steamer
,
to
see
his
aunt
,
who
was
staying
at
the
hotel
--
Geneva
having
been
for
a
long
time
his
place
of
residence
.
But
his
aunt
had
a
headache
--
his
aunt
had
almost
always
a
headache
--
and
now
she
was
shut
up
in
her
room
,
smelling
camphor
,
so
that
he
was
at
liberty
to
wander
about
.
He
was
some
seven-and-twenty
years
of
age
;
when
his
friends
spoke
of
him
,
they
usually
said
that
he
was
at
Geneva
“
studying
.
”
When
his
enemies
spoke
of
him
,
they
said
--
but
,
after
all
,
he
had
no
enemies
;
he
was
an
extremely
amiable
fellow
,
and
universally
liked
.
What
I
should
say
is
,
simply
,
that
when
certain
persons
spoke
of
him
they
affirmed
that
the
reason
of
his
spending
so
much
time
at
Geneva
was
that
he
was
extremely
devoted
to
a
lady
who
lived
there
--
a
foreign
lady
--
a
person
older
than
himself
.
Very
few
Americans
--
indeed
,
I
think
none
--
had
ever
seen
this
lady
,
about
whom
there
were
some
singular
stories
.
But
Winterbourne
had
an
old
attachment
for
the
little
metropolis
of
Calvinism
;
he
had
been
put
to
school
there
as
a
boy
,
and
he
had
afterward
gone
to
college
there
--
circumstances
which
had
led
to
his
forming
a
great
many
youthful
friendships
.
Many
of
these
he
had
kept
,
and
they
were
a
source
of
great
satisfaction
to
him
.
</p>
<p>
After
knocking
at
his
aunt
’s
door
and
learning
that
she
was
indisposed
,
he
had
taken
a
walk
about
the
town
,
and
then
he
had
come
in
to
his
breakfast
.
He
had
now
finished
his
breakfast
;
but
he
was
drinking
a
small
cup
of
coffee
,
which
had
been
served
to
him
on
a
little
table
in
the
garden
by
one
of
the
waiters
who
looked
like
an
attache
.
At
last
he
finished
his
coffee
and
lit
a
cigarette
.
Presently
a
small
boy
came
walking
along
the
path
--
an
urchin
of
nine
or
ten
.
The
child
,
who
was
diminutive
for
his
years
,
had
an
aged
expression
of
countenance
,
a
pale
complexion
,
and
sharp
little
features
.
He
was
dressed
in
knickerbockers
,
with
red
stockings
,
which
displayed
his
poor
little
spindle-shanks
;
he
also
wore
a
brilliant
red
cravat
.
He
carried
in
his
hand
a
long
alpenstock
,
the
sharp
point
of
which
he
thrust
into
everything
that
he
approached
--
the
flowerbeds
,
the
garden
benches
,
the
trains
of
the
ladies
’
dresses
.
In
front
of
Winterbourne
he
paused
,
looking
at
him
with
a
pair
of
bright
,
penetrating
little
eyes
.
</p>
<p>
“
Will
you
give
me
a
lump
of
sugar
?
”
he
asked
in
a
sharp
,
hard
little
voice
--
a
voice
immature
and
yet
,
somehow
,
not
young
.
</p>
<p>
Winterbourne
glanced
at
the
small
table
near
him
,
on
which
his
coffee
service
rested
,
and
saw
that
several
morsels
of
sugar
remained
.
“
Yes
,
you
may
take
one
,
”
he
answered
;
“
but
I
do
n’t
think
sugar
is
good
for
little
boys
.
”
</p>
<p>
This
little
boy
stepped
forward
and
carefully
selected
three
of
the
coveted
fragments
,
two
of
which
he
buried
in
the
pocket
of
his
knickerbockers
,
depositing
the
other
as
promptly
in
another
place
.
He
poked
his
alpenstock
,
lance-fashion
,
into
Winterbourne
’s
bench
and
tried
to
crack
the
lump
of
sugar
with
his
teeth
.
