What
could
cause
some
dynamics
is
that
you
need
money
for
all
these
packages
,
and
you
can
only
really
get
that
through
strong
reduction
targets
.
Be
it
Climate
charges
or
taxes
,
auctioning
of
emission
certificates
,
or
a
sort
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobin%20tax">
Tobin
tax
</ref>
on
international
emissions
trading
.
That
leads
to
those
nations
that
want
money
out
of
the
packages
having
an
incentive
to
work
for
stronger
reduction
targets
.
It
is
to
be
hoped
for
that
movement
for
strong
emission
targets
as
well
as
for
the
financing
of
technologies
,
forest
protection
and
adaptation
measures
develops
.
And
that
a
coalition
of
progressive
industrial
nations
,
least
developed
countries
(
the
so
called
LDCs
)
and
newly
industrialized
countries
-

such
a

The
four
packages
climate
protection
targets
,
adaptation
to
climate
change
,
accelerated
commercial
launching
of
the
necessary
technologies
and
financing
of
technology
,
forest
protection
and
adaptation
have
to
be
negotiated
in
detail
now
.
Next
year
there
will
be
four
rounds
of
negotiations
.
The
final
conclusion
is
to
be
reached
by
the
end
of
2009
,
at
the
climate
summit
in
Copenhagen

The
reduction
of
greenhouse
gas
emissions
,
so
that
a
warming
of
more
than
2°C
(
35.6
F
)
is
averted
,
is
central
.
The
global
average
temperatures
must
n't
rise
above
2°C
in
comparison
with
pre-industrial
levels
.
We
call
this
the
aversion
of
the
uncopeable
,
as
the
risks
of
such
a
warming
would
be
simply
too
great
.
</p>
<p>
To
achieve
this
goal
a
reduction
of
greenhouse
gas
emissions
by
50-85
%
by
2050
is
necessary
.
For
the
middle
term
this
means
that
the
peak
of
global
emissions
needs
to
be
reached
in
10-15
years
and
that
the
output
is
cut
considerably
year
after
year
from
then
onwards
.
The
group
of
industrialized
nations
have
to
reduce
their
emissions
by
25-40
%
till
2020
(
compared
to
1990
baselines
)
on
average
to
make
this
possible
.
</p>
<p>
Regarding
adaptation
,
what
we
call
coping
with
the
inadvertable
,
the
scale
of
funding
is
going
to
have
to
change
.
Roughly
US$
50
billion
a
year
are
going
to
be
required
.
</p>
<hi rend="bold">
We
should
n't
think
that
the
problem
is
just
in
the
U.S.
,
even
if
it
is
to
be
seen
most
clearly
there
.
Many
of
us
[
Germans/Europeans
]
do
n't
realize
what
the
necessary
emission
cuts
mean
.
