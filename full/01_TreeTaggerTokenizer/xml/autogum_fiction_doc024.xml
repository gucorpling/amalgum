Man
's
Reason
</head>
<p>
There
was
one
of
the
tribe
of
Tarzan
who
questioned
his
authority
,
and
that
was
Terkoz
,
the
son
of
Tublat
,
but
he
so
feared
the
keen
knife
and
the
deadly
arrows
of
his
new
lord
that
he
confined
the
manifestation
of
his
objections
to
petty
disobediences
and
irritating
mannerisms
;
Tarzan
knew
,
however
,
that
he
but
waited
his
opportunity
to
wrest
the
kingship
from
him
by
some
sudden
stroke
of
treachery
,
and
so
he
was
ever
on
his
guard
against
surprise
.
</p>
<p>
For
months
the
life
of
the
little
band
went
on
much
as
it
had
before
,
except
that
Tarzan
's
greater
intelligence
and
his
ability
as
a
hunter
were
the
means
of
providing
for
them
more
bountifully
than
ever
before
.
Most
of
them
,
therefore
,
were
more
than
content
with
the
change
in
rulers
.
</p>
<p>
Tarzan
led
them
by
night
to
the
fields
of
the
black
men
,
and
there
,
warned
by
their
chief
's
superior
wisdom
,
they
ate
only
what
they
required
,
nor
ever
did
they
destroy
what
they
could
not
eat
,
as
is
the
way
of
Manu
,
the
monkey
,
and
of
most
apes
.
</p>
<p>
So
,
while
the
blacks
were
wroth
at
the
continued
pilfering
of
their
fields
,
they
were
not
discouraged
in
their
efforts
to
cultivate
the
land
,
as
would
have
been
the
case
had
Tarzan
permitted
his
people
to
lay
waste
the
plantation
wantonly
.
</p>
<p>
During
this
period
Tarzan
paid
many
nocturnal
visits
to
the
village
,
where
he
often
renewed
his
supply
of
arrows
.
He
soon
noticed
the
food
always
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
which
was
his
avenue
into
the
palisade
,
and
after
a
little
,
he
commenced
to
eat
whatever
the
blacks
put
there
.
</p>
<p>
When
the
awe-struck
savages
saw
that
the
food
disappeared
overnight
they
were
filled
with
consternation
and
dread
,
for
it
was
one
thing
to
put
food
out
to
propitiate
a
god
or
a
devil
,
but
quite
another
thing
to
have
the
spirit
really
come
into
the
village
and
eat
it
.
Such
a
thing
was
unheard
of
,
and
it
clouded
their
superstitious
minds
with
all
manner
of
vague
fears
.
</p>
<p>
Nor
was
this
all
.
The
periodic
disappearance
of
their
arrows
,
and
the
strange
pranks
perpetrated
by
unseen
hands
,
had
wrought
them
to
such
a
state
that
life
had
become
a
veritable
burden
in
their
new
home
,
and
now
it
was
that
Mbonga
and
his
head
men
began
to
talk
of
abandoning
the
village
and
seeking
a
site
farther
on
in
the
jungle
.
</p>
<p>
Presently
the
black
warriors
began
to
strike
farther
and
farther
south
into
the
heart
of
the
forest
when
they
went
to
hunt
,
looking
for
a
site
for
a
new
village
.
</p>
<p>
More
often
was
the
tribe
of
Tarzan
disturbed
by
these
wandering
huntsmen
.
Now
was
the
quiet
,
fierce
solitude
of
the
primeval
forest
broken
by
new
,
strange
cries
.
No
longer
was
there
safety
for
bird
or
beast
.
Man
had
come
.
</p>
<p>
Other
animals
passed
up
and
down
the
jungle
by
day
and
by
night
--
fierce
,
cruel
beasts
--
but
their
weaker
neighbors
only
fled
from
their
immediate
vicinity
to
return
again
when
the
danger
was
past
.
</p>
<p>
With
man
it
is
different
.
When
he
comes
many
of
the
larger
animals
instinctively
leave
the
district
entirely
,
seldom
if
ever
to
return
;
and
thus
it
has
always
been
with
the
great
anthropoids
.
They
flee
man
as
man
flees
a
pestilence
.
</p>
<p>
For
a
short
time
the
tribe
of
Tarzan
lingered
in
the
vicinity
of
the
beach
because
their
new
chief
hated
the
thought
of
leaving
the
treasured
contents
of
the
little
cabin
forever
.
But
when
one
day
a
member
of
the
tribe
discovered
the
blacks
in
great
numbers
on
the
banks
of
a
little
stream
that
had
been
their
watering
place
for
generations
,
and
in
the
act
of
clearing
a
space
in
the
jungle
and
erecting
many
huts
,
the
apes
would
remain
no
longer
;
and
so
Tarzan
led
them
inland
for
many
marches
to
a
spot
as
yet
undefiled
by
the
foot
of
a
human
being
.
</p>
<p>
Once
every
moon
Tarzan
would
go
swinging
rapidly
back
through
the
swaying
branches
to
have
a
day
with
his
books
,
and
to
replenish
his
supply
of
arrows
.
This
latter
task
was
becoming
more
and
more
difficult
,
for
the
blacks
had
taken
to
hiding
their
supply
away
at
night
in
granaries
and
living
huts
.
</p>
<p>
This
necessitated
watching
by
day
on
Tarzan
's
part
to
discover
where
the
arrows
were
being
concealed
.
</p>
<p>
Twice
had
he
entered
huts
at
night
while
the
inmates
lay
sleeping
upon
their
mats
,
and
stolen
the
arrows
from
the
very
sides
of
the
warriors
.
But
this
method
he
realized
to
be
too
fraught
with
danger
,
and
so
he
commenced
picking
up
solitary
hunters
with
his
long
,
deadly
noose
,
stripping
them
of
weapons
and
ornaments
and
dropping
their
bodies
from
a
high
tree
into
the
village
street
during
the
still
watches
of
the
night
.
</p>
<p>
These
various
escapades
again
so
terrorized
the
blacks
that
,
had
it
not
been
for
the
monthly
respite
between
Tarzan
's
visits
,
in
which
they
had
opportunity
to
renew
hope
that
each
fresh
incursion
would
prove
the
last
,
they
soon
would
have
abandoned
their
new
village
.
</p>
<p>
The
blacks
had
not
as
yet
come
upon
Tarzan
's
cabin
on
the
distant
beach
,
but
the
ape-man
lived
in
constant
dread
that
,
while
he
was
away
with
the
tribe
,
they
would
discover
and
despoil
his
treasure
.
So
it
came
that
he
spent
more
and
more
time
in
the
vicinity
of
his
father
's
last
home
,
and
less
and
less
with
the
tribe
.
Presently
the
members
of
his
little
community
began
to
suffer
on
account
of
his
neglect
,
for
disputes
and
quarrels
constantly
arose
which
only
the
king
might
settle
peaceably
.
