Classify
Stars
</head>
<p>
Every
star
is
different
.
Some
are
big
,
some
small
,
some
hot
,
some
cold
.
They
can
be
blue
or
yellow
or
red
.
Stellar
classification
allows
you
to
describe
a
star
in
simple
terms
.

Determine
the
star
's
colour
.
Colour
serves
as
a
rough
guide
to
temperature
.
Currently
,
there
are
ten
colours
,
each
with
an
associated
temperature
range
.
O
class
stars
are
blue/UV
.
B
class
are
blue-white
,
A
class
white
,
F
yellow-white
,
G
yellow
,
K
orange
and
M
red
.
The
other
three
classes
are
infrared
.
L
class
appear
very
deep
red
in
visual
light
.
Their
spectra
show
alkali
metals
and
metal
hydrides
.
T
class
are
cooler
than
L
class
.
Their
spectra
show
methane
.
Y
class
are
the
coolest
of
all
,
and
apply
only
to
brown
dwarves
.
Their
spectra
are
different
to
T
and
L
class
,
but
there
is
no
definite
definition
.

Put
a
number
after
the
letter
to
show
precise
temperature
.
Within
each
colour
,
there
are
ten
temperature
bands
,
0-9
,
with
0
being
hottest
.
Thus
,
A0
is
hotter
than
A5
,
which
is
hotter
than
A9
,
which
is
hotter
than
F0
(
as
an
example
)

Determine
the
star
's
size
.
A
roman
numeral
,
indicating
the
star
's
size
,
is
added
after
the
temperature
designation
.
0
or
Ia+
indicates
a
hypergiant
star
.
Ia
,
Iab
and
Ib
represent
supergiants
(
bright
,
medium
,
dim
)
.
II
is
bright
giants
,
III
giants
,
IV
sub-giants
,
V
main
sequence
stars
(
the
part
of
a
stars
life
that
it
spends
the
most
time
going
through
)
and
VI
is
sub-dwarfs
.
A
prefix
of
D
indicates
a
white
dwarf
star
.
Examples
:
DA7
(
white
dwarf
)
,
F5Ia+
(
yellow
hypergiant
)
,
G2V
(
yellow
main-sequence
star
)
.
The
Sun
is
G2V
.

Use
a
prism
to
split
the
star
's
light
.
This
will
give
you
a
range
of
colours
,
called
a
spectrum
,
like
what
you
get
when
you
shine
a
torch
through
a
prism
.
The
spectrum
of
a
star
should
have
dark
lines
on
it
.
These
are
absorption
lines
.

Compare
the
star
's
spectrum
to
a
database
.
A
good
astronomical
database
should
give
a
typical
spectrum
for
each
star
type
.
This
is
why
the
type
is
,
sometimes
called
the
spectral
class
.

Determine
the
proportion
of
metals
(
elements
other
than
hydrogen
and
helium
)
in
a
star
.
Stars
with
greater
than
1
%
metals
are
termed
metal-rich
,
and
are
part
of
something
called
Population
I.
Stars
with
about
0.1
%
metals
are
termed
metal-poor
,
and
are
part
of
Population
II
.
Population
II
stars
formed
earlier
in
the
universe
,
when
less
metals
had
been
formed
.

Keep
your
eyes
open
for
stars
with
no
metals
.
These
stars
(
Population
III
)
are
expected
to
have
been
born
just
after
the
Big
Bang
,
when
the
only
elements
were
hydrogen
and
helium
,
and
metals
did
not
exist
.
As
of
yet
,
these
stars
are
only
theoretical
,
but
people
are
looking
very
hard
for
them
.

Determine
if
the
star
is
variable
.
Not
all
stars
are
,
but
some
are
,
and
can
be
very
useful
.

Determine
if
it
is
an
eclipsing
binary
.
Eclipsing
binaries
,
like
Algol
in
Perseus
,
are
two
stars
orbiting
each
other
.

Determine
the
amplitude
and
period
of
the
variation
.
Compare
these
to
the
characteristics
of
known
variable
types
to
determine
the
type
of
variable
star
.
For
example
,
Cepheid
variables
have
periods
of
days
to
months
and
amplitudes
of
up
to
2
magnitudes
,
whereas
Delta
Scuti
variables
have
periods
of
less
than
8
hours
,
and
amplitudes
of
less
than
0.9
magnitudes
.
