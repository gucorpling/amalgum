CHAPTER
XIII
</head>
<p>
For
three
days
I
did
my
own
work
and
Thomas
Mugridge
’s
too
;
and
I
flatter
myself
that
I
did
his
work
well
.
I
know
that
it
won
Wolf
Larsen
’s
approval
,
while
the
sailors
beamed
with
satisfaction
during
the
brief
time
my
<hi rend="italic">
régime
</hi>
lasted
.
</p>
<p>
“
The
first
clean
bite
since
I
come
aboard
,
”
Harrison
said
to
me
at
the
galley
door
,
as
he
returned
the
dinner
pots
and
pans
from
the
forecastle
.
“
Somehow
Tommy
’s
grub
always
tastes
of
grease
,
stale
grease
,
and
I
reckon
he
ai
n’t
changed
his
shirt
since
he
left
’
Frisco
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
know
he
has
n’t
,
”
I
answered
.
</p>
<p>
“
And
I
’ll
bet
he
sleeps
in
it
,
”
Harrison
added
.
</p>
<p>
“
And
you
wo
n’t
lose
,
”
I
agreed
.
“
The
same
shirt
,
and
he
has
n’t
had
it
off
once
in
all
this
time
.
”
</p>
<p>
But
three
days
was
all
Wolf
Larsen
allowed
him
in
which
to
recover
from
the
effects
of
the
beating
.
On
the
fourth
day
,
lame
and
sore
,
scarcely
able
to
see
,
so
closed
were
his
eyes
,
he
was
haled
from
his
bunk
by
the
nape
of
the
neck
and
set
to
his
duty
.
He
sniffled
and
wept
,
but
Wolf
Larsen
was
pitiless
.
</p>
<p>
“
And
see
that
you
serve
no
more
slops
,
”
was
his
parting
injunction
.
“
No
more
grease
and
dirt
,
mind
,
and
a
clean
shirt
occasionally
,
or
you
’ll
get
a
tow
over
the
side
.
Understand
?
”
</p>
<p>
Thomas
Mugridge
crawled
weakly
across
the
galley
floor
,
and
a
short
lurch
of
the
<hi rend="italic">
Ghost
</hi>
sent
him
staggering
.
In
attempting
to
recover
himself
,
he
reached
for
the
iron
railing
which
surrounded
the
stove
and
kept
the
pots
from
sliding
off
;
but
he
missed
the
railing
,
and
his
hand
,
with
his
weight
behind
it
,
landed
squarely
on
the
hot
surface
.
There
was
a
sizzle
and
odour
of
burning
flesh
,
and
a
sharp
cry
of
pain
.
</p>
<p>
“
Oh
,
Gawd
,
Gawd
,
wot
’
ave
I
done
?
”
he
wailed
;
sitting
down
in
the
coal-box
and
nursing
his
new
hurt
by
rocking
back
and
forth
.
“
W’y
’
as
all
this
come
on
me
?
It
mykes
me
fair
sick
,
it
does
,
an
’
I
try
so
’
ard
to
go
through
life
’
armless
an
’
’
urtin
’
nobody
.
”
</p>
<p>
The
tears
were
running
down
his
puffed
and
discoloured
cheeks
,
and
his
face
was
drawn
with
pain
.
A
savage
expression
flitted
across
it
.
</p>
<p>
“
Oh
,
’
ow
I
’
ate
’
im
!
’
Ow
I
’
ate
’
im
!
”
he
gritted
out
.
</p>
<p>
“
Whom
?
”
I
asked
;
but
the
poor
wretch
was
weeping
again
over
his
misfortunes
.
Less
difficult
it
was
to
guess
whom
he
hated
than
whom
he
did
not
hate
.
For
I
had
come
to
see
a
malignant
devil
in
him
which
impelled
him
to
hate
all
the
world
.
I
sometimes
thought
that
he
hated
even
himself
,
so
grotesquely
had
life
dealt
with
him
,
and
so
monstrously
.
At
such
moments
a
great
sympathy
welled
up
within
me
,
and
I
felt
shame
that
I
had
ever
joyed
in
his
discomfiture
or
pain
.
Life
had
been
unfair
to
him
.
It
had
played
him
a
scurvy
trick
when
it
fashioned
him
into
the
thing
he
was
,
and
it
had
played
him
scurvy
tricks
ever
since
.
What
chance
had
he
to
be
anything
else
than
he
was
?
And
as
though
answering
my
unspoken
thought
,
he
wailed
:
</p>
<p>
“
I
never
’
ad
no
chance
,
not
’
arf
a
chance
!
’
Oo
was
there
to
send
me
to
school
,
or
put
tommy
in
my
’
ungry
belly
,
or
wipe
my
bloody
nose
for
me
,
w’en
I
was
a
kiddy
?
’
Oo
ever
did
anything
for
me
,
heh
?
’
Oo
,
I
s’y
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Never
mind
,
Tommy
,
”
I
said
,
placing
a
soothing
hand
on
his
shoulder
.
“
Cheer
up
.
It
’ll
all
come
right
in
the
end
.
You
’ve
long
years
before
you
,
and
you
can
make
anything
you
please
of
yourself
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
It
’s
a
lie
!
a
bloody
lie
!
”
he
shouted
in
my
face
,
flinging
off
the
hand
.
“
It
’s
a
lie
,
and
you
know
it
.
I
’m
already
myde
,
an
’
myde
out
of
leavin
’s
an
’
scraps
.
It
’s
all
right
for
you
,
’
Ump
.
You
was
born
a
gentleman
.
You
never
knew
wot
it
was
to
go
’
ungry
,
to
cry
yerself
asleep
with
yer
little
belly
gnawin
’
an
’
gnawin
’
,
like
a
rat
inside
yer
.
It
car
n’t
come
right
.
If
I
was
President
of
the
United
Stytes
to-morrer
,
’
ow
would
it
fill
my
belly
for
one
time
w’en
I
was
a
kiddy
and
it
went
empty
?
</p>
<p>
“
’
Ow
could
it
,
I
s’y
?
I
was
born
to
sufferin
’
and
sorrer
.
I
’ve
had
more
cruel
sufferin
’
than
any
ten
men
,
I
’
ave
.
I
’ve
been
in
orspital
arf
my
bleedin
’
life
.
I
’ve
’
ad
the
fever
in
Aspinwall
,
in
’
Avana
,
in
New
Orleans
.
I
near
died
of
the
scurvy
and
was
rotten
with
it
six
months
in
Barbadoes
.
Smallpox
in
’
Onolulu
,
two
broken
legs
in
Shanghai
,
pnuemonia
in
Unalaska
,
three
busted
ribs
an

my
insides
all

An

.
Look

Look

My
ribs

.
I

me
on
for

”
</p>
<p>
This
tirade
against
destiny
went
on
for
an
hour
or
more
,
and
then
he
buckled
to
his
work
,
limping
and
groaning
,
and
in
his
eyes
a
great
hatred
for
all
created
things
.
His
diagnosis
was
correct
,
however
,
for
he
was
seized
with
occasional
sicknesses
,
during
which
he
vomited
blood
and
suffered
great
pain
.
And
as
he
said
,
it
seemed
God
hated
him
too
much
to
let
him
die
,
for
he
ultimately
grew
better
and
waxed
more
malignant
than
ever
.
