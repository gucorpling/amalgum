Life

<p>
Holley
grew
up
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi">
Jackson
,
Mississippi
</ref>
where
at
an
early
age
she
learned
to
play
the
auto-harp
,
ukulele
,
piano
,
and
guitar
;
though
it
was
playing
guitar
that
really
piqued
her
interest
.
She
has
said
,
&quot;
I
was
never
that
good
at
playing
piano
,
and
maybe
that
's
because
I
did
n't
practice
enough
,
but
I
found
the
guitar
fun
to
play
.
It
was
n't
a
chore
to
practice
.
