<p>
We
have
to
stop
listening
to
the
lies
of
our
politicians
and
governments
and
we
definitely
have
to
stop
letting
them
run
more
and
more
of
our
lives
.
We
have
to
start
analyzing
problems
to
find
out
what
's
really
causing
them
,
and
then
working
cooperatively
to
remove
the
causes
.

What
should
be
the
first
order
of
business
in
the
39th
Legislative
Assembly
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
The
top
priority
should
be
to
end
government
coercion
and
only
allow
force
to
be
used
to
defend
a
person
or
their
property
.
Those
who
use
threats
or
force
offensively
should
be
made
to
compensate
their
victim(s)
for
the
harm
done
to
them
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Are
the
property
taxes
in
your
riding
at
a
fair
level
for
the
amount
of
services
received
in
the
municipality
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
There
is
no
such
think
as
a
fair
tax
level
.
All
taxes
are
theft
.
</p>
<p>
If
a
government
agency
offers
a
service
they
should
charge
for
that
service
the
same
as
any
private
service
provider
would
.
In
addition
,
anyone
who
wished
to
offer
a
service
in
competition
with
the
government
agency
should
be
allowed
to
do
so
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
How
can
the
province
lead
the
way
in
stimulating
job
creation
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
To
stimulate
job
creation
,
the
provincial
government
should
get
out
of
the
way
and
allow
the
private
sector
to
create
jobs
without
government
interference
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
What
are
your
views
on
the
mixed
member
proportional
representation
(
MMP
)
referendum
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
I
'm
for
MMP
voting
as
it
decreases
the
chances
of
a
single
party
(
and
hence
a
few
individuals
)
from
having
free
reign
in
our
government
.
</p>
<p>
However
,
I
feel
MMP
should
be
implemented
with
far
fewer
seats
.
Increasing
the
number
of
seats
is
part
of
the
major
political
parties
'
plan
to
make
this
alternative
unpopular
.
If
they
oppose
it
so
strongly
,
it
's
obviously
a
very
good
idea
,
so
I
'm
all
for
it
.

What
role
,
if
any
,
does
“
new
media
”
play
in
your
campaign
,
and
the
campaign
of
your
party
?
(
websites
,
blogs
,
Facebook
,
YouTube
videos
,
etc
)
Do
you
view
it
as
beneficial
,
or
a
challenge
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
The
more
alternatives
available
the
better
.
Our
primary
objective
in
this
campaign
is
to
let
voters
know
that
:
there
is
an
alternative
to
ever
more
government
,
higher
taxes
and
more
regulations
controlling
their
lives
,
and
that
this
alternative
will
make
all
aspects
of
their
lives
better
as
it
will
bring
more
prosperity
,
less
crime
,
a
cleaner
environment
and
all
the
other
good
things
most
people
want
.

Of
the
decisions
made
by
Ontario
's
38th
Legislative
Assembly
,
which
was
the
most
beneficial
to
your
this
electoral
district
?
To
the
province
as
a
whole
?
Which
was
least
beneficial
,
or
even
harmful
,
to
your
this
riding
?
To
the
province
as
a
whole
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
No
government
decisions
are
beneficial
.
Most
are
a
costly
nuisance
.
The
rest
are
harmful
.
