The
background
</head>
<p>
With
the
arrival
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Bourbon">
Bourbons
</ref>
on
the
throne
of
Spain
in
1701
came
a
period
of
<hi rend="italic">
Indio
Mariano
</hi>
,
one
of
them
serious
,
led
by
different
men
.
The
first
of
these
took
place
in
Tepic
,
Nueva
Galicia
in
January
.
The
second
occurred
in
September
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuevo_León">

The
first
rebellion
</head>
<p>
Juan
Hilario
Rubio
,
an
important
man
of
Tepic
,
Alcalde
José
Desiderio
Maldonado
,
and
the
Indigenous
clerk
Juan
Francisco
Medina
were
the
leaders
of
the
first
Indio
Mariano
rebellion
.
These
men
circulated
a
proclamation
for
the
crowning
of
a
native
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tlaxcala">
Tlaxcala
</ref>
as
<hi rend="italic">
Rey
de
Indias
Mariano
Primero
</hi>
(
Mariano
I
,
king
of
the
Indies
)
.
This
was
scheduled
for
January
6
,
1801
.
Even
before
that
date
,
some
pueblos
were
in
open
rebellion
against
the
Spanish
.
</p>
<p>
The
coronation
,
however
,
was
frustrated
.
The
Spanish
officials
were
able
to
assemble
a
force
of
762
men
and
8
pieces
of
artillery
,
relying
largely
on
the
local
militia
and
the
fleet
in
the
harbor
at
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Blas,_Nayarit">
San
Blas
</ref>
.
For
the
place
and
time
,
this
was
an
overwhelming
force
.
</p>
<p>
The
three
leaders
and
many
other
persons
were
taken
prisoner
.
Many
prisoners
were
taken
in
two
&quot;
battles
&quot;
,
one
on
January
5
and
one
that
day
or
shortly
thereafter
.
The
Indigenous
offered
little
resistance
and
casualties
were
minimal
.
The
rebellion
seemed
to
be
over
by
January
8
,
but
the
following
week
a
second
wave
appeared
.
The
Spanish
forces
suffered
setbacks
.
Large
groups
of
armed
Indians
were
seen
in
many
places
,
converging
on
Tepic
.
The
Spanish
were
forced
to
withdraw
from
various
villages
.
They
too
converged
on
Tepic
.
</p>
<p>
Alarming
rumors
began
to
circulate
—
that
5,000
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaqui_people">
Yaquis
</ref>
were
approaching
;
that
6,000
to
7,000
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quechan">
Yumas
</ref>
were
coming
from
the
Colorado
River
.
The
rebellion
and
the
rumors
greatly
alarmed
viceregal
officials
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City">
Mexico
City
</ref>
,
particularly
since
the
mother
country
,
and
therefore
also
the
colony
,
was
at
war
with
Great
Britain
.
They
began
to
fear
the
possibility
of
a
general
Indian
uprising
,
perhaps
simultaneously
with
a
British
invasion
.
</p>
<p>
The
fears
were
relieved
the
following
week
.
Reports
came
in
contradicting
the
rumors
of
massive
movements
of
warriors
.
Other
reports
arrived
telling
of
Indians
returning
peacefully
to
their
villages
.
On
January
19
,
Captain
Leonardo
Pintado
dispersed
a
group
of
armed
rebels
,
taking
33
prisoners
.
The
emergency
came
to
an
end
.
The
Spanish
had
taken
approximately
300
prisoners
.
</p>
<p>
Most
of
those
arrested
were
sent
to
Guadalajara
.
However
,
some
died
in
jail
in
Tepic
of
an
unknown
disease
,
some
on
the
march
to
Guadalajara
,
and
some
after
arriving
in
Guadalajara
.
Some
of
the
Spanish
troops
also
suffered
from
the
disease
,
and
some
of
them
died
.
Juan
Hilario
Rubio
was
one
of
the
rebels
who
died
in
Guadalajara
.
He
was
condemned
postmortem
to
confiscation
of
his
property
,
demolition
of
his
house
,
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sowing_with_salt">
sowing
of
his
fields
with
salt
</ref>
.
The
two
other
leaders
were
condemned
to
six
years
of
public
labor
in
Veracruz
.
This
was
a
sentence
that
often
proved
fatal
.
Most
of
the
other
surviving
prisoners
were
released
.
</p>
<p>
Indio
Mariano
(
also
known
as
<hi rend="italic">
Máscara
de
Oro
</hi>
,
or
<hi rend="italic">
Golden
Mask
</hi>
)
was
never
crowned
.
He
was
apparently
a
young
Indian
itinerant
beggar
who
showed
up
in
Tepic
shortly
before
Christmas
1800
in
the
company
of
an
old
mulatto
and
a
child
.
He
claimed
to
be
the
son
of
a
deceased
governor
of
Tlaxcala
,
and
to
have
grown
up
in
luxury
.
It
may
not
have
been
true
that
Indio
Mariano
was
a
native
of
Tlaxcala
in
a
literal
sense
.
For
the
Indian
resistance
of
the
time
,
claiming
a
relationship
to
Tlaxcala
was
asserting
a
claim
to
the
special
rights
granted
the
Indigenous
of
that
place
by
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hernán_Cortés">
Hernán
Cortés
</ref>
at
the
time
of
the
Conquest
.
Indio
Mariano
was
never
found
.
However
,
rights
and
titles
claimed
in
connection
with
Tlaxcalla
persisted
up
until
the
time
of
the
first
Mexican
Empire
and
may
have
even
played
a
significant
role
in
motivating
some
natives
to
side
with
the
conservative
forces
during
the
French
Intervention
.
There
has
been
speculation
that
the
&quot;
Promise
of
Tlaxcalla
&quot;
may
have
played
a
part
in
the
Cristero
Rebellion
,
due
in
part
to
the
belief
that
the
catholic
rebels
were
awaiting
pontifical
approval
before
crowning
an
official
&quot;
Prince
of
Tlaxcalla
&quot;
as
heir
to
a
&quot;
Kingdom
of
the
Aztecs
&quot;
in
fulfillment
of
the
Tlaxcalla
Compact
.
One
has
to
believe
that
the
Tlaxcalla
Compact
may
have
given
rise
to
the
chicano
legend
of
the
return
of
the
Quetzalcuatl
to
unify
a
broken
Aztlan
.
Quetzalcuatl
is
the
chief
deity
of
the
allied
Aztec
tribes
who
unified
themselves
under
Tlaxcalla
and
the
Spanish
,
when
they
liberated
Cholula
from
Mexican
control
,
leading
up
to
the
conquest
of
Tenochtitlan
.

The
second
&quot;
rebellion
&quot;
</head>
<p>
On
September
1
,
1801
in
Nuevo
León
,
an
Indian
by
the
name
of
Juan
José
García
was
apprehended
stealing
cattle
.
He
told
the
authorities
he
was
Mariano
I
or
Alejandro
I.
These
were
names
of
kings
.
Mariano
asserted
that
his
royal
birth
and
ancestry
were
documented
by
papal
certificates
that
he
had
personally
obtained
in
Rome
.
His
case
was
transferred
to
the
royal
medical
tribunal
,
where
he
was
diagnosed
as
mentally
ill
with
melancholia
.
He
was
ordered
to
the
hospital
of
San
Hipólito
for
treatment
.
