Introduction

<p>
The
importance
of
electrical
vehicles
(
EV
)
has
been
hugely
increased
,
year
after
year
.
Certainly
,
their
role
is
critical
to
answering
the
problem
of
the
greenhouse
effect
.
Indeed
,
in
accordance
with
the
International
Energy
Agency
,
in
2018
the
global
stock
of
electric
passenger
cars
exceeded
5
million
,
which
has
increased
63
%
,
taking
into
consideration
the
previous
year
.
On
the
other
hand
,
several
governments
have
passed
legislation
in
order
to
encourage
the
transition
from
fuel
fossil
vehicles
to
EVs
.
In
this
context
,
the
technology
solutions
and
research
associated
with
these
vehicles
have
become
increasingly
important
.
One
of
the
fundamental
areas
of
the
EV
is
the
charging
of
the
EVs
batteries
.
</p>
<p>
There
are
several
aspects
that
should
be
considered
for
EV
chargers
connected
to
the
grid
.
It
should
be
considered
whether
they
will
be
used
for
slow
or
fast
charging
,
as
well
as
their
impact
on
the
grid
.
Regarding
this
last
issue
,
the
charger
must
be
designed
in
order
to
minimize
the
impact
on
the
grid
power
quality
.
In
this
way
,
it
should
be
designed
to
ensure
that
the
charger
is
a
load
with
high
power
factor
.
Many
high
power
factor
rectifiers
have
been
proposed
and
studied
.
Their
topologies
have
been
classified
as
Boost
,
Buck-Boost
,
and
Buck
,
in
accordance
with
their
capability
to
generate
an
output
voltage
that
is
higher
or
lower
than
the
maximum
input
voltage
.
</p>
<p>
Usually
,
EV
chargers
are
classified
as
off-board
or
on-board
.
The
off-board
chargers
are
normally
developed
for
high
power
DC
fast
charging
.
Several
rectifier
types
have
been
proposed
and
investigated
as
surveyed
in
.
The
on-board
chargers
are
for
reduced
powers
and
are
integrated
into
the
EVs
.
This
solution
gives
high
flexibility
to
the
drivers
since
it
usually
allows
the
EV
to
charge
through
an
electric
power
outlet
.
However
,
the
integration
of
the
charger
in
the
EV
will
increase
total
weight
,
volume
,
and
cost
.
Thus
,
to
minimize
this
drawback
,
the
chargers
should
be
designed
,
in
order
to
use
as
much
as
possible
,
the
same
available
hardware
used
for
the
traction
of
the
EV
.
To
implement
this
type
of
solution
,
it
must
be
considered
that
the
charging
and
propulsion
of
the
EV
do
not
occur
simultaneously
.
Indeed
,
the
vehicle
has
the
electric
motor
stopped
when
the
vehicle
is
connected
to
the
electric
grid
for
the
charging
process
.
So
,
when
the
EV
is
in
charging
mode
,
the
motor(s)
windings
will
be
used
as
filter
inductors
,
storage
elements
,
or
isolated
transformers
.
</p>
<p>
Several
configurations
have
been
proposed
for
the
integrated
battery
charger
of
EVs
.
These
proposals
have
also
taken
into
consideration
the
motor
type
.
For
the
case
of
the
three-phase
motors
,
solutions
using
a
Boost
rectifier
were
considered
,
being
the
motor
used
as
a
filter
inductor
.
These
solutions
require
having
access
to
the
motor
,
namely
to
the
terminals
of
the
motors
windings
,
or
neutral
point
of
the
windings
or
use
a
contactor
to
reconfigure
the
connection
of
the
motor
windings
.
An
EV
isolated
charger
for
a
lift
truck
was
also
proposed
in
.
Another
approach
was
through
the
use
of
current
rectifiers
with
Buck-Boost
characteristics
.
An
integrated
charger
with
this
type
of
converter
and
three-phase
connection
is
presented
in
.
Due
to
the
converter
type
,
in
charging
mode
,
the
motor
is
used
as
a
coupled
DC
inductor
.
Integrated
chargers
have
also
been
proposed
for
multiphase
motors
.
These
chargers
have
the
advantage
of
avoiding
the
problem
of
torque
generation
in
the
propulsion
motor
that
exists
in
systems
that
use
three-phase
motors
and
Boost
rectifiers
.
So
,
solutions
for
five
,
six
,
and
nine
machine
phases
have
been
proposed
.
However
,
for
many
EVs
,
the
dominant
motor
is
the
three-phase
and
chargers
for
multiphase
motors
cannot
be
applied
.
A
good
possibility
is
the
use
of
multilevel
inverters
for
the
drive
of
the
three-phase
AC
motor
.
Very
few
works
have
addressed
the
multilevel
configuration
for
the
EVs
.
A
charger
was
presented
for
an
EV
drive
with
two
,
two-level
voltage
source
inverters
(
dual
inverter
)
,
in
.
However
,
the
proposed
charger
was
developed
for
connection
to
DC
power
outlets
only
.
