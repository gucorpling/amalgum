Not
really
geared
up
for

The
Black
Cat
trail
.
</hi>
goes
from
Wau
to
Salamaua
on
the
north
coast
.
Some
of
the
bloodiest
battles
of
WW2
in
Papua
New
Guinea
were
fought
along
the
trail
between
the
Japanese
and
Allied
Forces
.
Trekking
this
trail
takes
four
to
five
days
,
involving
8-9
hours
walking
each
day
,
so
you
have
to
be
fit
.
Accommodation
is
in
local
villages
.
There
are
many
remnants
of
the
war
along
the
track
.
Live
munitions
,
plane
wrecks
,
and
huge
bomb
craters
can
be
seen
.
There
is
also
an
abundance
of
magnificent
flora
and
fauna
.
The
trip
ends
with
a
rafting
trip
down

The
Bulldog
Trail
.
</hi>
This
trail
is
only
now
being
commercially
developed
and
the
villagers
along
the
trail
have
had
little
exposure
to
trekkers
to
date
.
There
was
fierce
fighting
between
Lae
and
Wau
between
the
Japanese
and
the
Allies
and
Australian
troops
were
supplied
by
porters
carrying
food
and
munitions
to
Wau
from
Port
Moresby
along
the
Bulldog
Trail
.
This
trek
is
for
experts
only
