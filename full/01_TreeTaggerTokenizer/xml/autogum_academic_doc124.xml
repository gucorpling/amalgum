Methodology
</head>
<p>
The
main
purpose
of
this
study
is
to
describe
how
the
current
degrees
of
both
industrial
engineering
and
informatics
engineering
are
integrating
sustainability
competences
in
teaching
,
paying
special
attention
to
whether
it
is
done
holistically
and
systematically
throughout
the
curriculum
,
and
identifying
good
practices
and
reference
models
.
</p>
<p>
The
methodology
is
based
on
benchmarking
methods
,
used
in
the
competitive
analysis
of
companies
and
organizations
,
that
focus
on
best
practices
and
continuous
improvement
.
An
external
benchmarking
typology
has
been
chosen
,
comparing
the
behaviour
of
different
universities
that
offer
similar
degrees
.
This
approach
has
also
been
used
for
Sánchez
Carracedo
et
al.
—
with
a
lower
range
of
universities
—
but
it
is
different
from
other
studies
aimed
at
analyzing
the
performance
of
just
one
university
in
its
different
degrees
(
internal
benchmarking
)
.
Moreover
,
a
functional
approach
has
been
adopted
,
focusing
the
study
on
two
specific
aspects
that
have
been
considered
critical
:
the
holistic
vision
of
sustainability
competencies
and
its
systematic
inclusion
in
the
curricula
.
</p>
<p>
The
study
has
been
carried
out
exhaustively
in
the
universities
of
the
Community
of
Madrid
(
13
universities
,
6
public
and
7
private
)
.
To
complete
it
,
other
Spanish
universities
have
been
selected
that
could
contribute
to
the
objectives
of
the
study
:
technical
universities
,
as
specialists
and
referents
in
the
field
of
engineering
,
and
other
universities
attending
to
their
involvement
in
the
field
of
sustainability
(
such
as
their
participation
in
the
Higher
Education
Sustainability
Initiative
)
.
Finally
,
27
degrees
of
computer
engineering
(
hereafter
,
Informatics
)
and
28
degrees
of
industrial
engineering
(
hereafter
,
Industrial
)
have
been
analyzed
.

Data
Collection
</head>
<p>
For
the
collection
of
data
,
the
web
pages
on
each
of
the
selected
universities
and
degrees
have
been
reviewed
,
with
the
purpose
of
analyzing
the
presence
of
sustainability
competences
in
the
competences
and
objectives
that
define
the
degree
,
and
especially
the
presence
in
the
courses
of
the
curriculum
.
To
analyze
the
presence
in
each
course
,
the
information
has
been
obtained
from
the
mentioned
<hi rend="italic">
Learning
Guides
</hi>
.
</p>
<p>
A
first
pilot
study
was
carried
out
,
in
which
data
from
three
universities
were
collected
,
and
the
possibility
of
extending
the
study
to
some
foreign
universities
was
studied
,
an
option
that
was
rejected
due
to
the
lack
of
homogeneity
in
the
sources
of
information
.
From
this
pilot
study
,
a
small
number
of
<hi rend="italic">
key
dimensions
</hi>
were
determined
,
attending
their
significance
for
the
goal
of
the
study
and
the
facility
to
be
clearly
identified
in
the
sources
of
information
.
They
were
the
following
:
<list>
<item>
Ethics
and
professional
responsibility
</item>
<item>
Environmental
</item>
<item>
Social
</item>
<item>
Legal
and
regulatory
</item>
</list>
</p>
<p>
In
this
election
,
some
competences
relevant
to
ESD
—
critical
reasoning
,
systemic
thinking
,
multidisciplinary
work
or
the
economic
dimension
—
have
been
ruled
out
.
Every
engineering
degree
in
Spain
includes
mandatory
courses
on
Economy
,
but
the
contents
are
not
so
much
related
to
the
inclusive
economy
,
poverty
,
inequality
,
or
employment
,
which
would
be
the
most
significant
topics
for
ESD
;
when
they
appear
,
they
have
been
considered
as
social
issues
.
The
presence
of
critical
reasoning
skills
is
fundamentally
related
to
technical
aspects
.
The
difficulty
of
distinguishing
these
nuances
from
the
information
provided
by
the
<hi rend="italic">
Learning
Guides
</hi>
has
been
the
reason
for
not
considering
these
competences
as
<hi rend="italic">
key
dimensions
.
</hi>
However
,
when
they
appear
,
they
have
been
collected
as
relevant
qualitative
aspects
.
</p>
<p>
As
an
example
,
Table
4
reflects
the
identifications
made
from
the
competences
recommended
in
the
official
guidelines
.
</p>
<p>
Specifically
,
information
has
been
collected
on
:
<list>
<item>
Which
<hi rend="italic">
key
dimensions
</hi>
are
included
in
the
degrees
competences
.
</item>
<item>
Which
<hi rend="italic">

</hi>
are
included
in

competences

</item>
<item>
Which
<hi rend="italic">
key

</hi>
,
and
how
many
,
are
included
in
the
syllabus
of
the
courses
.
</item>
<item>
Methodological
aspects
that
are
considered
of

</item>
</list>
</p>
<p>
A
thorough
revision
of
the
<hi rend="italic">
Learning
Guides
</hi>
was
carried
out
to
collect
all
this
information
,
using
some
keywords
for
each
<hi rend="italic">
key
dimension
,
</hi>
but
also
taking
advantage
of
the
researchers
’
knowledge
of
the
subjects
for
identifying
their
presence
into
the
syllabuses
and
selecting
inspiring
practices
.
