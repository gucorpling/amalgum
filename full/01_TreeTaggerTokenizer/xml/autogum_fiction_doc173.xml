I
GO
IN
QUEST
OF
MY
INHERITANCE
</head>
<p>
I
made
what
change
I
could
in
my
appearance
;
and
blithe
was
I
to
look
in
the
glass
and
find
the
beggarman
a
thing
of
the
past
,
and
David
Balfour
come
to
life
again
.
And
yet
I
was
ashamed
of
the
change
too
,
and
,
above
all
,
of
the
borrowed
clothes
.
When
I
had
done
,
Mr.
Rankeillor
caught
me
on
the
stair
,
made
me
his
compliments
,
and
had
me
again
into
the
cabinet
.
</p>
<p>
“
Sit
ye
down
,
Mr.
David
,
”
said
he
,
“
and
now
that
you
are
looking
a
little
more
like
yourself
,
let
me
see
if
I
can
find
you
any
news
.
You
will
be
wondering
,
no
doubt
,
about
your
father
and
your
uncle
?
To
be
sure
it
is
a
singular
tale
;
and
the
explanation
is
one
that
I
blush
to
have
to
offer
you
.
For
,
”
says
he
,
really
with
embarrassment
,
“
the
matter
hinges
on
a
love
affair
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Truly
,
”
said
I
,
“
I
cannot
very
well
join
that
notion
with
my
uncle
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
But
your
uncle
,
Mr.
David
,
was
not
always
old
,
”
replied
the
lawyer
,
“
and
what
may
perhaps
surprise
you
more
,
not
always
ugly
.
He
had
a
fine
,
gallant
air
;
people
stood
in
their
doors
to
look
after
him
,
as
he
went
by
upon
a
mettle
horse
.
I
have
seen
it
with
these
eyes
,
and
I
ingenuously
confess
,
not
altogether
without
envy
;
for
I
was
a
plain
lad
myself
and
a
plain
man
’s
son
;
and
in
those
days
it
was
a
case
of
Odi
te
,
qui
bellus
es
,
Sabelle
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
It
sounds
like
a
dream
,
”
said
I.
</p>
<p>
“
Ay
,
ay
,
”
said
the
lawyer
,
“
that
is
how
it
is
with
youth
and
age
.
Nor
was
that
all
,
but
he
had
a
spirit
of
his
own
that
seemed
to
promise
great
things
in
the
future
.
In
1715
,
what
must
he
do
but
run
away
to
join
the
rebels
?
It
was
your
father
that
pursued
him
,
found
him
in
a
ditch
,
and
brought
him
back
multum
gementem
;
to
the
mirth
of
the
whole
country
.
However
,
majora
canamus
--
the
two
lads
fell
in
love
,
and
that
with
the
same
lady
.
Mr.
Ebenezer
,
who
was
the
admired
and
the
beloved
,
and
the
spoiled
one
,
made
,
no
doubt
,
mighty
certain
of
the
victory
;
and
when
he
found
he
had
deceived
himself
,
screamed
like
a
peacock
.
The
whole
country
heard
of
it
;
now
he
lay
sick
at
home
,
with
his
silly
family
standing
round
the
bed
in
tears
;
now
he
rode
from
public-house
to
public-house
,
and
shouted
his
sorrows
into
the
lug
of
Tom
,
Dick
,
and
Harry
.
Your
father
,
Mr.
David
,
was
a
kind
gentleman
;
but
he
was
weak
,
dolefully
weak
;
took
all
this
folly
with
a
long
countenance
;
and
one
day
--
by
your
leave
!
--
resigned
the
lady
.
She
was
no
such
fool
,
however
;
it
’s
from
her
you
must
inherit
your
excellent
good
sense
;
and
she
refused
to
be
bandied
from
one
to
another
.
Both
got
upon
their
knees
to
her
;
and
the
upshot
of
the
matter
for
that
while
was
that
she
showed
both
of
them
the
door
.
That
was
in
August
;
dear
me
!
the
same
year
I
came
from
college
.
The
scene
must
have
been
highly
farcical
.
”
</p>
<p>
I
thought
myself
it
was
a
silly
business
,
but
I
could
not
forget
my
father
had
a
hand
in
it
.
“
Surely
,
sir
,
it
had
some
note
of
tragedy
,
”
said
I.
</p>
<p>
“
Why
,
no
,
sir
,
not
at
all
,
”
returned
the
lawyer
.
“
For
tragedy
implies
some
ponderable
matter
in
dispute
,
some
dignus
vindice
nodus
;
and
this
piece
of
work
was
all
about
the
petulance
of
a
young
ass
that
had
been
spoiled
,
and
wanted
nothing
so
much
as
to
be
tied
up
and
soundly
belted
.
However
,
that
was
not
your
father
’s
view
;
and
the
end
of
it
was
,
that
from
concession
to
concession
on
your
father
’s
part
,
and
from
one
height
to
another
of
squalling
,
sentimental
selfishness
upon
your
uncle
’s
,
they
came
at
last
to
drive
a
sort
of
bargain
,
from
whose
ill
results
you
have
recently
been
smarting
.
The
one
man
took
the
lady
,
the
other
the
estate
.
Now
,
Mr.
David
,
they
talk
a
great
deal
of
charity
and
generosity
;
but
in
this
disputable
state
of
life
,
I
often
think
the
happiest
consequences
seem
to
flow
when
a
gentleman
consults
his
lawyer
,
and
takes
all
the
law
allows
him
.
Anyhow
,
this
piece
of
Quixotry
on
your
father
’s
part
,
as
it
was
unjust
in
itself
,
has
brought
forth
a
monstrous
family
of
injustices
.
Your
father
and
mother
lived
and
died
poor
folk
;
you
were
poorly
reared
;
and
in
the
meanwhile
,
what
a
time
it
has
been
for
the
tenants
on
the
estate
of
Shaws
!
And
I
might
add
(
if
it
was
a
matter
I
cared
much
about
)
what
a
time
for
Mr.
Ebenezer
!
”
</p>
<p>
“
And
yet
that
is
certainly
the
strangest
part
of
all
,
”
said
I
,
“
that
a
man
’s
nature
should
thus
change
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
True
,
”
said
Mr.
Rankeillor
.
“
And
yet
I
imagine
it
was
natural
enough
.
He
could
not
think
that
he
had
played
a
handsome
part
.
Those
who
knew
the
story
gave
him
the
cold
shoulder
;
those
who
knew
it
not
,
seeing
one
brother
disappear
,
and
the
other
succeed
in
the
estate
,
raised
a
cry
of
murder
;
so
that
upon
all
sides
he
found
himself
evited
.
Money
was
all
he
got
by
his
bargain
;
well
,
he
came
to
think
the
more
of
money
.
He
was
selfish
when
he
was
young
,
he
is
selfish
now
that
he
is
old
;
and
the
latter
end
of
all
these
pretty
manners
and
fine
feelings
you
have
seen
for
yourself
.
