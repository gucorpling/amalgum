<p>
Video
communication
services
are
the
most
trending
features
over
the
Internet
where
with
a
web-cam
,
microphone
and
Internet
access
,
Video
calls
to
family
and
friends
around
the
world
are
just
one
click
away
.
As
with
any
type
of
communication
over
the
network
,
we
are
going
to
share
a
lot
of
private
and
Personal
Information
,
and
here
,
the
most
important
point
,
&quot;
Privacy
&quot;
.
In
this
article
we
are
going
to
list
some
of
the
steps
and
tasks
we
can
do
with
our
computers
in
the
home-care
to
set
a
safer
environment
for
our
video
calls

Ensure
computer
safety
.
Firewall
,
to
protect
your
computer
from
different
types
of
Intrusion
attacks
(
computer
hackers
)
,
system
security
preferences
need
to
be
established
.
One
of
them
is
the
Firewall
.
In
order
to
get
all
the
benefits
,
the
firewall
needs
to
be
activated
and
check
the
list
of
programs
which
are
allowed
to
connect
to
the
internet
.
The
rest
of
the
programs
wo
n't
be
able
to
use
the
network
.
<list type="unordered">

Sometimes
,
there
are
requests
from
running
programs
to
allow
them
to
use
the
network
,
Be
careful
and
allow
only
programs
you
know
.

Install
anti-spyware
software
before
installing
the
video
call
software
or
even
before
continuing
on
to
using
the
Internet
,
make
sure
that
your
system
is
protected
by
an
anti-virus
which
can
stop
the
malware
,
spywares
and
viruses
,
and
gives
some
Internet
protection
to
keep
your
computer
safe
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Note
that
so
called
&quot;
good
antiviruses
&quot;
usually
need
a
paid
subscription
,
However
,
there
are
several
free
anti
virus
programs
which
are
as
good
if
not
better
than
some
paid
versions
.
A
search
for
Free
Antivirus
Programs
will
help
you
immensely
.
Start
with
free
anti-virus
,
If
the
system
is
not
protected
yet
,
</item>
<item>
Activate
the
system
default
program
(
Windows
Defender
on
Microsoft
systems
and
Mac
Defender
on
Apple
systems
)
until
downloading
and
installing
a
better
anti-virus
.

Use
video
calling
software
.
Choose
the
software
you
are
comfortable
with
,
and
do
n't
forget
that
privacy
is
the
most
important
thing
in
all
these
steps
.
The
Software
developer
's
reputation
is
important
to
determine
if
your
call
data
is
well
protected
or
not
,
where
these
developers
provide
more
security
to
their
servers
,
the
more
potentially
secure
they
are
,
these
servers
are
used
to
save
data
about
their
clients
'
accounts
and
their
software
users
,
usually
,
the
video
streaming
will
go
through
their
server
also
.
</item>
<item>
Download
the
software
.
After
choosing
the
software
,
search
its
main
website
for
the
download
link
.
Use
the
software
company
's
product
website
to
get
the
latest
versions
,
Most
applications
will
update
themselves
once
installed
.
</item>
<item>
Click
on
&quot;
Install
Manually
&quot;
if
the
option
is
available
,
here
you
will
see
if
any
&quot;
Bundled
Software
&quot;
is
included
,
be
sure
to
uncheck
ALL
,
these
are
usually
not
required
for
the
application
to
perform
normally
and
you
do
n't
get
anything
you
did
n't
ask
for
!
,
Create
an
account
.
search
for
contacts
you
want
to
add
to
your
contact
list
and
wait
for
their
response
.
BEWARE
!
if
you
do
not
personally
know
the
person
you
are
adding
to
your
contact
list
,
he/she
could
be
dangerous
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Never
ever
trust
an
unknown
,
they
are
only
words
on
a
screen
and
you
have
<hi rend="bold">
no
idea
</hi>
who
or
what
is
behind
there
!
!
NEVER
initiate
a
video
call
with
an
unknown
person
,
no
matter
what
they
say
or
how
persuasive
they
are
!
So
much
information
is
seen
in
the
background
of
the
video
by
stalkers
and
generally
bad
people
.

Develop
communication
environment

Before
your
friend
can
see
you
,
position
the
camera
to
hide
or
show
what
you
want
in
the
house
if
you
care
about
background
details
,
Keep
the
room
nicely
lit
so
that
the
camera
image
is
clear
,
after
setting
the
video
call
environment
,
you
will
be
able
to
enjoy
your
video
calls
,
whether
Family
or
Professional
.

security
,
do
n't
talk

,
always
to

those

that
person

class
mates

The
Internet
is
NOT
safe
in
any
respect
,
a
Firewall
and
all
the
antivirus
in
the
world
will
only
slow
but
not
stop
some-one
who
is
determined
,
so
do
n't
give
them
any
reason
to
try
to
&quot;
Hack
&quot;
you

Social
App
Allow
Access
.
We
are
surrounded
by
an
infinite
number
of
social
apps
,
we
need
to
be
very
careful
dealing
with
them
,
where
each
time
for
some
and
mostly
not
important
reasons
,
you
get
a
request
from
a
social
app
that
wants
access
to
your
profile
and
friends
Info
,
and
here
you
need
to
be
AWAKE
.
</item>
<item>
Every
click
on
the
Allow
button
means
you
are
sharing
your
private
Info
to
some-one
you
do
n't
know
nor
what
they
do
with
your
Info
.
We
need
to
use
only
necessary
applications
and
only
from
reputable
Software
Companies
.
,
this
will
keep
you
safer
and
help
keep
your
privacy
where
it
belongs
,
PRIVATE
