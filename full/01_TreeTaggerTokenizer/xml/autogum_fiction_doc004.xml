CHAPTER
9
.
Our
Relations
and
Theirs
</head>
<p>
What
I
’m
trying
to
show
here
is
that
with
these
women
the
whole
relationship
of
life
counted
in
a
glad
,
eager
growing-up
to
join
the
ranks
of
workers
in
the
line
best
loved
;
a
deep
,
tender
reverence
for
one
’s
own
mother
--
too
deep
for
them
to
speak
of
freely
--
and
beyond
that
,
the
whole
,
free
,
wide
range
of
sisterhood
,
the
splendid
service
of
the
country
,
and
friendships
.
</p>
<p>
To
these
women
we
came
,
filled
with
the
ideas
,
convictions
,
traditions
,
of
our
culture
,
and
undertook
to
rouse
in
them
the
emotions
which
--
to
us
--
seemed
proper
.
</p>
<p>
However
much
,
or
little
,
of
true
sex-feeling
there
was
between
us
,
it
phrased
itself
in
their
minds
in
terms
of
friendship
,
the
one
purely
personal
love
they
knew
,
and
of
ultimate
parentage
.
Visibly
we
were
not
mothers
,
nor
children
,
nor
compatriots
;
so
,
if
they
loved
us
,
we
must
be
friends
.
</p>
<p>
That
we
should
pair
off
together
in
our
courting
days
was
natural
to
them
;
that
we
three
should
remain
much
together
,
as
they
did
themselves
,
was
also
natural
.
We
had
as
yet
no
work
,
so
we
hung
about
them
in
their
forest
tasks
;
that
was
natural
,
too
.
</p>
<p>
But
when
we
began
to
talk
about
each
couple
having
“
homes
”
of
our
own
,
they
could
not
understand
it
.
</p>
<p>
“
Our
work
takes
us
all
around
the
country
,
”
explained
Celis
.
“
We
cannot
live
in
one
place
all
the
time
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
We
are
together
now
,
”
urged
Alima
,
looking
proudly
at
Terry
’s
stalwart
nearness
.
(
This
was
one
of
the
times
when
they
were
“
on
,
”
though
presently
“
off
”
again
.
)
</p>
<p>
“
It
’s
not
the
same
thing
at
all
,
”
he
insisted
.
“
A
man
wants
a
home
of
his
own
,
with
his
wife
and
family
in
it
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Staying
in
it
?
All
the
time
?
”
asked
Ellador
.
“
Not
imprisoned
,
surely
!
”
</p>
<p>
“
Of
course
not
!
Living
there
--
naturally
,
”
he
answered
.
</p>
<p>
“
What
does
she
do
there
--
all
the
time
?
”
Alima
demanded
.
“
What
is
her
work
?
”
</p>
<p>
Then
Terry
patiently
explained
again
that
our
women
did
not
work
--
with
reservations
.
</p>
<p>
“
But
what
do
they
do
--
if
they
have
no
work
?
”
she
persisted
.
</p>
<p>
“
They
take
care
of
the
home
--
and
the
children
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
At
the
same
time
?
”
asked
Ellador
.
</p>
<p>
“
Why
yes
.
The
children
play
about
,
and
the
mother
has
charge
of
it
all
.
There
are
servants
,
of
course
.
”
</p>
<p>
It
seemed
so
obvious
,
so
natural
to
Terry
,
that
he
always
grew
impatient
;
but
the
girls
were
honestly
anxious
to
understand
.
</p>
<p>
“
How
many
children
do
your
women
have
?
”
Alima
had
her
notebook
out
now
,
and
a
rather
firm
set
of
lip
.
Terry
began
to
dodge
.
</p>
<p>
“
There
is
no
set
number
,
my
dear
,
”
he
explained
.
“
Some
have
more
,
some
have
less
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Some
have
none
at
all
,
”
I
put
in
mischievously
.
</p>
<p>
They
pounced
on
this
admission
and
soon
wrung
from
us
the
general
fact
that
those
women
who
had
the
most
children
had
the
least
servants
,
and
those
who
had
the
most
servants
had
the
least
children
.
</p>
<p>
“
There
!
”
triumphed
Alima
.
“
One
or
two
or
no
children
,
and
three
or
four
servants
.
Now
what
do
those
women
DO
?
”
</p>
<p>
We
explained
as
best
we
might
.
We
talked
of
“
social
duties
,
”
disingenuously
banking
on
their
not
interpreting
the
words
as
we
did
;
we
talked
of
hospitality
,
entertainment
,
and
various
“
interests
.
”
All
the
time
we
knew
that
to
these
large-minded
women
whose
whole
mental
outlook
was
so
collective
,
the
limitations
of
a
wholly
personal
life
were
inconceivable
.
</p>
<p>
“
We
cannot
really
understand
it
,
”
Ellador
concluded
.
“
We
are
only
half
a
people
.
We
have
our
woman-ways
and
they
have
their
man-ways
and
their
both-ways
.
We
have
worked
out
a
system
of
living
which
is
,
of
course
,
limited
.
They
must
have
a
broader
,
richer
,
better
one
.
I
should
like
to
see
it
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
You
shall
,
dearest
,
”
I
whispered
.
</p>
<p>
“
There
’s
nothing
to
smoke
,
”
complained
Terry
.
He
was
in
the
midst
of
a
prolonged
quarrel
with
Alima
,
and
needed
a
sedative
.
“
There
’s
nothing
to
drink
.
These
blessed
women
have
no
pleasant
vices
.
I
wish
we
could
get
out
of
here
!
”
</p>
<p>
This
wish
was
vain
.
We
were
always
under
a
certain
degree
of
watchfulness
.
When
Terry
burst
forth
to
tramp
the
streets
at
night
he
always
found
a
“
Colonel
”
here
or
there
;
and
when
,
on
an
occasion
of
fierce
though
temporary
despair
,
he
had
plunged
to
the
cliff
edge
with
some
vague
view
to
escape
,
he
found
several
of
them
close
by
.
We
were
free
--
but
there
was
a
string
to
it
.
</p>
<p>
“
They
’ve
no
unpleasant
ones
,
either
,
”
Jeff
reminded
him
.
</p>
<p>
“
Wish
they
had
!
”
Terry
persisted
.
“
They
’ve
neither
the
vices
of
men
,
nor
the
virtues
of
women
--
they
’re
neuters
!
”
</p>
<p>
“
You
know
better
than
that
.
Do
n’t
talk
nonsense
,
”
said
I
,
severely
.
</p>
<p>
I
was
thinking
of
Ellador
’s
eyes
when
they
gave
me
a
certain
look
,
a
look
she
did
not
at
all
realize
.
</p>
<p>
Jeff
was
equally
incensed
.
“
I
do
n’t
know
what
‘
virtues
of
women
’
you
miss
.
Seems
to
me
they
have
all
of
them
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
They
’ve
no
modesty
,
”
snapped
Terry
.
“
No
patience
,
no
submissiveness
,
none
of
that
natural
yielding
which
is
woman
’s
greatest
charm
.
”
</p>
<p>
I
shook
my
head
pityingly
.
“
Go
and
apologize
and
make
friends
again
,
Terry
.
You
’ve
got
a
grouch
,
that
’s
all
.
These
women
have
the
virtue
of
humanity
,
with
less
of
its
faults
than
any
folks
I
ever
saw
.
As
for
patience
--
they
’d
have
pitched
us
over
the
cliffs
the
first
day
we
lit
among
‘
em
,
if
they
had
n’t
that
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
There
are
no
--
distractions
,
”
he
grumbled
.
“
Nowhere
a
man
can
go
and
cut
loose
a
bit
.
It
’s
an
everlasting
parlor
and
nursery
.
”
