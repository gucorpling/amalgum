on

,
the
inner
eastern
area

working-class
district
,
filled
with
pubs

called
<hi rend="italic">

is
<hi rend="bold">

,
a
suburb
that
is
not
held
to
such
a
high
esteem
as
the
surrounding
neighbourhoods
,
but
still
has
its
fair
share
of
character-filled
pubs
and
heritage-listed
industrial
buildings

sits
on
