Find
a
clean
surface
.
Make
sure
to
work
in
an
environment
that
is
clean
and
spacious
so
that
nothing
gets
dirty
and
messy
.
</item>
<item>
Prepare
the
batter
.
Get
a
blender
and
place
the
1/3
cups
of
flour
,
1
cup
of
semolina
,
1/2
teaspoon
of
ground
mahlab
,
1/2
teaspoon
of
yeast
,
1/3
cup
of
sugar
,
1/3
cup
of
pancake
mix
,
and
1
cup
of
water
(
may
require
1/2
a
cup
more
until
the
batter
becomes
smooth
)
into
it
.
Blend
the
batter
until
it
gets
smooth
.
</item>
<item>
Heat
frying
pan
.
pour
the
mix
i
a
large
bowl
and
allow
the
it
to
rest
for
10-15
minutes
while
the
pan
heats
up
.
Make
sure
it
is
on
medium
to
low
heat
and
that
the
batter
is
covered
.
<figure rend="Ingredientsinblender.jpg">

</item>
<item>
Pour
the
mix
.
Once
to
batter
has
rested
,
use
a
ladle
and
pour
about
1/4
cup
onto
the
frying
pan
.
Notice
that
the
kataif
will
start
to
bubble
around
the
edges
and
soon
will
start
to
cover
the
entire
surface
.
If
it
is
not
covered
with
bubbles
,
then
that
means
that
the
batter
is
too
thick
.
if
that
is
the
case
add
small
quantities
of
water
,
whisk
and
try
again
.
<figure rend="Ingredientsinbowl.jpg">

Remove
the
kataif
.
When
it
is
no
longer
shiny
and
liquidy
,
then
they
are
ready
to
be
removed
from
the
pan
.

NOTE
:
cooking
them
over
high
heat
will
cause
them
to
get
burnt
quickly
and
will
dry
them
out
.
That
will
cause
them
to
split
when
they
are
filled
or
will
reopen
.
you
want
to
color
to
be
a
golden
brown
so
check
with
the
first
one
,
if
its
too
dark
,
lower
the
heat
and
try
again
.
if
it
is
too
light
,
brig
the
heat
up
a
little
.

Cover
them
with
a
towel
.
Take
the
kataif
off
the
heat
and
immediately
cover
them
with
a
kitchen
towel
or
a
light
blanket
.
THIS
IS
VERY
IMPORTANT
!
Covering
them
allows
the
kataif
to
remain
soft
and
easy
to
stuff
and
seal
without
worrying
about
it
splitting
.

will
be
that
it
will
no
longer
seal
and
it
will
begin
to
split
