Zigbee
is
a
low-cost
wireless
communication
technology
based
on
the
IEEE
802.15.4
standard
,
which
is
often
used
to
create
personal
area
networks
.
Due
to
its
low
power
consumption
and
secure
networking
capabilities
,
it
is
often
preferable
for
wireless
control
and
monitoring
in
smart-building
technologies
.
</p>
<p>
In
this
study
,
we
use
XBee
embedded
modules
with
the
Zigbee
protocol
to
create
four
transmitters
that
are
placed
at
preassigned
positions
,
and
one
receiver
which
is
the
target
node
to
be
localized
.
In
order
to
introduce
mobility
to
the
target
node
and
to
verify
the
proposed
indoor
localization
strategies
,
NSBot2
,
which
is
a
nonholonomic
wheeled
mobile
robot
was
built
with
ATMega
microcontrollers
connected
to
the
target
node
as
shown
in
<figure>
Figure
1
</figure>
.
</p>
<p>
With
regard
to
control
mechanism
,
NSbot2
was
preprogrammed
with
closed-loop
cascade
control
where
its
motion
was
constrained
to
constant
translational
and
rotational
velocities
.
This
technique
does
not
just
allow
the
robot
to
travel
along
various
types
of
planned
path
,
but
it
also
enables
each
experiment
with
a
specific
path
to
be
repeated
with
minimal
variations
.
</p>
<p>
The
basic
idea
for
indoor
localization
with
RSSI
is
that
the
target
node
to
be
localized
stays
at
a
fixed
coordinate
,
and
the
RSSI
from
different
anchor
nodes
with
known
positions
are
measured
.
RSSI
values
can
be
converted
into
distances
using
a
path-loss
model
,
which
are
then
used
with
the
triangulation
,
multilateration
,
or
trilateration
method
to
estimate
the
position
of
the
target
node
.
</p>
<p>
One
of
the
most
commonly
used
path-loss
propagation
models
in
a
WSN
is
the
log-distance
function
.
Via
this
model
,
the
value
of
RSSI
,
(
in
dBm
)
can
be
theoretically
expressed
as
follows
:
(
1
)
where
<hi rend="italic">
d
</hi>
(
in
m
)
is
the
distance
between
transmitter
(
anchor
node
)
and
receiver
(
target
node
)
,
is
the
free
space
reference
distance
,
typically
1
m
,
is
the
path-loss
exponent
coefficient
,
and
is
the
RSSI
value
when
the
transmitter
and
the
receiver
are
1
m
apart
,
which
in
this
case
is
found
to
be
dBm
.
The
theoretical
value
for
with
some
calibrations
is
1.8
.
From
Equation
(
1
)
,
the
distance
<hi rend="italic">
d
</hi>
can
be
simply
retrieved
with
:
(

)
</p>
<p>
In
real
situations
,
when
the
target
node
is
continuously
moving
,
the
effects
of
noise
from
multipath
propagation
,
signal
occlusions
,
and
diffractions
can
be
undesirably
amplified
.
Hence
,
the
theoretical
RSSI-distance
relation
in
Equation
(
1
)
may
no
longer
be
sufficient
to
predict
the
actual
path-loss
model
.
In
order
to
estimate
the
real
distance
for
a
continuously
moving
node
more
accurately
,
sampled
data
for
are
collected
when
the
transmitter
is
placed
at
a
fixed
coordinate
,
and
the
receiver
,
named
Node
M
,
is
moved
at
a
speed
of
approximately
20
cm/s
from
cm
until
cm
.
This
is
illustrated
in
<figure>

.

<p>
A
curve-fitting
method
is
then
utilized
to
generate
an
improved
path-loss
propagation
model
,
,
as
follows
:

where

is

of
sampled

RSSI-Based
Localization
</head>
<p>
In
this
work
,
four
transmitters
were
configured
as
anchor
nodes
(
Anchors
A
,
B
,
C
,
and
D
)
;
hence
,
four
distance
values
can
be
obtained
at
each
time
instance
from
the
path-loss
propagation
model
.
They
are
also
placed
at
points
where
any
three
of
them
are
always
noncollinear
,
which
ensures
the
feasibility
of
the
trilateration
method
at
each
time
instance
.

<p>
Consider
as
the
unknown
coordinate
of
the
mobile
node
,
and
with
be
the
first
three
coordinates
from
three
different
anchor
nodes
received
by
the
mobile
node
.
Let
be
the
estimated
distance
from
Node
M
to
,
and

where

<p>
The
coordinate
of
the
mobile

can
then
be

via
Cramer

Odometry
</head>
<p>
Odometry
is
a
process
of
estimating
the
position
change
of
a
mobile
robot
on
the
basis
of
data
from
motion
sensors
.
For
this
research
,
the
encoders
on
both
wheels
of
the
mobile
robot
were
used
to
estimate
the
path
taken
as
well
as
the
heading
direction
.

illustrates
the
robot

position
with
respect
to
two
different
frames
,
namely

the
world
coordinate
system
,
whereas

the
robot-attached
frame
.
The
robot
’s
translational
velocity
,
<hi rend="italic">
v
</hi>
,
and
rotational
velocity
,
,
can
be
written
as
follows
:
(

)
(

)
where
<hi rend="italic">
r
</hi>
is
the
radius
of
the
wheel
,
<hi rend="italic">
D
</hi>
is
the
azimuth
length
between
wheels
,
and
and
represent
the
angular
velocities
of
the
right
and
left
wheels
respectively
.
Let
be
the
center
of
the
robot
,
be
the
current
coordinate
based
on
the
plane
,
be
the
current
coordinate
based
on
the

,
and
be
the
robot
’s
heading
angle
with
respect
to
the
<hi rend="italic">
X
</hi>
axis
.
The
relation
between
,
,
and
can
be
written
as
:
(

)
where
(

</p>
<p>
The
movement
of
the
robot
can
be
decomposed
into
linear
velocities
with
respect
to
the
<hi rend="italic">

and
<hi rend="italic">
Y

axes
,

which
have
a

with
linear
and

velocities
