<p>
Urine
is
a
vital
biofluid
in
mammals
and
could
be
easily
collected
in
a
noninvasive
manner
.
Moreover
,
the
metabolites
components
and
concentrations
in
urine
are
good
indicators
of
metabolic
fluctuations
.
Comparison
of
metabolite
profiles
between
the
treatment
group
and
the
control
group
could
obtain
metabolic
changes
and
reveal
adverse
effects
mechanism
of
stressor
.
In
this
study
,
1H-NMR
and
UPLC-MS/MS
based
metabolomics
were
employed
to
investigate
the
metabolic
perturbations
after
<hi rend="italic">
rac
</hi>
-metalaxyl
and
metalaxyl-M
exposure
.
The
results
showed
that
both
<hi rend="italic">
rac
</hi>
-metalaxyl
and
metalaxyl-M
induced
systematic
metabolic
changes
in
urine
and
serum
.
<hi rend="italic">
Rac
</hi>
-metalaxyl
and
metalaxyl-M
induced
liver
damages
and
metabolic

changes
including

These

Body
Weight
Changes
and
Liver
Damage
</head>
<p>
Only
one
mouse
was
dead
in
the
60
mg/kg
metalaxyl-M
treatment
group
during
the
whole
experiment
.
After
four
weeks
of
exposure
,
no
significant
changes
in
body
weight
were
observed
between
the
control
and
treatment
groups
after
<hi rend="italic">
rac
</hi>
-metalaxyl
and
metalaxyl-M
exposure
.
Histopathology
examination
showed
that
<hi rend="italic">
rac
</hi>
-metalaxyl
and
metalaxyl-M
can
both
induce
hepatocellular
inflammation
,
necrosis
,
and
vacuolation
in
mice
.
Such
results
suggested
<hi rend="italic">
rac
</hi>
-metalaxyl
and
metalaxyl-M
exposure
caused
liver
dysfunction
in
mice
.
Moreover
,
metalaxyl-M
induced
greater
liver
damage
than
<hi rend="italic">
rac
</hi>
-metalaxyl
at
the
same
dosage
.
The
liver
is
a
fundamental
and
essential
organ
for
metabolism
and
detoxification
of
xenobiotics
with
abundant
cytochrome
P450
enzymes
.
The
damages
of
the
liver
may
greatly
affect
the
detoxification
of
mice

Energy
Metabolism
</head>
<p>
Metabolites
involved
in
energy
metabolism
were
significant
changed
in
mice
urine
after
<hi rend="italic">
rac
</hi>
-metalaxyl
and
metalaxyl-M
exposure
,
including
citrate
,
succinate
,
lactate
,
alanine
,
pyruvate
,
and
acetate
.
These
metabolites
are
highly
related
to
energy
pathways
,
including
the
TCA
cycle
,
pyruvate
metabolism
,
and
glycolysis
or
gluconeogenesis
.
Citrate
and
succinate
are
the
main
intermediates
in
the
TCA
cycle
,
which
is
mainly
appeared
in
liver
mitochondria
.
Although
other
factors
cannot
be
excluded
,
the
increased
levels
of
citrate
and
succinate
in
the
urine
of
metalaxyl-M-treated
mice
indicated
that
metalaxyl-M
affected
the
activity
of
mitochondria
enzymes
involved
in
the
TCA
cycle
,
resulting
in
the
enhancement
of
energy
metabolism
in
treated
mice
.
In
addition
,
the
decreased
level
of
pyruvate
and
increased
levels
of
lactate
and
alanine
were
highly
related
to
pyruvate
metabolism
.
Pyruvate
could
be
converted
to
acetyl-coenzyme
A
(
COA
)
,
which
is
a
vital
intermediate
in
the
synthesis
of
citrate
.
Lactate
and
alanine
can
also
be
converted
to
pyruvate
.
Thus
,
the
increased
lactate
and
alanine
could
promote
the
level
of
acetyl-COA
and
then
up-regulate
the
energy
metabolism
.
To
sum
up
,
these
results
indicated
the
enhancement
of
energy
metabolism
in
mice
after
<hi rend="italic">
rac
</hi>
-metalaxyl
and
metalaxyl-M
exposure
.
Furthermore
,
the
perturbation
degrees
induced
by
metalaxy-M
were
higher
than
<hi rend="italic">
rac
</hi>
-metalaxy
in
energy
metabolism
.

Lipid
Metabolism
</head>
<p>
In
this
study
,
metalaxyl-M
induced
two
lipid
metabolism
pathway
fluctuations
including
glycerophospholipid
metabolism
,
glyoxylate
,
and
dicarboxylate
metabolism
.
However
,
no
lipid
metabolism
pathway
was
affected
by
<hi rend="italic">
rac
</hi>
-metalaxyl
exposure
.
According
to
metabolomics
data
,
metalaxyl-M
induced
the
increased
levels
of
choline
and
TMAO
and
decreased
levels
of
PC
and
GPC
.
<hi rend="italic">
Rac
</hi>
-metalaxyl
only
induced
the
decreased
level
of
GPC
.
Such
metabolites
were
all
related
to
lipid
metabolism
and
had
essential
effect
on
cholesterol
level
in
digestive
system
.
Choline
is
an
important
nutrient
that
is
required
for
lipid
transport
,
methyl-group
metabolism
,
neurotransmitter
synthesis
,
cell
membrane
structure
,
and
signaling
.
In
addition
,
choline
is
a
constituent
of
cell
membranes
and
lipoprotein
phospholipids
,
which
play
an
important
role
in
the
integrity
of
cell
membrane
and
lipid
metabolism
.
Increased
choline
levels
in
urine
samples
suggested
the
membrane
fluidity
was
disrupted
by
metalaxyl-M
.
PC
and
GPC
are
known
to
be
important
endogenous
metabolites
related
to
maintenance
of
choline
homeostasis
and
bile
acids
excretion
.
Moreover
,
PC
,
and
GPC
are
not
only
essential
components
of
cell
membranes
,
but
also
protect
cell
from
oxidative
stress
and
lipotoxicity
.
The
decreased
levels
of
PC
and
GPC
may
be
good
indicators
of
oxidative
stress
and
lipotoxicity
induced
by
metalaxyl-M
.
