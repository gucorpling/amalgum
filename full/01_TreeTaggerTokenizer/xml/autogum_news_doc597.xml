Dr.

</hi>
:
I
am
a
research
associate
in
the
Institute
of
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Neuroscience">
Neuroscience
</ref>
at
Newcastle
University
,
working
in
the
laboratory
of
Dr.
Geraldine
Wright
.
The
paper

co-authored

</hi>
What
did
your
research
involve
?
</p>
<hi rend="bold">
DSW
</hi>
:
The
research
involved
feeding
the
pesticide
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/imidacloprid">
imidacloprid
</ref>
,
and
the
mite
treatment
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coumaphos">
coumaphos
</ref>
,
to
honeybees
,
then
carrying
out
a
learning
and
memory
experiment
.
The
learning
experiment
relies
on
a
phenomenon
called
the
Proboscis
Extension
Reflex
(
PER
)
whereby
the
bee
extends
its
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proboscis">
proboscis
</ref>
(
sticks
out
its
tongue
)
to
receive
a
meal
when
the
antennae
are
touched
with
sugar
solution
.
In
the
lab
,
we
can
blow
a
floral
scent
at
the
bee
at
the
same
time
as
delivering
the
sugar
solution-
soon
,
the
bee
learns
to
extend
its
proboscis
in
response
to
the
scent
,
having
learned
that
this
particular
scent
indicates
a
sugar
reward
.
We
then
tested
the
bees
'
memory
,
by
comparing
the
PER
response
to
both
the
trained
scent
,
and
a
different
novel
scent
.

What
prompted
your
research
into
the
effect
of
chemicals
such
as
neonicotinoids
and
coumaphos
with
regards
to
the
interference
of
insect
's
ability
to
learn
?
</p>
<hi rend="bold">
DSW
</hi>
:
The
target
of
the
pesticide
imidacloprid
is
an
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/acetylcholine">
acetylcholine
</ref>
receptor
which
is
found
in
brain
regions
associated
with
learning
and
remembering
olfactory
information
.
Coumaphos
inhibits
the
breakdown
of
acetylcholine
at
these
same
synapses
.
Therefore
,
we
predicted
that
both
compounds
would
affect
olfactory
learning
,
and
that
the
effects
of
both
compounds
delivered
together
would
be
additive
.

What
conditions
did
you
test
your
hypothesis
under
?
</p>
<hi rend="bold">
DSW
</hi>
:
We
had
a
control
group
of
bees
fed
sugar
solution
alone
,
then
we
had
a
group
fed
sugar
solution
containing
low
levels
of
imidacloprid
,
a
group
fed
sugar
solution
containing
coumaphos
,
and
a
group
of
bees
fed
sugar
solution
containing
both
imidacloprid
and
coumaphos
.
The
pesticides
were
present
at
very
low
levels
,
similar
to
those
which
might
be
present
in
the
nectar
of
flowers
treated
with
imidacloprid
,
or
to
the
levels
of
coumaphos
which
might
be
in
the
pollen
and
honey
stores
of
a
coumaphos-treated
hive
.

For
how
long
have
you
been
conducting
your
investigation
?
</p>
<hi rend="bold">
DSW
</hi>
:
The
investigation
was
mainly
carried
out
from
June-September
2011
,
then
the
data
analysis
and
interpretation
was
carried
out
during
the
winter
.
In
bee
research
,
most
of
the
lab
work
is
carried
out
in
a
summer
season
when
the
bees
are
flying
,
then
we
spend
the
winter
doing
statistical
analysis
and
writing
up
our
results
.
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
(
(
</hi>
<hi rend="bold">

</hi>
<hi rend="bold">
)
)
</hi>
Was
the
outcome
as
you
expected
?
</p>
<hi rend="bold">
DSW
</hi>
:
We
found
that
imidacloprid
and
coumaphos
both
impaired
learning
,
and
that
they
did
indeed
have
an
additive
effect
on
learning
impairment
when
administered
together
.
A
rather
surprising
finding
on
the
memory
test
results
was
,
that
the
bees
could
not
tell
the
training
odour
,
and
a
novel
odour
,
apart-
they
responded
to
both
equally
,
not
preferring
the
odour
associated
with
the
sugar
reward
over
the
other
odour
which
should
have
no
rewarding
associations
.

Did
you
work
alongside
anyone
else
in
your
research
?
Was
any
part
of
the
investigation
most
difficult
?
</p>
<hi rend="bold">
DSW
</hi>
:
I
worked
alongside
Dr.
Wright
who
is
the
head
of
our
research
group
,
and
also
alongside
students
and
staff
performing
different
bee
experiments
focused
on
bee
nutrition
.
We
also
had
close
links
with
our
collaborators
Dr
Chris
Connelly
and
Dr
Mary
Palmer
at
Dundee
University
,
who
have
recently
published
a
study
on
actual
bee
brains
,
supplying
data
about
what
the
same
pesticides
do
to
the
neurons
when
actually
applied
directly
to
the
brain
areas
of
the
bee
involved
in
learning
and
memory
.
The
main
difficulty
involved
in
our
study
was
that
it
involved
a
6-day
experimental
protocol
,
performed
every
week
for
several
months
,
so
it
was
quite
intensive
!
Another
difficulty
of
bee
work
is
,
it
is
very
weather
dependant-
if
it
rains
or
is
cold
,
the
bees
are
n't
out
foraging
and
the
experiment
has
to
be
postponed
until
the
weather
improves
.
