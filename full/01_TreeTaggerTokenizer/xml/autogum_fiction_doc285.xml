CHAPTER
III
</head>
<p>
It
was
Daylight
's
night
.
He
was
the
centre
and
the
head
of
the
revel
,
unquenchably
joyous
,
a
contagion
of
fun
.
He
multiplied
himself
,
and
in
so
doing
multiplied
the
excitement
.
No
prank
he
suggested
was
too
wild
for
his
followers
,
and
all
followed
save
those
that
developed
into
singing
imbeciles
and
fell
warbling
by
the
wayside
.
Yet
never
did
trouble
intrude
.
It
was
known
on
the
Yukon
that
when
Burning
Daylight
made
a
night
of
it
,
wrath
and
evil
were
forbidden
.
On
his
nights
men
dared
not
quarrel
.
In
the
younger
days
such
things
had
happened
,
and
then
men
had
known
what
real
wrath
was
,
and
been
man-handled
as
only
Burning
Daylight
could
man-handle
.
On
his
nights
men
must
laugh
and
be
happy
or
go
home
.
Daylight
was
inexhaustible
.
In
between
dances
he
paid
over
to
Kearns
the
twenty
thousand
in
dust
and
transferred
to
him
his
Moosehide
claim
.
Likewise
he
arranged
the
taking
over
of
Billy
Rawlins
'
mail
contract
,
and
made
his
preparations
for
the
start
.
He
despatched
a
messenger
to
rout
out
Kama
,
his
dog-driver
--
a
Tananaw
Indian
,
far-wandered
from
his
tribal
home
in
the
service
of
the
invading
whites
.
Kama
entered
the
Tivoli
,
tall
,
lean
,
muscular
,
and
fur-clad
,
the
pick
of
his
barbaric
race
and
barbaric
still
,
unshaken
and
unabashed
by
the
revellers
that
rioted
about
him
while
Daylight
gave
his
orders
.
&quot;
Um
,
&quot;
said
Kama
,
tabling
his
instructions
on
his
fingers
.
&quot;
Get
um
letters
from
Rawlins
.
Load
um
on
sled
.
Grub
for
Selkirk
--

&quot;

<p>
&quot;
Plenty

.
&quot;

<p>
&quot;
Um

&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
No

,
&quot;
Daylight
answered
decisively
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Um
much
cold
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
We
travel
light
--
savvee
?
We
carry
plenty

,
plenty
letters
back
.
You

strong
man
.
Plenty

,

,

.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Sure
all
right
,
&quot;
Kama
muttered
,
with
resignation
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Much
cold
,
no
care
a
damn
.
Um
ready
nine
um
clock
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
He
turned
on
his
moccasined
heel
and
walked
out
,
imperturbable
,
sphinx-like
,
neither
giving
nor
receiving
greetings
nor
looking
to
right
or
left
.
The
Virgin
led
Daylight
away
into
a
corner
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Look
here
,
Daylight
,
&quot;
she
said
,
in
a
low
voice
,
&quot;
you
're
busted
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Higher'n
a
kite
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
've
eight
thousand
in
Mac
's
safe
--
&quot;
she
began
.
</p>
<p>
But
Daylight
interrupted
.
The
apron-string
loomed
near
and
he
shied
like
an
unbroken
colt
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
It
do
n't
matter
,
&quot;
he
said
.
&quot;
Busted
I
came
into
the
world
,
busted
I
go
out
,
and
I
've
been
busted
most
of
the
time
since
I
arrived
.
Come
on
;
let
's
waltz
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
But
listen
,
&quot;
she
urged
.
&quot;
My
money
's
doing
nothing
.
I
could
lend
it
to
you
--
a
grub-stake
,
&quot;
she
added
hurriedly
,
at
sight
of
the
alarm
in
his
face
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Nobody
grub-stakes
me
,
&quot;
was
the
answer
.
&quot;
I
stake
myself
,
and
when
I
make
a
killing
it
's
sure
all
mine
.
No
thank
you
,
old
girl
.
Much
obliged
.
I
'll
get
my
stake
by
running
the
mail
out
and
in
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Daylight
,
&quot;
she
murmured
,
in
tender
protest
.
</p>
<p>
But
with
a
sudden
well-assumed
ebullition
of
spirits
he
drew
her
toward
the
dancing-floor
,
and
as
they
swung
around
and
around
in
a
waltz
she
pondered
on
the
iron
heart
of
the
man
who
held
her
in
his
arms
and
resisted
all
her
wiles
.
</p>
<p>
At
six
the
next
morning
,
scorching
with
whiskey
,
yet
ever
himself
,
he
stood
at
the
bar
putting
every
man
's
hand
down
.
The
way
of
it
was
that
two
men
faced
each
other
across
a
corner
,
their
right
elbows
resting
on
the
bar
,
their
right
hands
gripped
together
,
while
each
strove
to
press
the
other
's
hand
down
.
Man
after
man
came
against
him
,
but
no
man
put
his
hand
down
,
even
Olaf
Henderson
and
French
Louis
failing
despite
their
hugeness
.
When
they
contended
it
was
a
trick
,
a
trained
muscular
knack
,
he
challenged
them
to
another
test
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Look
here
,
you-all
&quot;
he
cried
.
&quot;
I
'm
going
to
do
two
things
:
first
,
weigh
my
sack
;
and
second
,
bet
it
that
after
you-all
have
lifted
clean
from
the
floor
all
the
sacks
of
flour
you-all
are
able
,
I
'll
put
on
two
more
sacks
and
lift
the
whole
caboodle
clean
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
By
Gar
!
Ah
take
dat
!
&quot;
French
Louis
rumbled
above
the
cheers
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Hold
on
!
&quot;
Olaf
Henderson
cried
.
&quot;
I
ban
yust
as
good
as
you
,
Louis
.
I
yump
half
that
bet
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Put
on
the
scales
,
Daylight
's
sack
was
found
to
balance
an
even
four
hundred
dollars
,
and
Louis
and
Olaf
divided
the
bet
between
them
.
Fifty-pound
sacks
of
flour
were
brought
in
from
MacDonald
's
cache
.
Other
men
tested
their
strength
first
.
They
straddled
on
two
chairs
,
the
flour
sacks
beneath
them
on
the
floor
and
held
together
by
rope-lashings
.
Many
of
the
men
were
able
,
in
this
manner
,
to
lift
four
or
five
hundred
pounds
,
while
some
succeeded
with
as
high
as
six
hundred
.
Then
the
two
giants
took
a
hand
,
tying
at
seven
hundred
.
French
Louis
then
added
another
sack
,
and
swung
seven
hundred
and
fifty
clear
.
Olaf
duplicated
the
performance
,
whereupon
both
failed
to
clear
eight
hundred
.
Again
and
again
they
strove
,
their
foreheads
beaded
with
sweat
,
their
frames
crackling
with
the
effort
.
Both
were
able
to
shift
the
weight
and
to
bump
it
,
but
clear
the
floor
with
it
they
could
not
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
By
Gar
!
Daylight
,
dis
tam
you
mek
one
beeg
meestake
,
&quot;
French
Louis
said
,
straightening
up
and
stepping
down
from
the
chairs
.
&quot;
Only
one
damn
iron
man
can
do
dat
.
One
hundred
pun
'
more
--
my
frien
'
,
not
ten
poun
'
more
.
&quot;
The
sacks
were
unlashed
,
but
when
two
sacks
were
added
,
Kearns
interfered
.
&quot;
Only
one
sack
more
.
&quot;
