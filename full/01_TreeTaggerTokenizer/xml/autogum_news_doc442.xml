of

</p>
<p>
In
1941
,
she
became
a
nurse
for
the
Soviet
military
on
the
front
during
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/World_War_II">

.
She
suffered
a
severe
wound
to
the
chest
,
and
serious
head
injuries
in
1943
from
which
she
nearly
lost
her
sight
,
and
received
decorations
for
valor
.
Bonner
returned
to
the
front
in
1945
,
advancing
with
the
army
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potsdam">
Potsdam

.
While
studying
medicine
when
the
war
was
over
,
she
married
a
fellow
student
,
Ivan
Semyonov
and
they
had
a
son
and
a
daughter
.
But
as
she
became
increasingly
politically
active
,
they
lost
their
common
interests
and
divorced
in
1965
.
</p>
<p>
She
was
an
active
Soviet
dissident
in
the
1970s
,
and
a
leader
of
a
group
that
monitored
Soviet
compliance
with
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsinki%20Accords">

.
<hi rend="italic">
The
Washington
Post

describes
her
at
this
time
as
&quot;
[
h]eadstrong
and
sharp-tongued
with
a
no-nonsense
voice
deepened
by
years
of
chain-smoking
acrid
Russian
cigarettes
&quot;
.
</p>
<p>
Bonner
married
Sakharov
in
1972
,
whom
she
had
met
through
her
political
activities
.
He
was
also
fierce
critic
of
the
lack
of
civil
liberties
and
human
rights
in
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Soviet_Union">

,
and
their
tiny
Moscow
apartment
became
the
meeting
place
for
the
Soviet
dissident
movement
in
the
1970s
.
They
traveled
around
Russia
together
visiting
imprisoned
dissidents
and
working
for
their
legal
rights
.

When
Sakharov
won

in

exiled

and
Bonner

Sakharove
's
sole
contact
with
the
outside

,
smuggled
his
writings
to
Moscow
and
ensured
that
they
were
published
.
Soviet
authorities
conducted
campaigns
of
personal
attacks
against
her
,
accusing
her
of
being
a
foreign
agent
who
turned
Sakharove
against
his
country
.
In
1984
she
was
convicted
of
&quot;
anti-Soviet
agitation
&quot;
and
was
exiled
to
Siberia
with
her
husband
,
both
continually
harassed
by
authorities
.
She
published
her
memoir
in

of
the
years
in
exile
,
described
by
the

as
partly
&quot;
a
love

mutual
sacrifice

</p>
<p>
In

allowed
the
Sakharoves
to
return
to

where
they
continued
to
agitate
for
human

were
constantly
harassed
for
their
activities

<p>
When

two
years
after
Sakharov
's
death
in

Bonner
continued
her
human

and
political
activities
.
She
initially
supported
President

Boris
Yeltsin
</ref>

s
government
and
served
on
his
state

became
critical

government
at
the
beginning
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First%20Chechen%20War">
war
in

was
also
critical
of

successor
,

,
and
was
the
first
person
to
sign
a

in
March
2010

</p>
<p>
As
her
health
deteriorated
,
she
became
less
active
,
and
she
moved
to
the
United

to
be
with
her
daughter

<p>
Bonner
received
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorolf%20Rafto%20Memorial%20Prize">

in
1991
for
her

She
published
at

four
