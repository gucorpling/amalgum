Patent
a
Recipe
</head>
<p>
Did
you
invent
a
recipe
that
you
're
certain
has
never
been
tasted
by
the
world
before
?
You
might
have
a
uniquely
delicious
concoction
on
your
hands
,
but
in
order
to
patent
it
,
your
recipe
must
be
considered
novel
,
non-obvious
and
useful
.
Home
cooks
and
chefs
have
been
mixing
ingredients
for
thousands
of
years
,
so
coming
up
with
something
completely
new
is
n't
easy
.
If
your
recipe
does
n't
meet
these
qualifications
,
there
are
other
legal
protections
you
can
put
in
place
to
claim
it
as
your
own
.

Understand
what
makes
something
patentable
.
Section
35
USC
ยง
101
on
patent
law
states
that
&quot;
Whoever
invents
or
discovers
any
new
and
useful
process
,
machine
,
manufacture
,
or
composition
of
matter
,
or
any
new
and
useful
improvement
thereof
,
may
obtain
a
patent
therefor
,
subject
to
the
conditions
and
requirements
of
this
title
.
&quot;
Recipes
can
fall
into
this
category
in
two
different
ways
,
since
they
are
always
useful
,
they
may
involve
a
new
process
or
technique
,
and
they
include
a
composition
of
matter
.
All
of
this
is
to
say
that
recipes
are
indeed
possible
to
patent
as
long
as
they
meet
the
other
requirements
.

Determine
if
your
recipe
is
novel
.
In
legal
terminology
,
&quot;
novel
&quot;
refers
to
something
that
did
not
previous
exist
.
This
is
where
things
get
tricky
when
it
comes
to
patenting
recipes
.
It
's
very
difficult
to
determine
whether
a
particular
mix
of
ingredients
has
been
whipped
up
in
someone
's
kitchen
before
.
There
are
a
few
forms
of
research
you
should
undertake
in
order
to
see
if
your
recipe
is
novel
enough
to
patent
.
<figure rend="Patent a Recipe Step 2.jpg">
</figure>
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Search
the
United
States
Patent
and
Trademark
Office
database
to
see
if
your
recipe
has
already
been
patented
.
</item>
<item>
Search
cookbooks
and
the
Internet
for
your
recipe
.
If
you
find
the
recipe
in
either
location
you
may
be
ineligible
for
a
patent
because
of
an
existing
patent
or
the
recipe
will
be
considered
already
&quot;
disclosed
&quot;
if
it
has
been
published
elsewhere
.
</item>
<item>
If
you
cannot
find
an
exact
replication
of
the
recipe
,
you
can
proceed
to
determining
whether
your
recipe
meets
the
other
qualifications
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Determine
if
your
recipe
is
non-obvious
.
If
your
recipe
involves
a
technique
or
combination
of
ingredients
that
leads
to
unique
,
non-obvious
results
,
it
may
be
patentable
.
However
,
if
your
recipe
is
something
that
could
easily
be
thought
up
by
someone
else
,
or
involves
techniques
that
lead
to
predictable
results
,
it
's
probably
not
patentable
.
Since
most
recipes
invented
by
home
cooks
do
n't
lead
to
results
that
would
surprise
a
seasoned
cook
,
they
usually
are
n't
patentable
.

Food
companies
are
more
likely
to
create
recipes
that
are
patentable
,
because
they
are
able
to
use
experimental
processes
and
ingredients
that
lead
to
non-obvious
results
.
For
example
,
a
patentable
recipe
might
be
one
that
uses
a
new
technique
to
give
it
a
surprisingly
long
shelf
life
.
</item>
<item>
Simply
adding
a
unique
ingredient
to
a
recipe
is
n't
non-obvious
enough
to
make
it
patentable
.
For
example
,
an
experimental
home
cook
might
decide
to
add
cinnamon
to
a
meatloaf
recipe
.
Though
the
results
might
be
surprisingly
delicious
,
most
home
chefs
could
predict
the
flavor
change
that
the
addition
of
cinnamon
would
bring
about
.

Applying
for
a
Patent
</head>

Decide
what
kind
of
patent
you
need
.
There
are
several
different
kinds
of
patents
available
and
a
recipe
could
fall
into
more
than
one
category
of
patents
.
The
Utility
Patent
protects
new
inventions
that
have
a
useful
application
.
This
covers
new
methods
,
processes
,
machines
,
manufactured
items
,
devices
or
chemical
compounds
or
any
new
improvements
to
any
of
these
.
Most
recipes
would
fall
under
the
Utility
Patent
category
.
The
product
shape
or
packaging
may
also
be
susceptible
to
protection
under
a
design
patent
.
In
this
case
you
could
apply
for
one
of
those
as
well
.

Figure
out
where
you
need
patent
protection
.
Patents
can
be
filed
either
in
the
United
States
or
in
other
countries
.
If
you
feel
that
your
recipe
requires
international
protection
,
then
you
should
apply
for
a
patent
in
countries
where
you
want
patent
protection
.

Work

There
are
patent
lawyers
who
specialize
in
filing
the
necessary
paperwork
with
the
United

Patent

Office
.
While
you
're

recommends
you
hire
a
lawyer
at
this
point
to
handle

The
vast
majority
of
patent
applications
are
routinely
rejected
.
You
should
not
take
it
personally
.
Examiners
are
required
to
enforce
the
rules
diligently
and
it
often
works
out
to
your
advantage
,
resulting
in
a
more
valuable
patent
.
</item>
<item>
If
your
application
is
rejected
you
have
an
opportunity
to
argue
or
to
amend
(
narrow
)
the
claims
or
to
appeal
the
examiners
'
final
decision
.
This
often
takes
several
years
and
thousands
of
dollars
in
filing
fees
and
attorneys
'
fees
.
</item>
<item>
If
your
application
is
finally
rejected
and
you
abandon
it
,
and
you
still
want
to
protect
your
recipe
,
you
can
do
so
by
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Safeguard_Your_Organization's_Trade_Secrets">
protecting
it
as
a
trade
secret
</ref>
.
Those
who
know
the
secret
will
be
required
to
sign
a
non-disclosure
agreement
,
and
in
this
way
you
can
prevent
your
recipe
from
getting
leaked
.
