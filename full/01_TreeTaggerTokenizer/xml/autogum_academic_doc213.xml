Introduction

<p>
<hi rend="italic">
Lycium
barbarum
</hi>
L.
,
also
known
as
goji
,
is
a
perennial
deciduous
shrub
planted
in
large
areas
in
the
west
of
China
.
It
prefers
to
grow
in
sunny
;
cold
weather
;
and
moist
,
fertile
soil
.
Goji
berry
is
also
an
excellent
medicinal
herb
and
healthy
food
.
The
fruit
is
rich
in
vitamins
,
essential
amino
acids
,
and
linoleic
acid
.
These
nutrients
can
promote
blood
flow
and
prevent
arteriosclerosis
.
Long-term
consumption
of
goji
berry
can
also
help
to
prevent
fat
accumulation
in
the
liver
,
improve
cell
metabolism
,
and
ensure
regular
body
metabolism
,
thus
playing
an
essential
role
in
slowing
down
aging
of
the
body
.
Furthermore
,
goji
berry
also
has
effects
on
the
reduction
of
inflammation
and
fever
,
the
elimination
of
phlegm
,
liver
protection
,
diabetes
prevention
,
cough
relief
,
moistening
of
the
lungs
,
and
mucus
removal
.
Recently
,
the
beneficial
effects
of
goji
berry
have
been
gradually
recognized
by
people
,
and
the
fruit
is
rapidly
becoming
an
indispensable
food
supplement
.
Previous
studies
have
shown
that
total
phenolics
,
total
flavonoid
,
and
total
polysaccharide
contents
of
goji
fruits
from
13
different
regions
in
China
ranged
from
6.899
–
8.253
mg
gallic
acid
equivalents/g
dry
weight
(
DW
)
,
3.177
–
6.144
mg
rutin
equivalents/g
DW
,
and
23.62
–
42.45
mg/g
DW
,
indicating
that
the
goji
berry
from
Guyuan
of
Ningxia
was
most
similar
to
Daodi
herbs
.
Liu
et
al.
reported
a
comparative
analysis
of
carotenoid
accumulation
in
red
fruit
of
<hi rend="italic">
Lycium
barbarum
</hi>
L.
and
black
fruit
of
<hi rend="italic">
Lycium
ruthenicum
</hi>
L.
,
finding
more
extensive
contents
of
carotenoids
in
red
fruit
than
in
black
fruit
.

Nitrogen
fertilizer
is
an
essential
nutrient
that
has
an
important
impact
on
crop
growth
,
yield
,
and
product
quality
.
The
proper
application
of
nitrogen
fertilizer
can
increase
the
soil
’s
nitrogen
content
for
better
plant
growth
.
Several
studies
investigated
the
absorption
,
assimilation
,
and
effects
of
nitrogen
fertilizer
on
plant
development
.
Nitrogen
is
mainly
absorbed
in
the
form
of
nitrates
and
ammonium
salts
,
but
may
also
be
absorbed
in
organic
form
(
e.
g.
,
urea
or
amino
acids
)
.
The
assimilation
of
inorganic
N
and
organic
N
requires
a
series
of
strictly
regulated
enzyme
catalysis
steps
.
The
growth
and
development
,
yield
,
and
quality
of
goji
are
all
quantitatively
limited
by
nitrogen
demand
,
where
either
too
much
or
too
little
nitrogen
can
inhibit
the
growth
and
development
of
goji
.
Previous
studies
showed
that
about
20
%
of
the
nitrogen
absorbed
during
the
growth
and
development
of
goji
comes
from
fertilizers
,
with
80
%
coming
from
the
soil
.
In
two-year-old
goji
,
nitrogen
uptake
from
the
fast-growing
period
to
the
fruit-harvesting
period
(
from
early
May
to
mid-August
)
continuously
increased
during
the
annual
growth
cycle
and
in
early
May
to
late
June
.
The
nitrogen
content
of
the
fertilizer
absorbed
by
the
plant
was
higher
than
that
of
the
total
nitrogen
,
indicating
that
these
two
periods
were
the
peak
period
of
nitrogen
absorption
and
the
key
period
for
nitrogen
fertilizer
application
.
It
was
also
found
that
the
greatest
effect
of
fertilizers
on
the
growth
of
goji
shoots
in
spring
time
was
observed
in
response
to
nitrogen
fertilizer
,
followed
by
phosphate
fertilizer
and
,
lastly
,
potash
fertilizer
.
Most
of
the
studies
on
goji
berry
mainly
focused
on
the
effects
of
goji
berry
on
human
health
,
as
well
as
the
antioxidant
activity
of
goji
berry
through
phytochemical
analysis
.
The
impact
of
fertilizer
on
the
metabolites
of
goji
berry
has
not
yet
been
reported
.

<p>
Although
many
reports
have
identified
the
pharmacological
properties
,
biological
activity
,
and
nutrient
benefits
of
goji
berry
,
the
relationship
between
fertilization
and
the
goji
berry
metabolome
is
still
under-reported
.
In
this
study
,
we
utilized
an
integrated
UPLC-ESI-MS/MS
detection
system
to
study
the
effects
of
different
nitrogen
fertilizations
on
the
yield
and
metabolites
of
goji
berry
and
provided
a
theoretical
model
for
the
regulation
of
goji
berries
’
nutrient
compounds
by
fertilization
.
