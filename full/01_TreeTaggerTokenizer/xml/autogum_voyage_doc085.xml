The
name
&quot;
Ten
Sleep
&quot;
comes
from
American
Indians
who
marked
this
location
as
&quot;
ten
sleeps
&quot;
(
or
ten
days
'
travel
)
between
<ref target="Fort%20Laramie">
Fort
Laramie
</ref>
and
the
government
's
Indian
Agency
on
the
Stillwater
River
in
Montana
.

Creek
Raid
,
sometimes
called
the
Battle
of
Ten
Sleep
,
one
of
the
last
&quot;
Wild
West
&quot;
battles
.

Unless
you
really
know
the
local
backroads
well
,
you
'll
come
in
on
US
16
and
you
'll
leave
that
way
too
.
From

west
,
US
16
passes
through
<ref target="Worland">
Worland
</ref>

The
adventurous
might
enjoy
the
drive
from
Manderson
through
Hyattville
into
Ten
Sleep
on
Wyoming
Highways
31
and
49
,
where
you
can
see
a
variety
of
farms
and
ranches
squeezing
a
living
out
of
the
&quot;
badlands
.
&quot;
Between
Hyattville
and
Ten
Sleep
you
will
almost
certainly
have
to
stop
at
some
point
to
wait
for
cattle
to
cross
the
road
.
(
Be
aware
that
,
should
you
have
any
car
trouble
or
anything
,
it
could
be
an
hour
or
two
before
you
see
another
car
-
and
that
's
in
the
daytime
with
good
weather
.
Just
in
case
,
you
might
consider
whether
you
're
prepared
to
deal
with
all
problems
yourself
!
)
</p>
<p>
You
could
also
try
to
find
your
way
in
from
Moneta
through
Lost
Cabin
.
If
you
are
not
familiar
with
the
local
roads
,
before
trying
this
,
you
might
want
to
download
the
area
into
your
GPS
system

even
room
to
drive
.
