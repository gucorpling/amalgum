begin
to
wonder
whether
the
job
is
a
good
fit
for
you
and
your
life
.
The
job
of
parenting
is
not
one
you
can
resign
from
,
however
.
You
are
responsible
for
your
children
until
they
become
adults
,
no
matter
how
needy
they
get
or
how
underappreciated
you
may
feel
.
Parenting
burnout
can
cause
major
problems
in
your
life
,
so
make
sure
you
identify
and
address
it
immediately

Manage
parenting
burnout
by
adjusting
your
expectations
,
balancing
your
kids
'
needs
with
your
own
and
leaning
on
your
support
network
for
help
.

Think
about
the

put
on
their

oxygen
masks
before
giving
oxygen

cannot
help
your
