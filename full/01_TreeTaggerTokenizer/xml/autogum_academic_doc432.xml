Conclusions

<p>
In
the
presented
research
,
it
was
found
that
most
studies
on
urban
resilience
consider
buildings
,
infrastructure
and
social
community
,
while
there
is
a
significant
lack
of
research
on
the
impact
of
urban
open
space
on
urban
resilience
.
Among
the
latter
there
was
observed
a
dominant
focus
on
the
climate
change
issue
.
On
the
contrary
,
a
topic
on
the
importance
of
open
space
for
urban
seismic
resilience
is
rare
in
the
existing
scientific
literature
.
The
interest
in
this
issue
has
only
appeared
in
the
last
decade
,
which
offers
an
opportunity
for
further
research
.
</p>
<p>
There
are
some
important
differences
considering
resilience
to
a
climate
change
or
an
earthquake
.
While
climate
change
is
a
long-lasting
and
slowly
progressive
process
,
an
earthquake
strikes
suddenly
and
unannounced
.
Therefore
,
coping
with
climate
change
requires
constant
adaptation
,
while
seismic
impact
reduction
addresses
a
quick
response
and
effective
recovery
strategies
.
Green
open
spaces
contribute
to
climate
resilience
enhancement
.
On
the
other
hand
,
not
only
green
space
,
but
also
built-up
and
undeveloped
open
space
have
an
important
role
for
urban
seismic
resilience
.
</p>
<p>
Resilient
open
spaces
are
distinguished
by
their
specific
characteristics
which
depend
on
specific
types
of
disaster
and
particular
site
conditions
.
These
characteristics
are
the
qualitative
and
quantitative
properties
of
resilient
open
spaces
which
should
be
evaluated
for
the
holistic
resilience
assessment
of
an
urban
system
.
In
the
performed
literature
reviews
,
a
lack
of
quantitative
studies
on
open
space
for
urban
seismic
resilience
has
been
recognized
.
To
address
this
issue
,
the
authors
â€™
conceptual
proposal
for
the
quantitative
assessment
of
an
open
space
,
including
interactions
with
other
urban
components
,
is
presented
.
The
proposed
draft
concept
applies
a
complex
network
approach
for
the
seismic
resilience
assessment
of
the
urban
system
as
a
whole
.
The
urban
system
modelled
as
a
mathematical
graph
,
contains
all
urban
components
,
including
open
space
.
Beside
the
general
resilience
,
the
conceptual
evaluation
model
allows
the
identification
of
critical
points
and
bottlenecks
in
the
system
.
Therefore
,
it
can
serve
as
a
basis
for
the
actions
of
urban
resilience
enhancement
.
</p>
<p>
The
strategy
of
urban
resilience
enhancement
has
an
important
impact
on
urban
landscape
configuration
,
city
layout
,
engineering
,
hydro-engineering
,
urban
economy
,
agriculture
,
mobility
,
and
especially
emergency
management
of
urban
systems
.
To
achieve
the
goal
of
a
resilient
system
,
the
qualitative
and
well-distributed
open
space
can
make
a
significant
contribution
to
emergency
response
and
city
recovery
.
Considering
this
,
for
further
research
it
is
planned
to
work
on
the
realization
of
the
proposed
draft
model
,
which
would
allow
seismic
resilience
assessment
by
applying
algorithms
of
the
graph
theory
.
Moreover
,
to
contribute
to
resilience
enhancement
different
simulations
of
the
urban
system
recovery
scenarios
based
on
the
potential
of
open
space
would
be
performed
.
