It
has
been
revealed
that
the
final
report
into
a
midair
collision
that
killed
154
people
in
2006
will
blame
a
string
of
human
error
for
the
disaster
.

the

was
&quot;
inadvertently

this

The
ExcelAire
pilots
,
Joseph
Lepore
and
Jan
Paladino
,
were
only
allowed
to
return
home
after
promising
they
would
return
to
Brazil
if
summoned
by
the
courts
.
The
pair
,
along
with
four
air
traffic
controllers
,
have
been
indicted
over
the
crash
and
all
six
face
up
to
three
years
in
prison
each
.
</p>
<p>
The
purpose
of
this
investigation
,
however
,
was
not
to
acertain
blame
but
to
determine
the
root
causes
and
suggest
measures
by
which
a
reccurence
can
be
avoided
.
Some
moves
have
already
been
made
in
the
aftermath
;
the
accident
was
the
deadliest
in
Brazil
until
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAM%20Airlines%20Flight%203054">
TAM
Airlines

crashed
the
following

and
both
were
responsible

Brazilian
aviation
crisis
</ref>
.
In
response
,
a
major
overhaul
of
the
nation
's
military
ATC
system
is
underway
.
</p>
<p>
ExcelAire
's
executive
vice
president
David
Rimmer
was
critical
of
the
report
.
&quot;
The
transponder
issue
is
a
distraction
from
the
true
cause
of
the
accident
,
which
is
an
air
traffic
control
system
that
put
two
airplanes
on
a
collision
course
for
about
an
hour
,
&quot;
he
said
.
He
complained
that
ATC
did
not
&quot;
recognize
the
transponder
failure
and
to
provide
increased
separation
between
the
two
jets
,
as
required
by
international
aviation
regulations
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
He
was
also
concerned
by
the
Air
Force
's
methodology
and
the
conclusions
drawn
from
it
.
&quot;
We
have
no
proof
of
how
the
transponder
was
turned
off
and
no
evidence
to
suggest
it
was
inadvertently
turned
off
by
the
pilots
,
&quot;
he
said
.
&quot;
[
The
Air
Force
]
relied
on
theories
rather
than
conducting
in-depth
testing
of
the
equipment
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
report
's
official
release
is
next
week
,
however
it
has
already
been
seen
by
Brazilian
newspapers
,
hence
making
its
findings
public
today
.
