Ismail
was
charged
with
repopulating
villages
that
had
been
abandoned
due
to
Bedouin
raids
and
restoring
order
in
the
districts
.
In
late
1719

the
central
authorities
commanded
him
to
forcibly
settle
the
nomadic
and
frequently
rebellious
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Turkmen">

Al-Azm

<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wali">

(

The

used
his
influence
to
persuade
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublime_Porte">

(
Ottoman
imperial
government
)
to
send
Ismail
imperial
troops
to

Mawali
tribes
.
The
Sublime
Porte
also
granted
Ismail
and
his

certain
privileges
that
guaranteed
them
significant
income

Ismail
's
restoration
of
order
amid
instability
marked
by
frequent
Bedouin
raids
,
infighting
among
various
military
forces
and
the
brutality
of
local
administrators

gained
him
a
&quot;
reputation
as
a
resolute
but
just
and
even
generous
ruler
&quot;
,
according
to
historian
Dick
Douwes
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Douwes46-47-3">

The
18th-century
Homs-based
chronicler
Muhammad
al-Makki
praised
Ismail
's
rule
and
prayed
that
&quot;
God
give
him
strength

make
him
stand
firm

prolong
his
rule

for
seven

Ismail

Between

the

The

to
Damascus
contrasted
with
the
traditionally
short

typically
one-year-long

terms

most

The
fact
that
the
