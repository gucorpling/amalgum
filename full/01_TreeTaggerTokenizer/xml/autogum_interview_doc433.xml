has
now

Despite

On
July
13
,
unconfirmed
reports
began
to
emerge
of
a
general
strike
in
the
four

The

It
seems
like
often
,
discussion
of
the
politics
in
Kurdistan
,
whether
in
Iran
,
Iraq
or
Turkey
,
is
dominated
by
discussion
of
communist
or
guerilla
groups
like

you

moderate

Different
organisations
use
different
methods
to
raise
awareness
about
issues
they
regard
as
important
.
Naturally
,
international
media
outlets
give
attention
to
more
militant
actions
.
The
Democratic
Party
of
Iranian
Kurdistan
is
the
oldest
Kurdish
political
party
in
all
four
parts
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdistan">
Kurdistan
</ref>
and
the
most
experienced
political
organisation
in
Iranian
Kurdistan
;
we
have
in
the
past
waged
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guerrilla%20war">
guerrilla
war
</ref>
against
the
Islamic
Republic
from
1979
to
1997
,
and
although
we
are
not
rejecting
armed
struggle
as
a
method
,
we
think
that
there
are
other
opportunities
that
are
less
costly
in
terms
of
human
lives
that
are
worth
pursuing
.
</p>
<p>
We
have
always
believed
that
it
is
of
strategic
importance
to
engage
in
different
forms
of
political
protest
that
are
less
costly
in
terms
of
human
lives
;
for
example
,
in
the
form
of
general
strikes
and
other
forms
civil
disobedience
â€“
which
we
witnessed
all
over
Iranian
Kurdistan
on
the
occasion
of
the
20th
anniversary
of
the
assassination
of
the
Kurdish
leader
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul%20Rahman%20Ghassemlou">

The
PDKI
is
the
leading
Kurdish
political
party
in
Iranian
Kurdistan
;
in
the
first
rounds
of
elections
to
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majlis%20of%20Iran">
Majlis
</ref>
after
the
revolution
,
our
party
won
an
overwhelming
majority
of
the
votes
in
Iranian
Kurdistan
and
our
party
leader
at
the
time
,
Dr.
Ghassemlou
,
was
elected
to
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council%20of%20Experts">
Council
of
Experts
</ref>
,
which
had
the
task
of
drafting
the
constitution
,
as
the
only
secular
member
.
During
the
past
63
years
,
and
in
particular
during
the
past
30
years
,
we
have
shown
that
we
act
in
the
interest
of
our
people
and
as
a
consequence
of
that
our
party
is
popular
and
respected
by
the
Kurdish
people
.
Thus
,
even
though
we
think
it
is
important
that
international
media
pays
attention
to
the
situation
in
Iranian
Kurdistan
,
for
us
it
is
more
important
to
engage
in
forms
of
political
activity
that
are
of
long-term
significance
.
It
should
also
be
mentioned
that
the
general
strike
on
July
13
did
not
receive
any
attention
by
international
media
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
Islamic
Republic
has
created
a
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/North_Korea">
North
Korea
</ref>
-like
situation
in
Iranian
Kurdistan
where
not
only
international
media
cannot
gain
access
to
the
region
,
but
it
is
also
difficult
for
the
Kurds
themselves
to
inform
the
outside
world
about
their
plight
.
