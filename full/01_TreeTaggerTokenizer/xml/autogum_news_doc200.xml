Allegations
of
fraud
by
Halliburton
,
specifically
with
regard
to
its
operations
in

,
have
persisted
since
before

associations
between

</p>
<p>
Greenhouse
,
who
provided
the
bulk
of
testimony
,
spoke
for
several
minutes
about
her
involvement
in
the
evaluation
and
crafting
of
government
Army
contracts
,
and
how
explaining
how
superiors
undermined
and
dismissed
her
concerns
of
illegal
business
practices
.
&quot;
Ultimately
my
main
concern
was
the
repeated
insistence
that
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/">
Rio
contract
</ref>
be
awarded
to
KBR
without
competitive
bidding
,
&quot;
Greenhouse
said
.
She
testified
to
have
been
given
misinformation
in
answer
to
her
complaints
,
and
being
&quot;
overtly
misled
&quot;
by
KBR
managers
.
</p>
<p>
Mayberry
,
still
in
Iraq
,
testified
by
video
from
questions
prepared
by
the
committee
.
He
said
that
KBR
routinely
sold
expired
food
rations
to
the
Army
.
The
interviewer
asked
,
&quot;
Are
you
saying
that
Halliburton
deliberately
falsified
the
number
of
meals
they
prepared
and
then
submitted
false
claims
for
reimbursement
and
that
they
did
this
to
make
up
for
past
amounts
auditors
had
disallowed
?
&quot;
Mayberry
firmly
answered
&quot;
Yes
.
&quot;
He
said
that
serving
expired
food
ration
was
&quot;
an
everyday
occurrence
,
sometimes
every
meal
.
&quot;
He
explained
that
Halliburton
systematically
overcharged
for
the
number
of
meals
as
well
,
saying
,
&quot;
they
were
charging
for
20,000
meals
and
they
were
only
serving
10,000
meals
.
&quot;
Dorgan
later
commented
,
&quot;
obviously
there
's
no
honor
here
,
by
a
company
that
would
serve
outdated
food
to
our
troops
in
Iraq
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Mayberry
also
claimed
would-be
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whistleblower">
whistleblowers
</ref>
were
threatened
&quot;
to
be
sent
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falluja">
Falluja
</ref>
&quot;
and
other
&quot;
places
under
fire
&quot;
if
they
talked
to
media
or
governmental
oversight
officials
.
In
2003
and
2004
,
Falluja
had
been
well
known
as
dangerous
for
foreign
troops
and
civilians
.
&quot;
I
personally
was
sent
to
Falluja
for
three
weeks
.
The
manager
told
me
that
I
was
being
sent
away
until
the
auditors
were
gone
,
because
I
had
talked
to
the
auditors
,
&quot;
Mayberry
said
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
The
threat
of
being
sent
to
a
camp
under
fire
was
their
way
of
keeping
us
quiet
.
The
employees
who
talked
to
auditors
were
sent
to
camps
under
more
fire
than
other
camps
,
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp%20Anaconda">
Anaconda
</ref>
.
&quot;
This
report
led
Dorgan
and
others
to
voice
considerable
outrage
that
U.S.
citizens
would
be
personally
threatened
with
harm
for
talking
to
oversight
officials
or
media
.
</p>
<p>
Allan
Waller
testified
to
specific
examples
of
how
KBR
officials
had
conspired
in
blocking
Lloyd-Owen
fuel
transports
,
and
using
other
coercive
means
against
its
competitor
.
The
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British">
British
</ref>
Lloyd-Owen
has
a
direct
contract
with
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi%20government">
Iraq
government
</ref>
to
provide
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fuel">
fuel
</ref>
to
various
parts
of
the
country
.
</p>
<p>
In
his
introductory
remarks
,
Dorgan
explained
that
Senate
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United%20States%20Republican%20Party">
Republicans
</ref>
had
blocked
or
ignored
any
requests
by
Democrats
to
have
a
formal
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bipartisanship">
bipartisan
</ref>
hearing
,
resulting
in
the
need
for
an
independent
committee
.
