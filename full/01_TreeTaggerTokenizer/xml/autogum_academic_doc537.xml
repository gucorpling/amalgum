After
analyzing
the
background
and
continuous
sound
levels
in
the
Port
of
Cartagena
,
it
was
found
that
impulsive
sound
must
have
a
level
above
approximately
70
dB
re
1
µPa
to
be
detected
,
depending
on
the
frequency
(
between
80
and
45
dB
re
1
µPa
in
the
frequency
range
from
10
to
100
kHz
,
respectively
)
.
Only
one
impulsive
sound
source
was
detected
,
and
this
was
due
to
container
loading
operations
on
the
east
side
of
the
port
.
Although
this
source
is
not
usually
indicated
in
the
search
for
impulsive
sources
,
these
operations
can
be
considered
as
a
potentially
impulsive
noise
generating
activity
,
according
to
the
requirements
of
the
Marine
Strategy
Framework
Directive
.

The
analysis
of
the
bathymetric
survey
of
the
study
area
was
fundamental
in
the
application
of
acoustic
propagation
models
,
as
the
type
of
seabed
influenced
the
intensity
of
the
sound
,
due
to
the
reflections
of
the
waves
.
Also
,
having
reliable
bathymetric
information
contributed
to
the
construction
of
a
consistent
acoustic
propagation
model
,
as
the
accuracy
of
the
data
will
also
affect
the
accuracy
of
the
model
.

The
application
of
the
acoustic
propagation
model
implemented
in
this
study
,
despite
being
approximate
,
provided
information
on
the
potential
impact
produced
by
the
generation
of
impulsive
noise
in
the
vicinity
of
the
Port
of
Cartagena
.

In

this

Measurements
of
impulsive
sound
,
in
accordance
with
the
requirements
of
the
Marine
Strategy
Framework
Directive
,
which
will
serve
to
form
part
of
the
port

underwater
sound
record

Updated
and
accurate
data

The
results
of
this
study
can
serve
as
a
starting
point
for
a
larger
scale
strategy
against
the
potential
impact
of
underwater
noise
(
both
impulsive
and
continuous
)
in
the
Port
of
Cartagena
.
</p>
<p>
To
continue
advancing
in
this
regard
,
the
following
recommendations
are
proposed
:
<list>
<item>
Continuous
monitoring
of
the
levels
of
underwater
sound
in
the
Port
of
Cartagena
,
especially
during
activities
that
could
potentially
generate
underwater
noise
during
the
periods
of
high
sensitivity
of
any
marine
species
that
could
be
affected
.
</item>
<item>
Collection
of
information
on
marine
biodiversity
present
in
the
area
where
activities
are
carried
out
and
their
surroundings
.
Identifying
species
with
special
sensitivity
to
the
potential
impact
of
submarine
noise
in
the
vicinity
of
the
Port
of
Cartagena
.
</item>
<item>
Incorporating
location
systems
for
sensitive
species
in
the
port
area
,
through
,
for
example
,
passive
acoustic
systems
.
</item>
<item>
Adopting
a
set
of
preventive
and
corrective
measures
for
activities
potentially
generating
submarine
noise
,
firstly
related
to
the
selection
and
exclusion
of
areas
to
carry
out
activities
according
to
their
potential
impact
and
to
minimize
their
environmental
impact
.
Secondly
,
to
control
activities
in
seasons
of
special
sensitivity
(
migrations
,
breeding
,
etc.
)
,
including
the
regulation
of
activities
(
navigation
,
works
,
etc.
)
to
minimize
their
possible
adverse
effects
.
