A
summary
of
the
document
,
in
English
translation
,
gives
the
following
details
:
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Alonso
Pita
da
Veiga
,
Galician
,
and
our
vassal
&quot;
served
his
majesty
well
in
several
battles
including
the
Battle
of
Bicencio
and
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Bicocca">
Battle
of
Vicoca
</ref>
.
</p>
<p>
In
regards
to
the
Battle
of
Pavia
,
the
decree
states
that
Alonso
Pita
da
Veiga
recaptured
the
standard
&quot;
...
of
His
Most
Serene
Infante
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_I,_Holy_Roman_Emperor">
Don
Fernando
</ref>
,
who
is
now
King
of
Hungary
,
Our
most
dear
and
loved
son
and
brother
,
which
bore
the
insignia
of
Our
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Burgundy">
Duchy
of
Burgundy
</ref>
,
which
the
French
had
taken
when
the
standard-bearer
was
killed
”
.
This
refers
to
the
standard
of
Ferdinand
,
the
brother
of
Charles
V
,
whose
troops
fought
at
Pavia
.
For
this
action
,
Alonso
Pita
da
Veiga
was
awarded
600
gold
ducats
.
</p>
<p>
In
regards
to
the
capture
of
King
Francis
I
of
France
,
the
decree
states
&quot;
and
in
the
same
battle
,
you
accomplished
so
much
that
you
reached
the
person
of
said
King
(
Francis
I
of
France
)
and
captured
him
,
jointly
with
the
other
persons
that
captured
him
.
”
So
,
in
effect
,
Charles
V
credited
a
group
of
individuals
,
and
not
a
single
individual
,
with
the
capture
of
King
Francis
I.
For
that
action
,
Alonso
Pita
da
Veiga
was
awarded
the
sum
of
30,0000
maravedís
per
year
,
for
life
,
&quot;
above
and
beyond
your
pay
as
an
<hi rend="italic">
hombre
de
arma
</hi>
&quot;
.
&quot;
Hombre
de
arma
&quot;
was
a
term
used
in
that
era
to
signify
a
mounted
warrior
as
opposed
to
a
foot
soldier
.
</p>
<p>
The
decree
states
that
Alonso
Pita
da
Veiga
took
from
Francis
I
of
France
the
following
:
&quot;
and
you
took
from
him
his
left
gauntlet
and
a
brocade
decorated
with
four
crosses
of
silver
cloth
and
a
crucifix
made
of
the
True
Cross
,
of
which
events
the
same
King
of
France
gave
testimony
in
a
document
signed
by
his
own
hand
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
decree
then
awards
Alonso
Pita
da
Veiga
a
coat
of
arms
,
described
in
the
decree
,
that
incorporates
the
different
elements
of
his
deeds
at
the
Battle
of
Pavia
:
</p>
<p>
“
A
coat
of
arms
,
quartered
,
the
first
quarter
colored
the
color
of
blood
and
in
it

</ref>
as
a
symbol
that
you
took
said
King
of
France
,
and

;
and

are

of
the
Kings
of
France
;
and
in
the
right
quarter
with
the
field
colored
as
the
superior
quarter
and
in
it
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brocade">

</ref>
decorated
with
its
crosses
;
and
the
left
quarter
,
likewise
colored
,
and
in
it
the
said
standard
of
the
Most
Serene
King
of
Hungary
with
the
arms
of
Our
Duchy
of
Burgundy
.
