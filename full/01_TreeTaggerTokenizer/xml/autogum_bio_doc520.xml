helped
popularise
&quot;
the

as
a
nickname
for

,
due
to
her
longevity

One
estimate
placed
her
age
at

in

120

Another
ranged

Lady
Desmond
was
the
daughter
of
Sir
John
FitzGerald
,
second
Lord
of
Decies
in
Waterford
,
and
Ellen
Fitzgibbon
.
She
was
probably
born
at
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dromana">
Dromana
</ref>
,
in
County
Waterford
.
In
1529
,
she
married
,
becoming
the
second
wife
of

once
removed
.
&quot;
The
couple
had
a
single
daughter
,
also
named
Katherine
,
and
she
remained
a
widow
following
the
death
of
her
husband
in
1534
.
</p>
<p>
In
later
life
,
Lady
Desmond
was
party
to
a
property
dispute
typical
of
late-Tudor
Ireland
(
1485
–
1603
)
.
Her
husband
had
granted
her
a
life
tenancy
in
Inchiquin
Castle
,
about
5
miles
southwest
of
the
town
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youghal">
Youghal
</ref>
,
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munster">
Munster
</ref>
.
Upon
the
Countess
Desmond
's
death
the
castle
was
to
revert
to
the
line
of
the
Earls
of
Desmond
.
In
1575
,
she
passed
title
to
the
castle
and
lands
in
trust
,
by
deed
,
to
the
incumbent
earl
,

who
then
passed
it

to
his
servants

who
then
leased
out
some
of
the
land
while
preserving
the

interest
of
the

in

She
survived
far
beyond

<p>
A
legend
claims
that
,
to
protect
her
interests
in
the
castle
,
the
impoverished
&quot;
old
Countess
&quot;
set
out
from
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_(city)">
Cork
</ref>
in
1604
.
After
sailing
to
Bristol
,
she
walked
the
road
to
London
with
her
invalid
90-year-old
daughter
who
she
pulled
along
in
a
cart
.
In
the
19th
century
it
was
claimed
that
this
story
arose
from
a
confusion
with
another
dowager
countess
of
Desmond
,
who
travelled
to
London
to
petition
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_I">

.
This
countess
was
the
widow
of

James
FitzGerald
,

had

was

Katherine

husband
.
In
London
,
her
petition
was
presented
to
King

She

and

Lady
Desmond
reportedly
walked
every
week
to
her
local
market
town
,
a
distance
of
4
–
5
miles
,
even
after
her
return
from
London
in
1604
.
It
was
said
that
all
her
teeth
had
been
renewed
just
a
few
years
earlier
.
She
died
after
falling
from
a
tree
at
the
age
of
about
100
.

Historians
of
the
time
disagreed
as
to
the
type
of
tree
:
Robert
Sidney
stated
it
was
a
nut
tree
,
and
that
she
fell
,
hurt
her
thigh
,
contracted
fever
and
died
.
Another
attributed
her
death
to
a
fall
while
picking
cherries
.
She
is
believed
to
be
buried
,
with
her
husband
,
in
a
Franciscan
Friary
at
Youghal
.

<p>
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clodagh_Tait">
Clodagh

has
questioned
the
generally
accepted
date

death

citing
evidence
that
Lady
Katherine
may
have
died
as
early
as

in

married

her

the

In
fact
,
she
could
not
have
been
married
earlier
than
1505

as
her
husband

wife
,
Sheila

still
