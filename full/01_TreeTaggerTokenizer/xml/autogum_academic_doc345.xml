Microcontroller
Board
and
Data
Logger
Shield
Combination
</head>
<p>
The
microcontroller
board
and
data
logger
shield
combination
was
chosen
over
the
conventional
,
off-the-shelf
data
loggers
that
were
used
in
previous
temporary
stream
monitoring
studies
.
Unlike
the
conventional
loggers
,
the
microcontroller
board
and
data
logger
shield
combination
can
be
custom
programmed
,
which
enables
a
wider
range
of
data
logging
possibilities
.
While
for
this
study
the
microcontroller
board
and
data
logger
combination
was
programmed
as
an
interval
logger
,
for
future
studies
it
could
also
be
programmed
as
a
state
or
event
logger
(
the
interrupt
pins
on
the
microcontroller
board
can
be
used
for
state
and
event
logging
)
.
For
interval
logging
,
custom
programming
offers
infinite
possibilities
for
the
length
of
the
logging
interval
.
Furthermore
,
the
interval
can
be
programmed
to
be
longer
or
shorter
for
specified
times
,
(
e.
g.
,
during
base
or
storm
flow
)
or
to
increase
or
decrease
in
length
over
time
(
e.
g.
,
during
the
rising
and
falling
limbs
of
the
hydrograph
)
.
For
state
logging
,
custom
programming
offers
the
possibility
to
assign
custom
state
change
thresholds
,
rather
than
having
to
work
with
pre-programmed
thresholds
(
which
is
the
case
for
most
conventional
loggers
)
.
Another
advantage
of
the
microcontroller
board
and
data
logger
shield
combination
is
the
memory
flexibility
of
the
data
logger
shield
.
Conventional
loggers
often
make
use
of
built-in
memory
to
store
data
,
which
is
difficult
to
modify
.
The
data
logger
shield
,
on
the
other
hand
,
saves
the
data
on
an
exchangeable
SD-card
.
This
allows
the
memory
size
to
be
adjusted
based
on
the
needs
of
the
user
.
Finally
,
the
microcontroller
board
and
data
logger
shield
combination
is
cheaper
than
commercial
loggers
.
Not
only
is
the
combined
price
of
a
microcontroller
board
and
data
logger
shield
lower
,
but
the
microcontroller
board
also
offers
more
connections
for
sensors
,
thus
lowering
the
costs
per
sensor
.
The
overall
reduced
costs
per
monitoring
setup
allows
for
higher
spatial
resolution
monitoring
.
</p>
<p>
The
interval
logging
approach
used
in
this
study
was
chosen
over
a
state
logging
approach
as
was
used
in
several
previous
temporary
stream
monitoring
studies
.
The
advantage
of
interval
logging
over
state
logging
is
that
the
first
enables
logging
of
raw
sensor
data
.
The
availability
of
the
raw
sensor
data
allowed
for
data
cleaning
and
defining
catchment
specific
conversion
filters
prior
to
converting
the
data
into
state
data
.
This
improved
the
quality
of
the
state
data
.
In
addition
to
that
,
the
raw
sensor
data
in
combination
with
the
state
data
helped
to
better
assess
the
type
of
errors
committed
by
the
sensor
.
Bhamjee
and
Lindsay
(
2011
)
argued
that
a
state
logging
approach
is
preferable
to
an
interval
logging
approach
for
temporary
stream
monitoring
because
the
latter
would
quickly
reduce
memory
capacity
when
measuring
at
short
intervals
.
However
,
because
the
data
logger
shield
allows
the
memory
size
to
be
adjusted
,
this
was
not
an
issue
.
</p>
<p>
The
results
of
the
field
tests
show
that
the
microcontroller
board
and
data
logger
shield
combination
was
reliable
,
with
close
to
no
data
logging
failures
.
The
1.9
%
failed
data
logs
for
the
2016
field
season
were
attributed
to
a
single
microcontroller
board
and
data
logger
shield
combination
,
which
for
unknown
reasons
stopped
logging
data
for
eight
days
in
the
middle
of
the
field
season
and
then
continued
to
work
again
.
There
were
no
failures
for
the
other
microcontroller
boards
and
data
logger
shield
combinations
.
The
RTC
drift
,
on
the
other
hand
,
was
considerable
.
The
average
RTC
drift
for
both
field
seasons
was
more
than
three
times
higher
than
the
average
clock
drift
measured
for
commercial
pressure
transducers
in
a
study
by
Rau
et
al.
(
2019
)
.
Accumulating
RTC
drift
over
a
relatively
long
period
could
be
problematic
when
comparing
the
sensor
data
to
data
from
other
instruments
with
significantly
smaller
clock
drifts
.
During
the
field
tests
,
the
RTCs
were
reset
every
month
or
two
.
For
a
period
of
this
order
,
the
amount
of
RTC
drift
was
less
than
the
logging
interval
time
,
which
was
considered
acceptable
.
If
,
for
a
future
project
,
regular
resetting
of
the
RTC
is
not
an
option
,
then
it
could
be
worth
it
to
invest
in
a
better
RTC
.
</p>
<p>
As
the
data
storage
setup
allowed
for
years
of
storage
,
it
was
not
required
to
go
to
the
field
frequently
to
collect
the
sensor
data
.
However
,
to
further
simplify
data
collection
and
allow
the
ability
to
collect
real-time
data
,
the
next
step
would
be
to
add
a
module
to
the
multi-sensor
monitoring
system
that
enables
wireless
data
transmission
.
Such
a
module
was
not
included
in
the
current
setup
of
the
monitoring
system
because
it
would
have
significantly
increased
the
power
consumption
and
costs
of
the
monitoring
system
.
Furthermore
,
the
limited
reception
in
the
study
catchment
would
have
been
an
issue
for
optimal
data
transfer
.
However
,
new
developments
in
wireless
technology
will
improve
the
power
consumption
,
reception
and
costs
of
these
modules
,
making
it
more
practical
and
cost-effective
to
include
them
in
future
setups
.
