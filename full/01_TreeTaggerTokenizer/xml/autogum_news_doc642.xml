Prosecutors
claimed
that
one
of
the
potential
jurors
,
a
black
former
police
officer
who
had
once
sued
the
state
,
might
have
an
anti-government
bias
that
could
skew
her
judgement
in
trial
.
The
judge
overseeing
the
case
,
Steven
T.
O'Neill
,
decided
to
accept
the
prosecution
's
explanation
but
told
Cosby
's
lawyers
he
would
entertain
their
accusations
of
racial
bias
if
they
came
back
with
statistical
evidence
.
Of
eleven
jurors
seated
as
of
yesterday
,
ten
were
white
and
one
was
black
.
Out
of
the
100
potential
jurors
examined
,
sixteen
were
non-white
and
about
a
dozen
were
black
.
Of
the
eleven
,
seven
were
men
,
four
were
women
.
One
juror
and
six
alternates
had
yet
to
be

<p>
The

was
chosen
as
as
source
of
jurors
at
the
request
of
Cosby
's
legal
team
,
who
were
concerned
about
the
interest
that
politicians
elsewhere
in
Pennsylvania
have
shown
in
the
case
.
</p>
<p>
Judge
O'Neill
,
was
present
for
jury
selection
:
&quot;
No
one
should
make
an
effort

no

&quot;
he
instructed
the
first
set
of
100
potential
jurors
.
</p>
<p>
The
first
round
of
winnowing
was
done
by
questionnaire
.
Potential
jurors
were
asked
if
they
had
religious
beliefs
or
experiences
with
criminals
that
might
affect
their
ability
to
serve
impartially
.
Jurors
were
asked
if
they
or
anyone
they
know
has
been
sexually
assaulted
,
and
about
a
third
said
yes
.

selection
specialist
Howard
Varinsky

who
worked

and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy%20McVeigh">

cases
,
said
the
judge
would
be
likely
to
dismiss
jurors
who
said
yes
to
that
question
;
and
said
defense
lawyers
would
likely
favor
black
jurors
who
might
question
the
veracity
of
reports
from
police
officers
and
older
jurors
who
may
see
Cosby
's
alleged
victim
as
an
adulteress
.
</p>
<p>
Under
Pennsylvania
jury
selection
rules
,
either
side
may
reject
any
number
of
jurors
&quot;
for
cause
,
&quot;
meaning
either
that
they
have
some
health
problem
or
work
obligation
that
would
make
jury
service
an
undue
hardship
for
them
or
that
there
is
some
proof
that
they
could
not
be
impartial
.
Someone
who
has
admitted
to
hating
or
loving
Cosby
could
be
struck
for
cause
.
Each
legal
team
may
also
strike
seven
jurors
and
three
alternates
regardless
of
their
reasons
,
which
they
are
not
obliged
to
share
with
the
court
.
However
,
they
are
not
allowed
to
exclude
jurors
solely
because
of
their
race
or
gender
,
which
is
what
Cosby
's
lawyers
allege
the
prosecution
attempted
to
do
Tuesday
.
</p>
<p>
Over
the
past
few
years
,
about
40
women
have
accused
Bill
Cosby
of
drugging
and
sexually
assaulting
them
.
One
woman
besides
Constand
is
expected
to
testify
to
establish
that
Cosby
's
actions
were
part
of
a
predatory
pattern
.
Cosby
claims
his
encounter
with
Constand
was
consensual
and
says
he
hopes
to
restore
his
reputation
and
career
.
If
convicted
,
Cosby
,
who
is
currently
79
years
old
,
could
serve
10
years
in
prison
.
</p>
<p>
Bill
Cosby
is
best
known
for
his
role
on
<hi rend="italic">
The
Cosby
Show

,
which
earned
him
the
nickname
&quot;
America
's
Dad
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Judge
O'Neill
has
already
decided
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jury%20sequestration">
sequester

the
jury
for
the
trial
,
estimated
at
about
two
weeks
