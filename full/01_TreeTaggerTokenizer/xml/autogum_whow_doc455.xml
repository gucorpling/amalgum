Spot
a
Bad
Contractor
</head>
<p>
When
you
're
planning
on
doing
up
,
changing
or
fixing
a
part
of
your
home
or
garden
,
it
pays
to
know
who
is
likely
to
do
a
good
job
for
value
.
And
that
means
knowing
who
might
be
a
bad
bet
as
a
contractor
.
Many
people
have
had
a
bad
contractor
experience
.
These
experiences
come
in
all
sorts
of
flavors
,
from
bad
workmanship
to
unfinished
work
to
&quot;
unforeseen
&quot;
cost
over-runs
,
or
in
the
worst
case
,
the
contractor
skips
town
with
your
money
and
does
no
work
.
This
article
aims
to
point
out
the
problem
signs
<hi rend="italic">
before
</hi>
you
sign

the

<item>
Be
wary
of
a
deal
that
's
too
good
to
be
true
.
Watch
out
if
the
contractor
in
question
's
bid
was
far
below
all
of
the
others
.
This
is
a
sure
sign
that
the
contractor
is
either
unfamiliar
with
the
work
in
question
(
and
therefore
also
probably
new
to
the
work
)
,
or
has
underbid
on
purpose
because
he
intends
to
have
cost
over-runs
later
.
Another
play
on
this
theme
is
if
the
contractor
offers
a
great
bargain
in
order
to
use
&quot;
your
project
&quot;
as
an
example
,
such
as
featuring
it
on
a
website
or
in
a
brochure
.

Ask
for
references
.
Beware
the
contractor
who
has
questionable
or
no
references
and
or
no
fixed
business
address
.
Always
ask
for
references
;
if
the
contractor
does
good
work
,
he
will
have
many
,
many
examples
of
this
through
his
references
.
Any
contractor
that
does
not
have
a
fixed
business
address
could
be
a
fly-by-night
operation
.
If
you
are
suspicious
of
any
address
provided
,
turn
up
to
see
if
it
exists
before
you
sign
up
.

Have
a
written
agreement
.
Be
very
cautious
when
the
contractor
does
not
want
to
go
through
the
formalities
of
signing
a
contract
.
When
you
are
doing
any
major
work
,
a
contract
that
spells
out
what
the
scope
of
work
is
,
and
what
the
contractor
's
responsibilities
are
,
is
standard
business
practice
and
any
person
who
does
not
want
to
follow
that
is
suspect
.

Trust
your
gut
instinct
.
When
you
get
a
bad
feeling
,
trust
your
gut
feeling
;
the
guy
who
seems
like
a
sleazy
sales
man
probably
is
.
High
pressure
sales
tactics
such
as
&quot;
This
price
is
only
valid
until
I
walk
out
of
that
door
,
you
have
to
sign
this
right
now
...
&quot;
are
a
very
bad
sign
.
If
you
feel
hassled
,
pushed
,
intimidated
or
bullied
,
this
is
n't
the
contractor
for
you
.

Seek
another
opinion
.
Be
very
cautious
of
the
contractor
who
uses
scary
scenarios
to
get
you
to
buy
more
expensive
options
or
more
extensive
work
than
what
you
initially
wanted
.
If
problems
are
uncovered
during
a
project
,
they
should
be
obvious
.
Like
a
doctor
,
you
can
always
get
a
second
opinion
.

Do
your
own
research
.
Use
the
internet
to
learn
as
much
as
possible
about
the
product
or
services
that
you
want
for
your
home
or
garden
.
If
you
are
fairly
knowledgeable
about
the
product
or
service
,
you
will
be
familiar
with
the
lingo
,
you
will
be
able
to
ask
pertinent
questions
,
and
it
will
be
clear
to
the
contractor
that
you
know
what
you
want
and
this
will
scare
off
a
bad
contractor
or
can
lead
them
to
say
things
that
you
know
are
wrong
or
poorly
informed
.

Ask
people
whose
advice
you
value
.
The
best
way
to
find
a
good
contractor
is
to
ask
your
friends
,
family
or
neighbors
.
More
often
then
not
,
they
have
used
somebody
with
a
good
result
.
Be
extremely
wary
of
the
guy
who
pulls
up
in
front
of
your
house
out
of
the
blue
and
tells
you
that
you
need
a
new
roof
(
or
something
else
)
.
Best
to
tell
that
person
to
be
on
his
way
.
Additionally
,
many
locations
require
contractors
to
have
licenses
.
If
you
live
in
one
of
those
locations
,
it
is
perfectly
reasonable
to
ask
for
a
copy
of
the
contractors
license
and
insurance
certificate
.
No
show
,
no
go
.

Guard
yourself
against
possible
retaliation
.
If
you
have
fired
a
contractor
who
you
provided
a
key
to
access
your
home
,
change
your
locks
as
soon
as
possible
.
Best
to
leave
temptation
at
the
door
rather
than
let
it
through
.
