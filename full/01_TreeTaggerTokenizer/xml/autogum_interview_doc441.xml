Why
are
you
running
for
political
office
,
why
at
the
federal
level
,
why
this
party
,
and
why
in
this
riding
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
I
'm
running
for
political
office
because
I
'm
concerned
about
the
direction
our
nation
is
heading
.
We
are
becoming
more
and
more
secular
.
By
secular
I
do
n't
mean
neutral
;
secularism
is
also
a
religion
and
it
seeks
to
drive
out
all
other
religions
from
the
public
square
.
While
we
've
never
been
a
perfect
country
,
but
we
were
the
envy
of
many
and
had
become
a
safe
haven
for
many
without
religious
freedoms
.
CHP
wants
to
return
to
the
Judeo-Christian
values
upon
which
this
nation
was
founded
,
which
have
influence
every
area
of
government
,
from
fiscal
to
moral
.
</p>
<p>
The
Christian
Heritage
Party
is
a
federal
party
only
.
</p>
<p>
The
Yellowhead
EDA
has
been
my
home
since
birth
and
wish
to
represent
it
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Previous
to
this
campaign
,
have
you
been
politically
involved
?
How
will
you
apply
your
previous
work/volunteer/life
experience
to
serving
your
constituents
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
I
have
run
for
M.P.
in
the
2006
election
as
well
and
can
hopefully
built
on
that
experience
.
Locally
I
have
served
on
a
Prolife
board
and
presently
serve
on
our
Church
Council
.
In
these
positions
commitment
to
tasks
at
hand
are
important
as
well
as
service
to
others
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
As
you
campaign
around
your
riding
,
it
's
likely
that
some
issues
are
mentioned
more
often
by
voters
,
than
other
issues
.
What
would
you
say
are
the
three
hottest
topics
this
election
,
in
your
riding
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
1
.
<hi rend="bold">
Global
Warming/Environment/Kyoto
:
</hi>
</p>
<p>
The
CHP
would
offer
real
protection
for
our
air
and
water
;
solutions
that
encourage
good
,
proactive
stewardship
practices
.
We
should
not
be
involved
in
Kyoto
,
'
cap
and
trade
'
,
'
carbon-credits
'
,
or
in
carbon
taxes
.
We
should
increase
research
into
non
polluting
energy
sources
.
Let
's
solve
the
real
problems
of
water
,
air
and
soil
pollution
.
Panic
over
so-called
climate
change
,
which
many
scientists
say
is
not
man-made
,
(
scientists
often
ignored
and
belittled
by
mainstream
media
mind
you
)
could
cripple
our
economy
,
cost
billions
and
achieve
nothing
.
Instead
,
let
's
promote
and
reward
clean
,
renewable
energy
initiatives
.

<hi rend="bold">
Solutions
for
the
Economy
:
</hi>
</p>
<p>
The
CHP
would
put
Canada
back
to
work
with
a
nationwide
infrastructure
stimulus
package
that
would
fix
our
cities
,
our
highways
,
hospitals
and
water
and
sewage
treatment
plants
.
</p>
<p>
The
CHP
would
channel
dollars
to
research
and
development
to
look
after
a
real
environmental
threat
to
our
health
-
man
made
pollution
.
</p>
<p>
Eliminate
the
income
tax
and
implement
a
'
Fair
Tax
'
that
would
boost
the
economy
and
put
Canadians
in
charge
of
the
tax
they
pay
.
</p>

<hi rend="bold">
Healthcare
:
</hi>
</p>
<p>
The
CHP
will
overhaul
the
health
care
system
,
improve
delivery
of
services
and
revamp
hospital
design
for
better
health
outcomes
.
And
the
Christian
Heritage
Party
is
not
afraid
of
private
delivery
of
health
care
services
.
Neither
do
we
treat
entrepreneurship
and
visionary
private-sector
leadership
as
evil
when
it
comes
to
implementing
health
care
reforms
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Is
there
any
misconceptions
about
you
,
your
leader
,
or
your
party
and
platform
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
One
misconception
about
our
party
is
that
we
are
a
one
issue
party
,
namely
,
prolife
.
While
true
that
this
proudly
sets
us
apart
from
every
other
party
in
Canada
,
we
do
have
policies
on
almost
every
issue
facing
Canadians
:
infrastructure
,
taxation
,
healthcare
,
immigration
,
debt
and
deficit
.
</p>
<p>

There
's
a
more
ways
than
ever
to
get
your
message
out
,
from
the
traditional
campaign
fliers
and
lawn
signs
,
to
new
media
like
websites
,
Facebook
,
and
YouTube
.
The
tried-and-true
routes
get
the
message
out
to
the
masses
much
easier
,
but
digital
alternatives
are
much
more
measurable
in
how
many
are
seeing
or
interacting
with
your
campaign
.
What
seems
to
be
the
most
effective
,
from
your
experience
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
While
we
tend
to
continue
to
use
traditional
methods
to
advertise
,
we
understand
fully
the
importance
of
the
new
media
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Mainstream
media
with
their
bias
tend
to
ignore
our
party
,
we
have
found
it
to
be
extremely
essential
in
getting
our
message
out
.
</item>
<item>
Today
's
youth
are
turning
more
and
more
to
these
methods
of
news
delivery
.
They
are
our
future
