The
Brazilian
Regional
Council
of
Medicine
has
protested
against
a
Ministry
of
Education
decision
to
accept
the
diplomas
of
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Cuba">
Cuban
</ref>
medical
school
graduates
without
subjecting
them
to
a
more
rigorous
evaluation
process
.
</p>
<p>
Under
the
Brazilian
44045
Edict
of
July
19
,
1958
,
all
students
of
Medicine
,
Brazilian
or
non-Brazilian
,
who
studied
in
a
foreign
institution
must
undergo
a
strict
evaluation
before
their
professional
registration
is
granted
.
The
law
aims
to
ensure
that
the
physicians
who
graduated
at
foreign
universities
are
properly
prepared
for
and
familiarized
with
the
particular
medical
conditions
of
Brazil
.
Some
diseases
like
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/malaria">
malaria
</ref>
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dengue">
dengue
</ref>
for
example
are
very
rare
in
some
countries
but
are
more
common
in
Brazilian
territory
.
</p>
<p>
However
the
Brazilian
Ministry
of
Education
(
MEC
)
has
come
to
an
agreement
with
the
Cuban
government
to
allow
medical
students
who
studied
in
Cuba
to
go
through
a
less
rigorous
examination
.
Furthermore
the
MEC
wants
to
exempt
the
students
from
the
Cuban
Escola
Latino
Americana
de
Medicina
(
Latin
American
Medicine
School
)
or
ELAM
located
in
Havana
from
the
examination
.
Under
the
agreement
,
the
diplomas
of
ELAM
students
would
be
automatically
recognized
as
valid
in
Brazil
.
The
Brazilian
President
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luiz%20Inácio%20Lula%20da%20Silva">
Luiz
Inácio
Lula
da
Silva
</ref>
signed
the
endorsement
of
this
agreement
last
year
during
his
visit
to
Cuba
.
</p>
<p>
The
Brazilian
Regional
Council
of
Medicine
from
São
Paulo
is
opposed
to
the
idea
of
accepting
the
Cuban
diplomas
and
is
to
dispute
the
deal
in
Court
.
The
council
says
the
government
decision
is
unfair
and
disadvantages
Brazilian
students
.
It
also
says
that
the
decision
puts
the
Brazilian
community
at
risk
because
of
differences
between
Cuban
and
Brazilian
medical
education
.
Cuban
physicians
are
prepared
for
Cuban
conditions
and
necessities
in
health
which
differ
from
Brazilian
ones
.
Additionally
the
council
argues
that
the
decision
is
against
the
law
because
the
Brazilian
44045
Edict
demands
that
all
medical
students
from
foreign
schools
have
to
pass
a
careful
examination
.
</p>
<p>
The
Cuban
First
Secretary
of
Technical
and
Scientific
Collaboration
in
Health
,
Filisberto
Perez
,
recognizes
that
both
Brazil
and
Cuba
have
different
models
of
apprenticeship
in
medicine
.
However
he
believes
that
Cuba
and
Brazil
can
recognize
each
other
's
diplomas
without
difficulty
.
</p>
<p>
Early
this
year
,
a
team
of
Brazilian
inspectors
visited
the
leading
medical
schools
in
Cuba
to
evaluate
them
so
the
degrees
can
be
formalized
.
</p>
<p>
The
MEC
's
decision
has
angered
some
Brazilian
students
.
&quot;
Why
would
I
study
for
two
years
so
I
could
get
admitted
to
a
Brazilian
school
if
it
would
be
easier
to
&quot;
buy
&quot;
my
diploma
in
Cuba
?
&quot;
asks
Artur
Oliveira
Mendes
in
a
email
sent
to
a
academic
organization
.
He
added
:
&quot;
...
our
schools
of
medicine
are
demoralized
before
the
president
's
declaration
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
Brazilian
students
who
are
in
Cuba
were
selected
by
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workers'%20Party%20(Brazil)">
PT
</ref>
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist%20Party%20of%20Brazil">
PCdoB
</ref>
,
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landless%20Workers'%20Movement">
MST
</ref>
.
</p>
<p>
Senator
José
Agripino
Maia
(
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party%20of%20the%20Liberal%20Front%20(Brazil)">
PFL
</ref>
)
asked
the
Minister
of
Education
Tarso
Genro
to
explain
before
the
Senate
Education
Commission
why
the
students
from
Cuba
are
being
favoured
by
the
Brazilian
government
.
