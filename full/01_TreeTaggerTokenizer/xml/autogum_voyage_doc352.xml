Pétion-Ville
</head>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Pétion-Ville
</hi>
is
a
wealthy
suburb
to
the
southeast
of
<ref target="Port-au-Prince">
Port-au-Prince
</ref>
,
in
<ref target="Central%20Haiti">
Central
Haiti
</ref>
.
It
is
known
for
its
nightlife
and
restaurants
,
many
of
which
have
large
expat
crowds
.
</p>
<head>
Understand
</head>
<p>
Pétion-Ville
is
in
the
hills
east
and
separate
of
the
city
itself
on
the
northern
hills
of
the
Massif
de
la
Selle
.
It
was
named
after
Alexandre
Sabès
Pétion
(
1770
–
1818
)
,
the
Haitian
general
and
president
later
recognized
as
one
of
the
country
's
four
founding
fathers
.
The
district
is
primarily
a
residential
and
tourist
area
.
Pétion-Ville
is
part
of
the
city
's
metropolitan
area
,
one
of
the
most
affluent
areas
of
the
city
,
where
the
majority
of
tourist
activity
takes
place
,
and
one
of
the
wealthiest
parts
of
the
country
.
Many
diplomats
,
foreign
businessmen
,
and
a
large
number
of
wealthy
citizens
do
business
and
reside
within
Pétion-Ville
.
</p>
<p>
Despite
the
distance
from
the
capital
and
the
general
affluence
of
the
district
,
the
lack
of
administrative
enforcement
has
led
to
the
formation
of
shantytowns
on
the
outer
edges
of
the
district
,
as
poor
locals
migrate
upward
and
have
settled
there
in
search
of
job
opportunities
.
</p>
<p>
Pétion-Ville
has
more
security
than
the
center
of
Port-au-Prince
,
and
in
general
,
than
the
other
major
cities
of
Haiti
.
The
community
is
very
stable
,
with
nightlife
and
business
conducted
with
an
appearance
of
western
normality
,
in
striking
contrast
to
many
other
parts
of
greater
Port-au-Prince
.
</p>
<p>
The
hillside
suburban
town
is
filled
with
nightclubs
,
beauty
salons
,
fitness
gyms
and
French
restaurants
.
Businesses
which
cater
to
tourists
are
commonplace
,
and
parties
and
get-togethers
often
take
place
at
night
.

Pétion-Ville
(
in
the
hills

<p>
Crowded
tap-taps
(
passenger
pickup
trucks
)
and
buses
can
take
you
to
Pétion-Ville
for
a
few
dollars
,
but
can
be
dangerous
.
</p>
<head>
Get
around
</head>
<p>
Tap-taps
run
along
prescribed
routes
throughout
the
city
.
Most
routes
cost
G10
,
though
to
get
across
the
city
you
may
need
to
use
multiple
routes
,
each
of
which
charges
separately
.
These
can
be
rather
intimidating
if
you
are
n't
familiar
with
them
.
</p>
<p>
Taxis
are
typically
about
G500
and
should
only
be
used
during
daylight
.
After
dark
,
prices
rise
substantially
and
you
are
at
substantially
greater
risk
of
being
mugged
.

On
Sunday
nights
before
Carnival
,
there
are
frequently
street
parades
with
live
or
recorded
music
and
dancing
.
For
non-Haitians
,
it
may
be
safer
to
watch
from
a
distance
,
but
it
's
still
exhilarating
to
see
and
hear
.
These
can
go
very
late
(
1-2
am
into
Monday
)
