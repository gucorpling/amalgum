I
am
trying
to
make
my
home
more
energy
efficient
and
had
looked
into
having
foam
insulation
blown
into
my
attic
.
I
had
a
couple
of
estimates
but
they
were
out
of
my
budget
.
(
House
built
in
1952
,
literally
no
insulation
in
my
attic
,
just
dust
)
I
was
looking
on
my
city
's
website
and
saw
that
they
offered
a
weatherization
program
for
low
income
families
.
I
printed
off
everything
,
filled
out
the
forms
,
made
copies
of
the
required
information
(
i.
e.
:
ID
,
birth
certificate
,
utility
bills
)
and
mailed
it
last
week
.
I
just
got
a
call
from
the
city
and
the
lady
I
spoke
with
said
she
had
received
my
application
and
asked
if
I
was
just
needing
help
with
my
electric
bill
.
I
explained
that
my
bill
is
n't
high
,
yet
...
.
summer
is
coming
and
this
is
Texas
...
.
lol
,
but
that
I
was
actually
trying
to
get
assistance
for
having
insulation
blown
in
my
attic
and
just
weatherizing
my
house
in
general
.
She
said
that
she
saw
that
I
signed
that
form
and
that
she
would
be
sending
it
to
that
department
as
well
...
.
but
,
that
I
would
also
receive
assistance
with
my
electric
bill
and
they
would
send
me
a
letter
to
let
me
know
what
months
they
will
pay
and
how
much
they
will
help
pay
!
!
!
!
I
was
BLOWN
away
...
.
I
had
to
confirm
with
her
that
not
only
was
someone
from
the
electric
company
going
to
come
out
and
do
an
energy
review
for
weatherization
but
that
I
was
ALSO
going
to
receive
some
help
with
my
electric
bill
!
!
She
said
yes
and
also
wanted
to
let
me
know
that
the
weatherization
appointments
can
be
as
long
as
8
months
out
because
of
how
backed
up
they
are
.
I
told
her
I
understood
and
thanked
her
profusely
.
Just
wanted
to
put
this
out
there
for
people
.
I
've
been
in
my
house
for
almost
20
years
and
had
no
idea
that
this
program
existed
in
my
city
.

I
have
a
few
senior
citizens
that
live
near
me
in
a
fixed
income
.
They
did
this
.
The
weatherization
company
sealed
windows
and
doors
,
added
insulation
in
places
AND
provided
them
with
new
appliances
like
microwaves
,
dehumidifier
and
even
a
refrigerator
(
they
do
need
to
trade
out
your
old
one
)
.
The
assistance
program
for
their
electric
bill
helps
them
a
lot
.
It
’s
definitely
worth
applying
for
everything
you
’re
eligible
for
.
All
of
this
will
help
you
get
a
little
ahead
financially
and
was
definitely
worth
it
for
them
!
