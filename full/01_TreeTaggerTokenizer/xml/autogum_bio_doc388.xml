He
acted
as

to
Queen

and
travelled
in
Europe
studying
and
advising
other
European
nobles
.

After

Jane
moved

They
had
a
large
household
of
family
and
servants
which
Jane
had
a
large
role
in
managing
,
as
well
as
frequent
visitors
who
collaborated
with
John
on
a
variety
of
experiments
which
he
conducted
in
their
home

Jane
and
their
children
also
travelled
with

to
work
for

We
know
a
great
deal
about
Jane
Dee
because
of
the
detailed
diaries
and
records
kept
by
her
husband
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-7">

Dee
recorded
interactions
between
himself
and
his
wife
,
arguments
,
and
many
details
of
their
household
.
Such
detail
about
the
daily
life
of
a

woman
is
extremely

Involvement

<p>
Dee
's
diaries
record
Jane
's
involvement
in
his
scientific
investigations
.
He
recorded
her
menstrual
cycles
,
their
sexual
relations
and
the
births
of
their
children
,
as
well
as
investigating
their
miscarried

In
1582
,
Dee
began
to
attempt
communications
with
angels
with
a
new
associate
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Kelley">
Edward
Kelly
(
alias
Talbot
)
</ref>
who
acted
as
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrying">
scryer

.
Jane
distrusted
Kelley
from
the
start
,
and
Dee
records
several
instances
of
friction
between
his
wife
and
associate
.
When
Kelley
married
a
young
wife
,
Joanna
Cooper
,
and
,
according
to
Dee
,
neglected
her
,
this
may
have
worsened
Jane
and
Kelley
's
relationship
,
since
Jane
sympathised
with
Joanna
.

<p>
Nevertheless
,
in
1585
,
Jane
sought
Kelley
's
help
as
she
attempted
to
communicate
with
these
angels
.
She
asked
them
about
her
family
's
precarious
financial
situation
and
asked
for
help
and
reassurance
.
Dee
's
papers
record
her
petition
:
</p>
<hi rend="italic">
We
desire
,
God
,
of
his
greate
and
infinite
mercies
to
grant
us
the
helpe
of
His

Jane
took
an
even
more
involved
role
in
Dee
's
experimentation
in
1587
,
when
the
Dees
and
Kelleys
were
both
living
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Třeboň">
Třeboň
</ref>
.
Kelley
claimed
to
have
communication
from
the
angelic
visitors
Madimi
and
Ill
that
Dee
and
Kelly
should
exchange
wives
in
the
interest
of
furthering
their
philosophical
partnership
.
Dee
initially
objected
to
the
arrangement
but
was
convinced
by
the
insistent
urging
of
the
angel
through
Kelly
.
When
informed
of
the
angels
suggested
arrangement
,
Jane
Dee
objected
strenuously
and
'
fell
a
weeping
and
trembling
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
'
but
John
convinced
her
that
it
was
God
's
will
that
the
men
share
everything
.
Jane
and
John
and
Edward
Kelley
and
his
wife
,
Joanna
,
soon
signed
an
agreement
and
the
physical
relationships
seem
to
have
been
consummated
soon
after
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-11">

Some
historians
have
speculated
that
Jane
's
son
Theodore
,
born
in
1588
,
may
have
been
Kelley
's
and
that
his
name
was
chosen
to
reference
his
father
.

<p>
Dee
and
Kelley
's
conversations
with
angels
ceased
after
this
communication
,
and
their
close
collaboration
ended
in
1589
when
Dee
and
his
family
returned
to
England

Later
life
and
death
</head>
<p>
After
their
return
to
England
,
Dee
continued
to
record
details
about
Jane
,
including
their
sexual
activity
and
frequent
cryptic
notes
,
written
in
Greek
meaning
'
Jane
had
them
'
.
The
meaning
of
these
notes
is
not
certain
,
but
they
have
been
interpreted
as
meaning
that
Jane
had
dreams
or
visions
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-14">

Jane
gave
birth
to
three

Madini

Frances
in

collegiate
church
in
Manchester

Jane

Jane
was
John

second

third
wife

the
first

whom
he

Michael
(

and
Theodore

predeceased
their
mother

Madinia

Frances

of
