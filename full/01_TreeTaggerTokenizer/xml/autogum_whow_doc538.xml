A
pet
can
mean
so
much
to
a
family
.

,
fish
,
dog
,
cat
,
unicorn
,
or
whatever
it
is
,
you
can
love
them
so
much
!
Waiting
to
bring
them
home
can
be
excruciating
,
nobody
wants
to
wait
and
leave
their
new
best
friend
in
a
shelter
,
or
wherever
they
are
when
they
could
be
home
and
bonding
with
you
.
Sometimes
you
just
have
to
wait
though
,
this
article
should
help
with
that

Make
sure
everything
is
prepared
for
your
pet
.
You
want
everything
to
be
perfect
for

home
,
so
while
you
're
waiting
,
optimize
your
environment
,
and
get
all
the
stuff
they
'll
need
.
A
small
dog
might
need
you
to
fill
any
holes
under
the
fence
so
they
ca
n't
escape
,
come
up
with
where
you
're
going
to
put
dishes
,
cages
,
beds
.
so
on
.
You
do
n't

there
to
be
a
little
confusion
and
problems
when
you
bring
them
home
,
so
make
sure
everything
is
ready

<item>
When
waiting
to
bring
home
a
new
pet
,
our
minds
are
focused
on
them
.
So
whatever
you
're
doing
,
it
's
best
if
it
relates
to
the
pet
as
well
,
because
whatever
you
do
,
your
mind
will
probably
be
preoccupied
by
them
anyway
.
