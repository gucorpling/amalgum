In
the
frame
of
both
experimental
and
theoretical
studies
,
recent
technological
improvements
suggest
that
in
order
to
enhance
the
tribological
performance
concerning
the
load
support
and
friction
properties
of
the
journal
bearing
,
partial
texturing
must
be
employed
.
In
the
present
work
,
textured
bearing
with
a
rectangular
dimple
is
of
particular
interest
.
The
reason
for
using
the
rectangular-shaped
dimple
is
that
this
shape
is
able
to
achieve
the
best
performance
compared
to
other
shapes
based
on
the
work
of
Vilhena
et
al.
.
Additionally
,
in
practice
,
it
is
easier
to
manufacture
it
.
A
schematic
diagram
of
smooth
(
untextured
)
and
textured
journal
bearings
is
shown
in
<figure>
Figure

</figure>
.
The
film
thickness
is
approximated
by
a
cosine
profile
as
follows
:
(

)
where
<hi rend="italic">
c
</hi>
refers
to
the
radial
clearance
,
<hi rend="italic">
ε
</hi>
denotes
the
eccentricity
ratio
,
and
expresses
the
circumferential
angle
.
</p>
<p>
For
the
textured
bearing
studied
here
,
a
texture
cell
is
defined
by
its
dimple
depth
,
<hi rend="italic">
D
</hi>
,
dimple
length
,
<hi rend="italic">
W
</hi>
G
,
and
texture

length
,
<hi rend="italic">
W
</hi>
cell
,
as
shown
in
the
inset
of
<figure>

.
For
all
following
simulations
studied
here
,
the
texture
density
,
<hi rend="italic">
S
</hi>
T
(
the
ratio
of
the
dimple
length
,
<hi rend="italic">
W
</hi>
G
,
over
the
texture
cell
,
<hi rend="italic">
W
</hi>
cell
)
,
is
assumed
to
be
constant
and
equal
to
0.5
.
In
the
present
work
,
more
work
has
been
paid
to
optimizing
the
texturing
parameters
with
respect
to
the
improvement
of
the
pressure
profile
and
the
load
support
.
The
length
of
the
texturing
zone
and
the
dimple
depth
for
three
eccentricity
ratios
were
studied
for
two
surface
characteristics
(
i.
e.
,
with
and
without
slip
condition
)
.
With
respect
to
the
effect
of
dimple
depth
,
a
dimensionless
parameter
,
<hi rend="italic">
D
</hi>
/
<hi rend="italic">
h
</hi>
min
,
is
introduced
,
which
is
the
ratio
of
the
dimple
depth
,
<hi rend="italic">
D
</hi>
,
over
the
minimal
film
thickness
,
<hi rend="italic">

</hi>

.
The
surface
texturing
employed
in
the
present
study
is
a
series
of
dimples
on
the
bearing
(
stationary
)
surface
depending
on
the
length
of
the
texturing
zone
.
In
terms
of
the
texturing
zone
,
for
all
following
computation
,
the
dimples
are
introduced
from
the
angular
coordinates
(
i.
e.
,
circumferential
angle
)
of
,
with
the
reference
position
measured
at
the
<hi rend="italic">
h
</hi>
max
as
indicated
<figure>
Figure
1
</figure>
.
Computations
were
made
by
varying
the
length
of
the
texturing
zone
,
,
from
0
–
30
°to
0
–
180
°.
It
should
be
noted
that
for
all
computations
,
the
dimple
length
,
<hi rend="italic">
W
</hi>
G
,
is
equal
to
5
°.
In
this
way
,
for
each
interval
of
the
texturing
zone
of
30
°,
there
will
be
six
texture
cells
covering
the
specified
zone
.
</p>
<p>
A
comparative
performance
analysis
between
the
textured
geometry
with
or
without
slip
and
the
corresponding
smooth
configuration
was
then
conducted
.
The
parameters
studied
are
the
hydrodynamic
pressure
and
the
load
support
.
The
load
support
,
<hi rend="italic">
W
</hi>
,
per
unit
length
was
obtained
from
the
integration
of
the
hydrodynamic
pressure
acting
on
the
journal
.

To
determine
the
appropriate
mesh
density
for
evaluating
the
lubricant
characteristics
of
the
journal
bearing
accurately
,
the
meshing
analysis
needs
to
be
performed
.
In
the
present
study
,
for
the
calculation
the
CFD-based
commercial
software
ANSYS
DesignModeler
and
ANSYS
ICEM
CFD
were
employed
to
produce
the
computational
model
and
structural
mesh
,
respectively
.
The
computational
domain
is
meshed
with
the
uniform
quadrilateral
grid
,
as
shown
in
<figure>
Figure
3
</figure>
.
The
number
of
mesh
points
in
the
longitudinal
(
<hi rend="italic">
N
</hi>
x
)
and
transverse
(
<hi rend="italic">
N
</hi>
z
)
direction
was
varied
in
order
to
get
mesh
independence
.
In
addition
,
more
refinement
of
the
mesh
system
,
particularly
around
the
dimple
area
,
was
also
conducted
to
capture
the
presence
of
the
flow
recirculation
due
to
the
sudden
change
in
texture
geometry
.
Consequently
,
the
mesh
number
used
was
around
200,000
to
400,000
nodes
across
the
film
depending
on
the
texturing
zone
,
dimple
depth
,
and
eccentricity
ratio
.

<p>
In
the
present
work
,
as
reflected
in
<figure>
Figure
4
</figure>
the
boundary
condition
of
the
computational
domain
was
set
as
follows
:
One
side
of
the
location
of
the
maximum
film
thickness
,
<hi rend="italic">
h
</hi>
max
,
is
used
as
an
inlet
condition
and
the
other
as
an
outlet
.
The
pressure
at
the
inlet
(
<hi rend="italic">
P
</hi>
in
)
and
outlet
(
<hi rend="italic">
P
</hi>
out
)
boundaries
is
taken
as
the
ambient
pressure
,
i.
e.
,
zero
pressure
.
The
top
wall
of
the
lubricant
film
is
modelled
as
a
stationary
surface
,
whereas
the
bottom
surface
is
modelled
as
a
moving
surface
assuming
no-slip
condition
and
a
rotational
velocity
equal
to
that
of
the
shaft
.
During
the
calculation
in
ANSYS
FLUENT®
software
,
the
regions
of
cavitation
and
the
hydrodynamic
pressure
are
computed
with
the
MIXTURE
model
.
</p>
<p>
In
the
present
numerical
study
,
the
pressure-based
solver
was
employed
.
The
SIMPLEC
algorithm
was
used
to
treat
the
pressure
–
velocity
coupling
.
For
the
momentum
equations
,
the
second
order
upwind
discretization
scheme
was
used
,
whereas
the
QUICK
discretization
scheme
was
employed
for
the
turbulent
kinetic
energy
as
well
as
for
the
turbulent
dissipation
rate
and
the
volume
fraction
equation
.
In
the
present
work
,
a
convergence
tolerance
of
1
×
10−6
was
adopted
for
all
residual
terms
for
more
accurate
computational
results
.
