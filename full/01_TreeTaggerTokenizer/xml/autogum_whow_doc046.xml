How
to
Deal
With
a
Car
Maniac
</head>
<p>
We
've
all
dealt
with
them
,
or
maybe
you
are
one
.
There
are
some
people
that
eat
,
sleep
,
and
breathe
cars
.
If
you
're
a
normal
person
who
is
just
content
with
their
rust
bucket
car
you
bought
off
of
a
friends
lawn
,
they
may
seem
like
strange
people
speaking
a
foreign
language
.
They
just
know
what
they
like
to
talk
about
.
Even
if
you
do
n't
understand
why
they
must
vacuum
their
car
and
detail
it
every
week
.
</p>
<p>
Here
's
the
scenario
:
Let
's
say
you
have
to
go
to
school
or
work
with
a
car
maniac
.
Instead
of
getting
on
topic
this
said
person
will
not
stop
talking
about
his
car
,
his
baby
.
Instead
of
cringing
and
telling
him
to
go
marry
his
car
,
stop
and
think
.
(
Sorry
ladies
but
female
car
maniacs
are
very
rare
if
they
are
,
they
are
endangered
creatures
so
this
article
will
be
mostly
referring
to
car
maniacs
as
men
.
)
If
you
are
stuck
with
this
person
at
school
doing
a
group
project
or
at
work
,
you
're
going
to
have
to
try
to
be
civil
.
You
are
going
to
be
stuck
with
them
.

Steps

<list type="ordered">
<item>
Try
asking
them
to
get
to
work
and
on
task
politely
.

We
've
all
had
to
deal
with
the
two
guys
in
the
group
that
have
the
same
interests
and
no
matter
what
they
do
they
have
to
debate
about
which
type
of
cleaning
product
is
good
for
their
new
dealership
car
.
How
to
protect
it
from
UV
ray
damage
and
a
bunch
of
other
stuff
that
does
n't
seem
relevant
but
it
's
their
whole
life
.
Try
to
feign
interest
and
nod
politely
but
then
make
it
seem
as
though
you
just
remembered
we
need
to
get
back
to
work
.
Try
to
laugh
it
off
and
be
in
good
humor
about
it
.
You
're
trying
not
to
hurt
the
car
maniacs
feelings
.
After
all
,
you
still
need
to
work
together
.
Sometimes
this
may
not
be
the
greatest
way
.
If
the
person
you
are
trying
to
talk
to
does
n't
seem
to
get
the
hint
you
may
have
to
be
less
subtle
.
Sometimes
it
takes
a
lot
more
effort
to
deal
with
car
maniacs
.
</item>
</list>
<item>
If
you
're
caught
in
a
never
ending
car
story
,
which
can
happen
to
anyone
.
You
will
need
an
escape
route
.
<figure>
</figure>
Try
to
distract
the
person
.
If
they
will
not
stop
talking
keep
looking
away
from
them
.
Try
to
give
them
a
signal
that
you
have
other
things
to
do
.
Shift
your
weight
in
your
chair
and
make
it
seem
like
you
're
in
a
hurry
.
Try
to
look
at
your
phone
and
or
watch
if
the
situation
gets
really
dire
.
If
all
else
fails
try
to
say
you
have
an
important
call
to
answer
and
fake
answer
your
phone
apologize
,
then
walk
away
.
#Ask
someone
else
who
knows
the
person
you
're
talking
about
.
Mention
to
them
how
difficult
it
is
for
you
to
get
through
to
that
person
.
Ask
them
if
they
have
the
same
problem
.
If
there
is
no
one
to
ask
maybe
a
third
parties
prospective
is
all
you
need
to
shed
light
on
this
problem
.
</item>
<item>
If
you
have
n't
been
successful
yet
try
to
just
talk
it
out
with
them
directly
.
If
all
these
subtle
hints
do
n't
register
with
the
car
maniac
try
to
talk
with
them
about
the
problem
.
Try
to
start
the
conversation
in
a
light
mannered
way
.
Just
ask
them
if
you
could
sit
down
and
chat
for
a
minute
or
maybe
even
get
coffee
.
Try
to
address
the
problem
in
an
adult
manner
.
You
do
not
want
to
create
tension
between
the
two
of
you
,
especially
if
you
have
to
work
together
.
Just
express
your
concerns
over
being
on
task
and
completing
your
work
as
a
team
,
Try
to
let
them
down
gently
.
Say
that
you
like
them
as
a
person
but
they
make
doing
your
work
more
difficult
then
it
needs
to
be
.
If
you
were
on
task
things
would
go
by
more
smoothly
.
Express
the
fact
you
appreciate
his
interests
but
it
's
irrelevant
to
the
task
you
are
doing
now
.
Example
:
&quot;
You
know
we
would
be
on
schedule
if
YOU
were
n't
too
busy
talking
about
your
car
like
it
was
your
girlfriend
.
&quot;
Offending
someone
is
not
the
way
to
go
.
It
will
only
make
the
problem
worse
or
it
will
cut
off
communication
.
That
could
be
detrimental
to
your
project
.

Last
resort
is
going
to
your
Professor
and
or
Boss
about
the
situation
.
If
all
else
fails
and
you
've
tried
all
of
the
above
it
's
time
to
have
a
talk
with
someone
higher
up
the
food
chain
.
If
you
've
tried
to
resolve
your
problems
and
differences
to
no
avail
your
next
step
is
talking
with
your
boss
or
teacher
.
Explain
to
them
what
the
problem
is
and
what
you
have
done
to
try
to
resolve
it
and
maybe
they
could
give
you
advice
on
how
to
deal
with
this
situation
.
We
've
all
had
to
deal
with
differences
in
groups
.
Car
Maniacs
do
not
make
it
easy
when
that
seems
to
be
the
only
topic
they
know
how
to
talk
about
.
You
have
to
be
adult
about
the
situation
even
if
they
annoy
you
to
no
end
.
Trying
these
5
solutions
are
just
a
start
.
ultimately
if
the
issue
does
n't
go
away
you
need
to
tell
your
Boss
and
or
Professor/instructor
.
They
will
be
able
to
give
you
some
insight
to
the
problem
.
Hopefully
they
will
be
able
to
talk
with
the
person
and
get
the
problem
sorted
out
.
This
really
is
a
last
ditch
effort
.
Try
the
other
steps
before
resulting
to
this
one
.
Getting
your
boss
or
professor
involved
is
a
last
resort
.

Note

<list type="ordered">
<item>
Do
not
bash
or
offend
the
person
.
You
have
to
be
adult
about
the
situation
.
Try
not
to
say
YOU
in
an
accusing
way
.
</item>
<item>
You
cannot
use
step
2
every
time
you
see
them
.
They
will
get
suspicious
and
if
you
have
to
work
alongside
them
using
this
technique
too
often
will
cut
off
communication
and
that
's
no
good
either
.
