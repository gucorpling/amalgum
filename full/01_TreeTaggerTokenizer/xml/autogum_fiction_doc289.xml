Entering
the
living-room
,
Bud
found
Echo
surrounded
by
several
girls
from
Florence
and
the
neighboring
ranches
,
who
were
driving
her
almost
distracted
with
their
admiring
attentions
,
for
she
was
greatly
disturbed
about
her
lover
's
inexplicable
absence
.
Had
she
been
free
from
the
duties
of
hospitality
,
she
would
have
leaped
on
her
horse
and
gone
in
search
of
him
.
</p>
<p>
Echo
's
wedding-attire
would
seem
as
incongruous
as
Jack
's
to
the
eyes
of
an
Easterner
,
yet
it
was
entirely
suited
to
the
circumstances
,
for
the
couple
intended
,
as
soon
as
they
were
married
,
to
ride
to
a
little
hunting-cabin
of
Jack
's
in
the
Tortilla
Mountains
,
where
they
would
spend
their
honeymoon
.
</p>
<p>
She
was
dressed
in
an
olive-green
riding-habit
,
which
she
had
brought
from
the
East
.
The
skirt
was
divided
,
and
reached
just
below
the
knee
;
her
blouse
,
of
lighter
material
,
and
brown
in
color
,
was
loose
,
allowing
free
play
for
her
arms
and
shoulders
.
High
riding-boots
were
laced
to
the
knee
.
A
sombrero
and
riding-gloves
lay
on
the
table
ready
to
complete
her
costume
.
</p>
<p>
Bud
coldly
acknowledged
Echo
's
affectionate
and
happy
greeting
,
and
curtly
informed
her
that
Jack
had
arrived
.
</p>
<p>
She
rushed
out
of
doors
with
a
cry
of
joy
.
</p>
<p>
Running
across
the
courtyard
toward
her
lover
,
who
awaited
her
with
outstretched
arms
,
she
began
:
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Well
,
this
is
a
nice
time
,
you
outrageous
--
&quot;
when
Polly
stopped
her
with
a
mock-serious
look
.
&quot;
Wait
a
minute
--
wait
a
minute
&quot;
(
the
girl
drawled
as
if
reining
in
a
too
eager
horse
)
&quot;
do
n't
commence
calling
love-names
before
you
get
the
hitch
--
time
enough
after
.
He
has
been
actin
'
up
something
scandalous
with
me
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Jack
threw
up
his
hands
in
protest
,
hastily
denying
any
probable
charge
that
the
tease
might
make
.
&quot;
Why
,
I
have
n't
been
saying
a
word
!
&quot;
he
cried
.
</p>
<p>
Polly
laughed
as
she
ran
to
the
door
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
No
,
you
have
n't
,
&quot;
she
answered
mockingly
,
as
one
agrees
with
a
child
whose
feelings
have
been
hurt
.
&quot;
He
's
only
been
tellin
'
me
he
loved
--
&quot;
Pausing
an
instant
,
she
pointed
at
Echo
,
ending
her
sentence
with
a
shouted
&quot;
you
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
With
her
hand
on
Jack
's
shoulder
,
Echo
said
:
&quot;
Polly
,
you
are
a
flirt
.
You
've
too
many
strings
to
your
bow
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
You
mean
I
've
too
many
beaux
to
my
string
!
&quot;
laughingly
answered
the
girl
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
You
'll
have
Slim
Hoover
and
Bud
Lane
shooting
each
other
up
all
on
your
account
,
&quot;
chided
Echo
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Nothing
of
the
kind
,
&quot;
pouted
Polly
.
&quot;
Ca
n't
a
girl
have
friends
?
But
I
know
what
you
two
are
waiting
for
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
What
?
&quot;
asked
Jack
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
You
want
me
to
vamose
.
I
'm
hep
.
I
'll
vam
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
And
Polly
ran
into
the
kitchen
to
tell
the
men
that
the
bridegroom
had
arrived
,
but
could
n't
be
seen
until
the
bride
was
through
with
an
important
interview
with
him
.
So
she
hustled
them
all
into
the
living-room
,
where
the
girls
were
.
</p>
<p>
This
room
was
a
long
and
low
apartment
,
roughly
plastered
.
The
heavy
ceiling-beams
,
hewn
with
axes
,
were
uncovered
,
giving
an
old
English
effect
,
although
this
was
not
striven
for
,
but
made
under
the
stress
of
necessity
.
The
broad
windows
were
trellised
with
vines
,
through
which
filtered
the
sunshine
.
A
cooling
evening
breeze
stirred
the
leaves
lazily
.
The
chairs
were
broad
and
comfortable
--
the
workmanship
of
the
monks
of
the
neighboring
mission
.
In
the
corners
stood
squat
,
earthen
water-jars
of
Mexican
molding
.
On
the
adobe
walls
were
hung
trophies
of
the
hunt
;
war-bonnets
and
the
crudely
made
adornments
of
the
Apaches
.
</p>
<p>
Navajo
blankets
covered
the
window-seats
,
and
were
used
as
screens
for
sets
of
shelves
built
into
the
spaces
between
the
windows
.
</p>
<p>
Polly
carried
in
on
a
tray
a
large
bowl
of
punch
surrounded
by
glasses
and
gourds
.
This
was
received
with
riotous
demonstrations
.
She
placed
it
in
the
center
of
a
table
made
of
planks
laid
on
trestles
,
and
assisted
by
the
other
girls
,
served
the
men
liberally
from
the
bowl
.
</p>
<p>
The
guests
showed
the
effects
of
outdoor
life
and
training
.
Their
gestures
were
full
and
free
.
The
tones
of
their
voices
were
high-pitched
,
but
they
spoke
more
slowly
than
their
Eastern
cousins
,
as
if
feeling
the
necessity
,
even
when
confined
,
of
making
every
word
carry
.
No
one
lolled
in
his
seat
,
but
sat
upright
,
as
if
still
having
the
feel
of
the
saddle
under
him
.
</p>
<p>
Toward
women
in
all
social
gatherings
,
the
cowboys
act
with
exaggerated
chivalry
,
but
,
as
Sage-brush
would
describe
it
,
they
&quot;
herd
by
their
lonesome
.
&quot;
There
is
none
of
the
commingling
of
sexes
seen
in
the
East
.
At
a
dance
the
girls
sit
at
one
end
of
the
room
,
the
men
group
themselves
about
the
doorway
until
the
music
strikes
up
.
Then
each
will
seize
his
partner
after
the
boldest
has
made
the
first
move
.
When
the
dance-measure
ends
the
cowboy
will
rarely
escort
partner
to
her
seat
,
but
will
leave
her
to
find
her
way
back
to
her
chum
,
while
he
moves
sheepishly
back
to
the
doorway
,
to
be
received
by
his
fellows
with
slaps
on
the
back
and
loud
jests
.
At
table
cowboys
carry
on
little
conversation
with
the
girls
.
They
talk
amongst
themselves
,
but
at
the
women
.
The
presence
of
the
girls
leads
them
to
play
many
pranks
on
one
another
.
The
ice
is
long
in
breaking
,
for
their
habitual
reserve
is
not
easily
worn
off
.
Later
in
the
evening
this
shyness
is
less
marked
.
</p>
<p>
As
Jack
and
Echo
entered
the
doorway
,
Parenthesis
had
arisen
from
his
seat
at
the
head
of
table
and
was
beginning
:
&quot;
Fellow
citizens
--
