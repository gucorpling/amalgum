Besides
,
it
's
a
way
of
reclaiming
a
word
.
The
media
conglomerates
have
been
pointing
at
us
and
calling
us
pirates
,
trying
to
make
us
somehow
feel
shame
.
It
does
n't
work
.
We
wear
clothes
saying
&quot;
PIRATE
&quot;
in
bright
colors
out
on
the
streets
.
Yes
,
we
are
pirates
,
and
we
're
proud
of
it
,
too
.
</p>
<p>
Also
,
the
term
is
not
that
negative
at
all
in
Sweden
,
much
thanks
to
the
awesome
footwork
of
the
Pirate
Bureau
(
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piratbyrån">
Piratbyrån
</ref>
)
,
who
have
been
working
since
2003
to
educate
the
public
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
If
you
are
elected
,
and
have
the
opportunity
to
become
part
of
the
next
government
of
Sweden
,
do
you
intend
to
focus
only
on
the
issues
in
your
platform
(
IP
law
and
privacy
)
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
Our
current
plan
is
to
support
the
government
from
the
parliament
,
but
not
be
part
of
it
.
If
we
're
part
of
it
,
that
means
we
get
a
vested
interest
to
not
overthrow
it
,
which
puts
us
in
a
weaker
position
if
they
start
going
against
our
interests
.
</p>
<p>
Overall
,
our
strategy
is
to
achieve
the
balance
of
power
,
where
both
the
left
and
right
blocks
need
our
votes
to
achieve
a
majority
,
and
then
support
the
issues
of
whichever
government
that
agrees
to
drive
our
issues
the
strongest
.
Basically
,
we
sell
our
votes
on
other
issues
to
the
highest
bidder
in
exchange
for
them
driving
ours
.

Have
you
already
made
any
contacts
in
Swedish
politics
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
Contacts
...
I
'm
not
sure
what
you
mean
.
Several
of
us
have
been
shaking
hands
with
some
of
the
established
politicians
,
particularly
in
the
youth
leagues
,
if
that
's
what
you
mean
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
I
was
thinking
along
the
lines
of
exploring
possible
modes
of
cooperation
with
established
political
parties
—
are
you
already
taken
seriously
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
We
are
taken
seriously
by
most
of
the
youth
leagues
and
by
at
least
one
of
the
represented
parties
.
In
particular
,
which
is
what
counts
,
we
are
now
taken
seriously
by
national
media
.
However
,
we
ca
n't
tie
contacts
that
explore
modes
of
cooperation
quite
yet
—
since
our
strategy
depends
on
holding
the
balance
of
power
,
we
need
to
not
express
a
preference
for
whom
we
'd
like
to
cooperate
with
,
or
we
'd
put
ourselves
in
a
weaker
bargaining
position
.

What
is
your
position
on
moral
rights
,
as
recognized
by
European
Union
copyright
laws
:
the
right
of

,
the
right
to
have
a
work
published
anonymously
or
pseudonymously
,
and
the
right
to
the
integrity
of
the

.
Do
you
think
these
rights
should
be
preserved
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
We
safeguard
the
right
to
attribution
very
strongly
.
After
all
,
what
we
are
fighting
for
is
the
intent
of
copyright
as
it
is
described
in
the
US
constitution
:
the
promotion
of
culture
.
Many
artists
are
using
recognition
as
their
primary
driving
force
to
create
culture
.
