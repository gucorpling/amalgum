OFF
TO
THE
WOODS
</head>
<p>
WHETHER
Danny
Rugg
was
afraid
the
principal
had
seen
him
trying
to
force
a
fight
on
Bert
,
or
whether
the
unexpected
fall
that
came
to
him
,
caused
it
,
no
one
knew
,
but
certainly
,
for
the
next
few
days
,
Danny
let
Bert
alone
.
When
he
passed
him
he
scowled
,
or
shook
his
fist
,
or
muttered
something
about
&quot;
getting
even
,
&quot;
but
this
was
all
.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps
it
was
the
thought
of
what
Bert
had
seen
fall
from
Danny
's
pocket
that
made
the
bully
less
anxious
to
keep
up
the
quarrel
.
At
any
rate
,
Bert
was
left
alone
and
he
was
glad
of
it
.
He
was
not
afraid
,
but
he
liked
peace
.
</p>
<p>
The
school
days
went
on
,
and
the
classes
settled
down
to
their
work
for
the
long
Winter
term
.
And
the
thought
of
the
snow
and
ice
that
would
comparatively
soon
be
with
them
,
made
the
Bobbsey
twins
rejoice
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Charley
Mason
and
I
are
going
to
make
a
dandy
big
bob
this
year
,
&quot;
said
Bert
one
day
.
&quot;
It
's
going
to
carry
ten
fellows
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
And
no
girls
?
&quot;
asked
Nan
with
a
smile
.
She
was
walking
along
behind
her
brother
,
with
Grace
and
Nellie
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Sure
,
we
'll
let
you
girls
ride
once
in
a
while
,
&quot;
said
Charley
,
as
he
caught
up
to
his
chum
.
&quot;
But
you
ca
n't
steer
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
steered
a
bob
once
,
&quot;
said
Grace
,
who
was
quite
athletic
for
her
age
.
&quot;
It
was
Danny
Rugg
's
,
too
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Pooh
!
His
is
a
little
one
alongside
the
one
Charley
and
I
are
going
to
make
!
&quot;
exclaimed
Bert
.
&quot;
Ours
will
be
hard
to
steer
,
and
it
's
going
to
have
a
gong
on
it
to
tell
folks
to
get
out
of
the
way
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
That
's
right
,
&quot;
agreed
Charley
.
&quot;
And
we
'd
better
start
it
right
away
,
Bert
.
It
may
soon
snow
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
It
does
n't
feel
so
now
,
&quot;
spoke
Nan
.
&quot;
It
is
very
warm
.
It
feels
more
like
ice
cream
cones
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
And
if
you
'll
come
with
me
I
'll
treat
you
all
to
some
,
&quot;
exclaimed
Nellie
Parks
,
whose
father
was
quite
well
off
.
&quot;
I
have
some
of
my
birthday
money
left
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Oh
,
but
there
are
five
of
us
!
&quot;
cried
Nan
,
counting
.
&quot;
That
is
too
much
--
twenty-five
cents
,
Nellie
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
've
got
fifty
,
and
really
it
is
very
hot
today
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
It
was
warm
,
being
the
end
of
September
,
with
Indian
Summer
near
at
hand
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Well
,
let
's
go
to
Johnson
's
,
&quot;
suggested
Nellie
.
&quot;
They
have
the
best
cream
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Oh
,
here
comes
Flossie
and
Freddie
!
&quot;
exclaimed
Nan
.
&quot;
We
do
n't
want
to
take
them
,
Nellie
.
That
means
--
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Of
course
I
'll
take
them
!
&quot;
exclaimed
Nellie
,
generously
.
&quot;
I
've
got
fifty
cents
,
I
told
you
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
'll
give
them
each
a
penny
and
let
them
run
along
home
,
&quot;
offered
Bert
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
No
,
I
'm
going
to
treat
them
,
too
,
&quot;
insisted
Nellie
.
&quot;
Come
on
!
&quot;
she
called
to
the
little
twins
,
&quot;
we
're
going
to
get
ice
cream
cones
,
it
's
so
warm
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Oh
,
goodie
!
&quot;
cried
Flossie
.
&quot;
I
was
just
wishing
for
one
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
So
was
I
,
&quot;
added
her
brother
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
And
I
'll
ask
you
to
my
party
next
week
,
&quot;
the
little
girl
went
on
.
&quot;
I
'm
going
to
have
one
on
my
birthday
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Oh
,
are
you
really
,
Flossie
?
&quot;
asked
Nan
.
&quot;
I
had
n't
heard
about
it
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Yep
--
I
am
.
Mamma
said
I
could
,
but
she
told
me
not
to
tell
.
I
do
n't
care
,
I
wanted
Nellie
to
know
,
as
she
's
going
to
treat
us
to
cones
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
And
it
's
half
my
party
,
'
cause
my
birthday
's
the
same
day
,
&quot;
explained
Freddie
.
&quot;
So
you
can
come
to
my
party
at
the
same
time
,
Nellie
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Thank
you
,
dear
,
I
shall
.
Now
let
's
hurry
to
the
store
,
for
it
's
getting
warmer
all
the
while
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
ice
cream
in
the
funny
little
cones
was
much
enjoyed
by
all
.
Bert
and
Charley
walked
on
together
eating
,
and
talking
of
the
bob
sled
they
were
going
to
make
.
They
passed
Danny
Rugg
,
who
looked
rather
enviously
at
them
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Hey
,
Charley
,
&quot;
called
Danny
,
&quot;
come
here
,
I
want
to
speak
to
you
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
'm
busy
now
,
&quot;
answered
Charley
.
&quot;
Bert
and
I
have
something
to
do
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
So
have
I.
I
've
got
a
dandy
plan
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Well
,
I
'll
see
you
later
,
&quot;
spoke
Charley
.
</p>
<p>
He
had
once
been
quite
friendly
with
Danny
,
but
he
grew
not
to
like
his
ways
,
and
so
became
more
chummy
with
Bert
,
who
was
very
glad
,
for
he
liked
Charley
.
</p>
<p>
The
two
boys
went
on
to
Bert
's
barn
,
where
they
were
going
to
build
the
bob
sled
.
The
girls
,
with
Flossie
and
Freddie
,
went
on
the
Bobbsey
lawn
,
where
there
were
some
easy
chairs
.
They
sat
in
the
shade
of
the
trees
,
and
Freddie
had
Snap
do
some
of
his
tricks
for
the
visitors
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Can
he
jump
through
a
hoop
,
covered
with
paper
as
they
do
in
the
circus
?
&quot;
asked
Nellie
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Oh
,
we
never
thought
to
try
that
,
&quot;
said
Freddie
.
&quot;
I
'm
going
to
make
one
,
&quot;
and
,
filled
with
this
new
idea
,
he
hurried
into
the
house
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Dinah
,
&quot;
he
said
,
&quot;
I
want
some
paper
and
paste
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Land
sakes
,
chile
!
what
yo
'
gwine
t
'
do
now
?
&quot;
asked
the
colored
cook
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Make
a
kite
,
an
'
take
Snoop
up
in
de
air
laik
yo
'
brother
Bert
done
once
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
No
,
we
're
not
going
to
do
that
,
&quot;
answered
the
little
boy
.
&quot;
We
're
going
to
cover
a
hoop
with
paper
,
and
make
Snap
jump
through
it
,
like
in
a
circus
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Mah
goodness
mustard
pot
!
&quot;
cried
Dinah
.
&quot;
What
will
yo
'
all
be
up
to
next
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
do
n't
know
,
&quot;
answered
Freddie
.
&quot;
But
will
you
make
me
some
paste
,
Dinah
?
And
you
know
we
have
n't
got
Snoop
,
anyhow
,
so
we
could
n't
send
him
up
on
a
kite
tail
,
&quot;
added
Freddie
.
