I
feel
quite
strongly
about
this
issue
because
this
type
of
media
coverage
unfairly
stigmatizes
the
residents
of
Scarborough
and
Ward
44
and
adversely
affects
property
values
and
the
quality
of
life
of
her
residents
,
and
makes
it
easier
for
downtown
politicians
to
deny
services
for
Scarborough
residents
.

A

When
I
think
about
Toronto
I
think
about
home
.
I
think
about
my
ancestors
who
came
to
this
great
city
via
Ireland
and
the
British
Army
in
the
1850s
and
who
had
the
intelligence
to
settle
here
.
Toronto
is
where
I
was
born
and
it
is
where
I
will
live
,
fate
willing
,
for
the
rest
of
my
life
.
Toronto
literally
means
&quot;
Meeting
Place
&quot;
deriving
its
meaning
from
the
First
Nations
People
who
traded
here
.
Toronto
is
still
the
&quot;
Meeting
Place
&quot;
for
people
from
all
walks
of
life
and
ethnic
and
religious
backgrounds
and
is
rich
in
history
and
natural
beauty
.

Q
:
'
</hi>
Which
council
decision
(
since
the
2003
election
)
do
you
feel
the
city/your
ward
should
be
most
proud
of
,
and
which
was
least
desirable
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
A
:
</hi>
There
were
no
decisions
that
the
City
of
Toronto
implemented
since
the
2003
election
that
I
am
proud
of
.
Our
Ward
44
incumbent
,
Gay
Cowbourne
,
won
the
2003
election
as
a
protest
vote
against
the
former
councillor
,
Ron
Moeser
,
who
was
known
more
for
his
chronic
absenteeism
and
dismal
voting
record
than
in
representing
the
people
of
Ward
44
.
Unfortunately
,
Ms.
Cowbourne
was
not
cut
out
for
public
life
and
delegated
most
of
her
duties
to
her
paid
assistants
(
who
failed
miserably
in
the
process
)
and
voted
at
City
Hall
according
to
the
interests
of
the
NDP
bloc
at
City
Hall
and
not
for
the
residents
of
Ward
44
.
Ms.
Cowbourne
,
not
surprisingly
,
is
retiring
from
politics
and
will
not
be
seeking
re-election
.
</p>
<p>
I
am
disappointed
with
Council
for
concentrating
almost
exclusively
on
the
Toronto
Island
Airport
issue
while
the
City
of
Toronto
is
on
the
brink
of
financial
ruin
with
no
long
term
plan
to
invest
in
the
infrastructure
of
the
city
.
The
City
of
Toronto
does
not
have
the
authority
to
stop
the
Toronto
Airport
Authority
(
which
falls
under
the
authority
of
the
federal
government
)
from
expanding
their
operations
thus
wasting
precious
time
and
resources
in
the
process
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Q
:
</hi>
If
you
were
elected
as
a
&quot;
rookie
&quot;
councillor
,
What
would
you
bring
to
the
table
beyond
the
incumbent
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
A
:
</hi>
First
and
foremost
I
would
bring
a
dedication
to
the
council
position
that
Ward
44
has
never
had
.
I
will
be
a
strong
voice
for
the
people
of
Ward
44
at
City
Hall
and
will
not
be
influenced
by
special
interest
groups
or
the
agendas
of
political
parties
who
rarely
represent
the
local
interests
and
concerns
of
a
particular
ward
.
Unlike
Ron
Moeser
,
who
had
his
chance
and
failed
miserably
(
Moeser
was
evicted
from
office
by
Ward
44
voters
in
2003
due
to
his
chronic
absenteeism
and
his
miserable
voting
record
)
,
I
will
be
an
extremely
hard
working
councillor
who
will
promote
transparency
and
accountability
at
City
Hall
.
I
will
bring
both
corporate
and
academic
expertise
to
the
table
which
I
have
obtained
from
my
years
at
the
University
of
Toronto
and
my
extensive
business
background
.
I
will
bring
a
level
of
energy
to
City
Hall
that
will
be
an
inspiration
for
others
to
follow
.
