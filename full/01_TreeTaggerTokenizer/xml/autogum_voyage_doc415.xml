Boston/Fenway-Kenmore
</head>
<p>
The
<hi rend="bold">
Fenway-Kenmore
</hi>
neighborhood
is
named
after
Kenmore
Square
,
and
after
the
Fens
,
both
of
which
it
encompasses
.
Kenmore
Square
is
the
area
's
dynamic
urban
center
.
This
is
where
trains
arrive
and
shops
light
up
in
an
effort
to
entice
passing
customers
.
High
above
,
the
Citgo
sign
(
now
a
historical
landmark
)
keeps
a
watchful
eye
on
new
arrivals
as
they
make
their
way
through
these
congested
crossroads
.

Kenmore

</hi>
The
area
is
quite
urban
,
but
all
the
green
space
makes
it
feel
much
more
livable
than
you
might
think
.
Like
many
other
areas
of
Boston
,
Kenmore
is
in
the
middle
of
a
building
boom
.
The
closeness
of
the
parks
and
gardens
help
to
balance
the
city
and
nature
experiences
.

The
Fens
:
</hi>
Just
south
and
away
from
the
square
lies
the
hushed
Fens
,
a
study
in
contrasts
.
The
Muddy
River
meanders
through
rustling
reeds
and
shady
,
sloping
lawns
and
gardens
.
Rustic
stone
bridges
and
benches
offer
a
place
to
linger
,
to
admire
the
water
and
all
its
inhabitants
.
The
Fens
also
work
to
separate
Kenmore
from
the
sprawling
medical
complex
,
Longwood
Medical
Area
.
Turkeys
have
even
been
known
call
the
place
home
.
If
you
see
one
,
watch
out
,
they
can
be
mean
!

In
this
part
of
town
the
Green
line
will
usually
be
your
best
bet
,
and
<hi rend="bold">
Kenmore
</hi>
is
the
station
to
know
.
The
<hi rend="bold">
B
</hi>
,
<hi rend="bold">
C
</hi>
,
and
<hi rend="bold">
D
</hi>
Green
line
branches
all
stop
here
,
and
a
large
glass
bus
depot
hovers
above
.
It
's
also
the
closest
stop
to
the
Fenway
Park
.
From
here
the
B
line
continues
outbound
to
<hi rend="bold">
Blandford
Street
</hi>
,
<hi rend="bold">
BU
East
</hi>
,
and
<hi rend="bold">
BU
Central
</hi>
before
entering
<ref target="Boston/Allston-Brighton">
Allston
</ref>
.
While
the
D
branch
passes
through
<hi rend="bold">
Fenway
</hi>
before
entering
the
independent
town
of
<ref target="Brookline">
Brookline
</ref>
.
The
<hi rend="bold">
E
</hi>
branch
is
great
for
visiting
area
museums
,
it
stops
at
<hi rend="bold">
Symphony
</hi>
,
<hi rend="bold">
Museum
of
Fine

</hi>
,
<hi rend="bold">
Longwood

<p>
The
Orange
line
shares
the
<hi rend="bold">
Ruggles
</hi>
and
<hi rend="bold">
Massachusetts
Avenue
</hi>
stations
with
several
other
neighborhoods
,
but
you
wo
n't
find
these
stops
quite
as
helpful
.
The
E
branch
of
the
Green
line
is
closer
to
top
sights
,
however
,
the
Orange
line
can
be
a
good
alternative
if
the
E
line
is
experiencing
service
issues
.
Ruggles
also
serves
as
a
stop
for
Commuter
Rail
lines
headed
to
<hi rend="bold">
Providence/Stoughton
</hi>
,
<hi rend="bold">
Franklin
</hi>
,
and
<hi rend="bold">
Needham
</hi>
.
Another
Commuter
Rail
station
(
especially
popular
on
game
days
)
is
<hi rend="bold">
Yawkey
</hi>
,
which
serves
the
<hi rend="bold">
Framingham/Worcester
</hi>
line
.
It
's
quite
close
to
Fenway
Park
as
well
.
</p>
<p>
By
far
the
most
popular
bus
route
is
the
<hi rend="bold">
#57
</hi>
.
Running
from
Kenmore
Square
down
Comm
Ave
,
into
Allston
and
eventually
ending
in
<ref target="Watertown_%28Massachusetts%29">

Also
leaving
from
Kenmore
,
the
<hi rend="bold">
#60
</hi>
and
<hi rend="bold">

</hi>
run
less
frequently
into
Brookline
,
while
the
<hi rend="bold">

</hi>
and
<hi rend="bold">

</hi>
take
you
through
the
Longwood
area
and
the
<ref target="Boston/South_End">

</ref>
via
Ruggles
.
The
<hi rend="bold">
CT2
</hi>
and
<hi rend="bold">
#47
</hi>
busses
can
be
picked
up
in
Boston

and
take
you
over
the
BU
bridge
into
Kendall
and
Central
squares
in
<ref target="Cambridge_%28Massachusetts%29">

.
The
<hi rend="bold">

</hi>
also
runs
constantly
down
Huntington

taking
you
to
either
inbound
to
<ref target="Boston/Back_Bay-Beacon_Hill">

</ref>
or
outbound
to
<ref target="Boston/Jamaica_Plain-Mission_Hill">

Ruggles
is
a
also
a
major
bus
hub
,
fanning
lines
out
citywide

<p>
For
those
with
deep
pockets
and
endless
patience
,
take
the
Kenmore
Square/Fenway
exit
from
Storrow
Drive
and
follow
signs
to
your
destination
.
Do
n't
even
look
for
on
street
parking
,
go
right
for
a
garage
.
You
're
looking
at
around
$
15
-
20
an
hour
to
park
,
and
on
game
days
expect
to
be
gouged
$
100
or
more
for
parking
,
if
it
's
even
available
in
the
first
place
.
The
twisting
roads
,
congested
traffic
,
and
aggressive
drivers
should
all
be
steering
you
towards
forgoing
your
four
wheels
and
taking
the
T
instead
.

Not
your
typical
museum
experience
.
Modeled
after
a
15th
century
Venetian
palazzo
,
the
museum
displays
Mrs.
Gardner
's
evocative
home
as
it
was
when
she
lived
here
.
She
collected
many
masterworks
,
unappreciated
at
the
time
,
and
displayed
them
in
a
most
unconventional
manner
.
The
juxtaposition
of
artworks
from
different
cultures
and
time
periods
still
delights
visitors
today
.
While
the
museum
contains
works
by
famous
artists
like
Rembrandt
and
Velazquez
,
the
main
attraction
is
not
in
any
particular
work
,
but
in
how
each
room
is
laid
out
:
Not
only
the
paintings
and
tapestries
,
but
also
the
furniture
and
architecture
in
every
corner
of
the
building
are
valuable
works
of
art
.
Gardner
's
will
stipulates
the
works
of
art
must
remain
in
her
original
arrangement
.
This
is
the
reason
one
wall
remains
blank
,
after
an
unbelievable
art
heist
in
early
1990
.
Thirteen
pieces
were
stolen
,
valued
at
over
$
500
million
dollars
,
the
works
of
art
remain
missing
to
this
day
