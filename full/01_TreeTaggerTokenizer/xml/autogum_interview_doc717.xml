You
speak
in
the
book
about
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology">
psychology

term

cognitive

,
which
you
describe
as
&quot;
the
feeling
of
uncomfortable
tension
,
which
comes
from
holding
two
conflicting
thoughts
at
the
same
time
.
This
can
cause
an
individual
to
fight
within
their
minds
to
somehow
make
it
make
sense

Do
you
still
experience
cognitive
dissonance
when
reflecting
on
your
experiences
in
Scientology
?
Why
and
how
so
?
</hi>

<hi rend="bold">
NM
</hi>
:
I
no
longer
experience
Cognitive
Dissonance
when
reflecting
on
my
experiences
in
Scientology
.
I
have
done
further
study
of
it
and
find
it
to
be
a
common
human
ailment
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Cognitive
Dissonance
is
a
state
of
tension
that
occurs
whenever
a
person
holds
two
cognitions
(
ideas
,
attitudes
,
beliefs
,
opinions
)
that
are
psychologically
inconsistent
such
as
'
Smoking
is
a
dumb
thing
because
it
could
kill
me
'
and
'
I
smoke
two
packs
a
day
.
'
Dissonance
produces
mental
discomfort
,
ranging
from
minor
pangs
to
deep
anguish
;
people
do
n’t
rest
easy
until
they
find
a
way
to
reduce
it
.

Mistakes
Were
Made
,
But
Not
By
Me
</hi>
,

Travis

</p>
<p>
I
experienced
several
levels
of
Cognitive
Dissonance
while
in
Scientology
.
They
say
Church
on
the
door
,
but
the
day
to
day
operations
are
not
those
of
a
church
–
those
contrary
thoughts
were
assuaged
for
years
because
of
the
Hubbard
Policy
–
Religion
1970
,
wherein
he
stated
something
like
we
are
a
religion
for
accountant
and
attorneys
,
nothing
about
our
daily
operations
will
change
.
That
plus
the
line
that
I
was
often
given
and
gave
to
others
new
to
the
Church
–
it
’s
not
a
faith
,
it
is
an
Applied
Religious
Philosophy
,
non-denominational
in
nature
,
you
can
still
belong
to
your
own
church
and
be
a
Scientology
.
</p>
<p>
That
held
my
discomfort
together
until
years
later
I
read
the
Messianic
Program
,
wherein
Hubbard
laid
out
the
steps
to
make
himself
the
next
Messiah
for
planet
earth
.
</p>
<p>
Another
cognitive
dissonance
was
why
are
we
attempting
to
destroy
and
take
over
the
entire
field
of
mental
health
,
if
we
are
a
church
,
well
the
same
answer
,
we
are
n’t
really
a
church
.
</p>
<p>
When
LRH
[
L.
Ron
Hubbard
]
himself
wrote
to
me
that
he
wished
he
had
never
gone
the
&quot;
Church
&quot;
route
at
all
,
it
made
me
happy
and
erased
the
tension
of
the
Cognitive
Dissonance
.
</p>
<p>
Why
were
the
prices
so
high
?
If
we
were
supposed
to
Clear
the
Planet
,
and
help
make
the
world
a
better
place
,
then
why
did
we
charge
so
much
?
Very
few
people
could
afford
that
level
of
money
and
still
survive
and
raise
a
family
.

In
the
book
you
write
,
&quot;
I
have
studied
the
research
done
on
the
power
that
groups
can
hold
over
individuals
and
the
mindsets
and
peer
pressures
that
got
me
to
that
place
.
