Not
*another*
post
on
e-collars
?
!
But
seriously
,
help
me
to
decide
whether
to
use
an
e-collar
for
OUR
dog
!
(
Also
&quot;
transitional
leash
&quot;
)

I
've
read
dozens
of
threads
on
here
on
this
subject
and
tried
to
soak
them
all
in
.
I
also
appreciate
the
replies
I
received
on
an
alternate
post
about
leash
walking
.
Our
dog
does
NOT
have
any
aggression
issues
-
he
's
extremely
sweet
,
seems
submissive
,
and
is
generally
awesome
.
That
said
,
when
we
're
outside
or
even
inside
and
there
's
a
funny
noise
,
he
is
distracted
beyond
all
control
(
including
dangling
a
delicious
steak
in
front
of
his
nose
)
.
There
's
no
degree
of
waving
,
jumping
around
,
calling
his
name
,
throwing
raw
steak
at
him
that
will
get
his
attention
back
on
you
.
So
,
we
figured
let
's
check
out
the
local
trainers
to
try
and
get
things
off
on
the
right
foot
.
Lo
and
behold
,
there
's
a
few
highly
rated
trainers
in
our
area
(
on
Yelp
,
Google
,
etc
)
that
ALL
use
e-collars
.
So
while
I
never
really
thought
I
'd
go
that
route
,
that
seems
to
be
the
standard
at
least
in
our
town
.
I
met
with
one
today
,
and
she
gave
me
the
run
down
.
First
,
the
leash-walking
part
:
for
that
,
she
recommends
using
the
k9
lifeline
transitional
leash
(
http://www.k9lifeline.net/product/k9-lifeline-training-leash/
)
.
NO
e-collar
,
just
a
lot
of
training
on
using
that
leash
.
I
'd
never
heard
of
it
,
looks
kinda
like
the
gentle
leader
,
but
she
said
it
was
better
(
shrugs
)
.
The
complete
package
though
involves
the
e-collar
.
She
showed
me
the
one
they
use
(
https://www.educatorcollars.com/educator-et-300ts-mini.html?gclid=Cj0KEQiAiMHEBRC034nx2ImB1J0BEiQA-r7ctvjTkqkl4jdqNF1arecH_qBcwD0r_Nzqddfxiok9FbUaAjJz8P8HAQ
)
and
'
shocked
'
me
with
it
(
not
bad
actually
)
.
She
explained
that
all
the
trainers
there
go
through
extensive
education
on
proper
use
,
and
that
they
only
use
it
at
the
lowest
threshold
where
the
dog
responds
.
Honestly
,
I
left
there
thinking
that
this
does
n't
seem
like
the
worst
thing
in
the
world
.
Am
I
wrong
?
We
just
want
our
dog
well
behaved
and
responsive
to
us
in
distracting
situations
,
which
seems
like
will
be
damn
near
impossible
given
how
distracted
he
can
be
.
And
while
I
never
even
considered
that
he
might
go
off
leash
some
day
,
this
seems
like
a
real
possibility
with
the
e-collar
.
A
lot
of
the
posts
I
've
seen
on
here
have
said
that
e-collars
are
terrible
...
unless
given
the
proper
training
.
We
are
NOT
looking
for
a
quick
fix
.
I
'm
willing
to
put
in
months
of
training
with
positive
reinforcement
if
that
's
what
it
takes
.
My
point
is
,
positive
reinforcement
appears
to
have
big
limitations
with
this
sweet
pup
who
could
n't
care
less
about
the
positives
!

I
had
been
working
with
and
training
dogs
for
over
twenty
years
,
yet
it
was
n't
until
four
years
ago
that
I
learned
how
to
use
an
e-collar
.
I
won
it
in
a
raffle
at
a
dog
trial
and
being
a
positive
trainer
,
was
going
to
sell
it
right
away
.
However
,
the
idea
that
we
should
actually
learn
how
to
use
equipment
instead
of
just
read
about
it
,
seemed
like
a
good
one
.
I
went
to
a
professional
trainer
,
much
like
you
,
and
learned
how
to
use
it
.
I
love
it
.
Ideally
,
it
's
not
a
punishment
tool
;
it
is
taught
with
a
combination
of
negative
reinforcement
and
positive
reinforcement
(
negative
and
positive
has
nothing
to
do
with
bad
or
good
.
In
operant
training
,
it
has
to
do
with
adding
and
taking
away
)
.
I
have
been
using
one
ever
since
.
I
have
also
moved
forward
from
simpe
pet
training
and
AKC
obedience
to
more
intense
high
drive
sports
like
PSA
,
personal
protection
and
do
detection
(
exp
.
and
narc
,
etc
)
.
Aside
from
that
,
I
have
seen
amazing
results
with
aggressive
dogs
and
with
an
e-collar
,
dogs
can
experience
so
much
more
freedom
.
