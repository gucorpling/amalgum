Racialised
Immigrant
Other
to
Australia
</head>
<p>
One
of
the
reasons
for
immigrating
to
Australia
is
to
further
my
education
and
develop
skills
required
to
compete
in
today
’s
world
.
When
I
arrived
in
Australia
in
2010
,
I
was
particularly
impressed
with
the
multiracial
,
multicultural
and
multiethnic
landscape
of
Australia
,
the
quality
of
services
provided
by
universities
and
government
entities
,
and
the
low
levels
of
racial
violence
.
I
still
remember
how
the
custom
officer
treated
me
politely
on
my
arrival
and
said
to
me
,
‘
Welcome
to
Australia
.
’
However
,
with
time
,
I
became
more
aware
of
my
difference
and
how
it
impacts
on
my
life
chances
.
The
blatant
and
sometimes
subtle
forms
of
discrimination
that
I
was
experiencing
contradicted
the
words
of
welcome
.
Gradually
,
I
became
interested
in
understanding
the
role
of
racialised
identity
constructions
and
the
mediating
effects
of
skin
colour
on
racialised
immigrants
to
Australia
,
which
became
one
of
the
motivations
for
undertaking
my
doctoral
studies
.
</p>
<p>
As
a
black
Nigerian
immigrant
negotiating
identity
and
belonging
in
Australia
,
the
motivations
for
the
doctoral
project
come
from
my
personal
experiences
and
passion
for
social
justice
,
and
inclusion
for
individuals
,
families
and
communities
.
The
project
has
an
overarching
theme
in
social
justice
and
the
need
to
improve
conditions
for
marginalised
and
oppressed
groups
in
society
.
It
provides
a
better
understanding
of
the
experiences
of
and
the
problems-that-matter
for
some
of
Australia
’s
most
recent
immigrant
communities
.
It
examines
the
experiences
of
African
migrants
and
refugees
living
in
Queensland6
,
with
an
aim
to
develop
a
better
understanding
of
their
race
,
health
,
education
and
migration
status
and
their
everyday
life
.
By
addressing
race
relations
as
an
important
driver
of
disadvantage
,
the
project
extends
upon
existing
understanding
of
black
Africans
in
Australia
and
raises
more
questions
for
building
a
more
integrated
,
just
and
socially
inclusive
Australia
where
all
are
given
a
fair
go
.
The
empirical
investigation
utilises
both
qualitative
and
quantitative
methods
of
data
collection
to
allow
a
useful
analysis
of
some
of
the
complexities
of
the
challenging
topic
.
The
theoretical
approach
synthesises
concepts
from
critical
perspectives
from
across
the
humanities
,
health
and
social
sciences
.
The
project
sheds
light
on
the
circumstances
of
African
immigrants
in
Australia
,
making
a
useful
contribution
to
practice
,
public
policy
,
social
and
community
services
and
the
growing
body
of
work
that
seeks
to
better
understand
how
to
work
with
marginalised
communities
in
Australia
.
</p>
<p>
I
began
the
project
wanting
to
learn
more
about
the
black
African
experience
in
Australia
as
racialised
black
subjects
.
Though
I
have
lived
the
very
experiences
I
wanted
to
research
,
the
motivation
to
undertake
the
research
project
should
not
be
seen
as
lacking
objectivity
.
Rather
,
my
doctoral
project
highlights
my
passion
for
social
change
,
justice
,
equality
,
inclusion
and
human
rights
.
Even
when
I
was
doing
the
research
,
some
members
of
the
African
community
,
including
some
participants
,
were
worried
not
just
about
the
outcome
of
the
research
,
but
also
about
what
will
happen
to
me
and
other
black
Africans
in
Australia
for
doing
the
research
.
For
example
,
a
participant
,
Loretta
,
asked
:
“
<hi rend="italic">
Why
did
you
choose
this
topic
?
</hi>
”
This
question
was
not
because
the
topic
appeared
irrelevant
to
her
,
but
she
was
a
bit
afraid
that
I
might
wake
up
the
sleeping
lion
to
my
detriment
and
the
detriment
of
other
black
Africans
in
Australia
.
While
another
participant
,
Aaron
,
told
me
that
my
project
“
<hi rend="italic">
is
very
interesting
,
”
</hi>
he
cautioned
me
.
He
said
,
<hi rend="italic">
“
You
do
not
have
to
take
all
I
have
said
…
You
have
to
be
careful
.
You
have
to
be
eclectic
.
Ph.D.
is
not
an
end
;
Ph.D.
is
just
a
means
.
</hi>
”
Another
participant
,
Ricky
,
advised
me
.
In
Ricky
’s
own
words
,
“
<hi rend="italic">
What
I
might
advise
you
to
do
is
to
make
the
blame
for
them
not
to
be
as
hard
,
to
see
the
truth
in
a
way
that
they
may
understand
it
.
Even
though
the
truth
is
quite
hard
and
bitter
at
times
,
but
it
needs
to
be
said
.
We
are
here
now
in
Australia
and
some
of
us
believed
that
this
is
our
home
.
”
</hi>
If
not
for
my
passion
and
interest
in
social
justice
,
social
inclusion
and
and
human
rights
,
I
would
not
have
gone
into
nor
continued
nor
completed
my
doctoral
studies
.
Given
the
fears
and
concerns
in
the
community
about
my
health
and
well-being
,
and
about
how
white
Australians
would
react
,
including
the
admonitions
that
I
received
for
even
trying
to
investigate
the
lived
experiences
of
racialised
black
Africans
in
Australia
,
I
was
really
close
to
quitting
my
doctoral
project
.
