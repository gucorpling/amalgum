Principle

Apply
the
principle
of
Truth
.
Fight
your
own
inner
demons
,
fear
and
insecurities
.
Everyone
is
unique
in
this
world
and
therefore
,
one
should
not
compare
with
others
.
Be
honest
with
yourself
of
who
you
are
and
what
you
want
.
If
you
think
there
is
something
to
fix
,
then
fix
it
.

Practice
nonviolence
.
Control
your
temper
and
also
your
thoughts
.
What
we
think
,
we
become
and
therefore
if
you
always
are
thinking
of
hurting
someone
or
feeling
extremely
angry
at
someone
,
those
are
the
vibes
you
'll
be
giving
to
others
.
Best
way
to
be
nonviolent
is
to
think
positively
and
believe
that
whatever
happens
is
for
a
good
reason
.
Nonviolence
and
forgiveness
are
the
higher
calling
of
virtue
.

Resist
eating
meat
.
Not
everyone
can
resist
meat
,
but
you
can
control
your
consumption
.
For
health
reasons
,
avoiding
eating
a
lot
of
red
meat
is
a
good
idea
.

Avoid
premarital
sex
.
Many
of
us
want
to
get
married
and
have
children
or
be
intimate
with
someone
.
Therefore
,
practicing
brahmacharya
might
not
be
possible
.
However
,
you
ought
not
think
of
the
opposite
sex
as
an
object
.
You
could
also
wait
to
be
intimate
with
someone
till
after
marriage
.
Gandhi
's
life
is
known
to
not
be
a
good
example
of
sexual
purity
,
as
he
used
his
position
to
sexually
exploit
young
women
.
This
fact
,
along
with
his
views
about
racial
purity
,
help
us
to
view
Gandhi
as
a
flawed
man
.
However
,
we
cannot
let
the
imperfections
of
men
and
women
deter
us
from
pursuing
high
ideals
and
sound
principles
.
Principles
stand
on
their
own
merit
,
regardless
of
any
individual
's
life
or
level
of
moral
uprightness
.

Avoid
consuming
more
than
you
need
.
Life
in
western
countries
tends
to
be
quite
fast
.
Do
you
need
the
latest
fashion
clothing
or
can
you
wear
the
clothes
you
already
have
?
Do
you
need
50-100
pairs
of
shoes
?
Do
you
need
the
latest
gadgets
?
Do
you
need
a
brand
new
BMW
?
Simplicity
does
n't
mean
foregoing
all
your
desires
,
but
not
buying
something
right
away
or
something
you
do
n't
really
need
.
Simplicity
also
means
being
happy
with
what
you
are
given
and
have
.

Have
faith
.
You
do
n't
have
to
believe
in
God
,
but
it
is
good
to
believe
that
everyone
has
equal
inherent
value
-
you
are
no
less
or
more
than
someone
else
.
It
is
about
knowing
your
values
,
ethics
and
morals
.
Faith
is
not
following
others
blindly
-
especially
when
someone
else
is
doing
something
that
your
heart
says
is
not
right
.
