Teaching
career
</head>
<p>
Speaking
of
her
teaching
career
in
high
school
,
she
always
broke
from
tradition
and
followed
her
own
creative
approach
to
her
work
,
like
preparing
materials
way
out
of
the
text
books
,
taking
after
school
lessons
and
designing
unconventional
science
labs
.
The
results
that
followed
always
proved
outstanding
:
one
hundred
percent
students
sailed
through
exams
when
barely
forty
percent
made
it
before
she
taught
the
class
.
And
this
miracle
indeed
happened
in
a
school
at
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Bronx">
South
Bronx
</ref>
,
considered
one
of
the
poorest
congressional
districts
in
New
York

Giving
back
to
the
community
is
something
I
've
always
felt
really
strongly
about
.
I
believe
in
karma
,
that
if
you
put
positive
energy
out
into
the
Universe
,
you
are
creating
positive
energy
in
your
own
life

She
believes
that
