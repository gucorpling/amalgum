CHAPTER
VIII
.
A
QUESTION
OF
NERVE
</head>
<p>
“
That
was
your
victory
,
Miss
Stevens
.
Allow
me
to
congratulate
you
.
”
If
Thurston
showed
any
ill
grace
in
his
tone
it
was
without
intent
.
But
it
did
seem
unfortunate
that
just
as
he
was
waxing
eloquent
and
felt
sure
of
himself
and
something
of
a
hero
,
Mona
should
push
him
aside
as
though
he
were
of
no
account
and
disperse
a
bunch
of
angry
cowboys
with
half
a
dozen
words
.
</p>
<p>
She
looked
at
him
with
her
direct
,
blue-gray
eyes
,
and
smiled
.
And
her
smile
had
no
unpleasant
uplift
at
the
corners
;
it
was
the
dimply
,
roguish
smile
of
the
pastel
portrait
only
several
times
nicer
.
Re
could
hardly
believe
it
;
he
just
opened
his
eyes
wide
and
stared
.
When
he
came
to
a
sense
of
his
rudeness
,
Mona
was
back
in
the
kitchen
helping
with
the
supper
dishes
,
just
as
though
nothing
had
happened
--
unless
one
observed
the
deep
,
apple-red
of
her
cheeks
--
while
her
mother
,
who
showed
not
the
faintest
symptoms
of
collapse
,
flourished
a
dish
towel
made
of
a
bleached
flour
sack
with
the
stamp
showing
a
faint
pink
and
blue
XXXX
across
the
center
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
knew
all
the
time
they
would
n't
do
anything
when
it
came
right
to
the
point
,
”
she
declared
.
“
Bless
their
hearts
,
they
thought
they
would
--
but
they
're
too
soft-hearted
,
even
when
they
are
mad
.
If
yuh
go
at
'
em
right
yuh
can
talk
'
em
over
easy
.
It
done
me
good
to
hear
yuh
talk
right
up
to
'
em
,
Bud
.
”
Mrs.
Stevens
had
called
hi
Bud
from
the
first
time
she
laid
eyes
on
him
.
“
That
's
all
under
the
sun
they
needed
--
just
somebody
to
set
'
em
thinking
about
the
other
side
.
You
're
a
real
good
speaker
;
seems
to
me
you
ought
to
study
to
be
a
preacher
.
”
</p>
<p>
Thurston
's
face
turned
red
.
But
presently
he
forgot
everything
in
his
amazement
,
for
Mona
the
dignified
,
Mona
of
the
scornful
eyes
and
the
chilly
smile
,
actually
giggled
--
giggled
like
any
ordinary
girl
,
and
shot
him
a
glance
that
had
in
it
pure
mirth
and
roguish
teasing
,
and
a
dash
of
coquetry
.
He
sat
down
and
giggled
with
her
,
feeling
idiotically
happy
and
for
no
reason
under
the
sun
that
he
could
name
.
</p>
<p>
He
had
promised
his
conscience
that
he
would
go
home
to
the
Lazy
Eight
in
the
morning
,
but
he
did
n't
;
he
somehow
contrived
,
overnight
,
to
invent
a
brand
new
excuse
for
his
conscience
to
swallow
or
not
,
as
it
liked
.
Hank
Graves
had
the
same
privilege
;
as
for
the
Stevens
trio
,
he
blessed
their
hospitable
souls
for
not
wanting
any
excuse
whatever
for
his
staying
.
They
were
frankly
glad
to
have
him
there
;
at
least
Mrs.
Stevens
and
Jack
were
.
As
for
Mona
,
he
was
not
so
sure
,
but
he
hoped
she
did
n't
mind
.
</p>
<p>
This
was
the
reason
inspired
by
his
great
desire
:
he
was
going
to
write
a
story
,
and
Mona
was
unconsciously
to
furnish
the
material
for
his
heroine
,
and
so
,
of
course
,
he
needed
to
be
there
so
that
he
might
study
his
subject
.
That
sounded
very
well
,
to
himself
,
but
to
Hank
Graves
,
for
some
reason
,
it
seemed
very
funny
.
When
Thurston
told
him
,
Hank
was
taken
with
a
fit
of
strangling
that
turned
his
face
a
dark
purple
.
Afterward
he
explained
brokenly
that
something
had
got
down
his
Sunday
throat
--
and
Thurston
,
who
had
never
heard
of
a
man
's
Sunday
throat
,
eyed
him
with
suspicion
.
Hank
blinked
at
him
with
tears
still
in
his
quizzical
eyes
and
slapped
him
on
the
back
,
after
the
way
of
the
West
--
and
any
other
enlightened
country
where
men
are
not
too
dignified
to
be
their
real
selves
--
and
drawled
,
in
a
way
peculiar
to
himself
:
</p>
<p>
“
That
's
all
right
,
Bud
.
You
stay
right
here
as
long
as
yuh
want
to
.
I
do
n't
blame
yuh
--
if
I
was
you
I
'd
want
to
spend
a
lot
uh
time
studying
this
particular
brand
uh
female
girl
myself
.
She
's
out
uh
sight
,
Bud
--
and
I
do
n't
believe
any
uh
the
boys
has
got
his
loop
on
her
so
far
;
though
I
could
name
a
dozen
or
so
that
would
be
tickled
to
death
if
they
had
.
You
just
go
right
ahead
and
file
your
little
,
old
claim
--
”
</p>
<p>
“
You
're
getting
things
mixed
,
”
Thurston
interrupted
,
rather
testily
.
“
I
'm
not
in
love
with
her
.
I
,
well
,
it
's
like
this
:
if
you
were
going
to
paint
a
picture
of
those
mountains
off
there
,
you
'd
want
to
be
where
you
could
look
at
them
--
would
n't
you
?
You
would
n't
necessarily
want
to
--
to
own
them
,
just
because
you
felt
they
'd
make
a
fine
picture
.
Your
interest
would
be
,
er
,
entirely
impersonal
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Uh-huh
,
”
Hank
agreed
,
his
keen
eyes
searching
Phil
's
face
amusedly
.
</p>
<p>
“
Therefore
,
it
does
n't
follow
that
I
'm
getting
foolish
about
a
girl
just
because
I
--
hang
it
!
what
the
Dickens
makes
you
look
at
a
fellow
that
way
?
You
make
me
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Uh-huh
,
”
said
Hank
again
,
smoothing
the
lower
half
of
his
face
with
one
hand
.
“
You
're
a
mighty
nice
little
boy
,
Bud
.
I
'll
bet
Mona
thinks
so
,
too
and
when
yuh
get
growed
up
you
'll
know
a
whole
lot
more
than
yuh
do
right
now
.
Well
,
I
guess
I
'll
be
moving
.
When
yuh
get
that
--
er
--
story
done
,
you
'll
come
back
to
the
ranch
,
I
reckon
.
Be
good
.
”
</p>
<p>
Thurston
watched
him
ride
away
,
and
then
flounced
,
oh
,
men
do
flounce
at
times
,
in
spirit
,
if
not
in
deed
;
and
there
would
be
no
lack
of
the
deed
if
only
they
wore
skirts
that
could
rustle
indignantly
in
sympathy
with
the
wearer
--
to
his
room
.
Plainly
,
Hank
did
not
swallow
the
excuse
any
more
readily
than
did
his
conscience
.
