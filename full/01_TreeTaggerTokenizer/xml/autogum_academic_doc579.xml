<p>
In
inverter
grid
supporting
mode
,
there
is
power
interaction
with
host
grid
which
involves
power
exchange
.
The
equivalent
power
flow
diagram
between
the
inverter-based
microgrid
and
the
host
grid
is
shown
in
<figure>
Figure

</figure>
,
where
<hi rend="italic">
vi
</hi>
signifies
the
VSI
voltage
and
<hi rend="italic">
vg
</hi>
represents
the
grid
voltage
.
Similarly
,
the
inherent
impedances
of
the
inverter
and
its
filter
circuit
are
lumped
together
as
<hi rend="italic">
Zi
</hi>
while
the
grid
impedance
is
represented
as
<hi rend="italic">
Zg
</hi>
.
The
load
current
and
impedance
are
signified
by
<hi rend="italic">
IL
</hi>
and
<hi rend="italic">
ZL
</hi>
.
These
aforementioned
impedances
are
typically
inductive
owing
to
the
significant
output
inductance
of
the
VSI
.
Nevertheless
,
this
inverter
impedance
can
be
greatly
influenced
by
the
type
of
control
strategy
employed
,
and
grid
impedance
is
highly
resistive
in
low-voltage
distribution
feeder
lines
.
Similarly
,
the
impedance
(
resistance
and
inductive
reactance
)
of
the
grid
is
significantly
present
and
taken
into
consideration
in
microgrids
located
at
a
long
distance
away
far
from
the
host
grid
.
Consequently
,
this
work
put
into
consideration
the
line
impedance
of
the
grid
.
In
line
with
the
stipulation
of
the
grid
codes
,
only
reactive
current
is
injected
all
through
the
period
of
voltage
sag
.
Consequently
,
the
resulting
compensating
voltage
is
relatively
in
phase
with
the
grid
voltage
.

Switched
Inductance
:
Sizing
and
Switching
</head>
<p>
A
microgrid
is
to
ensure
required
uninterrupted
supply
of
quality
power
to
the
local
sensitive
loads
besides
fulfilling
FRT
requirement
of
reactive
power
support
in
the
event
of
disturbance
on
the
main
grid
.
In
this
work
,
this
is
ensured
by
ascertaining
that
all
the
sections
in
the
microgrid
are
supplied
with
a
constant
voltage
at
a
regular
frequency
.
The
proposed
scheme
in
<figure>
Figure
5
</figure>
shows
the
implementation
of
this
requirement
through
an
additional
reactive
power
injection
.
The
VSI
injects
a
significantly
high
amount
of
reactive
power
in
supporting
the
utility
grid
and
sustain
microgrid
load
voltages
since
the
grid
impedance
is
usually
low
.
However
,
the
aforementioned
secondary
control
based
LVRT
schemes
are
significantly
limited
in
voltage
sag
compensation
.
To
tackle
this
problem
,
a
PCC
voltage
moderation
scheme
based
on
PI
control
using
the
DSC
positive
and
negative
is
introduced
.
Furthermore
,
under
a
strong
(
stiff
)
main
grid
connection
,
independent
control
of
the
point
of
common
coupling
voltage
and
by
extension
microgrid
voltage
is
not
sufficient
for
good
power
quality
since
the
host
grid
imposes
the
voltage
.
Thus
,
control
strategies
may
not
be
able
to
effectively
restore
the
network
voltage
especially
at
the
PCC
.
Hence
,
a
switched
inductance
is
inserted
in
series
at
the
PCC
to
the
main
network
during
a
voltage
disturbance
to
increase
the
network
impedance
to
independently
regulate
the
microgrid
voltage
irrespective
of
the
host
grid
condition
.
Thus
,
sustaining
the
PCC
voltage
at
the
rated
magnitude
.
</p>
<p>
The
appropriate
sizing
and
switching
of
this
inductance
ensure
sustained
microgrid
voltage
irrespective
of
a
host
grid
disturbance
.
The
inductance
size
is
estimated
in
relation
to
the
voltage
sag
in
the
worst-case
scenario
which
must
be
compensated
at
PCC
.
It
also
depends
on
the
expected
current
flow
through
the
inductance
under
voltage
sag
.
The
balance
between
microgrid
generated
power
(
active
and
reactive
)
and
the
local
load
consumption
determines
the
current
flow
(
magnitude
and
phase
angle
)
through
the
inductance
during
grid
disturbance
.
In
the
proposed
strategy
of
this
work
,
during
the
grid
fault
,
the
total
microgrid
generated
active
power
is
commensurate
with
the
rated
local
load
capacity
to
limit
the
amplitude
of
the
current
flow
into
the
main
grid
.
However
,
excess
active
power
may
still
be
supplied
to
the
main
grid
due
to
varying
load
demand
and
this
affects
the
inductance
size
.
To
estimate
required
value
for
the
series
inductance
,
the
load
demand
is
assumed
to
be
zero
and
the
rated
load
power
is
assumed
generated
and
supplied
to
the
host
grid
.
The
phasor
diagram
of
this
estimation
is
presented
in
<figure>
Figure

</figure>
,
where
<hi rend="italic">
Vg
</hi>
represents
the
phase
voltage
of
the
host
grid
,
<hi rend="italic">
Vmg
</hi>
represents
phase
voltage
within
the
microgrid
.
Similarly
,
<hi rend="italic">
Xn
</hi>
signifies
needed
switched
inductive
reactance
while
<hi rend="italic">
In
</hi>
signifies
current
flow
across
<hi rend="italic">
Xn
</hi>
.
The
inverter
voltage
is
therefore
given
by
(

)
</p>
<p>
Consequently
,
the
value
of
the
series
inductance
is
determined
by
solving
the
quadratic
equation
generated
by
making
the
<hi rend="italic">
Xn
</hi>
the
subject
of
the
formula
in
Equation
(

.
It
is
therefore
given
as
(

<p>
The
inverter
current

Ii

is
in
phase
with
the
current
flowing
through

,
hence
