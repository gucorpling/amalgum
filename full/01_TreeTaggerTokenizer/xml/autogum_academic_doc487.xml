What
do
the
Clinical
Data
Teach
Us
?
</head>
<p>
As
discussed
above
,
the
great
majority
of
the
radiobiological
investigations
have
been
done
with
very
radioresistant
and
hyper-radiosensitive
cells
.
However
,
the
hyper-radiosensitive
and
hyper-radioresistant
cellular
models
are
not
representative
of
the
clinical
reality
.
For
example
,
there
is
no
known
human
genetic
syndromes
caused
by
mutations
of
Ku
or
DNA-PKcs
proteins
,
the
major
NHEJ
actors
.
The
only
human
case
of
gross
defect
in
NHEJ
function
to
non-viability
was
caused
by
mutations
of
DNA
ligase
IV
(
LIG4
)
.
The
majority
of
cases
of
fatal
post-radiotherapy
events
were
encountered
after
whole-body
irradiation
of
children
with
ataxia
telangiectasia
(
AT
)
caused
by
homozygous
<hi rend="italic">
ATM
</hi>
mutations
during
their
anti-leukemia
or
lymphoma
treatment
.
It
is
important
to
note
that
AT
frequency
is
of
about
1/100,000
.
By
contrast
,
about
5
%
–
20
%
cancer
of
patients
treated
by
radiotherapy
exhibit
post-radiotherapy
tissue
reactions
that
can
be
considered
as
moderate
radiosensitivity
.
Surprisingly
,
no
or
very
few
rodent
cells
with
moderate
radiosensitivity
have
been
the
subject
of
a
published
radiobiological
characterization
.
Interestingly
,
some
of
the
proteins
whose
mutations
are
responsible
for
these
syndromes
were
cited
as
components
of
the
different
variants
of
A-NHEJ
(
see
Section
4
)
.
In
addition
,
some
genetic
syndromes
,
associated
or
not
with
cancer
proneness
,
different
from
the
precited
ones
,
also
show
a
moderate
radiosensitivity
:
this
is
notably
the
case
of
neurofibromatosis
,
Huntington
’s
chorea
,
and
tuberous
sclerosis
syndromes
.
It
must
be
stressed
that
these
syndromes
are
caused
by
mutations
of
cytoplasmic
proteins
,
which
may
contradict
the
historical
hypothesis
that
nucleus
is
the
most
radiosensitive
part
of
the
cell
(
see
the
Introduction
)
.
Furthermore
,
it
also
contradicts
the
hypothesis
that
defect
of
DSB
repair
is
the
unique
cause
of
cellular
radiosensitivity
.
The
question
of
how
to
build
a
unified
model
that
would
describe
both
hyper-radiosensitivity
observed
in
<hi rend="italic">
LIG4
</hi>
-
and
<hi rend="italic">
ATM
</hi>
-mutated
cells
and
moderate
radiosensitivity
caused
by
impairment
of
alternative
signaling
and
DSB
repair
pathways
remains
.
</p>
<p>
To
date
,
the
ATM
protein
has
been
considered
as
an
early
actor
of
the
DSB
recognition
via
its
phosphorylation
of
H2AX
and
the
individual
radiation
response
.
Surprisingly
,
ATM
has
not
been
integrated
in
all
the
DSB
repair
models
discussed
above
while
mutations
of
RAD51
and
RAD52
(
for
HR
)
and
Ku
and
DNA-PKcs
(
for
NHEJ
)
do
not
cause
any
viable
syndromes
in
humans
(
<figure>
Figure
1
</figure>
)
.
Recently
,
the
delay
in
the
radiation-induced
nucleo-shuttling
of
ATM
protein
(
RIANS
)
was
shown
to
be
a
reliable
parameter
for
predicting
radiosensitivity
and
to
provide
a
biologically
relevant
interpretation
of
the
linear-quadratic
model
,
the
mathematical
basis
of
the
cellular
radiation
response
.
In
the
context
of
the
RIANS
model
,
the
following
mechanistic
hypothesis
has
been
proposed
:
after
irradiation
,
cytoplasmic
trans-auto-phosphorylated
dimeric
forms
of
ATM
become
monomeric
and
diffuse
to
the
nucleus
.
In
the
nucleus
,
active
ATM
monomers
phosphorylate
H2AX
molecules
at
DSB
sites
,
which
activates
NHEJ
.
The
ATM
monomers
will
re-dimerize
during
the
DSB
repair
process
.
Once
in
nucleus
,
ATM
may
also
inhibit
MRE11
nuclease
activity
or
any
other
actor
responsible
for
genomic
instability
.
By
contrast
,
in
cells
with
moderate
radiosensitivity
,
over-expressed
ATM
substrates
may
delay
the
RIANS
,
thereby
favoring
cancer
proneness
and
aging
.
This
is
notably
the
case
for
huntingtin
,
neurofibromin
,
and
tuberin
.
(
<figure>
Figure
6
</figure>
)
.
</p>
<p>
Three
groups
of
radiosensitivity
have
been
defined
:
</p>
<p>
Group
I
(
about
75
%
to
85
%
whole
population
)
represents
the
normosensitive
(
radioresistant
)
patients
with
a
rapid
RIANS
after
2
Gy
,
a
low
risk
of
post-radiotherapy
tissue
reaction
and
of
cancer
</p>
<p>
Group
II
(
about
5
–
20
%
of
whole
population
)
represents
the
patients
who
elicit
a
moderate
radiosensitivity
with
a
delay
in
the
RIANS
due
to
the
sequestration
of
ATM
by
mutated
and
over-expressed
substrates
.
These
patients
are
moderately
radiosensitive
and
may
have
a
high
risk
of
cancer
or
neurodegeneration
.
</p>
<p>
Group
III
(
&lt;1
%
whole
population
)
represents
the
<hi rend="italic">
ATM
</hi>
-mutated
patients
with
no
functional
ATM
kinase
or
those
who
show
strong
DSB
repair
defects
(
like
the
<hi rend="italic">
LIG4
</hi>
-mutated
patient
described
above
)
,
hyper-radiosensitivity
,
and
either
high
cancer
proneness
or
severe
accelerated
aging
.
</p>
<p>
While
it
provides
relevant
explanation
of
the
radiosensitivity
of
syndromes
caused
by
mutations
of
cytoplasmic
proteins
,
the
RIANS
model
appears
to
be
compatible
with
all
the
alternative
models
,
as
ATM
is
upstream
of
all
the
cascades
of
radiation-induced
phosphorylations
involved
in
the
individual
response
to
IR
.
Obviously
,
further
investigations
are
needed
to
better
understand
the
direct
or
indirect
role
of
cytoplasmic
ATM
forms
in
the
activation
or
the
inhibition
of
DSB
repair
pathways
.
