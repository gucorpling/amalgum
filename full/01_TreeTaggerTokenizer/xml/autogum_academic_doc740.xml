Definition
of
Environment-Induced
Migrants
</head>
<p>
The
complexity
of
the
environment-induced
migration
phenomenon
is
replicated
in
the
number
of
terms
used
to
define
it
:
“
climate
refugee
”
or
“
environmental
refugee
”
,
“
environmentally
displaced
person
”
,
“
forced
migration
due
to
environmental
change
”
,
“
environment-driven
migration
”
and
“
environmentally-motivated
migrants
”
.
</p>
<p>
There
is
no
internationally
established
definition
for
individuals
migrating
for
environmental
reasons
;
they
have
no
legal
basis
and
status
that
confers
responsibilities
on
states
.
In
fact
,
people
induced
to
migrate
due
to
environmental
factors
do
not
fall
completely
into
the
categories
provided
by
the
current
international
legal
framework
and
demonstrate
the
restrictions
of
the
current
paradigm
where
migration
is
basically
framed
.
The
international
studies
emphasize
that
environment-induced
migration
is
out
of
the
scope
of
international
protection
but
in
great
need
in
terms
of
assistance
and
defense
.
There
is
increasing
recognition
that
current
gaps
need
to
be
bridged
.
In
reality
,
countries
are
left
to
determine
their
own
standards
,
rules
and
interpretations
of
present
norms
and
human
rights
responsibilities
and
they
propose
different
levels
of
protection
.
Currently
,
international
initiatives
on
the
protection
of
environment-induced
migrants
are
being
discussed
giving
rise
to
a
rich
but
fragmented
practice
.
</p>
<p>
The
following
categories
of
migrants
are
usually
considered
as
environment-induced
migrants
:
those
forced
to
migrate
to
avoid
the
worsening
slow-onset
deterioration
of
the
environment
;
those
forced
to
migrate
more
permanently
due
to
recurrent
events
;
those
displaced
by
climate-related
disasters
,
who
often
move
temporarily
;
and
those
who
“
choose
”
to
move
as
an
adaptation
strategy
,
in
response
to
environmental
pressures
and
other
factors
.
</p>
<p>
The
International
Organization
for
Migration
defined
environmental
migrants
as
“
people
or
groups
of
people
who
,
for
compelling
reasons
of
sudden
or
progressive
change
in
the
environment
that
adversely
affects
their
lives
or
living
conditions
,
are
obliged
to
leave
their
habitual
homes
,
or
choose
to
do
so
,
either
temporarily
or
permanently
,
and
who
move
either
within
their
country
or
abroad
”
.
In
the
next
section
,
we
consider
the
types
of
environment-induced
mobility
and
issues
related
to
its
assessment
.

Environment-Induced
Mobility
:
Types
and
Issues
of
Assessing
</head>
<p>
Climate
change
is
anticipated
to
make
the
environment
hotter
,
increase
peak
precipitation
and
cause
more
extreme
floods
,
storms
and
droughts
.
These
changes
,
in
turn
,
are
expected
to
cause
further
population
mobility
.
According
to
the
United
Nation
International
Strategy
for
Disaster
Reduction
(
ISDR
)
—
droughts
,
storms
and
floods
have
enlarged
three-fold
during
the
past
30
years
and
there
is
a
relationship
between
migration
and
climate
change
.
Continuous
environmental
deterioration
affects
the
present
situation
and
causes
different
types
of
human
mobility
,
in
particular
,
temporary
and
circular
migration
(
for
instance
,
because
of
periods
of
drought
)
,
or
permanent
migration
(
due
to
desertification
or
the
rise
in
sea
level
)
.
These
environmental
hazards
induce
people
to
migrate
internally
or
globally
.
The
current
studies
specify
that
a
great
portion
of
environment-induced
migration
is
taking
place
within
national
borders
.
Nevertheless
,
there
is
also
evidence
of
a
growing
number
of
environment-induced
migration
across
international
borders
.
</p>
<p>
Among
the
issues
that
affect
the
assessment
of
the
expansion
and
the
character
of
environment-induced
migration
is
a
lack
of
proper
data
.
In
particular
,
global
data
on
international
movement
in
the
context
of
environmental
disasters
is
limited
.
Only
a
few
remarkable
cases
have
been
examined
so
far
,
in
particular
,
the
Nansen
Initiative
,
2015
,
which
“
intended
to
identify
effective
practices
and
build
consensus
on
key
principles
and
elements
to
address
the
protection
and
assistance
needs
of
people
displaced
across
borders
in
the
context
of
disasters
,
including
the
adverse
effects
of
climate
change
”
and
research
conducted
by
Dina
Ionesco
,
Daria
Mokhnacheva
and
François
Gemenne
in
2017
.
The
International
Organization
for
Migration
—
Atlas
of
Environmental
Migration
—
“
clarifies
terminology
and
concepts
,
draws
a
typology
of
migration
related
to
environment
and
climate
change
,
describes
the
multiple
factors
at
play
,
explains
the
challenges
,
and
highlights
the
opportunities
related
to
this
phenomenon
”
.
The
official
statistics
on
humanitarian
visas
by
countries
such
as
the
United
States
(
US
)
,
Brazil
and
Argentina
in
some
cases
can
be
also
analyzed
.
</p>
<p>
The
fast-changing
status
of
migrants
prone
to
national
conflicts
also
contributes
to
difficulties
in
identifying
environment-induced
migration
flows
.
Recent
studies
indicate
that
today
’s
internally
displaced
people
(
IDPs
)
can
become
tomorrow
’s
asylum
seekers
or
refugees
.
IDPs
are
those
individuals
who
have
not
yet
crossed
an
international
border
.
For
instance
,
approximately
55
%
of
the
Afghan
refugees
and
85
%
of
the
Syrian
refugees
interviewed
in
Greece
in
2016
reported
that
they
had
been
IDPs
before
passing
over
the
national
border
.
An
additional
issue
that
makes
the
link
between
migration
and
the
environment
problematic
to
indicate
is
the
difficulty
of
separating
environmental
drivers
from
economic
political
and
social
drivers
of
migration
because
environmental
determinants
are
usually
associated
with
economic
social
and
political
factors
.
