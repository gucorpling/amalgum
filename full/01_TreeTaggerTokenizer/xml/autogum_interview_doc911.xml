Five
activists
have
installed
themselves
on
the
rooftop
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestas">

in

<p>
The
five
—
four
of
whom
are
members
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate%20Camp">
Climate
Camp
</ref>
which
has
set
up
in
the
Isle

Wight
—
scaled
the
Cowes
plant
,
which
is
located
about
five
miles
(
8
kilometres
)
north
of
Vestas
's
main
Isle
of
Wight
plant
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport,%20England">

,
on
August

and
have
been
camping
on
the
rooftop
ever
since

<p>
Martin
Shaw
,
a
self-described

</ref>
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-syndicalism">

&quot;
on
the
roof
of
Vestas
Venture
Quays
,
spoke
with
<hi rend="italic">
Wikinews
</hi>
.
He
reports
that
while
none
of
the
five
rooftop
occupiers
are
Vestas
employees
,
but
instead
consist
of
one
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National%20Union%20of%20Rail,%20Maritime%20and%20Transport%20Workers">
RMT
</ref>
member
and
four
Climate
Camp
members
,
factory
employees
&quot;
instigated
this
action
&quot;
and
had
intended
to
occupy
the
roof
themselves
,
but
Shaw
and
the
other
four
,
as
experienced
climbers
,
had
the
technical
ability
and
experience
to
accomplish
the
task
.
</p>
<p>
While
on
the
roof
,
the
five
are
living
in
tents
and
washing
in
rainwater
heated
by
the
sun
in
black
plastic
bags
.
Food
is
sent
up
on
ropes
from
members
of
the
local
community
;
unlike
at
Vestas
Newport
,
the
police
and
security
are
not
restricting
the
bringing
in
of
food
and
drink
.
</p>
<p>
While
Shaw
notes
that
the
stand
of
the
anarcho-syndicalists
on
the
best
fate
of
Vestas
does
not
exactly
match
that
of
the
workers
,
who
have
called
for
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nationalisation">
nationalisation
</ref>
of
the
plant
,
&quot;
whatever
their
demands
are
are
our
demands
&quot;
.
</p>
<p>
The
central
message
of
the
rooftop
protest
,
Shaw
related
,
is
opposition
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIMBY">
NIMBYism
</ref>
.
&quot;
I
personally
have
got
some
sympathy
with
Vestas
&quot;
,
Shaw
noted
,
accusing
the
Isle
of
Wight
's
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/member%20of%20parliament">
MP
</ref>
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew%20Turner%20(politician)">
Andrew
Turner
</ref>
,
of
on
the
one
hand
saying
he
supported
the
Vestas
workers
but
on
the
other
hand
campaigning
against
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wind%20farm">
wind
farms
</ref>
being
built
on
the
island
.
&quot;
Local
opposition
is
stopping
wind
turbines
being
built
in
this
country
&quot;
,
stated
Shaw
.
The
occupiers
plan
to
unveil
a
banner
tonight
on
the
roof
of
the
Vestas
plant
reading
:
&quot;
Save
the
environment
,
scuttle
a
NIMBY
&quot;
.
</p>
<p>
The
problem
,
he
went
on
to
say
,
is
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Europe">
Europe
</ref>
-wide
.
The
upcoming
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United%20Nations%20Climate%20Change%20Conference%202009">
Copenhagen
Climate
Summit
</ref>
,
Shaw
accuses
,
will
be
a
&quot;
business
summit
rather
than
an
environmental
summit
&quot;
.
</p>
<p>
The
Vestas
Cowes
occupiers
plan
to
stay
on
the
factory
roof
&quot;
until
the
workers
want
us
to
come
down
&quot;
.
If
the
police
come
to
remove
them
,
as
happened
earlier
today
at
Vestas
's
Newport
plant
,
the
five
occupiers
say
they
will
resist
&quot;
determinedly
and
creatively
&quot;
but
offered
no
details
.
Shaw
says
that
while
they
wo
n't
use
violence
to
resist
the
police
,
&quot;
we
will
defend
ourselves
&quot;
.
