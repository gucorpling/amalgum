Career
</head>
<p>
What
little
is
known
of
Moheschunder
comes
from
articles
that
John
Cochrane
,
stationed
at
Calcutta
in
the
1840s
,
wrote
for
the
London
chess
magazines
.
It
appears
that
Cochrane
,
who
had
defeated
every
player
in
England
barring
his
protégé
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Staunton">
Howard
Staunton
</ref>
,
had
been
searching
for
some
worthy
opponents
for
some
time
.
In
the
autumn
of
1848
,
a
member
of
the
Calcutta
Chess
club
heard
of
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmin">
Brahmin
</ref>
in
a
village
(
mofussil
)
who
had
never
been
beaten
at
chess
.
He
found
an
opportunity
of
meeting
him
,
played
him
,
and
lost
.
It
was
stated
that
the
man
,
'
Moheschunder
Bonnerjee
,
a
Brahmin
'
,
of
about
50
,
hardly
knew
the
European
rules
of
chess
;
yet
his
play
was
presumably
under
European
rules
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-sergeant-1">

</ref>
</p>
<p>
This
club
member
brought
Bannerjee
back
to
Calcutta
with
him
.
Cochrane
played
him
and
won
,
but
was
impressed
.
Banerjee
was
engaged
as
&quot;
a
paid
attaché
&quot;
of
the
Chess
Club
,
where
he
improved
wonderfully
.
In
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_Player's_Chronicle">
Chess
Player
's
Chronicle
</ref>
for
1851
are
published
some
games
between
Cochrane
and
Moheschunder
;
and
&quot;
the
Brahmin
&quot;
figures
as
a
player
in
various
collections
of
games
.
The
Indian
Defences
by
P-KKt3
coupled
with
P-Q3
,
or
P-QKt3
coupled
with
P-K3
,
were
largely
taught
to
European
players
by
the
example
of
Moheschunder
and
other
Indians
,
to
whom
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fianchetto">
fianchetto
</ref>
developments
were
a
natural
legacy
from
their
own
game
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-sergeant-1">

It
is
notable
that
many
of
Bannerjee
's
openings
were
based
on
single
pawn
moves
,

&quot;
mentioned
by

as
in

rules

</p>
<p>
Cochrane
is
quoted
in
a
letter
written
by
a
member
of
the
Calcutta
Chess
Club
,
appearing
in
the
<hi rend="italic">
Chess
Player

Chronicle
</hi>
in

:
</p>
The
only
player
here
who
has
any
chance
whatever
with
Mr
Cochrane
,
upon
even
terms
,
is
a
Brahmin
of
the
name
of
Moheschunder
Bonnerjee
.
Of
this
worthy
,
Mr
Cochrane
has
himself
remarked
that
he
possesses
as
great
a
natural
talent
for
chess
as
any
player

ever
met
with

without
one

exception

The
origin
of
the
name
&quot;
Indian
Defence
&quot;
</head>
<p>
Moheshchunder
,
like
other
Indian
players
of
the
time
,
favoured
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fianchetto">
fianchettoed
</ref>
openings
,
trying
to
control
the
centre
with
long-distance
pieces
rather
than
occupying
it
with
the
pawns
.
Possibly
these
ideas
germinated
in
an
environment
of
chess
rules
that
did
not
permit
the
initial
two-square
move
for
pawns
.
The
theory
behind
these
openings
were
developed
in
recorded
chess
history
much
later
,
but
Cochrane
introduced
the
term
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_defence">
Indian
defence
</ref>
for
this
class
of
openings
,
which
has
now
come
to
cover
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimzo-Indian">
Nimzo-Indian
</ref>
and
many
other
popular
openings
.
Fianchettoes
appear
to
have
been
a
favourite
style
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_chess">
Indian
chess
</ref>
variants
,
and
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_Indian_defence">

was
also
a
frequent
opening
for
