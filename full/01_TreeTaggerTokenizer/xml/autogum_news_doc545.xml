has
expelled

Nick

,
previously
for
fifteen
years
its
leader
.
The
party
stated
they
informed
Griffin
of
their
decision
yesterday
and
gave
multiple
reasons
for
the
expulsion
,
including
distributing
inaccurate
information
,
trying
to
damage
the
party
's
public
image
,
harassment
of
staff
members
,
and
defying
instructions
given
to
him
by
current
leader

.
Griffin
has
said
he
was
&quot;
'
expelled
'
without
trial
&quot;
and
the
BNP
violated
its
constitution
.

Griffin
was
BNP
chairman
until
July
,
when
he
quit
the
role
and
became
honorary
president
;
acting
chairman
Adam
Walker
took
his
place
.
Griffin
was
elected
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North%20West%20England%20(European%20Parliament%20constituency)">
North
West
England
</ref>
MEP
(
Member
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/European_Parliament">
European
Parliament
</ref>
)
in
2009
but
lost
the
seat
in
the
2014
election
.
</p>
<p>
Under
Griffin
's
tenure
,
the
party
reportedly
experienced
an
increase
in
success
,
gaining
more
than
50
councillors
in
the
UK
and
two
MEPs
in
2009
,
Griffin
being
one
and
the
other

Brons
</ref>
.
However
,
more
recently
the
party
has
reportedly
had
monetary
difficulties
and
internal
disputes
,
as
well
as
disagreements
over
what
attitudes
the
party
should
adopt
.
Brons
departed
from
the
BNP
in
2012
and
went
on
to
form
his
own
political
party
,
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British%20Democratic%20Party">
British
Democratic
Party
</ref>
.
</p>
<p>
The
BNP
's
political
support
has
significantly
declined
in
recent
years
;
its
percentage
vote
share
in
the
European
Parliament
elections
in
North
West
England
dipped
from
6.1
%
in
2009
to
1.9
%
in
2014
,
while
most
of
the
party
's
councillors
have
lost
their
positions
.
Also
,
in
January
Nick
Griffin
was
declared
bankrupt
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
This
has
been
a
difficult
decision
to
make
and
not
one
taken
lightly
&quot;
,
a
member
of
a
conduct
committee
within
the
BNP
commented
.
&quot;
Although
we
all
appreciate
that
Nick
has
achieved
a
lot
for
our
Party
in
the
past
,
we
must
also
remember
that
the
Party
is
bigger
than
any
individual
.
Nick
did
not
adjust
well
to
being
given
the
honourary
title
of
President
and
it
soon
became
obvious
that
he
was
unable
to
work
as
an
equal
member
of
the
team
and
alarmingly
his
behaviour
became
more
erratic
and
disruptive
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
conduct
committee
said
they
made
their
decision
because
of
Griffin
's
behaviour
,
which
included
&quot;
preparing
a
‘
report
’
which
tells
lies
about
key
Party
personnel
and
finances
and
approving
the
leak
of
these
damaging
and
defamatory
allegations
onto
the
internet
&quot;
,
&quot;
harassing
members
of
BNP
staff
and
in
at
least
one
case
making
physical
threats
&quot;
,
&quot;
bringing
the
Party
into
disrepute
through
public
statements
&quot;
,
&quot;
publishing
,
causing
to
be
published
or
being
reckless
as
to
the
publication
of
untrue
allegations
against
the
Party
in
the
form
of
e-mails
giving
a
false
account
of
[
his
]
bankruptcy
situation
&quot;
and
&quot;
disobeying
legitimate
,
constitutional
instructions
given
to
[
him
]
by
our
Chairman
,
Adam
Walker
aimed
at
preventing
damage
to
the
reputation
and
unity
of
the
Party
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Griffin
's
response
to
this
expulsion
from
the
party
was
to
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Twitter">
tweet
</ref>
:
&quot;
Breaking
news
!
I
've
just
been
'
expelled
'
without
trial
from
the
#BNP
!
That
'll
teach
me
to
tell
a
member
of
staff
he
's
a
'
useless
,
lazy
twat
'
&quot;
.
In
a
later
tweet
,
he
added
:
&quot;
Only
thing
is
that
the
ruling
Wigton
Soviet
are
operating
outside
the
constitution
so
I
shall
ignore
their

gangster
games
.
