What
do
you
expect
Project
Chanology
to
accomplish
and
when
?

<hi rend="bold">
J.J.
</hi>
:
I
am
not
an
Anon
,
and
know
little
about
the
movement
.
But
I
was
extremely
impressed
that
Anonymous
brought
out
thousands
of
people
to
protest
around
the
world
on
short
notice
.
From
what
I
've
seen
,
I
believe
they
can
accomplish
a
lot
.
I
hope
a
few
more
protests
,
then
work
on
Scientology
's
tax
exemption
,
which
I
believe
is
a
very
vulnerable
area
for
Scientology
.
Project
Chanology
is
a
strong
force
with
able
people
.
It
can
do
a
lot
.

Anonymous
utilized
criminal
tactics
,
why
should
such
organizations
be
trusted
and
regarded
as
credible
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
J.J.
</hi>
:
Us
long-time
critics
were
initially
very
frightened
of
Anonymous
.
You
can
tell
that
from
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark%20Bunker">
Wise
Beard
Man
</ref>
'
s
first
video
but
since
then
it
appears
that
Anonymous
has
dropped
the
original
things
we
were
seeing
.
So
I
see
it
as
self-policing
happened
and
things
are
on
track
now
.
I
do
not
condone
anything
but
peaceful
,
legal
methods
.
And
now
Anonymous
is
promoting
that
as
well
,
so
I
am
happy
.

What
should
be
the

step
for
the

movement

</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
J.J.
</hi>
:
Wow
.
That
's
not
for
me
to
say
.
I
'm
not
a
part
of
it
.
But
I
do
hope
they
will
do
as
they
have
been
,
which
is
listening
to
us
who
have
been
in
the
field
for
a
long
time
.
You
can
listen
and
learn
from
what
we
've
done
,
then
decide
where
to
go
from
here
.
My
one
wish
would
be
to
go
after
Scientology
's
tax
exempt
status
in
the
US
.
Otherwise
I
have
confidence
that
Anonymous
will
find
the
right
path
.

J.J.

religiousfreedomwatch.org

my

most
of

about

So
I

I

J.J.

:
I
've
been
deposed
3
times
by
Scientology
attorneys
.
My
home
has
been
picketed
.
My
business
has
been
picketed
twice
.
In
Clearwater
I
was
followed
sometimes
daily
by
PIs
[
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private%20investigator">
Private
investigator
</ref>
]
.
Lynn
Farney
yelled
at
me
&quot;
we
will
raid
you
and
sue
you
!
You
are
on
notice
!
&quot;
after
one
deposition
.
I
've
had
my
neighborhood
leafleted
with
flyers
calling
me
a
bigot
.
What
keeps
me
going
is
that
Scientology
hurts
people
.
When
they
stop
hurting
people
,
I
'll
stop
bugging
them
.

:
Go
to
the
police
right
away

Keep
a
record
of
everything
.
Carry
a
video
camera
.
I
always
had
a
video
camera
with
me
in
Clearwater
,
even
going
to
the
grocery
store
.
And
another
thing
I
liked
to
do
is
post
everything
that
happened
online
.
One
time
I
posted
&quot;
if
I
disappear
,
here
's
the
plate
number
of
a
car
that
's
been
following
me
