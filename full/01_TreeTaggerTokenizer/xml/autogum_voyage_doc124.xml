<p>
Named
after
a
noted
19th-century
Shoshoni
chief
,
Pocatello
is
a
working-class
town
with
a
strong
railroad
and
trade
union
heritage
.
As
such
it
has
more
of
a
blue-collar
feel
to
it
than
the
other
major
Idaho
cities
.
At
one
time
the
city
boasted
the
largest
rail
yard
west
of
the
Mississippi
River
.
The
city
has
a
reputation
for
being
a
(
slightly
)
more
progressive
enclave
in
otherwise
conservative
,
Mormon-dominated
Eastern
Idaho
.
</p>
<p>
Although
the
presence
of
<hi rend="bold">
Idaho
State
University
</hi>
in
Pocatello
unquestionably
makes
it
a
college
town
as
well
,
student
life
is
somewhat
more
sedate
than
in
other
college
towns
in
the
region
such
as
<ref target="Moscow%20%28Idaho%29">
Moscow
</ref>
,
Idaho
,
or
<ref target="Missoula">
Missoula

,

.
The
bar
scene
can
be
lively
on
the
weekends
,
but
do
n't
expect
to
find
too
many
raging
frat
house
keggers
here
.

<p>
Pocatello
tends
to
have
more
snow
and
more
severe
snowstorms
than
the
other
major
cities
in
Idaho
(
although
not
as
severe
as
places
like
<ref target="Stanley%20%28Idaho%29">
Stanley
</ref>
)
.
Given
that
and
the
city
's
hilly
landscape
,
driving
can
be
a
challenge
in
the
winter
.
</p>
<p>
The
Pocatello
area
is
also
subject
to
inversions
in
the
winter
months
.
This
,
combined
with
the
output
of
nearby
fertilizer
plants
,
can
make
air
quality
an
issue
.
