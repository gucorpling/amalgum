Supervised
Classification
of
Hyperspectral
Pixels
at
the
Ground
Canopy
Scale
</head>
<p>
One
approach
used
to
analyze
hyperspectral
data
on
the
field
scale
is
the
pixel-wise
classification
into
usual
pixel
(
background
,
straw
,
healthy
leaf
tissue
)
and
in
disease
specific
symptoms
.
In
the
field
experiment
2018
,
YR
had
a
significant
disease
severity
and
classifiers
for
this
disease
were
derived
.
</p>
<p>
The
use
of
16
VIs
reached
a
reasonable
but
not
competitive
performance
.
However
,
it
has
to
be
noted
that
we
compared
161
features
to
16
,
meaning
a
significant
reduction
in
dimensionality
.
The
results
can
be
integrated
in
a
later
discussion
of
the
various
feature
sets
obtained
by
feature
selection
.
</p>
<p>
Based
on
these
results
,
SVM
SNV
(
Table
1
)
was
selected
as
most
appropriate
approach
.
A
visual
comparison
of
the
SAM
results
and
the
SVM
SNV
result
is
shown
in
<figure>
Figure
5
</figure>
.
Significant
differences
were
apparent
.
The
SVM
detected
many
more
senescent
leaves
,
e.
g.
,
all
leaves
from
the
lower
leaf
levels
,
whereas
the
SAM
assigned
these
to
the
background
or
the
healthy
leaves
.
The
SVM
was
more
sensitive
for
ear
detection
,
which
caused
major
problems
in
the
SAM
image
,
where
they
were
partly
assigned
to
YR
.
Overall
,
both
approaches
were
sensitive
to
YR
,
but
the
SVM
was
much
more
accurate
in
the
very
bright
image
parts
as
well
as
the
darker
background
parts
,
while
the
class
YR
was
overrepresented
in
the
SAM
classification
.
The
visually
most
significant
aspect
was
the
large
number
of
blue
pixels
in
the
visualization
of
the
SVM
result
.
YR
disease
was
present
at
all
leaf
levels
and
led
to
early
senescence
in
lower
leaf
levels
.
</p>
<p>
The
classification
models
were
validated
via
two
approaches
:
(
1
)
pixel-wise
classification
of
the
hold-out
test
data
set
consisting
of
manually
annotated
pixels
of
new
images
of
separate
plots
,
and
(
2
)
prediction
of
pixel
classes
of
all
images
obtained
on
a
respective
day
and
comparing
the
total
%
disease
class
from
all
plant
pixels
to
the
visual
assessment
done
by
the
expert
(
<figure>
Figure
6
</figure>
)
.
Approach
1
resulted
in
a
confusion
matrix
allowing
the
calculation
of
multiple
performance
measures
such
as
the
overall
accuracy
,
the
sensitivity
,
and
the
recall
,
whereas
Approach
2
provided
the
R²value
,
correlation
coefficient
,
and
a
regression
plot
.
Table
1
shows
the
overall
accuracy
and
the
F1
score
for
the
different
classification
methods
.
</p>
<p>
Presumably
,
due
to
light
reflections
and
transmission
or
a
deviating
weighting
of
the
different
canopy
levels
,
the
SVM
prediction
overestimated
the
ratio
of
diseased
pixels
.
To
compensate
for
this
,
a
linear
regression
model
was
applied
.
However
,
deviations
between
the
predicted
disease
severity
and
the
visual
assessment
could
have
various
reasons
,
e.
g.
,
the
section
of
the
plot
observed
by
the
sensor
did
not
represent
the
true
status
that
was
evaluated
by
the
visual
assessment
.
The
viewing
angle
produced
a
variable
composition
of
different
leafs
and
leaf
layers
in
the
field
of
view
of
the
human
and
the
sensors
.
Furthermore
,
the
visibility
of
the
lower
leaf
levels
was
low
for
imaging
system
from
the
top
,
and
more
accurate
if
the
human
rater
could
go
deep
into
the
crop
stand
for
individual
leaf
disease
rating
.
Further
points
are
that
the
visual
assessment
produced
a
single
value
averaging
the
affected
leaf
area
.
From
repeated
disease
assessments
with
multiple
experts
,
different
deviations
have
been
observed
depending
on
the
literature
.
The
method
of
disease
detection
is
subjective
to
the
individuals
performing
the
assessment
.
Another
prime
factor
for
deviations
and
classification
inaccuracies
is
the
biological
heterogeneity
.
This
has
to
be
considered
as
highly
dynamic
within
one
field
,
one
plot
,
and
one
location
,
and
even
on
different
leaf
layers
and
single
leaves
.
The
biological
heterogeneity
can
be
affected
by
many
factors
,
e.
g.
,
the
leaf
color
and
status
,
stem
elongation
(
distance
of
leaf
layers
)
,
the
density
of
the
canopy
,
and
other
biological
growth
processes
.

Evaluation
of
Hyperspectral
UAV
Observations
Using
a
Filter-System
Hyperspectral
Camera
</head>
<p>
To
characterize
the
reflectance
characteristics
of
the
field
plots
,
the
spectra
of
the
central
4
×
2
m
of
each
plot
were
averaged
.
Intra-plot
variations
were
neglected
.
Multiple
traits
were
predicted
with
reasonable
accuracy
based
on
SVM
and
SVR
analysis
of
the
55
recorded
bands
from
500
–
900
nm
.
Table
2
shows
the
obtained
performance
parameters
based
on
a
SNV
representation
and
the
integration
of
all
55
bands
.
</p>
<p>
Using
the
SVR
approach
,
a
prediction
of
the
disease
severity
in
percent
was
possible
with
reasonable
accuracy
(
<figure>
Figure
7
</figure>
)
.
The
interpretation
of
this
result
has
to
take
into
account
that
a
value
from
the
visual
assessment
might
not
represent
the
average
plot
value
because
diseases
may
occur
at
zoned
locations
in
the
plot
,
and
assessment
locations
may
or
may
not
be
in
these
spots
.
