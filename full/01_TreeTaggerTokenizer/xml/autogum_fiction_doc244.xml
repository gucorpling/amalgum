THE
LOST
FISH
</head>
<p>
&quot;
You
come
with
me
,
Freddie
,
&quot;
said
Mr.
Button
.
Fred
's
face
flushed
at
the
term
applied
to
him
by
his
grandfather
and
still
deeper
color
appeared
in
his
cheeks
when
he
saw
a
mischievous
expression
appear
in
the
eyes
of
the
girls
.
To
be
called
by
the
name
be
which
he
was
called
when
he
was
a
little
fellow
,
or
at
least
very
much
smaller
than
he
was
at
the
present
time
,
was
the
last
thing
that
could
be
applied
him
in
the
way
of
teasing
.
Mr.
Button
,
however
,
had
no
thought
of
annoying
his
grandson
and
used
the
term
simply
because
it
had
been
familiar
to
him
from
the
time
when
Fred
was
born
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Good-by
,
Freddie
,
good-by
,
&quot;
called
the
three
Go
Ahead
boys
together
,
as
their
comrade
obediently
followed
the
call
and
at
once
joined
his
grandfather
and
the
man
who
had
demanded
the
bond
and
turned
into
the
street
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
That
fellow
was
waiting
for
us
,
&quot;
exclaimed
George
in
surprise
.
&quot;
I
believe
that
Mr.
Button
knew
all
the
time
that
he
was
to
be
here
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Well
,
what
do
you
make
of
it
?
&quot;
inquired
Grant
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
do
n't
know
what
to
make
of
it
.
That
man
and
a
lot
of
his
friends
from
the
canal-boats
force
their
way
on
board
the
Black
Growler
and
leave
only
when
they
are
scared
by
the
coming
of
the
Caledonia
.
Then
the
first
thing
we
know
he
shows
up
here
at
Cape
Vincent
and
orders
us
to
give
up
a
bond
which
he
says
we
have
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
And
the
worst
of
it
is
that
we
have
it
,
&quot;
said
George
ruefully
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
HAD
it
,
you
mean
,
&quot;
suggested
Grant
soberly
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
That
's
right
,
&quot;
joined
in
John
.
&quot;
We
gave
it
up
and
had
it
recorded
in
Fred
's
name
.
Now
I
suspect
that
those
two
men
somehow
have
put
up
a
job
on
Fred
and
that
we
'll
lose
our
bond
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
'
Our
'
bond
is
good
,
&quot;
scoffed
George
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Well
,
whose
is
it
?
&quot;
demanded
John
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
That
's
what
we
do
n't
know
,
but
that
does
n't
mean
that
everything
we
see
,
which
may
be
the
property
of
somebody
we
do
n't
know
,
belongs
to
us
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Well
,
if
this
Mr.
Somebody
owns
that
bond
why
does
n't
he
come
and
claim
it
?
&quot;
retorted
John
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
It
's
my
opinion
that
Mr.
Somebody
has
come
,
&quot;
said
Grant
dryly
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
What
do
you
mean
?
&quot;
inquired
George
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
do
n't
know
that
I
mean
anything
.
I
'm
thinking
though
that
the
man
who
owns
that
bond
,
if
it
is
good
for
anything
,
is
n't
going
to
rest
easily
until
he
finds
out
where
it
is
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Do
you
think
that
boatman
owns
it
?
&quot;
asked
John
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
It
's
plain
that
he
knows
something
about
it
,
&quot;
answered
Grant
.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile
the
two
girls
in
the
party
were
becoming
somewhat
impatient
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
My
,
nobody
knows
how
thirsty
I
am
!
&quot;
said
Miss
Susie
,
who
had
been
an
interested
listener
and
for
some
strange
reason
had
not
joined
in
the
conversation
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Plenty
of
water
around
here
,
&quot;
suggested
John
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
do
n't
mean
that
,
&quot;
said
the
girl
quickly
.
&quot;
I
mean
something
cold
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
And
frozen
?
&quot;
asked
John
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
My
,
how
quick
witted
you
are
!
&quot;
laughed
the
girl
.
&quot;
That
's
exactly
what
we
want
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
suppose
we
might
as
well
give
in
first
as
last
,
&quot;
said
George
in
mock
despair
.
&quot;
If
anybody
knows
where
we
can
get
any
ice
cream
we
'll
start
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
We
'll
start
anyway
,
&quot;
spoke
up
Miss
Susie
.
&quot;
If
we
start
we
shall
find
it
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Evidently
success
attended
the
efforts
to
locate
the
ice
cream
parlors
for
long
before
the
return
of
the
boys
and
girls
to
the
Black
Growler
,
Fred
and
his
grandfather
had
come
back
,
the
latter
becoming
more
impatient
with
the
failure
of
the
young
people
to
appear
.
</p>
<p>
Sam
Hodge
meanwhile
had
been
busily
engaged
in
his
inspection
of
the
machinery
of
the
Black
Growler
.
When
his
task
was
completed
he
did
not
make
any
remarks
,
but
his
face
apparently
beamed
with
satisfaction
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Sam
,
&quot;
said
Fred
,
&quot;
what
do
you
think
our
chances
are
against
that
Varmint
II
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
'
Gainst
the
which
?
&quot;
demanded
Sam
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
That
motor-boat
that
we
were
racing
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
think
it
will
depend
somewhat
on
how
fast
we
go
,
&quot;
said
Sam
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
What
a
wise
man
you
are
,
&quot;
laughed
Fred
.
&quot;
I
might
have
thought
of
that
myself
if
I
had
tried
hard
.
Do
you
think
we
can
beat
that
boat
?
That
's
what
I
want
to
know
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
think
we
can
if
we
go
faster
than
she
does
,
&quot;
replied
Sam
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Well
,
can
we
make
her
go
faster
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
You
can
if
the
speed
is
in
her
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Well
,
do
you
think
the
speed
is
in
her
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
ca
n't
say
just
yet
,
&quot;
said
Sam
,
who
was
not
to
be
moved
from
his
cautious
position
.
&quot;
Here
come
your
friends
,
&quot;
he
added
as
the
boys
and
girls
were
seen
approaching
the
dock
.
</p>
<p>
Mr.
Button
grumbled
over
the
delay
which
had
been
caused
by
the
failure
of
the
young
people
to
return
,
but
as
no
one
except
Fred
understood
just
what
he
was
saying
slight
attention
was
paid
him
.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile
at
Sam
's
command
the
engine
was
started
,
and
the
Black
Growler
,
free
from
the
dock
once
more
,
soon
was
noisily
and
speedily
making
her
way
down
the
mighty
river
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Why
did
n't
you
beat
that
other
boat
?
&quot;
demanded
Miss
Susie
of
Fred
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
That
was
n't
what
we
were
trying
to
do
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Well
,
what
were
you
trying
to
do
?
&quot;
demanded
the
girl
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Testing
our
boat
and
at
the
same
time
trying
to
find
out
what
time
they
could
make
in
the
Varmint
II
.
