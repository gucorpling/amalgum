Learn
about
the
basics
of
providing
a
healthy
home
for
mice
.
Although
mice
are
generally
independent
and
easy
to
maintain
,
they
do
require
a
certain
amount
of
care
and
attention
.
Healthy

,
and
plenty
of
exercise
.

Mice
are
very
intelligent
and
active
animals
so
keep
in
mind
that
you
will
need
to
provide
them
with
adequate
space
,
chew
toys
,
and
an
exercise
wheel
to
keep
them
healthy
and
happy

Decide
if
you
can
care
for
at
least
two
mice
.
Mice
are
by
nature
social
animals
,
so
it
is
recommended
to
get
at
least
two
that
can
live
together
,
with
a
female-female
pair
being
the
best
option
.

Mice
reproduce
very
rapidly
,
so
it
is
not
recommended
to
house
males
and
females
together
.

<item>
Male
mice
may
display
aggressive
behavior
and
fight
if
housed
together

See
if
you
have
space
for
a
cage
or
aquarium
of
at
least
two
cubic
feet
.
Mice
may
be
small
,
but
the
more
space
you
give
them
in
their
captivity
the
better
as
they
are
very
active
little
creatures
.
It
is
recommended
to
house
mice
in
a
space
that
allows
them
at
least
one
cubic
foot
of
space
each
.

Mice
are
nocturnal
creatures
who
are
sensitive
to
heat
and
light
.
Make
sure
that
you
have
a
space
for
their
cage
or
aquarium
that
stays
out
of
direct
sunlight
and
away
from
strong
heat
sources
.

If
you
have
other
pets
such
as
dogs
or
cats
,
or
small
children
,
make
sure
that
you
have
a
safe
space
out
of
their
reach
to
house
your
mice
to
avoid
any
unfortunate
accidents
.

Determine
if
you
have
the
budget
to
cover
initial
and
ongoing
costs
.
Compared
to
other
larger
animals
,
owning
a
pet
mouse
is
much
cheaper
,
however
it
is
not
free
.
There
will
be
initial
expenses
to
purchase
housing
,
toys
,
bedding
and
food
as
well
as
ongoing
expenses
.

Keep
in

that
you
will

spend
a
few
hundred
dollars
a
year
on
food
and
bedding
for
your
pet
mice

Find
a
veterinarian
near
you
that
offers
care
for
mice
.
Call
around
to
different
vets
in
your
area
and
ask
about
their
experience
dealing
with
mice
.
Vets
generally
deal
a
lot
more
with
larger
more
common
pets
,
so
it
is
important
to
make
sure
you
know
where
to
take
your
mice
if
they
fall
ill
.

Choose
a
mouse
if
you
want
a
low-maintenance
pet
full
of
personality
.
Mice
are
intelligent
and
social
creatures
who
can
learn
to
recognize
their
owners
and
enjoy
interacting
with
them

Despite
their
small
size

mice
have
their
own
quirks

personalities

can
make
a

alternative
pet
to
a
dog

cat

also
make
great
first
pets
for
children

they
are
relatively
easy
to
care

Be

have
enough
time

dedicate
to
caring
for
mice
.

mice
require
much
less
time
commitment
than
many
other
pets

they
do
benefit
from
regular
handling
and
interaction
with
their
owners

want
to
form
a
strong
bond
with
them

Talk
with

If

in

household
will
be
responsible

caring

It
may
be
tempting
to
give
into
the
pleas
of
a
child
and
purchase
a
mouse
or
two
impulsively
,
but
before
doing
this
sit
down
and
make
sure
they
really
know
what
it
will
take
to
care
for
a
pet
mouse

Determine
if
you
will
be
able
to
take
care
of
mice
for
up
to
3
years
.
Mice
live
an
average
of
1.5-3
years
,
a
relatively
short
lifespan
but
still
a
commitment
.
Think
about
your
plans
for
the
next
few
years
,
if
there
is
a
chance
of
you
moving
,
think
about
whether
you
would
be
able
to
take
your
furry
companion
with
you
or
not
.

Make
a

take

of
your
