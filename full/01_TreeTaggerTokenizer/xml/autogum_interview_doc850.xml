were
arrested
by

while

.

<p>
The
two
protesters
,
who
earlier
participated
in
the
delivery
of
a
'
global
speech
'
collaboratively
written
and
read
by
members
of
Anonymous
at
protests
worldwide
,
are
believed
to
have
been
charged
by
Dekalb
police
for
protesting
without
a
permit
and
causing
'
offensive
or
hazardous
conditions
'
.
However
,
other
members
of
Anonymous
who
took
leading
roles
in
arranging
the
protest
are
adamant
that
the
Dekalb
police
had
previously
told
them
they
did
not
need
a
permit
to
protest
.
</p>
<p>
The
arrests
were
filmed
by
other
members
of
Anonymous
who
subsequently
posted
the
videos
onto
popular
video-sharing
website
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/YouTube">
YouTube
</ref>
.
The
videos
show
a
very
quick
arrest
in
which
the
arresting
officers
did
not
read
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miranda%20warning">
Miranda
rights
</ref>
of
the
protesters
,
which
—
contrary
to
popular
belief
—
is
only
required
to
be
read
before
a
police
officer
interviews
someone
in
custody
.
This
was
confirmed
by
other
members
of
the
group
who
say
they
did
n't
hear
their
rights
being
read
before
they
were
led
away
.
&quot;
They
were
grabbed
and
taken
behind
the
complex
in
one
swift
strike
.
There
was
no
Miranda
rights
read
when
they
were
initially
grabbed
&quot;
said
one
member
of
Anonymous
interviewed
by
Wikinews
.
</p>
<p>
In
other
videos
published
on
YouTube
,
the
same
members
of
Anonymous
were
shown
thanking
police
for
their
work
and
offering
them
some
of
the
cake
members
of
Anonymous
had
brought
to
the
protest
,
shortly
before
they
were
arrested
.
</p>
<p>
Members
of
Anonymous
have
composed
an
open
letter
to
Dekalb
's
Chief
of
Police
,
asking
if
such
a
show
of
police
strength
was
really
needed
at
a
non-violent
protest
organised
and
attended
mainly
by
college
students
and
young
Americans
.
</p>
<p>
Drivers
showing
their
support
for
the
protesters
by
honking
their
car
horns
while
driving
past
were
followed
by
police
bikes
waiting
in
the
Scientology
building
's
driveway
and
given
tickets
for
violating
noise
ordinance
laws
.
However
,
many
members
of
Anonymous
have
voiced
confusion
over
these
tickets
,
as
the
honks
of
support
were
only
2-3
seconds
in
duration
at
most
,
and
noise
ordinance
laws
state
a
horn
must
be
sounded
for
longer
than
60
seconds
to
count
as
a
violation
of
the
law
.
When
,
after
the
arrests
were
made
,
the
police
started
to
adopt
the
policy
of
ticketing
drivers
who
honked
,
members
of
Anonymous
quickly
raised
&quot;
Do
not
honk
&quot;
signs
to
drivers
.
</p>
<p>
Both
of
the
members
of
Anonymous
have
been
released
,
one
with
a
bail
of
$
763.00
.
There
are
confirmed
to
be
two
charges
standing
against
one
.
No
information
has
been
released
from
the
police
department
at
this
point
.

If

But
then
I
see
that
the
Atlanta
police
arrested
two
Anons
,
and
were
even
stopping
cars
that
honked
in
approval
of
the
protest

Is
Atlanta
not

Just

On

the

were
completely
cool

and
we
heard
they
liked
us

Usually
the
police
are
very
chilled
with
the
protests
and
such
.
This
is
the
first
time
that
I
can
recall
them
acting
like
this
.

They
really
did
n't
talk
to
us
at
all
at
the
last
protest
.
Several
people
had
called
in
before
both
protests
to
confirm
that
we
did
n't
need
a
permit
and
that
everything
was
OK-
they
knew
we
were
coming
,
and
so
on-
but
at
this
protest
initial
requests
to
get
more
information
from
the
officers
were
either
ignored
or
met
with
hostility
.

Was

on
what
the
two

were
arrested
for
?

Originally
I
heard
that
they
could
n't
answer
that
,
but
then
people
started
saying
it
was
for
inciting
disorder
and
for
protesting
without
a
permit
.
We
had
contacted
the
police
department
earlier
,
and
were
told
that
we
would
n't
need
a
permit
.
