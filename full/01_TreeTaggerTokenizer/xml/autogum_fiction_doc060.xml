SELECT
SEMINARY

YOUNG
LADIES
</head>
<p>
Little
Sara
Crewe
never
went
in
or
out
of
the
house
without
reading
that
door-plate
and
reflecting
upon
it
.
By
the
time
she
was
twelve
,
she
had
decided
that
all
her
trouble
arose
because
,
in
the
first
place
,
she
was
not
“
Select
,
”
and
in
the
second
she
was
not
a
“
Young
Lady
.
”
When
she
was
eight
years
old
,
she
had
been
brought
to
Miss
Minchin
as
a
pupil
,
and
left
with
her
.
Her
papa
had
brought
her
all
the
way
from
India
.
Her
mamma
had
died
when
she
was
a
baby
,
and
her
papa
had
kept
her
with
him
as
long
as
he
could
.
And
then
,
finding
the
hot
climate
was
making
her
very
delicate
,
he
had
brought
her
to
England
and
left
her
with
Miss
Minchin
,
to
be
part
of
the
Select
Seminary
for
Young
Ladies
.
Sara
,
who
had
always
been
a
sharp
little
child
,
who
remembered
things
,
recollected
hearing
him
say
that
he
had
not
a
relative
in
the
world
whom
he
knew
of
,
and
so
he
was
obliged
to
place
her
at
a
boarding-school
,
and
he
had
heard
Miss
Minchin
's
establishment
spoken
of
very
highly
.
The
same
day
,
he
took
Sara
out
and
bought
her
a
great
many
beautiful
clothes
--
clothes
so
grand
and
rich
that
only
a
very
young
and
inexperienced
man
would
have
bought
them
for
a
mite
of
a
child
who
was
to
be
brought
up
in
a
boarding-school
.
But
the
fact
was
that
he
was
a
rash
,
innocent
young
man
,
and
very
sad
at
the
thought
of
parting
with
his
little
girl
,
who
was
all
he
had
left
to
remind
him
of
her
beautiful
mother
,
whom
he
had
dearly
loved
.
And
he
wished
her
to
have
everything
the
most
fortunate
little
girl
could
have
;
and
so
,
when
the
polite
saleswomen
in
the
shops
said
,
“
Here
is
our
very
latest
thing
in
hats
,
the
plumes
are
exactly
the
same
as
those
we
sold
to
Lady
Diana
Sinclair
yesterday
,
”
he
immediately
bought
what
was
offered
to
him
,
and
paid
whatever
was
asked
.
The
consequence
was
that
Sara
had
a
most
extraordinary
wardrobe
.
Her
dresses
were
silk
and
velvet
and
India
cashmere
,
her
hats
and
bonnets
were
covered
with
bows
and
plumes
,
her
small
undergarments
were
adorned
with
real
lace
,
and
she
returned
in
the
cab
to
Miss
Minchin
's
with
a
doll
almost
as
large
as
herself
,
dressed
quite
as
grandly
as
herself
,
too
.
</p>
<p>
Then
her
papa
gave
Miss
Minchin
some
money
and
went
away
,
and
for
several
days
Sara
would
neither
touch
the
doll
,
nor
her
breakfast
,
nor
her
dinner
,
nor
her
tea
,
and
would
do
nothing
but
crouch
in
a
small
corner
by
the
window
and
cry
.
She
cried
so
much
,
indeed
,
that
she
made
herself
ill
.
She
was
a
queer
little
child
,
with
old-fashioned
ways
and
strong
feelings
,
and
she
had
adored
her
papa
,
and
could
not
be
made
to
think
that
India
and
an
interesting
bungalow
were
not
better
for
her
than
London
and
Miss
Minchin
's
Select
Seminary
.
The
instant
she
had
entered
the
house
,
she
had
begun
promptly
to
hate
Miss
Minchin
,
and
to
think
little
of
Miss
Amelia
Minchin
,
who
was
smooth
and
dumpy
,
and
lisped
,
and
was
evidently
afraid
of
her
older
sister
.
Miss
Minchin
was
tall
,
and
had
large
,
cold
,
fishy
eyes
,
and
large
,
cold
hands
,
which
seemed
fishy
,
too
,
because
they
were
damp
and
made
chills
run
down
Sara
's
back
when
they
touched
her
,
as
Miss
Minchin
pushed
her
hair
off
her
forehead
and
said
:
</p>
<p>
“
A
most
beautiful
and
promising
little
girl
,
Captain
Crewe
.
She
will
be
a
favorite
pupil
;
quite
a
favorite
pupil
,
I
see
.
”
</p>
<p>
For
the
first
year
she
was
a
favorite
pupil
;
at
least
she
was
indulged
a
great
deal
more
than
was
good
for
her
.
And
when
the
Select
Seminary
went
walking
,
two
by
two
,
she
was
always
decked
out
in
her
grandest
clothes
,
and
led
by
the
hand
at
the
head
of
the
genteel
procession
,
by
Miss
Minchin
herself
.
And
when
the
parents
of
any
of
the
pupils
came
,
she
was
always
dressed
and
called
into
the
parlor
with
her
doll
;
and
she
used
to
hear
Miss
Minchin
say
that
her
father
was
a
distinguished
Indian
officer
,
and
she
would
be
heiress
to
a
great
fortune
.
That
her
father
had
inherited
a
great
deal
of
money
,
Sara
had
heard
before
;
and
also
that
some
day
it
would
be
hers
,
and
that
he
would
not
remain
long
in
the
army
,
but
would
come
to
live
in
London
.
And
every
time
a
letter
came
,
she
hoped
it
would
say
he
was
coming
,
and
they
were
to
live
together
again
.
</p>
<p>
But
about
the
middle
of
the
third
year
a
letter
came
bringing
very
different
news
.
Because
he
was
not
a
business
man
himself
,
her
papa
had
given
his
affairs
into
the
hands
of
a
friend
he
trusted
.
The
friend
had
deceived
and
robbed
him
.
All
the
money
was
gone
,
no
one
knew
exactly
where
,
and
the
shock
was
so
great
to
the
poor
,
rash
young
officer
,
that
,
being
attacked
by
jungle
fever
shortly
afterward
,
he
had
no
strength
to
rally
,
and
so
died
,
leaving
Sara
,
with
no
one
to
take
care
of
her
.
</p>
<p>
Miss
Minchin
's
cold
and
fishy
eyes
had
never
looked
so
cold
and
fishy
as
they
did
when
Sara
went
into
the
parlor
,
on
being
sent
for
,
a
few
days
after
the
letter
was
received
.
