Be
a
Successful
Pilgrim
</head>
<p>
Travelling
for
a
religious
purpose
to
a
pilgrim
town
is
very
different
from
a
summer
holiday
with
family
or
backpacking
with
friends
.
These
steps
will
help
you
become
a
successful
pilgrim
.
Please
note
that
&quot;
temple
&quot;
is
used
as
a
generic
term
,
but
you
could
well
substitute
it
with
churche/mosque/synagogue
or
any
other
place
of
worship
.

Steps

<list type="ordered">
<item>
Feel
as
if
God
wants
you
to
undertake
this
journey
and
remain
eager
to
see
the
temple
.
Slowly
,
bring
the
shrine
and
the
particular
deity
into
your
consciousness
,
right
from
the
time
you
get
the
idea
to
go
on
the
trip
.
Search
the
net
for
articles
and
experiences
of
people
who
visited
the
same
place
and
your
urge
to
make
it
happen
will
become
stronger
.
As
that
happens
,
the
Universe
will
pave
the
way
for
you
to
reach
your
destination
,
and
all
the
details
will
fall
into
place
.

Book
a
flight
after
checking
the
timings
of
the
place
of
worship
.
If
a
temple
is
closed
between
1
.
p.
m.
and
4p
.
m.
,you
would
not
want
a
flight
which
arrives
during
those
hours
.
Most
pilgrim
spots
are
small
towns
which
have
little
to
offer
in
terms
of
entertainment
,
so
long
hours
of
waiting
could
bring
on
serious
boredom
.
For
the
same
reason
,
keep
your
trip
short
and
try
to
take
the
return
flight
as
soon
as
you
finish
your
visit
to
the
shrine(s)
.

Book
a
hotel
room
if
you
find
you
need
to
stay
more
than
a
day
.
Choose
wisely-
remember
you
are
visiting
a
holy
town
for
a
day
or
two
,
you
do
n't
really
need
a
swimming
pool
and
a
spa
during
that
period
.
Do
n't
make
luxury
a
priority
and
pay
for
facilities
you
might
never
use
.
Instead
choose
a
hotel
that
offers
acceptable
levels
of
comfort
and
is
located
close
to
the
temple
.

If
your
hotel
offers
transfers
from
and
to
the
airport
,
you
're
lucky
.
Otherwise
,
hop
onto
a
local
taxi
or
bus
which
will
take
you
to
your
hotel
.
Choose
a
mode
of
transport
that
has
been
approved
by
a
local
government
body
.
That
way
,
you
have
less
chances
of
getting
ripped
off
by
touts
who
abound
in
pilgrim
spots
.

Be
prepared
to
withstand
physical
strain
.
Some
places
require
climbing
several
flights
of
stairs
or
long
hours
of
walking
or
standing
in
queues
.

Safeguard
your
money
.
The
road
to
temples
is
often
lined
with
shops
selling
flowers
,
candles
,
lamps
,
holy
threads
,
cloth
pieces
of
holy
colours
,
food
items
special
to
the
place
,
etc.
The
shopkeepers
often
hound
pilgrims
into
buying
them
and
make
it
appear
as
though
your
trip
will
be
meaningless
without
these
offerings
.
Do
not
feel
obliged
or
get
talked
into
buying
anything
.
Only
buy
if
you
feel
convinced
that
you
must
follow
the
custom
.
Sometimes
,
managing
all
the
paraphernalia
in
your
hands
can
be
distracting
while
you
worship-so
think
before
you
buy
.

Be
aware
about
technology
.
Many
temples
prohibit
the
use
of
mobile
phones
and
cameras
.
You
will
be
asked
to
deposit
your
gadgets
at
a
special
counter
at
the
entrance
,
(
sometimes
for
a
fee
)
that
many
temples
have
,
and
collect
them
later
.

Get
in
the
right
mood
.
At
least
10
minutes
before
you
reach
the
main
spot
,
avoid
chatting
or
laughing
with
those
around
and
make
an
effort
to
quiet
yourself
inside
.
Focus
your
energies
on
God
and
the
reason
you
are
there
.
If
you
know
any
prayers
or
chants
,
repeat
them
to
yourself
.

Buy
yourself
a
souvenir
or
a
book
that
narrates
the
legend
of
the
town
and
the
deity
,
to
share
with
folks
back
home
.

Tips
</head>
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Be
culturally
sensitive
.
Some
temples
prohibit
leather
,
some
do
n't
allow
entry
to
foreigners
inside
the
main
sanctuary
.
Rather
than
argue
with
the
local
authorities
after
reaching
there
,
be
informed
of
these
restrictions
before
and
act
accordingly
.
While
temples
and
mosques
can
be
noisy
,
churches
have
a
hushed
silence
inside
and
it
would
be
disturbing
to
others
if
you
are
strolling
around
with
a
bawling
infant
or
talking
on
your
mobile
.
</item>
<item>
Dress
sensibly
according
to
the
religious
customs
of
the
place
.
Avoid
exposed
limbs
,
which
might
be
considered
objectionable
in
some
places
.
In
general
it
is
better
to
err
on
the
conservative
side
.
If
you
are
a
woman
,
now
is
not
the
time
for
deeply
cut
blouses
or
extra
tight
T-
shirts
or
jeans
.
The
reason
there
is
a
dress
code
for
holy
places
is
so
that
pilgrims
are
not
distracted
and
are
able
to
concentrate
on
their
worship
.
Some
holy
places
require
one
's
head
to
be
covered
with
a
scarf
.
</item>
<item>
Also
dress
according
to
the
temperature
and
whether
the
trip
requires
any
climbing
of
hills
or
walking
for
a
long
time
.
</item>
<item>
Conduct
yourself
in
a
way
in
which
you
do
n't
offend
the
sensibilities
of
other
devotees
and
violate
local
norms
.
</item>
<item>
Be
patient
in
long
queues
.
Do
n't
jostle
and
push
your
way
around
.
Everyone
is
equal
in
the
eyes
of
God
and
there
's
no
reason
you
should
be
allowed
first
.

Warnings
</head>
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Beware
of
touts
and
anyone
who
promises
to
get
you
any
kind
of
deal
.
They
are
likely
to
be
frauds
.
This
is
especially
so
if
you
are
a
foreigner
to
that
country
and
visually
seem
like
one
.
</item>
<item>
In
many
Hindu
temples
in
India
,
people
of
other
religions
are
not
allowed
into
the
main
shrine
.
However
,
you
must
n't
be
disappointed
as
there
is
enough
architectural
splendour
in
the
rest
of
the
temple
to
keep
you
clicking
away
and
ask
the
guide
a
zillion
questions
.
</item>
<item>
If
you
are
asthmatic
or
diabetic
or
have
any
medical
condition
that
may
need
emergency
aid
,
keep
the
relevant
supplies
handy
.
