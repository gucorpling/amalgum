<p>
Rainy
River
is
famous
for
being
frequently
(
though
wrongly
)
seen
as
being
at
being
the
opposite
end
of
Toronto
's
Yonge
Street
,
which
has
led
to
the
street
being
dubbed
the
&quot;
longest
street
in
the
world
&quot;
,
due
to
a
false
conflation
between
the
street
and
Highway
11
,
which
the
street
was
once
the
southernmost
section
of
.
The
street
name
for
the
highway
through
the
town
is
Atwood
Avenue
.

<head>
History
</head>
<p>
Rainy
River
was
formed
around
1895
along
the
east
shore
of
the
Rainy
River
about
2
km
from
the
current
town
centre
by
a
group
of
lumbermen
whose
mill
was
purchased
by
the
Beaver
Mills
Lumber
Company
in
1898
.
The
small
village
took
the
name
Beaver
Mills
until
it
was
incorporated
as
a
town
in
1904
.
In
1901
the
Ontario
and
Rainy
River
Railway
completed
a
bridge
connecting
Minnesota
to
Ontario
,
but
Beaver
Mills
town
site
was
in
the
way
of
the
eastern
end
and
so
they
created
a
new
town
further
up
river
in
between
the
two
large
mills
.
The
only
method
of
transport
at
the
time
was
by
steamship
so
parts
of
the
bridge
arrived
addressed
to
&quot;
Rainy
River
&quot;
.
The
town
eventually
accepted
this
as
its
name
.
</p>
<p>
The
town
grew
rapidly
because
of
the
thriving
lumber
industry
and
its
two
large
mills
and
bolstered
by
the
railway
.
In
1910
,
a
forest
fire
known
as
The
Great
Fire
of
1910
originating
in
northern
Minnesota
swept
north
and
destroyed
the
mills
.
Across
the
south
side
of
the
river
the
two
villages
of
Baudette
and
Spooner
were
completely
burned
out
,
and
much
of
the
population
was
saved
at
the
last
moment
by
a
group
of
citizens
from
Rainy
River
who
backed
a
train
of
box
cars
across
the
bridge
and
pulled
them
out
.
The
mill
industry
relocated
as
a
result
,
contributing
to
a
drop
in
population
from
more
than
2000
people
to
its
current
less
than
800
.
</p>
<p>
Because
of
the
railway
(
now
a
part
of
Canadian
National
Railways
)
,
the
growing
hunting/fishing
tourism
industry
,
the
town
remained
firmly
established
.
The
town
has
had
many
industries
in
the
past
,
a
Rail
Round
House
,
in
the
1960s
the
Rainy
River
Boat
company
,
in
the
1970s
Arctic
Cat
Apparel
among
some
of
the
major
ones
,
all
have
now
closed
and
the
current
town
faces
a
dismal
future
.
