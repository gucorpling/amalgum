authorities
today
declared
an
intent
to
force
web
companies
to
screen
content
for
&quot;
offensive
&quot;
and
&quot;
blasphemous
material
&quot;
.
The
move
follows
failed

<p>
Communications
Minister
Kapil
Sibal
says
&quot;
My
aim
is
that
insulting
material
never
gets
uploaded
&quot;
,
and
that
web
firms
&quot;
will
have
to
give
us
the
data
,
where
these
images
are
being
uploaded
and
who
is
doing
it
.
&quot;
The
government
's
planned
new
policy
is
in
response
to
web-based
firms
informing
him
they
could
not
prevent
such
material
being
uploaded
.
&quot;
They
have
given
it
to
me
in
writing
that
they
will
not
do
anything
until
we
get
an
order
from
the
court
,
&quot;
even
though
&quot;
At
a
meeting
on
4
November
,
we
showed
them
some
of
the
photos
and
they
too
agreed
that
the
photos
were
offensive
,
&quot;
said
Sibal
.
The
disputed
material
was
first
discussed
three
months
ago
.
</p>
<p>
Sibal
calls
the
situation
&quot;
unacceptable
&quot;
and
disputes
the
firms
'
defence
of
being
merely
&quot;
platforms
&quot;
for
others
to
add
material
.
He
claims
they
showed
their
&quot;
intention
was
not
to
cooperate
&quot;
.
Facebook
promised
ongoing
dialogue
in
a
statement
and
&quot;
[
recognise
]
the
government
's
interest
in
minimising
the
amount
of
abusive
content
&quot;
.
They
also
promised
to
&quot;
remove
any
content
that
violates
our
terms
,
which
are
designed
to
keep
material
that
is
hateful
,
threatening
,
incites
violence
or
contains
nudity
off
the
service
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Google
say
they
remove
material
breaching
their
policies
and
to
comply
with
local
legislation
.
&quot;
But
when
content
is
legal
and
does
n't
violate
our
policies
,
we
wo
n't
remove
it
just
because
it
's
controversial
,
as
we
believe
that
people
's
differing
views
,
so
long
as
they
're
legal
,
should
be
respected
and
protected
,
&quot;
the
company
added
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
We
have
to
take
care
of
the
sensibilities
of
our
people
,
we
have
to
protect
their
sensibilities
.
Our
cultural
ethos
is
very
important
to
us
,
&quot;
Sibal
said
today
.
A
response
from
web
firms
of
&quot;
we
throw
up
our
hands
,
we
ca
n't
do
anything
about
this
&quot;
would
not
be
tolerated
.
</p>
<p>
Although
some
reports
suggest
the
spat
has
been
triggered
by
critiques
of
powerful
politician
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonia%20Gandhi">
Sonia
Gandhi
</ref>
,
Sibal
claims
the
firms
have
previously
hesitated
to
respond
to
requests
for
details
of
&quot;
terrorists
&quot;
.
All
the
material
the
government
wishes
to
censor
is
&quot;
absolutely
illegal
,
defamatory
,
pornographic
or
other
similar
kind
of
material
&quot;
says
Congress
spokesman
Abhishek
Manu
Singhvi
.
Material
in
question
includes
cartoons
of
Gandhi
and
Prime
Minister
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Manmohan_Singh">
Manmohan
Singh
</ref>
and
material
mocking
religion
including
an
image
depicting
pigs

<p>
Indian
computer
security
expert
Vijay
Mukhi
rubbished
the
suggestions
.
&quot;
The
idea
of
prescreening
is
impossible
.
How
will
they
do
it
?
...
There
is
no
technology
currently
that
determines
whether
content
is
'
defamatory
'
or
'
offensive
'
,
&quot;
he
told
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Reuters">
Reuters
</ref>
.
This
sentiment
was
broadly
echoed
by
large
numbers
on
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Twitter">
Twitter
</ref>
;
the
tag
#IdiotKapilSibal
was
among
the
nation
's
Twitter
users
'
most-used
today
.
Twitter
and
Facebook
were
the
organising
points
earlier
this
year
for
an
anti-graft
campaign
that
saw
thousands
protesting
and
new
laws
passed
.
</p>
<p>
Internet
companies
insist
too
much
material
flows
through
the
web
to
make
such
screening
plausible
.
Sibal
says
the
firms
are
applying
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/US">
US
</ref>
standards
which
do
not
take
Indian
needs
into
account
.

Indian
security
demands
for
access
to

communications
.
The
government
gave
up
that
request
but
did
manage
to
gain
limited
access
to
some
BlackBerry
communications
.
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Skype">
Skype
</ref>
and
Google
were
told
then
that
local
servers
would
be
mandatory
,
allowing
the
government
to
inspect
emails
.
</p>
<p>
About
100
million
of
India
's
1.2
billion
people
are
online
.
There
are
28
million
Indian
Facebook
profiles
.
Google
says
it
has
received
68
content
removal
requests
from
Indian
officials
this
year
,
and
there
have
also
been
concerns
Google
Earth
could
be
used
to
plan
militant
attacks
.
</p>
<p>
India
's
new
moves
follow
criticism
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_Kingdom">
United
Kingdom
</ref>
earlier
this
year
.
The
UK
proposed
social

restrictions
following
riots
while
the
Foreign
Secretary
simultaneously
criticised
other
nations
using
social

controls
to
limit
protest
.
