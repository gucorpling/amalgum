History
</head>
<p>
Wernigerode
is
first
recorded
in
1121
when
it
was
the
seat
of
the
medieval
County
of
Wernigerode
,
a
status
it
held
until
1429
.
It
was
during
that
time
,
in
1229
,
that
it
was
granted
town
rights
.
Wernigerode
's
heyday
came
during
the
14th
and
15th
centuries
as
it
grew
wealthy
through
trading
in
cloth
,
beer
and
brandy
.
However
,
it
suffered
from
plague
epidemics
in
the
16th
century
as
well
as
the
ravages
of
the
Thirty
Years
'
War
and
fell
into
decline
.
</p>
<p>
From
1645
to
1807
,
Wernigerode
was
the
seat
of
the
County
of
Stolberg-Wernigerode
.
At
the
end
of
the
18th
century
,
the
town
's
economy
picked
up
again
,
this
time
based
on
tanning
and
the
manufacture
of
cloth
and
linen
.
In
1815
it
was
absorbed
into
the
Prussian
Province
of
Saxony
.
During
the
Industrial
Revolution
,
new
metal
and
wood
industries
settling
here
.
The
railways
arrived
in
1872
,
the
same
year
that
the
Harz
's
best
known
brewery
,
the
<hi rend="italic">
Hasseröder
Brauerei
</hi>
,
was
founded
.
</p>
<p>
After
the
Second
World
War
,
Wernigerode
fell
on
the
East
German
side
of
the
Inner
German
Border
in
the
newly-created
state
Saxony-Anhalt
.
Wernigerode
became
part
of
the
restored
state
of
Saxony-Anhalt
in
1990
after
German
reunification
and
did
not
take
long
to
restore
the
beauty
of
its
timber-framed
town
houses
.
Wernigerode
has
a
population
of
about
35,000

Wernigerode
has
a
wealth
of
historic
sights
and
curiosities
.
Without
a
shadow
of
doubt
,
though
,
its
top
sights
are
its
preserved
medieval
castle
overlooking
the
town
and
its
splendid
town
hall
.
But
wandering
around
its
ancient
,
sometimes

the

will
come
across

A
