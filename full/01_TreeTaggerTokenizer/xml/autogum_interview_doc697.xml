The
FCP
Will
insist
that
there
be
no
cover-up
of
information
related
to
the
transmission
of
viruses
,
the
link
between
abortion
and
breast
cancer
and
the
inadequacy
of
condoms
against
some
viruses
.
</p>
<p>
The
Family
Coalition
party
would
create
a
responsible
free
enterprise
climate
,
with
government
intervention
limited
to
the
enforcement
of
the
entrepreneur
’s
responsibilities
in
such
areas
as
work
safety
and
protection
.
</p>
<p>
It
would
reform
the
school
system
to
prepare
young
people
for
assuming
the
challenge
of
change
and
responsibility
for
innovation
,
to
create
a
vibrant
economy
in
Ontario
.
We
will
help
the
private
sector
to
create
jobs
by
reducing
taxes
to
stimulate
investment
and
increase
the
buying
power
of
the
average
citizen
.
</p>
<p>
People
must
keep
in
mind
a
quote
from
my
own
mother
when
speaking
to
a
grade
eight
graduating
class
years
ago
:
The
world
owes
you
nothing
if
you
contribute
nothing
.
</p>
<p>
The
Family
Coalition
Party
will
require
a
person
’s
juvenile
record
to
be
released
upon
the
first
adult
conviction
and
will
require
a
person
who
is
convicted
of
a
violent
offence
for
which
he/she
has
been
previously
convicted
to
serve
the
balance
of
the
previous
unserved
sentence
.
In
addition
the
maximum
sentence
for
the
current
conviction
will
be
doubled
,
without
possibility
for
parole
.
</p>
<p>
We
believe
that
no
person
living
below
the
poverty
line
should
pay
taxes
.
</p>
<p>
The
Family
Coalition
Party
will
restore
freedom
of
speech
of
pro-life
individuals
or
groups
,
including
their
freedom
to
demonstrate
peacefully
in
front
of
hospitals
,
abortion
clinics
or
any
other
place
of
their
choice
.
In
addition
,
The
Family
Coalition
Party
will
urge
the
federal
government
to
restore
full
legal
protection
to
all
human
beings
,
from
the
moment
of
conception
to
natural
death
.

What

</p>
<p>
The
first
order
of
business
in
the
39th
Legislative
Assembly
should
be
,
in
accordance
with
the
wishes
of
the
people
from
across
Canada
as
demonstrated
in
a
recent
pole
,
to
put
an
end
to
abortion
.
The
public
is
also
concerned
with
job
loss
and
crime
in
our
streets
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Are
the
property
taxes
in
your
riding
at
a
fair
level
for
the
amount
of
services
received
in
the
municipality
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
The
Family
Coalition
Party
would
cut
taxes
by
reducing
the
budgets
of
all
government
Agencies
,
Boards
and
Commissions
by
10
%
the
first
year
and
initiate
a
review
the
second
year
with
a
view
of
eliminating
as
many
of
them
as
possible
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
How
can
the
province
lead
the
way
in
stimulating
job
creation
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
The
decision
to
index
support
payment
programs
to
inflation
was
a
positive
move
made
by
the
38th
Legislative
Assembly
,
but
left
most
recipients
still
short
of
what
they
need
to
live
.
The
health
tax
was
a
heavy
burden
placed
on
low
income
members
of
society
.
