Kununurra
</head>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Kununurra
</hi>
is
a
small
town
built
on
big
dreams
.
In
a
remote
corner
of
the
vast
<ref target="Kimberley%20%28Western%20Australia%29">
Kimberley
</ref>
region
of
<ref target="Western%20Australia">
Western
Australia
</ref>
,
its
unaffected
pastoral
feel
makes
a
comfortable
base
from
which
to
explore
the
majestic
natural
attractions
in
the
rugged
surrounding
landscape
.
</p>
<head>
Understand
</head>
<p>
Kununurra
's
existence
is
due
entirely
to
a
grand
engineering
scheme
to
harness
the
Ord
River
,
and
establish
an
agriculture
industry
in
the
area
.
The
town
itself
came
into
existence
in
the
late
1950s
as
a
support
centre
for
the
Ord
Irrigation
scheme
.
A
few
vanguard
families
slowly
spread
their
multi-thousand
acre
properties
across
the
fertile
plain
.
In
recent
years
,
it
has
unceasingly
shaken
off
its
pragmatic
origins
to
develop
infrastructure
for
the
growing
number
of
visitors
to
this
previously
difficult-to-visit
part
of
the
Kimberley
.
From
the
initial
handful
of
pioneering
farmers
,
the
permanent
population
has
now
grown
to
around
7,000
.
The
town
was
officially
gazetted
as
recently
as
1961
.
</p>
<head>
History
</head>
<p>
As
early
as
1882
,
fortune
seeking
pastoralists
and
farmers
have
been
drawn
to
pin
their
hopes
on
the
Ord
River
and
the
wide
open
plains
around
it
.
The
Ords
potential
was
first
identified
by
explorer
Alexander
Forrest
in
1879
.
He
encouraged
graziers
in
search
of
new
land
to
the
area
and
subsequently
built
his
empire
on
leases
of
51
million
acres
.
The
most
well
known
of
these
pastoralists
was
the
Durack
family
,
who
in
1882
drove
7,250
head
of
cattle
and
200
horses
overland
from
<ref target="Queensland">
Queensland
</ref>
to
establish
the
Lissadell
,
Argyle
,
Rosewood
and
Ivanhoe
stations
.
At
Ivanhoe
station
,
north
of
the
present
Kununurra
townsite
,
the
potential
of
growing
crops
on
the
rich
alluvial
soils
of
the
Ord
Valley
became
apparent
and
after
early
experiments
literally
bore
fruit
,
many
acres
of
cattle
country
were
turned
over
to
agriculture
.
It
was
soon
realised
that
the
full
potential
of
the
Ord
to
grow
thirsty
crops
could
only
be
achieved
with
more
water
.
</p>
<p>
Begun
in
1958
,
the
<hi rend="bold">
Ord
Irrigation
Scheme
</hi>
was
an
ambitious
idea
to
capture
the
huge
volume
of
water
flowing
down
the
Ord
during
the
monsoon
for
irrigation
of
the
fertile
plains
along
the
river
's
lower
reaches
and
to
develop
a
productive
agriculture
industry
and
create
a
food
bowl
for
Western
Australia
.
</p>
<p>
The
first
stage
was
completed
in
1963
with
the
construction
of
the
Diversion
Dam
,
creating
Lake
Kununurra
and
feeding
a
network
of
canals
that
supported
31
farms
by
1966
.
Spurred
on
by
this
success
,
the
second
stage
saw
the
building
of
the
Ord
River
Dam
further
upstream
,
subsequently
creating
Lake
Argyle
,
Australia
's
second
largest
artificial
Lake
.
Construction
of
the
335-metre-long
,
earth
wall
dam
was
completed
in
1971
and
ceremoniously
opened
a
year
later
.
The
reservoir
's
initial
capacity
of
a
hefty
5,641
gigilitres
(
equivalent
to
11
Sydney
Harbours
by
some
peoples
estimate
)
was
increased
in
the
early
1990s
,
when
the
wall
was
raised
by
6
metres
to
double
its
current
capacity
to
an
oceanic
10,763
giglitres
.
The
extra
capacity
enabled
a
hydroelectric
power
station
to
keep
spinning
and
provide
the
towns
power
.
</p>
<p>
In
the
early
days
,
farmers
experimented
with
a
range
of
crops
and
had
variable
results
.
Crops
such
as
cotton
and
rice
were
dismal
failures
as
pests
and
birds
ate
them
quicker
than
they
could
grow
.
But
sugar
cane
,
bananas
,
melons
and
mangos
became
very
successful
cash
crops
.
In
recent
years
,
sandalwood
plantations
became
more
abundant
.
A
trial
of
commercial
hemp
proved
to
be
viable
and
production
is
tipped
to
be
expanded
once
the
states
draconian
laws
can
be
modernised
.

Culture

<p>
There
are
a
few
explanations
for
the
etymology
of
the
town
's
name
,
the
most
popular
being
a
mangled
English
pronunciation
of
<hi rend="italic">
Gunanurang
</hi>
-
&quot;
Big
River
&quot;
in
the
local
Miriwoong
people
's
language
.
</p>
<p>
Many
scenes
from
the
movie
<hi rend="italic">

</hi>
were
filmed
in
the
area
surrounding
Kununurra
.

<head>
Climate
</head>
<p>
Kununurra
has
a
tropical
climate
with
two
distinct
seasons
;
the
monsoonal
‘
wet
’
season
and
the
touristy
‘
dry
’
season
.
The
wet
season
starts
around
October
,
typified
by
heavy
rain
,
40°C
days
and
uncomfortable
humid
nights
,
and
ends
in
April
.
The
rest
of
the
year
is
the
milder
,
dry
season
,
bringing
30°C
highs
,
blue
skies
and
the
bulk
of
tourists
.
</p>
<head>
When
to
visit
</head>
<p>
Though
the
dry
is
typically
the
peak
tourist
season
,
the
wet
is
arguably
the
best
time
to
see
Kununurra
.
The
monsoonal
weather
brews
up
billowing
thunderclouds
flashing
with
electrical
storms
that
make
for
some
beautiful
sunsets
.
The
ensuing
downpours
create
rushing
cascades
to
usually
dry
waterholes
and
bring
a
flush
of
new
green
growth
to
the
landscape
.
If
you
can
endure
the
humidity
and
incessant
rain
,
you
will
see
a
Kununurra
that
many
miss
.

Kununurra
is
a
mere
30
km
from
the
<ref target="Northern%20Territory">
Northern
Territory
</ref>
border
,
but
a
long
way
from
anywhere
else
.
The
drive
over
vast
distances
,
through
some
very
isolated
country
to
get
there
should
not
be
taken
lightly
,
though
with
a
bit
of
forward
planning
the
getting
there
can
be
a
great
trip
in
itself
.
</p>
<head>
From
Broome
</head>
<p>
The
easy
way
is
on
the
<hi rend="bold">
Great
Northern
Highway
</hi>
,
taking
about
two
days
to
cover
the
1,044
km
if
you
push
it
.
The
good
sealed
road
passes
through
a
few
small
towns
and
sights
.
The
more
interesting
,
but
harder
way
,
is
via
the
<ref target="Gibb%20River%20Road">
Gibb
River
Road
</ref>
,
taking
at
least
seven
days
to
trundle
over
its
650
km
length
.
The
Gibb
is
an
unsealed
4WD
only
track
across
the
Kimberleys
northern
parts
,
passing
many
gorges
,
waterfalls
and
generally
beautiful
country
.
It
is
prone
to
flooding
in
the
wet
season
and
may
be
closed
entirely
.
It
's
best
to
check
with
the
tourist
bureau
before
setting
out
.
