A
REVELATION
</head>
<p>
A
group
of
boys
was
assembled
in
an
open
field
to
the
west
of
the
public
schoolhouse
in
the
town
of
Crawford
.
Most
of
them
held
hats
in
their
hands
,
while
two
,
stationed
sixty
feet
distant
from
each
other
,
were
“
having
catch
.
”
</p>
<p>
Tom
Pinkerton
,
son
of
Deacon
Pinkerton
,
had
just
returned
from
Brooklyn
,
and
while
there
had
witnessed
a
match
game
between
two
professional
clubs
.
On
his
return
he
proposed
that
the
boys
of
Crawford
should
establish
a
club
,
to
be
known
as
the
Excelsior
Club
of
Crawford
,
to
play
among
themselves
,
and
on
suitable
occasions
to
challenge
clubs
belonging
to
other
villages
.
This
proposal
was
received
with
instant
approval
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
move
that
Tom
Pinkerton
address
the
meeting
,
”
said
one
boy
.
</p>
<p>
“
Second
the
motion
,
”
said
another
.
</p>
<p>
As
there
was
no
chairman
,
James
Briggs
was
appointed
to
that
position
,
and
put
the
motion
,
which
was
unanimously
carried
.
</p>
<p>
Tom
Pinkerton
,
in
his
own
estimation
a
personage
of
considerable
importance
,
came
forward
in
a
consequential
manner
,
and
commenced
as
follows
:
</p>
<p>
“
Mr.
Chairman
and
boys
.
You
all
know
what
has
brought
us
together
.
We
want
to
start
a
club
for
playing
baseball
,
like
the
big
clubs
they
have
in
Brooklyn
and
New
York
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
How
shall
we
do
it
?
”
asked
Henry
Scott
.
</p>
<p>
“
We
must
first
appoint
a
captain
of
the
club
,
who
will
have
power
to
assign
the
members
to
their
different
positions
.
Of
course
you
will
want
one
that
understands
about
these
matters
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
He
means
himself
,
”
whispered
Henry
Scott
,
to
his
next
neighbor
;
and
here
he
was
right
.
</p>
<p>
“
Is
that
all
?
”
asked
Sam
Pomeroy
.
</p>
<p>
“
No
;
as
there
will
be
some
expenses
,
there
must
be
a
treasurer
to
receive
and
take
care
of
the
funds
,
and
we
shall
need
a
secretary
to
keep
the
records
of
the
club
,
and
write
and
answer
challenges
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Boys
,
”
said
the
chairman
,
“
you
have
heard
Tom
Pinkerton
’s
remarks
.
Those
who
are
in
favor
of
organizing
a
club
on
this
plan
will
please
signify
it
in
the
usual
way
.
”
</p>
<p>
All
the
boys
raised
their
hands
,
and
it
was
declared
a
vote
.
</p>
<p>
“
You
will
bring
in
your
votes
for
captain
,
”
said
the
chairman
.
</p>
<p>
Tom
Pinkerton
drew
a
little
apart
with
a
conscious
look
,
as
he
supposed
,
of
course
,
that
no
one
but
himself
would
be
thought
of
as
leader
.
</p>
<p>
Slips
of
paper
were
passed
around
,
and
the
boys
began
to
prepare
their
ballots
.
They
were
brought
to
the
chairman
in
a
hat
,
and
he
forthwith
took
them
out
and
began
to
count
them
.
</p>
<p>
“
Boys
,
”
he
announced
,
amid
a
universal
stillness
,
“
there
is
one
vote
for
Sam
Pomeroy
,
one
for
Eugene
Morton
,
and
the
rest
are
for
Frank
Fowler
,
who
is
elected
.
”
</p>
<p>
There
was
a
clapping
of
hands
,
in
which
Tom
Pinkerton
did
not
join
.
</p>
<p>
Frank
Fowler
,
who
is
to
be
our
hero
,
came
forward
a
little
,
and
spoke
modestly
as
follows
:
</p>
<p>
“
Boys
,
I
thank
you
for
electing
me
captain
of
the
club
.
I
am
afraid
I
am
not
very
well
qualified
for
the
place
,
but
I
will
do
as
well
as
I
can
.
”
</p>
<p>
The
speaker
was
a
boy
of
fourteen
.
He
was
of
medium
height
for
his
age
,
strong
and
sturdy
in
build
,
and
with
a
frank
prepossessing
countenance
,
and
an
open
,
cordial
manner
,
which
made
him
a
general
favorite
.
It
was
not
,
however
,
to
his
popularity
that
he
owed
his
election
,
but
to
the
fact
that
both
at
bat
and
in
the
field
he
excelled
all
the
boys
,
and
therefore
was
the
best
suited
to
take
the
lead
.
</p>
<p>
The
boys
now
proceeded
to
make
choice
of
a
treasurer
and
secretary
.
For
the
first
position
Tom
Pinkerton
received
a
majority
of
the
votes
.
Though
not
popular
,
it
was
felt
that
some
office
was
due
him
.
</p>
<p>
For
secretary
,
Ike
Stanton
,
who
excelled
in
penmanship
,
was
elected
,
and
thus
all
the
offices
were
filled
.
</p>
<p>
The
boys
now
crowded
around
Frank
Fowler
,
with
petitions
for
such
places
as
they
desired
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
hope
you
will
give
me
a
little
time
before
I
decide
about
positions
,
boys
,
”
Frank
said
;
“
I
want
to
consider
a
little
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
All
right
!
Take
till
next
week
,
”
said
one
and
another
,
“
and
let
us
have
a
scrub
game
this
afternoon
.
”
</p>
<p>
The
boys
were
in
the
middle
of
the
sixth
inning
,
when
some
one
called
out
to
Frank
Fowler
:
“
Frank
,
your
sister
is
running
across
the
field
.
I
think
she
wants
you
.
”
</p>
<p>
Frank
dropped
his
bat
and
hastened
to
meet
his
sister
.
</p>
<p>
“
What
’s
the
matter
,
Gracie
?
”
he
asked
in
alarm
.
</p>
<p>
“
Oh
,
Frank
!
”
she
exclaimed
,
bursting
into
tears
.
“
Mother
’s
been
bleeding
at
the
lungs
,
and
she
looks
so
white
.
I
’m
afraid
she
’s
very
sick
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Boys
,
”
said
Frank
,
turning
to
his
companions
,
“
I
must
go
home
at
once
.
You
can
get
some
one
to
take
my
place
,
my
mother
is
very
sick
.
”
</p>
<p>
When
Frank
reached
the
little
brown
cottage
which
he
called
home
,
he
found
his
mother
in
an
exhausted
state
reclining
on
the
bed
.
</p>
<p>
“
How
do
you
feel
,
mother
?
”
asked
our
hero
,
anxiously
.
</p>
<p>
“
Quite
weak
,
Frank
,
”
she
answered
in
a
low
voice
.
“
I
have
had
a
severe
attack
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Let
me
go
for
the
doctor
,
mother
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
do
n’t
think
it
will
be
necessary
,
Frank
.
The
attack
is
over
,
and
I
need
no
medicines
,
only
time
to
bring
back
my
strength
.
”
</p>
<p>
But
three
days
passed
,
and
Mrs.
Fowler
’s
nervous
prostration
continued
.
She
had
attacks
previously
from
which
she
rallied
sooner
,
and
her
present
weakness
induced
serious
misgivings
as
to
whether
she
would
ever
recover
.
Frank
thought
that
her
eyes
followed
him
with
more
than
ordinary
anxiety
,
and
after
convincing
himself
that
this
was
the
case
,
he
drew
near
his
mother
’s
bedside
,
and
inquired
:
