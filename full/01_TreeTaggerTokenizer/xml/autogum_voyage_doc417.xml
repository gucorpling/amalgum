Malda
is
the
base
for
a
visit
to
Gour-Pandua
.
The
area
saw
three
eras
of
glory
-
the
Buddhist
Palas
,
the
Hindu
Senas
and
the
Muslim
Sultans
.
The
Senas
,
the
last
Hindu
kings
of
Bengal
,
were
displaced
by
the
Muslims
in
the
beginning
of
the
13th
century
.
They
ruled
till
the
Battle
of
Palashi
in
1757
.
There
is
no
trace
of
any
shrine
or
structure
of
the
Buddhist
or
Hindu
periods
.
Even
those
of
the
Muslim
period
are
virtually
in
ruin
.
</p>
<p>
During
the
13th-14th
century
Bengal
's
rulers
maintained
a
certain
independence
from
the
Sultans
in
Delhi
.
It
was
also
the
period
of
founding
of
the
Bengali
language
and
the
Bengali
identity
.
The
Iliyas
Shah
dynasty
ruling
from
Gour
played
a
big
role
in
that
development
.
</p>
<p>
The
place
has
variously
been
referred
to
as
Lakshanabati
,
Lakhnauti
and
Jannatabad
