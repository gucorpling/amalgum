Topography
</head>
<p>
Wondergat
is
a
collapsed
cavern
filled
with
water
.
The
hole
is
about
75
x
100m
at
the
surface
and
the
sides
are
near
vertical
to
the
bottom
at
about
36m
.
There
are
caverns
extending
from
the
main
shaft
to
the
north
and
south
at
the
bottom
.
The
bottom
of
these
caverns
slopes
downward
away
from
the
main
shaft
.
There
is
an
overhang
to
the
north
about
half
wat
up
,
and
a
narrow
cave
on
the
south
wall
,
quite
shallow
,
known
as
Leopards
cave
.
