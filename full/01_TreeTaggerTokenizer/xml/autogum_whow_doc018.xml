Make
a
Carrot
Clarinet
</head>
<p>
Clarinets
are
a
musical
instrument
from
the
woodwind
family
.
The
clarinet
is
classified
by
its
cylindrical
shape
and
the
type
of
mouthpiece
used
to
play
it
.
Traditional
clarinets
are
made
from
plastic
or
wood
in
a
factory
,
but
you
can
make
one
at
home
for
fun

a
