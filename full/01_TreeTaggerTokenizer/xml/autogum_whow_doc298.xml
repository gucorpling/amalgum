Safely
Eat
a
Carolina
Reaper
Pepper
</head>
<p>
The
Carolina
Reaper
Pepper
is
the
world
’s
spiciest
pepper
at
1.5
million
Scoville
Units
.
Due
to
this
notorious
distinction
,
many
individuals
on
YouTube
and
other
social
media
formats
have
taken
on
the
“
Carolina
Reaper
Pepper
Challenge
”
in
which
they
attempt
to
consume
this
pepper
.
Although
such
efforts
are
carried
out
with
the
purpose
of
entertainment
,
serious
precautions
need
to
be
taken
into
consideration
in
order
to
ensure
safety
for
the
person
eating
a
Carolina
Reaper
Pepper
and
surrounding
people
.

Consume
a

snack
food
.
Any
irritation
in
your
mouth
,
stomach
,
or
eyes
in
response
to
consumption
of
these
items
is
a
likely
indication
of
low
spice
tolerance
and
signal
to
avoid
eating
a
Carolina
Reaper
Pepper
.

Eat
a
serving
of
a
spicier
item
such
as
a
jalapenos
if
the
item
from
step
1
was
consumed
comfortably
.
If
these
spicier
items
can
be
comfortably
consumed
,
it
is
likely
safe
to
proceed
with
eating
a
Carolina
Reaper
Pepper
under
the
right
precautions
.
If
discomfort
is
experienced
,
chew
on
a
slice
of
bread
to
remove
spicy
chemicals
from
taste
buds
.

even
spicier
item
such
as
cayenne
pepper
if
Step

was
consumed
comfortably

If
discomfort

Purchase
the
Carolina
Reaper
Pepper
from
an
online
store
,
as
it
is
often
not
sold
in
grocery
stores
.
Online
stores
like
PuckerButt
Pepper
Company
and
Amazon
are
reliable
options
,
as
they
provide
packaging
costing
$
1
-
2
per
Carolina
Reaper
Pepper
.

Buy
a
gallon
of
milk
,
antacids
,
and
towel
from
a
local
grocery
store
if
necessary
.
The
milk
and
antacids
help
deal
with
the
discomfort
of
consuming
the
pepper
while
the
towel
help
to
clean
up
a
potential
mess
.

Consuming
the
Pepper
</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Have
a
light
meal
prior
to
consuming
the
pepper
.
Such
a
precaution
significantly
decreases
the
likelihood
of
throwing
up
food
that
is
being
digested
.
A
slow-digesting
item
like
meat
or
oatmeal
is
recommended
.

Mentally
calm
down
before
eating
the
pepper
.
Stress
has
been
shown
to
worsen
an
individual
's
response
to
spicy
foods
.
<figure rend="Meditate for Beginners Step 1 Version 2.jpg">

<item>
Eat
only
one
pepper
at
a
time
,
not
multiple
.
Consuming
more
than
one
pepper
greatly
increases
the
potential
for
body
irritation
and
health
danger
.

Avoid
making
tongue
contact
with
the
seeds
and
inner
pepper
,
instead
mainly
contacting
the
outer
flesh
of
the
pepper
.
The
seeds
and
associated
inner
flesh
contain
the
highest
capsaicin
content
,
making
them
the
spiciest
portion
of
the
pepper
as
capsaicin
is
the
component
that
gives
a
spicy
flavor
.

Thoroughly
chew
the
pepper
.
Swallowing
prematurely
without
fully
breaking
the
pepper
down
greatly
increases
the
risk
of
stomach
discomfort
.

After

the
Pepper
</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Slowly
drink
milk
if
any
irritation
is
felt
in
the
mouth
area
.
Milk
contains
casein
that
binds
to
capsaicin
,
neutralizing
its
spicy
effect
.

<item>
Consume
antacids
if
any
stomach
pain
is
felt
more
than
an
hour
after
pepper
consumption
.
Antacids
will
help
to
reduce
feelings
of
heartburn
and
other
stomach
discomforts
.

Receive
medical
attention
if

pain
is
felt
more
than
an
hour

Such
a
prolonged
body
response
necessitates
medical
treatment

Wash
your
hands
.
Capsaicin
residue
can
remain
on
fingers
after
pepper
consumption
and
can
lead
to
skin
irritation
in
certain
areas
for
the
person
who
consumed
the
pepper
and
other
individuals
.

<item>
Use
a
rag
to
clean
the
table
or
other
areas
that
the
pepper
has
touched
.
Such
areas
can
contain
capsaicin
residue
and
be
harmful
to
those
individuals
who
come
into
contact
with
them
.
