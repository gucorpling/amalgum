Store
Fresh
Mushrooms
</head>
<p>
Mushrooms
can
be
one
of
the
hardest
vegetables
to
store
because
of
how
quickly
they
can
absorb
too
much
moisture
and
start
to
go
bad
.
Keeping
mushrooms
in
their
original
packaging
for
as
long
as
possible
,
storing
loose
mushrooms
in
a
paper
bag
or
paper
towels
,
and
freezing
mushrooms
can
all
help
keep
them
fresher
longer
.

Using

Keep
the
mushrooms
in
their
original
packaging
.
If
you
’re
not
going
to
use
your
mushrooms
right
away
,
it
’s
okay
to
leave
them
in
their
original
cardboard
and
plastic
wrap
packaging
.
The
plastic
wrap
usually
has
holes
which
allow
excess
moisture
to
escape
without
drying
the
mushrooms
out
.

Rewrap
the
mushrooms
with
shrink
wrap
.
If
you
do
need
a
few
mushrooms
right
away
,
make
the
smallest
hole
possible
in
the
original
plastic
covering
.
Once
you
’ve
taken
the
mushrooms
you
need
out
of
the
package
,
rewrap
the
area
you
removed
them
from
with
plastic
wrap
.

Refrigerate
them
.
After
you
’ve
brought
the
mushrooms
home
,
refrigerate
them
in
their
original
packaging
.
Putting
fresh
mushrooms
in
the
refrigerator
slows
down
the
growing
process
and
can
prevent
them
from
going
bad
quickly
.
Using
this
technique
should
keep
your
mushrooms
fresh
for
about
a
week
.

Using
a
Paper
Bag

Put
mushrooms
into
a
paper
lunch
bag
.
If
you
do
n’t
want
to
store
your
fresh
mushrooms
in
their
original
packaging
,
you
can
instead
store
them
in
a
paper
bag
.
The
size
of
the
bag
can
vary
depending
on
how
many
mushrooms
you
’re
storing
,
but
brown
paper
lunch
bags
are
generally
the
best
choice
.

You
can
also
wrap
them
in
damp
paper
towels
before
you
place
them
in
the
bag
.
</item>

</item>
<item>
Leave
the
paper
bag
open
.
Do
n’t
fold
over
the
top
of
the
bag
of
mushrooms
.
Leaving
it
open
keeps
the
level
of
moisture
balanced
.
The
bag
will
trap
some
moisture
.
Leaving
it
open
prevents
your
mushrooms
from
soaking
up
too
much
moisture
.

Store
the
bag
in
your
refrigerator
.
You
should
store
the
paper
bag
of
mushrooms
in
your
refrigerator
,
preferably
in
one
of
the
crisper
drawers
.
This
keeps
the
scent
and
taste
of
other
food
from
getting
into
your
mushrooms
.
Crisper
drawers
are
also
designed
to
keep
fresh
vegetables
fresher
for
longer
.
Using
this
method
should
keep
your
mushrooms
fresh
for
a
week
to
10
days
.

Freezing
Mushrooms

Clean
the
mushrooms
first
.
If
you
do
n't
plan
to
use
your
fresh
mushrooms
within
a
week
or
so
,
you
'll
want
to
freeze
them
to
preserve
them
.
Start
by
rinsing
the
mushrooms
under
water
and
then
letting
them
dry
in
open
air
.
You
can
spread
them
on
a
paper
or
tea
towel
to
catch
the
excess
water
.

Brush
with
towel
or
mushroom
brush
.
Once
the
mushrooms
are
relatively
dry
,
brush
them
with
a
paper
towel
or
mushroom
brush
.
This
gets
some
of
the
more
stubborn
dirt
off
of
them
.

Slice
and
sauté
the
mushrooms
.
Slice
your
mushrooms
into
even
pieces
before
you
sauté
them
.
Using
an
egg
slicer
can
give
you
uniform
pieces
.
Sauté
them
in
one
to
two
tablespoons
of
olive
oil
with
some
salt
and
pepper
to
taste
.

Let
the
mushrooms
cool
.
Once
you
’ve
finished
cooking
the
mushrooms
,
let
them
cool
before
you
freeze
them
.
Spread
them
out
on
a
cookie
sheet
in
a
single
layer
until
they
are
cool
to
the
touch
.

Freeze
in
plastic
resealable
bags
.
Once
the
mushrooms
have
cooled
,
store
them
in
resealable
plastic
bags
and
freeze
them
.
Cooking
before
freezing
them
prevents
them
from
absorbing
too
much
moisture
when
they
defrost
.
