Why
have
you
chosen
to
involve
yourself
in
the
political
process
?
Why
did
you
choose
to
run
in
this
constituency
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
I
was
inspired
to
enter
politics
by
reading
authors
,
Ayn
Rand
and
George
Orwell
.
Soon
after
,
I
looked
at
the
political
landscape
in
Canada
and
noticed
it
was
-
and
still
is-
a
haven
for
Statists
.
</p>
<p>
I
felt
that
those
of
us
that
understand
the
ideological
roots
of
liberty
need
to
involve
ourselves
in
the
political
process
.
</p>
<p>
I
'm
running
for
Don
Valley
East
because
Don
Mills
has
been
my
home
for
31
years
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
What
prior
political
experience
do
you
have
?
What
skills
and
insight
can
you
bring
to
office
,
from
other
non-political
positions
you
may
have
held
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
I
've
been
studying
philosophy
,
history
,
politics
and
economics
for
approximately
20
years
.
I
bring
the
insight
of
having
a
historical
understanding
of
individual
rights
in
the
West
.
</p>
<p>
This
knowledge
has
armed
me
with
the
ability
to
make
sound
,
principled
,
policy
decisions
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Which
of
your
competitors
do
you
expect
to
pose
the
biggest
challenge
to
your
candidacy
?
Why
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
I
have
no
illusions
about
winning
in
this
election
.
I
'm
running
so
that
those
living
in
my
riding
have
an
opportunity
to
vote
for
a
principled
,
non-statist
,
candidate
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
What
makes
you
the
most
desirable
of
all
candidates
running
in
the
riding
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
I
'm
the
only
rationally
principled
,
non-statist
,
candidate
running
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
What
do
you
feel
are
the
three
most
important
issues
to
voters
in
your
riding
?
Are
these
the
same
top
three
issues
that
are
most
important
to
you
?
What
would
you
do
to
address
these
issues
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
There
's
is
no
way
for
any
Politician
to
know
with
certainty
what
the
three
most
important
issues
are
in
their
riding
.
The
question
has
smuggled
into
it
a
collectivist
premise
that
a
Politician
is
some
kind
of
Rousseuian
grand
legislator
who
has
mystical
insight
into
the
&quot;
General
Will
&quot;
of
his
community
.
Many
people
are
concerned
about
excessive
taxation
.
Many
are
concerned
about
the
lack
of
choice
in
Education
and
Healthcare
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
What
should
be
the
first
order
of
business
in
the
39th
Legislative
Assembly
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
Cutting
taxes
,
specifically
,
property
and
income
taxes
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Are
the
property
taxes
in
your
riding
at
a
fair
level
for
the
amount
of
services
received
in
the
municipality
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
No.
There
is
no
&quot;
fair
&quot;
level
.
Who
can
determine
the
&quot;
fair
&quot;
level
?
This
question
presupposes
some
kind
mystical
collective
way
of
determining
fairness
with
regard
to
taxation
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
How
can
the
province
lead
the
way
in
stimulating
job
creation
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
Abolish
the
provincial
income
tax
and
scrap
property
taxes
,
for
starters
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
What
are
your
views
on
the
mixed
member
proportional
representation
(
MMP
)
referendum
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
MMP
would
make
majority
Governments
difficult
-
if
not
impossible
.
It
is
only
by
Freedom
Party
forming
a
majority
Government
where
the
necessary
uncompromising
changes
can
be
made
to
restore
Government
respect
for
the
individual
's
right
to
life
,
liberty
and
property
.

What
role
,
if
any
,
does
&quot;
new
media
&quot;
play
in
your
campaign
,
and
the
campaign
of
your
party
?
(
websites
,
blogs
,
Facebook
,
YouTube
videos
,
etc
)
Do
you
view
it
as
beneficial
,
or
a
challenge
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
They
're
all
beneficial
.
The
party
uses
practically
all
methods
of
new
media
.
