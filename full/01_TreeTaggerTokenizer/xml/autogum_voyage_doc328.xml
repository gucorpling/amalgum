Deokso
is
a
small
town
east
of
Guri
in
the
Gyeonggi
province
of
South
Korea
.
It
is
12
miles
east
of
Seoul
.
</p>
<p>
Deosko
was
for
a
long
time
detached
from
Seoul
,
which
is
visible
in
the
traditional
areas
of
the
town
.
Since
the
opening
of
a
subway
station
,
the
town
has
experienced
an
increase
in
modern
housing
developments
and
general
population
.
</p>
<head>
By
subway
</head>
<p>
Deokso
is
on
the
Jungnang
line
of
<ref target="Seoul%23By%20subway">
Seoul
Subway
System
</ref>
.
The
station
is
around
45
minutes
from
Yongsan
station
and
10
minutes
from
Guri
.
</p>
<head>
By
bus
</head>
<p>
There
are
lots
of
buses
from
all
over
the
province
to
Deokso
which
run
regularly
.
There
is
a
direct
bus
from
<ref target="Incheon%20International%20Airport">
Incheon
Airport
</ref>
which
runs
6
times
a
day
.
</p>
<head>
By
car
</head>
<p>
Deosko
is
accessible
from
nearby
Maseok
and
Guri
in
under
20
minutes
.
</p>
<head>
By
foot
</head>
<p>
It
is
possible
to
walk

Guri
to
Deokso
.
If
you
walk
towards
the
Han
river
and
turn
left
away
from
Seoul
,
it
s
a
soothing
2
hour
walk
to
Deokso
down
the
river
.
</p>

Get
around
</head>
<p>
Due
to
Deokso
's
size
,
the
majority
of
the
town
can
be
seen
on

,
although
buses
and
taxis
are
both
inexpensive
and
frequent
.

The

The

This

747
'
Jumbo

ever
to

was
decommisioned
after
crashing
in

Pizza
School

,
Next
to
the
Train
Station
.
(
Take
a
right
out
of
the
main
entrance
of
the
train
station
.
)
.
If
you
want
cheap
pizza
,
welcoming
service
,
and
above
average
cardboard
then
Pizza
School
is
the
place
for
you
.
Do
n't
let
the
vaguely
education
themed
garish
decor
put
you
off
,
this
is
a
real
gem
.
The
woman
who
runs
the
place
is
very
welcoming
and
has
just
started
to
learn
English
for
her
expanding
foreign
customer
base
.
The
man
who
makes
the
pizza
does
n't
talk
much
though
.
However
what
is
important
to
understand
is
that
meat
pizza
is
only
₩5,000
.
All
you
have
to
do
is
say
combination
pizza
and
the
woman
will
always
say
one
.
It
is
advised
you
say
yes
.
Then
there
will
be
the
phrase
&quot;
10
minute
&quot;
,
which
will
get
cuter
with
every
time
you
order
.
Cheap

The
Galbi
Place
</hi>
,
New
Deokso
(
The
other
side
of
the
train
station
)
.
Galbi
is
a
delicious
treat
enjoyed
by
many
in
Korea
.
This
restaurant
is
the
prime
supplier
of
tasty
galbi
to
hungry
Deoksonians
.
If
you
exit
the
train
station
on
the
side
no
one
else
does
and
pass
GS25
and
turn
left
you
are
on
the
correct
road
.
To
recognise
this
restaurant
look
for
a
large
eatery
with
lots
of
tables
with
grills
in
the
middle
.
Then
,
once
inside
if
you
want
meat
on
your
grill
then
order
galbi
sal
.
Galbi
is
best
enjoyed
in
large
groups
as
this
reduces
the
cost
of
the
meal
.
This
is
the
most
cost
effective
and
taste
effective
restaurant
for
Galbi
in
Deokso
.
