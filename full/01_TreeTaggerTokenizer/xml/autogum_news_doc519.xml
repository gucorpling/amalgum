Four
foreign
men
have
today
gone
before
a
court
in
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Hungary">
Hungary
</ref>
on
suspicion
of
people
smuggling
.
Their
detention
relates
to
Thursday
's
discovery
of
a
lorry
full
of
corpses
in
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Austria">
Austria
</ref>
.
The
death
toll
was
yesterday
finalised
at
71
.

The
lorry
had
been
abandoned
since
Wednesday
on
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hard%20shoulder">

of
the
&quot;
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern%20Motorway">
Eastern
Motorway
</ref>
&quot;
,
near
the
Hungarian
border
.
Roadworkers
became
suspicious
of
dark
liquid
seeping
from
the
vehicle
,
and
responding
police
found
the
bodies
.
Initial
police
estimates
were
that
20
â€“
50
were
suffocated
in
the
back
of
the
lorry
which
was
near
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parndorf">
Parndorf
</ref>
.
</p>
<p>
The
arrested
men
are
thought
to
include
the
vehicle
's
owner
and
at
least
two
drivers
.
Three
are
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Bulgaria">
Bulgarian
</ref>
and
one
is
from
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Afghanistan">

.
Criminal
suspects
in
Hungary
can
generally
be
held
for
72
hours
before
charge
but
prosecutors
,
citing
the
seriousness
of
the
case
,
want
the
period
extended
.
Extradition
to
Austria
is
possible
.
</p>
<p>
Of
the
71
dead
,
59
are
men
,
eight
are
women
,
and
four
are
children
.
The
children
are
thought
to
be
aged
three
,
eight
,
and
ten
years
,
alongside
an
eighteen-month-old
baby
.
&quot;
There
was
also
a
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Syria">
Syrian
</ref>
travel
document
found
&quot;
police
spokesman
Hans
Peter
Doskozil
told
journalists
&quot;
so
of
course
our
first
assumption
is
that
these
people
were
migrants
,
and
likely
a
group
of
Syrian
migrants
.
We
can
rule
out
that
they
were
Africans
&quot;
.
</p>
<p>
The
four
accused
were
escorted
into
court
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kecskemet">
Kecskemet
</ref>
,
central
Hungary
,
by
a
police
convoy
.
Reportedly
the
lorry
traveled
from
Kecskemet
.
Hungary
is
presently
building
a
border
fence
across
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Serbia">
Serbian
</ref>
frontier
,
as
migrants
from
war-torn
Syria
and
other
regions
seek
access
to
the

Area

movement
,
which
covers
most

the

several

After

they

On

removed
