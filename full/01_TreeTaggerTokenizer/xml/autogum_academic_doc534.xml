This
study
adopts
the
system
architecture
thinking
and
ADR
approach
for
the
design
of
the
AI
energy
platform
.
Thus
,
the
results
are
presented
and
discussed
by
focusing
on
the
three
key
constructs
:
the
structure
,
the
behavior
and
components
,
and
the
view
of
the
system
.

System
Structure
:
The
Architectural
Framework
of
the
AI
Energy
Platform
</head>
<p>
The
platform
architecture
may
also
define
the
business/market
layer
from
the
Smart
Grid
Architecture
Model
(
SGAM
)
.
SGAM
has
three
dimensions
:
domains
on
the
<hi rend="italic">
x
</hi>
-axis
(
Generation
,
Transmission
,
Distribution
,
Distributed
Energy
Resources
,
Customer
premises
)
,
Zones
of
ICT-based
control
systems
on
the
<hi rend="italic">
y
</hi>
-axis
(
Process
,
Field
,
Station
,
Operation
,
Enterprise
,
Market
)
,
and
the
Interoperability
layer
on
the
<hi rend="italic">
z
</hi>
-axis
(
Components
,
Communication
Information
,
Function
,
Business
)
.
Therefore
,
the
AI
platform
architecture
contributes
to
enhancing
the
smart
grid
platform
as
it
exists
at
the
moment
to
integrate
the
high
penetration
of
renewable
energy
sources
.
From
this
point
on
,
the
business
layer
is
,
therefore
,
decomposed
into
four
layers
,
those
from
the
4C
framework
in
Table
1
below
.
</p>
<p>
The
4C
systemic
framework
is
applied
in
various
empirical-inspired
digitalization
studies
,
which
is
used
in
this
study
as
the
foundation
for
theory
and
framework
building
.
The
framework
has
been
used
in
value-related
research
in
smart
energy
and
the
smart
grid
.
The
framework
encompasses
four
types
of
value
typologies
in
a
digital
system
(
e.
g.
,
smart
energy
and
renewable
system
)
:
connectivity
,
content
,
context
,
and
commerce
(
as
shown
in
Table
1
)
.
The
4C
framework
resonates
with
the
SGAM
architecture
as
the
formal
system
model
in
the
EU
.
The
framework
connects
the
service
logic
and
value-based
provisioning
and
utilization
within
the
focal
ecosystem
.
</p>
<p>
Each
of
the
4C
layers
is
formed
from
the
smart
grid
architecture
and
shall
integrate
the
different
actors
within
the
value
chain
of
the
smart
grid
infrastructure
.
Therefore
,
the
AI
platform
is
transversal
between
the
energy
actors
but
also
throughout
the
domains
and
hierarchical
zones
of
the
smart
grid
.
In
the
4C
framework
,
the
content
and
context
layers
are
particularly
relevant
to
the
field
of
AI
as
data
and
contextual-aware
services
from
these
two
layers
are
empowered
by
the
technological
infrastructure
.
For
instance
,
AI
and
more
specifically
deep-learning
technologies
have
been
used
for
price
prediction
for
intra-day
trade
in
Nordpool
(
the
Nordic
regional
energy-trading
platform
)
based
on
the
research
of
.
The
simplified
conceptual
framework
developed
and
utilized
in
this
study
is
shown
in
<figure>
Figure

</figure>
and
the
detailed
interconnection
and
integration
between
the
4C
framework
as
the
business/market
layer
of
the
SGAM
are
presented
in
<figure>

</p>
<p>
From
a
technology
perspective
,
the
computation
value
of
a
digitalized
ecosystem
is
realized
through
the
integration
of
AI
technology
and
algorithms
into
the
existing
ICT
systems
.
In
particular
,
the
AI
algorithms
are
developed
and
trained
through
various
frameworks
(
e.
g.
,
TensorFlow
,
PyTorch
)
and
hardware
and
software
computation
resources
.
Building
on
top
of
the
establishment
of
network
connectivity
and
the
extraction
,
collection
,
and
storage
of
data
,
AI
algorithms
are
trained
to
build
meaningful
models
to
enable
the
execution
of
automated
tasks
at
scale
.

System
Behavior
:
AI
Energy
Platform
from
Market
Design
and
Value
Utilization
Perspective
</head>
<p>
Conventionally
,
a
“
simple
”
market
model
suggests
that
the
business
model
is
to
facilitate
the
value
created
in
the
market
to
flow
from
providers
to
users
through
a
central
entity
as
the
aggregator
.
The
concept
paves
the
way
to
the
simple
platform
model
proposed
by
.
The
platform
models
can
be
two-
or
multi-sided
platforms
that
connect
the
heterogeneous
groups
of
value
providers
and
value
users
through
market
mechanisms
such
as
matchmaking
and
bridging
.
</p>
<p>
The
work
of
Gandia
and
Parmentier
describes
the
design
of
a
digital
platform
from
the
value
utilization
point
of
view
.
The
platform
operators
normally
need
to
subsidize
one
side
of
the
platform
such
as
the
platform
service
users
.
In
a
multi-sided
platform
,
the
end-user
may
consume
the
product
,
service
or
other
value
that
is
created
and
provided
by
the
other
actors
on
the
platform
while
producing
value
to
other
actors
.
Furthermore
,
a
multi-sided
platform
can
bridge
a
variety
of
user
groups
to
interact
with
each
other
and
create
positive
network
effects
.
Expanding
this
stream
of
design
for
the
AI
platform
market
led
to
the
incorporation
of
the
work
from
Milgrom
and
Tadelis
that
focuses
on
how
AI
can
impact
generic
market
design
in
two
major
ways
.
