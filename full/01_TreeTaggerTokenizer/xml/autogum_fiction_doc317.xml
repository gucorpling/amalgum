Oscar
Maironi
was
very
poor
.
His
thin
gray
suit
in
summer
resembled
his
thick
gray
suit
in
winter
.
It
does
not
seem
that
he
had
more
than
two
;
but
he
had
a
black
coat
and
waistcoat
,
and
a
narrow-brimmed
,
shiny
hat
to
go
with
these
,
and
one
pair
of
patent-leather
shoes
that
laced
,
and
whose
long
soles
curved
upward
at
the
toe
like
the
rockers
of
a
summer-hotel
chair
.
These
holiday
garments
served
him
in
all
seasons
;
and
when
you
saw
him
dressed
in
them
,
and
seated
in
a
car
bound
for
Park
Square
,
you
knew
he
was
going
into
Boston
,
where
he
would
read
manuscript
essays
on
Botticelli
or
Pico
della
Mirandola
,
or
manuscript
translations
of
Armenian
folksongs
;
read
these
to
ecstatic
,
dim-eyed
ladies
in
Newbury
Street
,
who
would
pour
him
cups
of
tea
when
it
was
over
,
and
speak
of
his
earnestness
after
he
was
gone
.
It
did
not
do
the
ladies
any
harm
;
but
I
am
not
sure
that
it
was
the
best
thing
for
Oscar
.
It
helped
him
feel
every
day
,
as
he
stepped
along
to
recitations
with
his
elbow
clamping
his
books
against
his
ribs
and
his
heavy
black
curls
bulging
down
from
his
gray
slouch
hat
to
his
collar
,
how
meritorious
he
was
compared
with
Bertie
and
Billy
--
with
all
Berties
and
Billies
.
He
may
have
been
.
Who
shall
say
?
But
I
will
say
at
once
that
chewing
the
cud
of
one
’s
own
virtue
gives
a
sour
stomach
.
</p>
<p>
Bertie
’s
and
Billy
’s
parents
owned
town
and
country
houses
in
New
York
.
The
parents
of
Oscar
had
come
over
in
the
steerage
.
Money
filled
the
pockets
of
Bertie
and
Billy
;
therefore
were
their
heads
empty
of
money
and
full
of
less
cramping
thoughts
.
Oscar
had
fallen
upon
the
reverse
of
this
fate
.
Calculation
was
his
second
nature
.
He
had
given
his
education
to
himself
;
he
had
for
its
sake
toiled
,
traded
,
outwitted
,
and
saved
.
He
had
sent
himself
to
college
,
where
most
of
the
hours
not
given
to
education
and
more
education
,
went
to
toiling
and
more
toiling
,
that
he
might
pay
his
meagre
way
through
the
college
world
.
He
had
a
cheaper
room
and
ate
cheaper
meals
than
was
necessary
.
He
tutored
,
and
he
wrote
college
specials
for
several
newspapers
.
His
chief
relaxation
was
the
praise
of
the
ladies
in
Newbury
Street
.
These
told
him
of
the
future
which
awaited
him
,
and
when
they
gazed
upon
his
features
were
put
in
mind
of
the
dying
Keats
.
Not
that
Oscar
was
going
to
die
in
the
least
.
Life
burned
strong
in
him
.
There
were
sly
times
when
he
took
what
he
had
saved
by
his
cheap
meals
and
room
and
went
to
Boston
with
it
,
and
for
a
few
hours
thoroughly
ceased
being
ascetic
.
Yet
Oscar
felt
meritorious
when
he
considered
Bertie
and
Billy
;
for
,
like
the
socialists
,
merit
with
him
meant
not
being
able
to
live
as
well
as
your
neighbor
.
You
will
think
that
I
have
given
to
Oscar
what
is
familiarly
termed
a
black
eye
.
But
I
was
once
inclined
to
applaud
his
struggle
for
knowledge
,
until
I
studied
him
close
and
perceived
that
his
love
was
not
for
the
education
he
was
getting
.
Bertie
and
Billy
loved
play
for
play
’s
own
sake
,
and
in
play
forgot
themselves
,
like
the
wholesome
young
creatures
that
they
were
.
Oscar
had
one
love
only
:
through
all
his
days
whatever
he
might
forget
,
he
would
remember
himself
;
through
all
his
days
he
would
make
knowledge
show
that
self
off
.
Thank
heaven
,
all
the
poor
students
in
Harvard
College
were
not
Oscars
!
I
loved
some
of
them
as
much
as
I
loved
Bertie
and
Billy
.
So
there
is
no
black
eye
about
it
.
Pity
Oscar
,
if
you
like
;
but
do
n’t
be
so
mushy
as
to
admire
him
as
he
stepped
along
in
the
night
,
holding
his
notes
,
full
of
his
knowledge
,
thinking
of
Bertie
and
Billy
,
conscious
of
virtue
,
and
smiling
his
smile
.
They
were
not
conscious
of
any
virtue
,
were
Bertie
and
Billy
,
nor
were
they
smiling
.
They
were
solemnly
eating
up
together
a
box
of
handsome
strawberries
and
sucking
the
juice
from
their
reddened
thumbs
.
</p>
<p>
“
Rather
mean
not
to
make
him
wait
and
have
some
of
these
after
his
hard
work
on
us
,
”
said
Bertie
.
“
I
’d
forgotten
about
them
--
”
</p>
<p>
“
He
ran
out
before
you
could
remember
,
anyway
,
”
said
Billy
.
</p>
<p>
“
Was
n’t
he
absurd
about
his
old
notes
?
“
Bertie
went
on
,
a
new
strawberry
in
his
mouth
.
“
We
do
n’t
need
them
,
though
.
With
to-morrow
we
’ll
get
this
course
down
cold
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Yes
,
to-morrow
,
”
sighed
Billy
.
“
It
’s
awful
to
think
of
another
day
of
this
kind
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Horrible
,
”
assented
Bertie
.
</p>
<p>
“
He
knows
a
lot
.
He
’s
extraordinary
,
”
said
Billy
.
</p>
<p>
“
Yes
,
he
is
.
He
can
talk
the
actual
words
of
the
notes
.
Probably
he
could
teach
the
course
himself
.
I
do
n’t
suppose
he
buys
any
strawberries
,
even
when
they
get
ripe
and
cheap
here
.
What
’s
the
matter
with
you
?
”
</p>
<p>
Billy
had
broken
suddenly
into
merriment
.
“
I
do
n’t
believe
Oscar
owns
a
bath
,
”
he
explained
.
</p>
<p>
“
By
Jove
!
so
his
notes
will
burn
in
spite
of
everything
!
”
And
both
of
the
tennis
boys
shrieked
foolishly
.
</p>
<p>
Then
Billy
began
taking
his
clothes
off
,
strewing
them
in
the
window-seat
,
or
anywhere
that
they
happened
to
drop
;
and
Bertie
,
after
hitting
another
cork
or
two
out
of
the
window
with
the
tennis
racket
,
departed
to
his
own
room
on
another
floor
and
left
Billy
to
immediate
and
deep
slumber
.
This
was
broken
for
a
few
moments
when
Billy
’s
room-mate
returned
happy
from
an
excursion
which
had
begun
in
the
morning
.
