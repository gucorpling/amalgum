Life

<p>
Uccellini
's
life
,
like
many
composers
of
the
17th
century
,
is
not
well
documented
;
however
,
enough
information
exists
to
create
a
rough
biography
.
He
was
born
into
a
reasonably
affluent
noble
family
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forlimpopoli">
Forlimpopoli
</ref>
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forlì">
Forlì
</ref>
,
who
had
owned
land
in
the
area
since
the
early
14th
century
.
Many
members
of
the
family
held
ecclesiastical
posts
locally
,
including
Uccellini
's
father
Pietro
Maria
,
and
it
is
likely
that
Marco
went
to
study
at
the
seminary
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assisi">
Assisi
</ref>
sometime
in
the
early
1630s
.
Evidence
from
his
will
suggests
that
Uccellini
began
his
formal
musical
education
there
,
possibly
under
another
notable
early
violinist-composer
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Battista_Buonamente">
Giovanni
Battista

</ref>
,
who
was
then
serving
as
music
director

at

He
became
<hi rend="italic">
Capo

</hi>
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Este">
Este
</ref>
court

<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modena">
Modena
</ref>
from
1641

and
was
the
<hi rend="italic">
maestro

</hi>
of
the
Modena
cathedral
from
1647
to
1665
.
According
to
payroll
records
and
remnants
of
Uccellini
's
correspondence
,
it
is
clear
that
he
was
a
valued
advisor
and
confidant
to
the
d'Este
family
,
paid
almost
eight
times
more
than
the
other
court
violinists
.
Following
the
devolution
of
the
Estense
Chapel
upon
the
accession
of
Duke
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfonso_IV_d'Este,_Duke_of_Modena">
Alfonso

</ref>
,
Uccellini
was
let
go
from
his
position

However

he
was

remployed
as
the
<hi rend="italic">

court
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parma">

until
his
death
;
he
received
this
job
mainly
through
the
assistance
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabella_d'Este,_Duchess_of_Parma">
Isabella
d'Este
</ref>
,
who
recently
married
into
the
Farnese
family
.
At
the
Farnese
court
,
he
composed
operas
and
ballets
,
but
none
of
this
music
survives
;
thus
,
he
is
mainly
known
today
for
his
instrumental
music

Uccellini
was
one
of
a
line
of
distinguished
Italian
violinist-composers
in
the
first
half
of
the
17th
century
.
His
sonatas
for
violin
and
continuo
contributed
to
the
development
of
an
idiomatic
style
of
writing
for
the
violin
(
including
virtuosic
runs
,
leaps
,
and
forays
into
high
positions
)
,
expanding
the
instrument
's
technical
capabilities
and
expressive
range
.
Like
other
17th-century
Italian
sonatas
,
Uccellini
's
consist
of
short
contrasting
sections
(
frequently
dances
)
that
flow
one
into
another
.
Uccellini
's
innovations
influenced
a
generation
of
Austro-German
violinist-composers
including

Contributions
to
Violin
Playing
</head>
<p>
It
can
be
assumed
from
the
highly
idiomatic
and
virtuosic
nature
of
Uccellini
's
violin
compositions
that
he
was
himself
a
brilliant
violinist
.
Besides
introducing
several
technical
innovations
necessary
to
play
his
difficult
music
,
he
was
an
early
popularizer
of
music
written
explicitly
for
solo
violin
and
continuo
;
at
the
time
,
it
was
common
for
composers
not
to
specify
instruments
in
their
works
,
preferring
to
write
parts
adaptable
between
instruments
of
similar
ranges
.
