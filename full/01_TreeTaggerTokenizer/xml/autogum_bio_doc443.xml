<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Robert
Wilson
</hi>
(
flourished
1572
–
1600
)
,
was
an
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabethan">
Elizabethan
</ref>
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dramatist">
dramatist
</ref>
who
worked
primarily
in
the
1580s
and
1590s
.
He
is
also
believed
to
have
been
an
actor
who
specialized
in
clown
roles
.
</p>
<p>
He
was
connected
with
sixteen
plays
intended
for
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Henslowe">
Philip
Henslowe
</ref>
'
s
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rose_(theatre)">
Rose
Theatre
</ref>
,
in
partnership
with
other
playwrights
who
also
produced
copy
for
Henslowe
.
While
mentioned
as
a
dramatist
by
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Meres">
Francis
Meres
</ref>
in
1598
,
most
existing
information
on
his
dramatic
career
is
derived
from
Henslowe
's
papers
.
</p>
<p>
Since
the
name
is
common
,
it
is
not
certain
that
the
Robert
Wilson
who
worked
for
Henslowe
in
1598-1600
is
the
same
man
who
was
a
prominent
actor
and
occasional
playwright
in
the
1580s
;
yet
many
scholars
consider
it
more
likely
than
not
that
the
records
refer
to
one
Robert
Wilson
and
not
two
.
If
this
is
correct
,
Wilson
was
acting
with
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicester's_Men">
Leicester

in
the
1570s

and
was
praised
along
with

</ref>
for
his
&quot;
wit

&quot;
He
is

as
the

In

years

,
Wilson
worked
with
other

As
to
why
a
writer
would
work
the
way
the
Henslowe
collaborators
did
:
the
careers
of
dramatists
who
worked
mostly
on
solo
projects
,
like
Shakespeare
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Jonson">
Ben
Jonson
</ref>
,
show
that
a
dramatist
working
alone
could
produce
one
or
two
plays
a
year
on
a
dependable
basis
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-3">

</ref>
If
one
of
those
plays
failed
to
sell
,
or
flopped
with
the
audience
,
the
writer
was
severely
affected
.
Collaborative
writing
spread
the
risk
,
and
could
provide
a
more
certain
income
for
a
journeyman
author
.

A
&quot;
Robert
Wilson
,
yeoman
(
player
)
&quot;
was
buried
at
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Giles-without-Cripplegate">
St.
Giles
</ref>
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cripplegate">
Cripplegate
</ref>
on
20
November
1600
.
This
is
consistent
with
the
view
that
the
two
Robert
Wilsons
,
the
player
with
Leicester
's
Men
and
Henslowe
's
dramatist
,
were
one
and
the
same
person
;
it
explains
why
Henslowe
's
Wilson
stopped
writing
in
1600
.
