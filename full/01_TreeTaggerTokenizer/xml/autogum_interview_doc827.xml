On

Does
the
Church
of
Satan
have
relationships
with
other
churches
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
PG
:
</hi>
Not
at
all
.
We
’re
not
ecumenical
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
It
would
seem
there
are
pagans
or
humanist
religions
that
follow
your
general
philosophy
.
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
PG
:
</hi>
I
would
n't
say
that
.
Most
pagan
religions
are
theistic
on
one
level
or
another
.
They
generally
think
their
deities
exist
in
some
part
.
We
do
n't
believe
Satan
exists
as
a
deity
.
I
think
there
are
some
pagans
who
may
look
at
their
Gods
and
Goddesses
as
archetypes
only
,
and
in
that
sense
that
would
be
closer
to
our
position
because
you
can
look
at
the
symbol
of
Satan
as
an
archetype
.
But
,
we
generally
do
n't
feel
we
have
any
relation
to
any
kind
of
religious
organization
.

<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
What
is
the
membership
numbers
for
the
Church
of
Satan
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
PG
:
</hi>
We
never
give
out
numbers
.
The
reason
for
that
our
founder
came
up
with
and
I
agree
with
him
and
keep
to
his
policy
:
if
people
think
there
are
too
few
of
us
,
they
tend
to
not
want
to
take
us
seriously
.
If
they
think
there
are
too
many
of
us
,
they
think
we
’re
a
threat
.
There
was
even
a
point
back
during
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satanic%20panic">
Satanic
Panic
</ref>
in
the
late
1980
’s
and
early
1990
’s
when
there
was
governmental
legislation
proposed
to
ban
Satanism
because
they
thought
there
were
all
these
metal
heads
out
there
sacrificing
babies
,
doing
drugs
and
making
child
pornography
.
Of
course
,
now
we
know
,
it
was
mostly
people
who
were
borderline
Christian
evangelists
pretending
,
but
then
accusing
their
own
family
members
and
getting
them
put
in
jail
,
or
acting
as
therapists
and
most
of
those
people
have
been
sued
and
properly
censured
since
then
.

Has
the
church
thrived
after
LaVey
’s
passing
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
PG
:
</hi>
It
has
.
Partially
because
we
are
taking
advantage
of
technology
with
the
Internet
and
global
media
;
our
website
gets
hundreds
of
thousands
of
hits
a
day
and
literature
keeps
getting
translated
into
many
different
languages
the
world
over
.
My
own
book
,
The
Satanic
Scriptures
,
the
hardcover
came
out
in
April
and
the
paperback
is
coming
out
this
month
.
I
’ve
already
got
five
different
languages
coming
out
and
I
’m
negotiating
for
others
.
We
are
thriving
,
we
have
many
members
.

DS
:
What
is
your
book
about
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
PG
:
</hi>
It
’s
a
collection
of
my
essays
I
’ve
written
over
the
past
twenty
years
talking
about
Satanic
philosophy
,
how
it
’s
applied
.
I
talk
about
music
since
I
am
by
training
a
composer
;
I
went
to
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/New_York_University">
NYU
</ref>
.
I
have
a
Bachelor
’s
and
Master
’s
in
music
composition
,
mostly
focusing
on
orchestral
work
.
One
conception
in
the
book
I
wanted
to
dispel
is
the
stereotype
that
Satanism
is
always
associated
with
Metal
and
the
cookie
monster
voice
.
That
's
Satanism
?
No.
