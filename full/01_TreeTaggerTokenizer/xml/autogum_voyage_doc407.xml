Understand
</head>
<p>
This
town
is
located
in
central
Maryland
,
located
near
the
Major
City
of
Baltimore
.
It
is
a
suburban
town
with
plenty
of
retail
resources
and
one
of
the
better
public
school
systems
in
the
state
.
</p>
<head>
By
car
</head>
<p>
From
the
north
</p>
<p>
There
are
quite
a
few
ways
to
get
into
Severna
Park
but
the
most
commonly
used
route
involves
taking
an
exit
off
of
I-97
which
will
bring
you
to
Ritchie
Highway
road
,
one
of
the
more
central
roads
in
Severna
Park
.
</p>
<p>
From
the
South
</p>
<p>
You
will
most
likely
find
yourself
traveling
on
I-95
until
you
pass
through
the
Washington
D.C.
area
,
then
you
'll
want
to
take
the
US-50
exit
towards
Annapolis
and
then
the
same
exit
leading
to
Ritchie
Highway
</p>
<head>
By
air
</head>
<p>
The
Airport
closest
to
Severna
Park
,
is
the
Baltimore
Washington
International
Airport
.
It
is
located
about
25
minutes
away
from
Severna
Park
,
assuming

Most
airports
will
have
direct
flights
to

a
major

<p>
You
can
also
fly
into
the
Washington
Dulles
International
Airport

near

D.C.
and
close
to
Virginia
.
It
is
a
little
over
an
hours
time
away
from

but
is
most
likely
your
destination
if
you
are
traveling
Internationally
.
</p>
<head>
Get
around
</head>
<p>
Because
the
town
is
so
small
,
the
best
and
most
effective
way
to
get
around
town
is
by
car
.
There
are
also
buses
that
circulate
through
the
town
.
Also
,
in
the
summer
when
the
weather
is
nice
you
can
get
most
places
in
town
by
walking
to
them
.
