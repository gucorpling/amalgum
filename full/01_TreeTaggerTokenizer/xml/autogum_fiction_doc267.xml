CHAPTER
III
—
Chirp
the
Third
</head>
<p>
The
Dutch
clock
in
the
corner
struck
Ten
,
when
the
Carrier
sat
down
by
his
fireside
.
So
troubled
and
grief-worn
,
that
he
seemed
to
scare
the
Cuckoo
,
who
,
having
cut
his
ten
melodious
announcements
as
short
as
possible
,
plunged
back
into
the
Moorish
Palace
again
,
and
clapped
his
little
door
behind
him
,
as
if
the
unwonted
spectacle
were
too
much
for
his
feelings
.
</p>
<p>
If
the
little
Haymaker
had
been
armed
with
the
sharpest
of
scythes
,
and
had
cut
at
every
stroke
into
the
Carrier
’s
heart
,
he
never
could
have
gashed
and
wounded
it
,
as
Dot
had
done
.
</p>
<p>
It
was
a
heart
so
full
of
love
for
her
;
so
bound
up
and
held
together
by
innumerable
threads
of
winning
remembrance
,
spun
from
the
daily
working
of
her
many
qualities
of
endearment
;
it
was
a
heart
in
which
she
had
enshrined
herself
so
gently
and
so
closely
;
a
heart
so
single
and
so
earnest
in
its
Truth
,
so
strong
in
right
,
so
weak
in
wrong
;
that
it
could
cherish
neither
passion
nor
revenge
at
first
,
and
had
only
room
to
hold
the
broken
image
of
its
Idol
.
</p>
<p>
But
,
slowly
,
slowly
,
as
the
Carrier
sat
brooding
on
his
hearth
,
now
cold
and
dark
,
other
and
fiercer
thoughts
began
to
rise
within
him
,
as
an
angry
wind
comes
rising
in
the
night
.
The
Stranger
was
beneath
his
outraged
roof
.
Three
steps
would
take
him
to
his
chamber-door
.
One
blow
would
beat
it
in
.
‘
You
might
do
murder
before
you
know
it
,
’
Tackleton
had
said
.
How
could
it
be
murder
,
if
he
gave
the
villain
time
to
grapple
with
him
hand
to
hand
!
He
was
the
younger
man
.
</p>
<p>
It
was
an
ill-timed
thought
,
bad
for
the
dark
mood
of
his
mind
.
It
was
an
angry
thought
,
goading
him
to
some
avenging
act
,
that
should
change
the
cheerful
house
into
a
haunted
place
which
lonely
travellers
would
dread
to
pass
by
night
;
and
where
the
timid
would
see
shadows
struggling
in
the
ruined
windows
when
the
moon
was
dim
,
and
hear
wild
noises
in
the
stormy
weather
.
</p>
<p>
He
was
the
younger
man
!
Yes
,
yes
;
some
lover
who
had
won
the
heart
that
<hi rend="italic">
he
</hi>
had
never
touched
.
Some
lover
of
her
early
choice
,
of
whom
she
had
thought
and
dreamed
,
for
whom
she
had
pined
and
pined
,
when
he
had
fancied
her
so
happy
by
his
side
.
O
agony
to
think
of
it
!
</p>
<p>
She
had
been
above-stairs
with
the
Baby
,
getting
it
to
bed
.
As
he
sat
brooding
on
the
hearth
,
she
came
close
beside
him
,
without
his
knowledge
—
in
the
turning
of
the
rack
of
his
great
misery
,
he
lost
all
other
sounds
—
and
put
her
little
stool
at
his
feet
.
He
only
knew
it
,
when
he
felt
her
hand
upon
his
own
,
and
saw
her
looking
up
into
his
face
.
</p>
<p>
With
wonder
?
No.
It
was
his
first
impression
,
and
he
was
fain
to
look
at
her
again
,
to
set
it
right
.
No
,
not
with
wonder
.
With
an
eager
and
inquiring
look
;
but
not
with
wonder
.
At
first
it
was
alarmed
and
serious
;
then
,
it
changed
into
a
strange
,
wild
,
dreadful
smile
of
recognition
of
his
thoughts
;
then
,
there
was
nothing
but
her
clasped
hands
on
her
brow
,
and
her
bent
head
,
and
falling
hair
.
</p>
<p>
Though
the
power
of
Omnipotence
had
been
his
to
wield
at
that
moment
,
he
had
too
much
of
its
diviner
property
of
Mercy
in
his
breast
,
to
have
turned
one
feather
’s
weight
of
it
against
her
.
But
he
could
not
bear
to
see
her
crouching
down
upon
the
little
seat
where
he
had
often
looked
on
her
,
with
love
and
pride
,
so
innocent
and
gay
;
and
,
when
she
rose
and
left
him
,
sobbing
as
she
went
,
he
felt
it
a
relief
to
have
the
vacant
place
beside
him
rather
than
her
so
long-cherished
presence
.
This
in
itself
was
anguish
keener
than
all
,
reminding
him
how
desolate
he
was
become
,
and
how
the
great
bond
of
his
life
was
rent
asunder
.
</p>
<p>
The
more
he
felt
this
,
and
the
more
he
knew
he
could
have
better
borne
to
see
her
lying
prematurely
dead
before
him
with
their
little
child
upon
her
breast
,
the
higher
and
the
stronger
rose
his
wrath
against
his
enemy
.
He
looked
about
him
for
a
weapon
.
</p>
<p>
There
was
a
gun
,
hanging
on
the
wall
.
He
took
it
down
,
and
moved
a
pace
or
two
towards
the
door
of
the
perfidious
Stranger
’s
room
.
He
knew
the
gun
was
loaded
.
Some
shadowy
idea
that
it
was
just
to
shoot
this
man
like
a
wild
beast
,
seized
him
,
and
dilated
in
his
mind
until
it
grew
into
a
monstrous
demon
in
complete
possession
of
him
,
casting
out
all
milder
thoughts
and
setting
up
its
undivided
empire
.
</p>
<p>
That
phrase
is
wrong
.
Not
casting
out
his
milder
thoughts
,
but
artfully
transforming
them
.
Changing
them
into
scourges
to
drive
him
on
.
Turning
water
into
blood
,
love
into
hate
,
gentleness
into
blind
ferocity
.
Her
image
,
sorrowing
,
humbled
,
but
still
pleading
to
his
tenderness
and
mercy
with
resistless
power
,
never
left
his
mind
;
but
,
staying
there
,
it
urged
him
to
the
door
;
raised
the
weapon
to
his
shoulder
;
fitted
and
nerved
his
finger
to
the
trigger
;
and
cried
‘
Kill
him
!
In
his
bed
!
’
</p>
<p>
He
reversed
the
gun
to
beat
the
stock
upon
the
door
;
he
already
held
it
lifted
in
the
air
;
some
indistinct
design
was
in
his
thoughts
of
calling
out
to
him
to
fly
,
for
God
’s
sake
,
by
the
window
—
