Twenty
Indians

a
case
against
35-year
old
Madhavan
on
Tuesday

They
claim
they
were
victims
of
a
scam
after
Madhavan
convinced
them
to
invest
in
a
charitable
organization
and
tourist
resort
,
but
allegedly
kept
the
money
for
himself
.
Madhavan
arrived
in
Bahrain
in
2005

<p>
Police
began
an
investigation
into
Madhavan
in
April
after
a
woman
filed
a
complaint
alleging
he
had
promised
to
start
a
business
with
her
after
a
meeting
in
Dubai
,

she
said
he
disappeared
after

,
last
week
from
her
residence
in
Dubai
,
in
order
to
give
testimony
against
Madhavan
.
She
was
greeted
at
the
international
airport
by
police
,
and
is
under
police
protection
due
to
concerns
for
her
safety
.
Her
family
members
told
<hi rend="italic">
Khaleej

that
she
feared
physical
harm
from
Madhavan
or
his
henchmen

Interpol
has
been
investigating
Madhavan
in
allegations
related
to
his
business
dealings
with
Serafin
Edwin
since
2004
.
&quot;
I
am
happy
that
the
police
finally
caught
up
with
him
and
he
is
in
prison
.
He
is
a
big
fraud

everything

comes
out

lie

Madhavan
was
arrested

G.

presented
a

&quot;
They
’re
conducting
all
kinds
of
criminal

material
activities
behind
their
spiritual
exteriors
.
Ninety
per
cent
of
them
are
fake
and
criminals
.
There
are
so
many
swamis
who
have
enlightened
the
hearts
and
minds
of
people
,
but
these
people
are
fakes
with
no
idea
about
spirituality
.
They
are
only
interested
in
women
and
money
and
muscle
power
,
&quot;
said
Sudhakaran
.
Many
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu">
Hindus
</ref>
were
upset
by
Sudhakaran
's
words
,
as
some
devout
Hindus
consider
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swami">
swamis

to
be
above
the
law
and
should
not
be
criticized
.
