The
title
of
my
book
is
SCIENTOLOGY
–
ABUSE
AT
THE
TOP
.
At
the
lower
echelons
of
the
organization
,
the
parishioners
are
&quot;
schmoozed
&quot;
and
treated
with
all
kinds
of
smiles
and
compassion
.
That
's
because
they
pay
for
service
and
promote
the
&quot;
religion
&quot;
to
others
so
as
to
expand
their
ranks
.
So
the
organization
needs
to
keep
them
happy
and
therefore
the
&quot;
internal
laundry
&quot;
of
what
goes
on
behind
the
scenes
is
kept
entirely
hidden
away
.
The
TOP
of
Scientology
is
the
Sea
Organization
.
My
book
describes
the
physical
,
mental/emotional
abuse
that
occurs
day-in
and
day-out
in
the
Scientology
's
Sea
Organization
–
from
their
Rehabilitation
Project
Force
(
which
is
nothing
short
of
a
slave-labor
camp
,
to
which
I
was
assigned
four
times
for
several
years
)
,
to
the
physical
assault
&amp;
battery
committed
on
the
top
executives
by
their
current
leader
,
David
Miscavige
(
which
I
personally
witnessed
on
at
least
a
dozen
occasions
)
.
Somehow
the
Scientology
organizations
are
free
from
outside
inspection
because
they
are
a
&quot;
religion
&quot;
and
therefore
allowed
to
practice
their
religious
beliefs
in
any
way
they
see
fit
.
This
is
dangerous
and
the
information
about
how
far
this
has
gone
needs
to
be
exposed
,
as
it
is
extreme
.

You
left
Scientology
in
2005
,
why
did
you
decide
to
publish
the
book
,
five
years
later
?
</hi>

AS
</hi>
:
When
I
left
in
March
2005
after
being
a
full-time
,
live-in
staff
member
for
a
quarter
century
,
I
had
a
total
of
$
150
to
my
name
.
I
had
no
outside
job
skills
,
never
cooked
and
I
barely
knew
how
to
drive
.
I
had
no
clue
what
I
would
be
doing
to
make
a
living
in
the
&quot;
outside
world
&quot;
.
It
was
not
unlike
being
dropped
on
another
planet
and
having
to
figure
out
how
to
survive
from
scratch
.
</p>
<p>
After
I
became
stable
and
saved
up
some
money
,
I
began
writing
.
As
I
wrote
,
I
realized
how
important
it
was
to
get
my
story
out
.
This
&quot;
religion
&quot;
promotes
how
their
purpose
is
to
create
a
sane
world
without
criminality
,
etc.
and
the
more
I
was
OUT
of
their
grip
,
the
more
I
realized
just
how
insane
and
criminal
they
really
are
.
I
learned
about
the
Universal
Declarations
for
Human
Rights
and
saw
how
many
points
I
personally
knew
were
violated
by
the
Scientology
organization
with
their
members
.
I
learned
about
laws
of
the
land
(
which
I
had
been
entirely
ignorant
of
while
a
staff
member
)
and
realized
some
of
the
acts
that
I
witnessed
were
actual
violations
of
the
LAW
.
