<p>
The
world
and
the
United
States
would
be
much
better
off
if
we
were
n't
all
relying
on
a
small
region
of
the
world
for
the
lifeblood
of
our
economies
.
The
only
way
to
bring
the
price
of
oil
down
is
to
make
it
less
valuable
and
the
only
way
to
do
that
is
to
develop
alternative
energy
sources
that
can
replace
oil
in
everyday
life
.
Not
only
would
this
be
good
for
the
country
and
for
the
future
,
but
it
would
also
go
a
long
ways
to
reducing
Greenhouse
gas
emissions
.
</p>
<p>
For
that
reason
,
I
am
proposing
the
following
Energy
Plan
for
the
United
States
(
and
the
world
)
in
the
following
3
steps
.
</p>
<p>
Short
Term
-
Conservation
and
Alternative
Power
</p>
<p>
Five
to
Thirty
Years
-
A
Strong
Nuclear
Program
</p>
<p>
Long
Term
-
We
Need
New
Technologies
â€“
A
Manhattan
Project
for
Energy
Independence
</p>

for
more
details
on
this
and
other
policies
my
administration
will
be
following
.
</p>
<p>
Second
,
the
next
biggest
problem
facing
us
now
and
for
generations
to
come
is
our
fiscal
irresponsibility
.
</p>
<p>
There
are
fewer
topics
concerning
our
current
political
landscape
that
get
me
more
upset
than
the
fiscal
irresponsibility
of
our
Congress
and
President
.
As
President
,
I
promise
to
veto
any
and
all
bills
that
include
the
barrels
of
pork
as
discussed
below
.
If
we
do
n't
get
our
country
back
on
a
footing
of
fiscal
responsibility
soon
,
we
are
going
to
leave
a
bankrupt
,
second
level
economy
to
our
children
and
grandchildren
.
The
President
is
our
leader
and
he
needs
to
act
like
one
and
do
what
is
right
for
the
country
now
and
in
the
future
.
</p>
<p>
Under
the
&quot;
fiscal
restraint
&quot;
of
the
Republicans
our
deficit
has
ballooned
and
spending
has
increased
(
even
ignoring
the
war
in
Iraq
)
at
a
greater
pace
than
at
almost
any
time
in
the
history
of
our
country
.
There
was
the
hope
and
,
as
we
were
promised
by
the
Democrats
during
the
last
Congressional
elections
,
that
they
would
show
some
fiscal
restraint
and
get
the
country
back
on
a
path
of
fiscal
responsibility
,
but
the
current
Congress
has
shown
they
can
even
outspend
the
spendthrift
Republicans
.
Without
a
truly
Independent
President
our
spending
will
never
go
down
as
they
will
always
be
trying
to
buy
votes
for
the
parties
.
</p>
<p>
Third
,
the
next
biggest
problem
facing
us
now
is
illegal
immigration
.
</p>
<p>
The
facts
are
simple
.
The
President
and
his
administration
have
conspired
with
the
large
business
and
agricultural
interests
in
our
country
to
artificially
depress
and
hold-down
wages
.
They
have
done
this
at
a
tremendous
cost
to
all
law-abiding
,
tax-paying
American
citizens
and
it
needs
to
stop
now
!
It
is
also
in
the
process
of
bankrupting
a
large
number
of
our
states
,
counties
and
cities
because
of
the
cost
of
dealing
with
illegal
immigrants
and
their
families
.
If
the
illegal
immigration
problem
had
not
occurred
most
state
and
local
governments
would
be
in
a
financing
surplus
situation
and
wages
across
the
board
for
entry
level
jobs
would
be
higher
.
