Carbohydrate
Dynamics
of
Plant
Cold
Acclimation
</head>
<p>
Carbohydrates
are
the
primary
products
of
photosynthesis
,
and
they
play
a
central
role
in
energy
metabolism
,
developmental
processes
,
stress
signalling
and
temperature
acclimation
.
Reprogramming
of
primary
metabolism
during
cold
acclimation
typically
results
in
the
accumulation
of
soluble
sugars
,
sugar
alcohols
,
organic
acids
,
amino
acids
,
polyamines
and
substrates
for
secondary
metabolites
.
This
accumulation
eventually
allows
plants
to
withstand
lower
temperatures
when
compared
to
non-acclimated
plants
.
Sugars
play
diverse
roles
which
are
,
e.
g.
,
stabilization
of
membranes
,
osmo-protection
,
and
protection
of
proteins
from
desiccation
.
Further
,
sugar
accumulation
might
also
result
from
reduced
sink
activity
because
growth
retardation
at
low
temperatures
is
stronger
than
the
reduction
of
photosynthetic
activity
.
In
general
,
reactions
in
primary
metabolism
are
tightly
regulated
and
closely
linked
to
the
circadian
clock
to
ensure
continuous
carbohydrate
availability
.
Clock
components
are
significantly
influenced
by
low
temperature
and
sugars
are
also
known
to
be
important
for
entrainment
of
the
clock
.
Besides
the
clock
components
,
light
itself
is
deemed
to
be
essential
for
cold
acclimation
.
</p>
<p>
It
has
been
suggested
that
carbohydrates
directly
influence
cell
membrane
stability
by
interacting
with
the
membrane
interface
and
therefore
support
the
maintenance
of
membrane
integrity
under
freezing
conditions
.
For
example
,
sucrose
can
interact
with
the
phosphate
in
lipid
headgroups
,
thereby
decreasing
membrane
permeability
.
Carbohydrates
have
been
found
to
stabilize
in
vitro
liposomes
against
leakage
of
aqueous
content
,
which
suggests
a
cryoprotective
role
in
vivo
.
Fructans
have
been
found
to
move
via
vesicle
transport
from
vacuoles
to
the
apoplast
where
they
can
assist
in
stabilizing
the
plasma
membrane
.
Further
,
sugar
transport
proteins
are
believed
to
play
a
role
in
vacuolar
fructan
export
.
Raffinose
family
oligosaccharides
(
RFOs
)
are
known
to
protect
membranes
under
cold
stress
and
contribute
to
higher
freezing
resistance
.
Raffinose
is
synthesised
within
the
cytosol
and
transported
into
plastids
to
protect
thylakoid
membranes
,
contributing
to
PSII
integrity
and
acting
as
a
potential
ROS
scavenger
.
Furthermore
,
hydrogen
bonds
between
sugars
and
proteins
are
discussed
to
inhibit
dehydration-induced
protein
unfolding
.

Starch
is
a
direct
product
of
photosynthesis
and
a
storage
compound
for
carbon
.
Starch
biosynthesis
and
breakdown
are
tightly
regulated
during
abiotic
stress
.
Many
enzymes
involved
in
starch
metabolism
are
redox
regulated
.
During
cold
stress
,
starch
metabolism
in
<hi rend="italic">
Arabidopsis
</hi>
has
great
flexibility
in
the
way
it
reacts
to
differences
in
growth
conditions
and
it
is
a
determinant
of
plant
fitness
under
abiotic
stress
.
Starch
degradation
is
an
initial
response
as
starch
metabolism
has
the
potential
to
relieve
product
inhibition
effects
on
Calvin
cycle-associated
enzymes
and
might
allow
the
release
of
Pi
in
chloroplasts
under
cold
.
Increased
activity
of
beta-amylases
supplements
maltose
accumulation
during
cold
exposure
.
Further
,
mobilisation
of
starch
seems
to
differ
between
different
natural
accessions
of
<hi rend="italic">
Arabidopsis
</hi>
and
might
influence
their
cold
acclimation
capacities
.
Interestingly
,
impairment
of
plastidial
α-glucan
phosphorylase
resulted
in
no
significant
changes
in
the
starch
content
of
<hi rend="italic">
Arabidopsis
</hi>
leaves
,
but
reduced
survival
under
stress
.
This
highlights
that
the
dynamics
of
synthesis
and
breakdown
pathways
rather
than
the
absolute
amount
of
starch
might
be
responsible
for
metabolic
reprogramming
and
survival
under
abiotic
stress
.
Starch
has
several
roles
in
both
source
and
sink
tissues
and
starch
degradation
into
sugars
has
a
pivotal
role
for
plant
cold
stress
responses
via
offering
osmo-protective
sugars
and
rapid
energy
supplies
.
</p>
<p>
Maltose
,
a
product
of
starch
degradation
,
might
serve
as
a
direct
osmo-protectant
in
chloroplasts
by
protecting
stromal
proteins
from
dehydration
.
Maltose
supplies
biosynthesis
of
other
carbohydrates
like
hexoses
and
raffinose
,
but
also
proline
to
fuel
and
maintain
carbon
metabolism
.
A
direct
correlation
between
freezing
tolerance
in
<hi rend="italic">
Arabidopsis
</hi>
accessions
and
the
degree
of
accumulation
of
raffinose
and
proline
has
been
observed
.
Proline
is
well-known
to
accumulate
during
stress
response
,
affecting
signaling
events
,
cryoprotection
and
redox
balance
in
several
plant
species
.
In
a
protein-protein
interaction
network
,
delta
1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate
synthase
2
(
P5CS2
)
,
which
is
a
central
enzyme
in
proline
biosynthesis
,
indicated
a
linkage
to
heat-shock
proteins
and
to
the
interface
of
primary
and
secondary
metabolism
.
In
general
,
gene
expression
related
to
secondary
metabolism
is
well
correlated
with
freezing
tolerance
.
In
<hi rend="italic">
Arabidopsis
</hi>
,
biosynthesis
of
secondary
metabolites
,
e.
g.
,
flavonoids
,
is
induced
during
cold
exposure
.
The
substance
class
of
flavonoids
is
estimated
to
comprise
more
than
8000
metabolites
and
flavonoid
metabolism
may
comprise
20
%
of
the
total
carbon
flux
in
a
plant
cell
.
Flavonoids
frequently
contain
sugars
like
rhamnose
,
arabinose
,
glucose
,
galactose
,
which
directly
shows
the
necessity
of
a
regulatory
and
metabolic
interaction
between
plant
carbohydrates
and
secondary
metabolism
during
cold
acclimation
.
Several
flavonoid
biosynthesis
mutants
with
reduced
flavonoid
content
showed
impaired
freezing
tolerance
,
and
the
contribution
of
flavonoids
to
freezing
tolerance
was
shown
to
be
genotype-dependent
.
Flavonoid
metabolism
was
found
to
be
regulated
via
post-transcriptional
mechanisms
as
the
corresponding
transcripts
and
metabolites
correlated
poorly
in
response
to
cold
.
