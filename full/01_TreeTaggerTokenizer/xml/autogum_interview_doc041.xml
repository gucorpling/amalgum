the

Why
are
you
a

:
I
have
always
considered
myself
to
be
a
Democrat
,
although
what
that
term
means
has
shifted
over
the
years
.
I
probably
best
fit
the
term
&quot;
Kennedy
Democrat
&quot;
because
I
am
a
strong
advocate
of
social
equality
and
freedom
but
I
believe
we
must
be
fiscally
responsible
as
well
.
While
that
may
not
fit
the
current
narrative
of
modern
liberalism
that
favors
social
justice
and
a
mixed
economy
leaning
toward
an
ever
increasing
presence
of
government
regulation
and
assistance
,
it
reflects
what
I
truly
believe
.
</p>
<p>
I
think
,
during
the
modern
era
,
Democrats
have
been
the
primary
political
catalyst
for
social
equality
and
change
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John%20F.%20Kennedy">
President
Kennedy
</ref>
had
a
unique
ability
to
bring
both
sides
of
the
aisle
together
to
[
make
]
progress
in
that
regard
,
but
he
also
recognized
that
government
regulation
bore
a
cost
and
could
pose
a
threat
if
it
was
used
in
an
unbridled
fashion
.
We
seem
to
have
forgotten
that
concept
.
</p>
<p>
Conservatives
are
relatively
adverse
to
change
.
I
am
not
.
I
simply
think
change
needs
to
[
be
]
achieved
in
a
responsible
manner
and
that
federal
officials
should
recognize
their
[
responsibility
]
to
serve
as
stewards
of
the
taxpayers
'
money
.
</p>
<p>
I
also
think
we
need
to
figure
out
how
to
provide
more
opportunities
for
people
rather
than
just
mask
the
symptoms
with
assistance
.
The
goal
of
government
assistance
should
always
be
to
provide
it
as
a
temporary
bridge
rather
than
a
permanent
foundation
.
When
we
lose
sight
of
this
,
we
create
programs
that
deepen
our
problems
rather
than
resolve
them
.
</p>
<p>
I
clearly
do
n't
fit
the
Republican
mindset
when
it
comes
to
my
position
on
social
issues
.
However
,
I
'm
sure
I
cause
discomfort
for
some
Democrats
who
think
that
the
government
is
the
solution
to
every
problem
.
My
real
world
experience
in
business
and
my
exposure
to
the
economies
of
other
countries
have
given
me
a
different
perspective
;
one
that
compels
me
to
assess
government
programs
from
a
rational
basis
as
well
as
an
emotional
one
.
</p>
<p>
I
think
there
's
room
in
the
Democratic
Party
for
that
type
of
mindset
.

Well
,
imagine

the

</p>
<p>
What
I
know
I
can
achieve
is
to
broaden
the
active
Democratic
base
.
The
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic%20and%20Latino%20Americans">
Hispanic
community
</ref>
in
this
country
has
been
relatively
inactive
from
a
political
perspective
.
While
it
represents
a
sizable
element
of
the
Party
's
foundation
,
it
is
somewhat
underrepresented
in
elected
office
and
does
not
participate
in
the
electoral
process
to
the
degree
it
should
.
I
can
spotlight
the
importance
of
registering
to
vote
and
participating
in
the
process
within
the
Hispanic
community
because
my
candidacy
has
attracted
some
attention
in
that
regard
.
I
hope
I
will
encourage
other
minorities
and
underrepresented
groups
to
become
more
engaged
as
well
.
