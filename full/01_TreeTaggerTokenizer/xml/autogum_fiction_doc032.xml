Chapter
24
</head>
<p>
Sometimes
lolling
upon
Tantor
's
back
,
sometimes
roaming
the
jungle
in
solitude
,
Korak
made
his
way
slowly
toward
the
West
and
South
.
He
made
but
a
few
miles
a
day
,
for
he
had
a
whole
lifetime
before
him
and
no
place
in
particular
to
go
.
Possibly
he
would
have
moved
more
rapidly
but
for
the
thought
which
continually
haunted
him
that
each
mile
he
traversed
carried
him
further
and
further
away
from
Meriem
--
no
longer
his
Meriem
,
as
of
yore
,
it
is
true
!
but
still
as
dear
to
him
as
ever
.
</p>
<p>
Thus
he
came
upon
the
trail
of
The
Sheik
's
band
as
it
traveled
down
river
from
the
point
where
The
Sheik
had
captured
Meriem
to
his
own
stockaded
village
.
Korak
pretty
well
knew
who
it
was
that
had
passed
,
for
there
were
few
in
the
great
jungle
with
whom
he
was
not
familiar
,
though
it
had
been
years
since
he
had
come
this
far
north
.
He
had
no
particular
business
,
however
,
with
the
old
Sheik
and
so
he
did
not
propose
following
him
--
the
further
from
men
he
could
stay
the
better
pleased
he
would
be
--
he
wished
that
he
might
never
see
a
human
face
again
.
Men
always
brought
him
sorrow
and
misery
.
</p>
<p>
The
river
suggested
fishing
and
so
he
dawdled
upon
its
shores
,
catching
fish
after
a
fashion
of
his
own
devising
and
eating
them
raw
.
When
night
came
he
curled
up
in
a
great
tree
beside
the
stream
--
the
one
from
which
he
had
been
fishing
during
the
afternoon
--
and
was
soon
asleep
.
Numa
,
roaring
beneath
him
,
awoke
him
.
He
was
about
to
call
out
in
anger
to
his
noisy
neighbor
when
something
else
caught
his
attention
.
He
listened
.
Was
there
something
in
the
tree
beside
himself
?
Yes
,
he
heard
the
noise
of
something
below
him
trying
to
clamber
upward
.
Presently
he
heard
the
click
of
a
crocodile
's
jaws
in
the
waters
beneath
,
and
then
,
low
but
distinct
:
&quot;
By
George
!
The
beggar
nearly
got
me
.
&quot;
The
voice
was
familiar
.
</p>
<p>
Korak
glanced
downward
toward
the
speaker
.
Outlined
against
the
faint
luminosity
of
the
water
he
saw
the
figure
of
a
man
clinging
to
a
lower
branch
of
the
tree
.
Silently
and
swiftly
the
ape-man
clambered
downward
.
He
felt
a
hand
beneath
his
foot
.
He
reached
down
and
clutched
the
figure
beneath
him
and
dragged
it
up
among
the
branches
.
It
struggled
weakly
and
struck
at
him
;
but
Korak
paid
no
more
attention
than
Tantor
to
an
ant
.
He
lugged
his
burden
to
the
higher
safety
and
greater
comfort
of
a
broad
crotch
,
and
there
he
propped
it
in
a
sitting
position
against
the
bole
of
the
tree
.
Numa
still
was
roaring
beneath
them
,
doubtless
in
anger
that
he
had
been
robbed
of
his
prey
.
Korak
shouted
down
at
him
,
calling
him
,
in
the
language
of
the
great
apes
,
&quot;
Old
green-eyed
eater
of
carrion
,
&quot;
&quot;
Brother
of
Dango
,
&quot;
the
hyena
,
and
other
choice
appellations
of
jungle
opprobrium
.
</p>
<p>
The
Hon.
Morison
Baynes
,
listening
,
felt
assured
that
a
gorilla
had
seized
upon
him
.
He
felt
for
his
revolver
,
and
as
he
was
drawing
it
stealthily
from
its
holster
a
voice
asked
in
perfectly
good
English
,
&quot;
Who
are
you
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Baynes
started
so
that
he
nearly
fell
from
the
branch
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
My
God
!
&quot;
he
exclaimed
.
&quot;
Are
you
a
man
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
What
did
you
think
I
was
?
&quot;
asked
Korak
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
A
gorilla
,
&quot;
replied
Baynes
,
honestly
.
</p>
<p>
Korak
laughed
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Who
are
you
?
&quot;
he
repeated
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
'm
an
Englishman
by
the
name
of
Baynes
;
but
who
the
devil
are
you
?
&quot;
asked
the
Hon.
Morison
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
They
call
me
The
Killer
,
&quot;
replied
Korak
,
giving
the
English
translation
of
the
name
that
Akut
had
given
him
.
And
then
after
a
pause
during
which
the
Hon.
Morison
attempted
to
pierce
the
darkness
and
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
features
of
the
strange
being
into
whose
hands
he
had
fallen
,
&quot;
You
are
the
same
whom
I
saw
kissing
the
girl
at
the
edge
of
the
great
plain
to
the
East
,
that
time
that
the
lion
charged
you
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Yes
,
&quot;
replied
Baynes
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
What
are
you
doing
here
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
The
girl
was
stolen
--
I
am
trying
to
rescue
her
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Stolen
!
&quot;
The
word
was
shot
out
like
a
bullet
from
a
gun
.
&quot;
Who
stole
her
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
The
Swede
trader
,
Hanson
,
&quot;
replied
Baynes
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Where
is
he
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Baynes
related
to
Korak
all
that
had
transpired
since
he
had
come
upon
Hanson
's
camp
.
Before
he
was
done
the
first
gray
dawn
had
relieved
the
darkness
.
Korak
made
the
Englishman
comfortable
in
the
tree
.
He
filled
his
canteen
from
the
river
and
fetched
him
fruits
to
eat
.
Then
he
bid
him
good-bye
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
am
going
to
the
Swede
's
camp
,
&quot;
he
announced
.
&quot;
I
will
bring
the
girl
back
to
you
here
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
shall
go
,
too
,
then
,
&quot;
insisted
Baynes
.
&quot;
It
is
my
right
and
my
duty
,
for
she
was
to
have
become
my
wife
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Korak
winced
.
&quot;
You
are
wounded
.
You
could
not
make
the
trip
,
&quot;
he
said
.
&quot;
I
can
go
much
faster
alone
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Go
,
then
,
&quot;
replied
Baynes
;
&quot;
but
I
shall
follow
.
It
is
my
right
and
duty
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
As
you
will
,
&quot;
replied
Korak
,
with
a
shrug
.
If
the
man
wanted
to
be
killed
it
was
none
of
his
affair
.
He
wanted
to
kill
him
himself
,
but
for
Meriem
's
sake
he
would
not
.
If
she
loved
him
then
he
must
do
what
he
could
to
preserve
him
,
but
he
could
not
prevent
his
following
him
,
more
than
to
advise
him
against
it
,
and
this
he
did
,
earnestly
.
