Given
that
the
UK
,
USA
have
strained
political
relations
with
North
Korea
,
what
is
the
purpose
of
these
scientists
working
together
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Dr.
Robert
Kelly
</hi>
:
Mt
Paektu
erupted
massively
about
1100
years
ago
and
has
been
dormant
since
.
Recently
there
has
been
seismic
activity
,
and
should
it
explode
again
,
it
could
be
gigantic
—
and
devastating
.
It
is
everyone
's
interest
in
East
Asia
to
know
about
such
a
possibility
,
so
this
kind
of
cooperation
can
be
above
politics
.
But
it
is
also
always
good
to
engage
North
Korea
to
try
to
draw
them
out
.
Such
engagement
can
occur
in
nonpolitical
,
technical
areas
like
this
most
easily
.

Does
North
Korea
understand
that
it
needs
the
specialism
of
British
and
American
scientists
to
plan
for
when
the
volcano
erupts
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
RK
</hi>
:
It
does
.
North
Korea
does
actually
engage
in
various
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track%20II%20diplomacy">
track
II
programming
</ref>
,
including
student
and
administrative
exchanges
.
This
is
not
well-known
due
to
the
nuclear
issue
however
.
The
North
Korean
government
is
aware
of
its
technological
backwardness
,
and
they
often
dangle
concessions
to
other
states
in
exchange
for
tech
transfers
like
this
.

The
North
Korea
underground
nuclear
test
site
is
very
close
to
the
volcano
,
do
you
think
this
affected
North
–
South
Korean
relations
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
RK
</hi>
:
Not
very
much
.
It
does
upset
South
Koreans
somewhat
,
because
Mt
.
Paektu
is
actually
[
a
]
national
landmark
.
It
is
the
mythological
birthplace
of
the
Korean
people
.
And
there
is
some
scientific
concern
that
major
seismic
activity
could
impact
nuclear
facilities
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">

Do
you
think
that
the
field
work
being
carried
out
by
the
scientists
,
being
near
a
militarised
border
is
very
difficult
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
RK
</hi>
:
No
,
because
it
is
in
the
interest
of
all
local
parties
—
NK
,
Chinese
,
even
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Russia">
Russian
</ref>
—
that
Mt
.
Paektu
is
properly
monitored
.
Indeed
,
I
could
imagine
that
,
behind
the
scenes
,
the
Chinese
pushed
North
Korea
toward
this
cooperation
,
as
this
is
somewhat
unusual
for
NK
.

May
the
North
Koreans
be
wary
and
suspicious
of
their
British
and
American
counterparts
,
given
the
secretiveness
of
the
state
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
RK

:
Absolutely
.
I
have
been
to
NK
,
and
I
can
say
positively
that
the
scientists
will
be
monitored
and
accompanied
at
all
times
they
are
away
from
their
hotels
.
They
will
also
be
isolated
from
the
NK
wider
population
.
They
will
only
interact
with
specially
chosen
minders
who
speak
excellent
English
and
have
proven
their
loyalty
to
the
state
.
And
there
will
be
security
personnel
with
them
at
all
times
outside
their
hotels
too
.

Do
you
think
that
Western
scientists
collaborating
together
with
the
North
Koreans
could
set
as
an
example
of
political
things
to
see
in
the
future
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
RK
</hi>
:
Not
really
.
I
hope
so
,
but
North
Korean[sic
]
has
a
tendency
to
pretend
to
open
itself
,
and
then
to
re-close
after
it
gets
what
it
wants
.
All
sorts
of
interaction
with
North
Korea
gets
hyped
as
'
a
new
beginning
'
or
a
'
historic
opening
,
'
only
to
come
to
naught
.
That
does
not
mean
it
could
not
happen
,
just
that
I
am
skeptical
.
Instead
,
NK
is
likely
to
continue
to
interact
when
and
where
it
has
certain
specific
needs
,
as
in
this
case
.
And
that
interaction
will
be
tightly
monitored
.
Fifteen
years
[
ago
]
,
at
the
start
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine%20Policy">
Sunshine
Policy
</ref>
by
SK
,
there
was
hope
that
increased
interaction
would
grow
organically
and
slowly
open
up
NK
.
That
was
the
spirit
behind
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Kaesong_Industrial_Region">
Kaesong
industrial
zone
</ref>
.
But
in
fact
,
the
North
Koreans
tightly
controlled
Kaesong
to
capture
its
gains
and
limit
spillovers
.
I
imagine
the
same
will
happen
here
.

Is
there

increased
seismic
activity
in
relation
to
Mount
Paektu
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
JG

:
Not
currently
.
There
was
unrest
at
the
volcano
during
2002
–
05
but
it
has
returned
to
normalcy
.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">

Would
an
eruption
of
Mount
Paektu
have
consequences
for
multiple
countries
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
JG
</hi>
:
Yes
.
The
most
likely
widespread
consequence
will
be
an
interuption
of
air
traffic
between
North
Asia
and
North
America
and
Europe
.
More
locally
,
the
tourist
industry
on
the
Chinese
side
of
the
border
will
be
very
impacted
.
Most
ash
fall
will
be
in
the
DPRK
.
</p>
<p>
For
perspective
,
there
was
an
extremely
large
eruption
of
the
volcano
at
about
940
AD
—
one
of
the
largest
historical
eruptions
anywhere
on
Earth
.
It
is
uncertain
how
often
it
has
erupted
since
,
and
how
large
the
eruptions
were
,
but
nothing
has
been
big
enough
to
cause
serious
problems
scores
of
kilometers
away
.
So
yes
there
is
risk
—
it
is
large
mountain
with
a
long
history
of
eruptions
—
but
nothing
indicates
a
high
level
of
concern
now
.
