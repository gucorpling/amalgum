Know
your
needs
.
Nobody
can
say
for
sure
what
your
long-term
care
needs
will
be
,
but
there
are
several
ways
to
help
you
have
a
forecast
.
<list type="unordered">

Look
at
your
present
health
situation
.
Do
you
have
a
current
condition
?
Are
you
in
any
risk
of
incurring
illness
or
injury
because
of
your
lifestyle
or
job
?
At
the
same
time
,
look
into
your
family
's
health
background
?
Are
you
susceptible
to
certain
health
conditions
that
run
in
your
bloodline
?
As
you
think
about
these
factors
,
you
can
consult
your
doctor
so
that
you
'll
have
a
better
assessment
of
your
possible
long-term
care
needs
in
the
future

Explore
different
care
options
.
Long-term
care
can
come
from
different
sources
and
can
be
administered
in
different
settings
.
Learn
what
these
are
,
determine
what
's
available
to
you
,
and
decide
which
among
the
options
you
prefer
most
.
<list type="unordered">

In
most
cases
,
loved
ones
and
family
members
become
the
main
providers
of
care
when
a
long-term
care
event
takes
place
.
Though
they
usually
assume
the
role
of
caregivers
out
of
love
and
concern
,
you
also
need
to
consider
how
this
situation
can
affect
their
job
,
income
,
relationships
and
overall
quality
of
life
.
</item>
<item>
Meanwhile
,
long-term
care
can
also
be
provided
by
professionals
.
Depending
on
the
level
of
care
needed
,
care
services
can
be
administered
in
the
home
,
assisted
living
facilities
,
adult
day
care
centers
,
or
nursing
homes
.

Learn
about
the
cost
of
care
in
your
area
.
As
you
create
a
plan
,
make
sure
that
you
're
familiar
with
how
much
long-term
care
costs
in
the
area
where
you
intend
to
receive
care
.
This
will
help
you
gauge
how
much
you
need
for
care-related
expenses
.
The
cost
of
different
care
services
and
settings
vary
from
state
to
state
.
For
instance
,
the
median
annual
cost
of
a
private
room
in
a
nursing
home
in
Florida
is
$
96,725
,
whereas
in
South
Carolina
,
the
annual
average
is
only
at
$
75,008
.

Determine
how
you
're
going
to
cover
care
expenses
.
Care-related
expenses
can
be
covered
in
different
ways
.
You
can
opt
for
self-insurance
and
pay
from
your
own
pocket
,
purchase
long-term
care
insurance
or
hybrid
products
like
life
insurance
or
annuities
with
long-term
care
coverage
,
or
seek
assistance
from
Medicaid
.
Each
payment
option
has
its
own
sets
of
pros
and
cons
.
You
need
to
carefully
examine
these
alongside
your
financial
situation
to
know
which
is
most
suitable
for
you
.
Asking
the
help
of
a
professional
can
help
you
in
doing
so
.

Create
the
necessary
documents
.
Advance
directives
such
as
a
health
care
power
of
attorney
and
living
will
should
also
be
part
of
your
long-term
care
plan
.
These
documents
are
essential
because
they
will
serve
as
your
mouthpiece
should
you
become
unable
to
decide
and
speak
for
yourself
.
<list type="unordered">

A
health
care
power
of
attorney
states
the
name
of
the
person
who
will
be
responsible
for
making
health
care
related
decisions
for
you
when
you
can
no
longer
do
so
.
</item>
<item>
Meanwhile
,
living
will
is
a
document
that
contains
your
wishes
,
preferences
,
and
requests
when
it
comes
to
medical
treatment
and
health
care
.
