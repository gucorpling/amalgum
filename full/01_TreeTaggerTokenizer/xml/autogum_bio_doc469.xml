Life

Born
between

and

,
Alva
Cortés
Ixtlilxóchitl
was
a
direct
descendant
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ixtlilxochitl_I">

and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ixtlilxochitl_II">

)
of

.
He
was
also
the
great-great-grandson
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuitláhuac">
Cuitláhuac
</ref>
(
Cuitláhuac
was
the
eleventh
son
of
the
ruler
Axayacatl
and
a
younger
brother
of
Moctezuma

the
previous
ruler

the

On
the
death
of
his
eldest
brother
in
1602
,
he
was
declared
by
a
royal
decree
heir
to
the
titles
and
possessions
of
his
family
.
The
property
,
however
,
does
not
appear
to
have
been
large
,
as
he
complained
in
1608
of
the
deplorable
state
of
misery
to
which
the
posterity
of
the
kings
of
Texcoco
were
reduced
.

In

he
was
employed
as
interpreter
by
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viceroy">
viceroy
</ref>
,
which
appointment
he
owed
to
his
learning
and
skill
in
explaining
the
hieroglyphic
pictures
of
the
ancient
Mexicans
.
He
had
also
a
profound
knowledge
of
the
traditions
of
his
ancestors
which
were
preserved
in
the
national
songs
,
and
&quot;
was
intimate
with
several
old
Native
Americans
famous
for
their
knowledge
of
Mexican
history
.
&quot;
He
turned
his
own
labors
and
those
of
his
friends
to
account
in
composing
works
on
the
history
of
his
country
.
They
remained
unknown
until
their
importance
was
revealed
by

,
and
afterward
by
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_von_Humboldt">

The
former
says
that
they
were
written
in
Spanish
by
command
of
the
viceroy
,
and
were
deposited
in
the
library

There
were

In

and
in

governor

In
spite
of
his
illustrious
birth
,
good
education
and
obvious
ability
,
he
lived
most
of
his
life
in
dire
poverty

Most
of

works
were
written
to

to

.
His
<hi rend="italic">
Relación
histórica
de
la
nación
tulteca
</hi>
(
usually
called
<hi rend="italic">
Relación
</hi>
)
was
written
between
1600
and
1608
.
This
was
an
account
of
many
events
in
New
Spain
,
and
many
events
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toltec">
Toltec
</ref>
people
.
The
<hi rend="italic">
Relación
</hi>
and
most
of
his
other
accounts
and
compilations
contain
writing
fragments
and
songs
,
with
much
repetition
and
little
organization
.
He
gives
a
detailed
account
of
the
important
part
played
by
his
great-grandfather
Don
Fernando
Ixtlilxóchitl
II
in
the
conquest
of
Mexico
and
the
pacification
of
the
Indigenous
of
New
Spain
,
praising
him
in
every
possible
way
and
condemning
the
ingratitude
of
the
conquerors
.
</p>
<p>
Later
(
1610
to
1640
,
according
to
Chavero
)
,
Alva
wrote
the
Spanish
work
<hi rend="italic">
Historia
chichimeca
</hi>
,
which
refers
to
the
same
events
,
but
with
more
organization
.
<hi rend="italic">
Historia
chichimeca
</hi>
is
not
the
original
title
,
which
is
unknown
,
but
was
supplied
by
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_de_Sigüenza_y_Góngora">
Carlos
de
Sigüenza
y

</ref>
when
the
manuscript
was
in
his
possession
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Boturini_Bernaducci">
Lorenzo

</ref>
,
who
owned
the
same
manuscript
later
,
called
it
<hi rend="italic">
Historia
general
de
la
Nueva
España
</hi>
.
There
are
indications
it
was
part
of
a
larger
work
,
the
rest
of
which
has
been
lost
,
or
perhaps
it
was
unfinished
.
It
ends
with
the
siege
of
Mexico
.
The
work
gives
the
Texcoca
version
of
pre-Columbian
history
and
the
conquest
,
in
contrast
to
the
work
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Alvarado_Tezozómoc">
Fernando
Alvarado
Tezozómoc
</ref>
,
which
gives
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexica">
Mexica
</ref>
version
.
The
<hi rend="italic">
Historia
chichimeca
</hi>
is
considered
Alva
's
best
work
.
</p>
<p>
His
works
contain
very
important
data
for
the
history
of
Mexico
,
but
except
for
<hi rend="italic">
Historia
chichimeca
</hi>
,
they
are
written
without
order
or
method
,
the
chronology
is
very
faulty
,
and
there
is
much
repetition
.

his

the

of

<hi rend="italic">

in
1891-1892
.
José

reproduced

with
a
new

in

<p>
He
wrote
two
memorials
,
<hi rend="italic">
Sucinta

<hi rend="italic">

,
addressed
to
Viceroy

,
hijo

,
and
Fray
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/García_Guerra">

</ref>
.
These
were
attempts
to
recover
some
of
the
property
and
privileges
of
his
royal
ancestors
.
Partly
owing
to
these
appeals
,
and
partly
to
the
favor
of
Fray
García
Guerra
,
who
afterwards
became
archbishop
of
Mexico
and
viceroy
of
New
Spain
,
some
land
concessions
were
granted
him
,
and
in
the
last
years
of
his
life
he
was
appointed
interpreter
in
the
Indian
judiciary
court
.
He
was
still
working
there
when
he
died
in
1648
,
poor
and
forgotten
.
His
son
,
Juan
de
Alva
Cortes
,
inherited
his
documents
and
before
his
death
were
given
to
Don
Carlos
de
Siguenza

Gongora
.
