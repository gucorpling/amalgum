the
possible

:

<hi rend="italic">
&quot;
[
The
President
]
has
not
given
[
the
Senate
]
full
information
,
but
has
concealed
important
intelligence
which
he
ought
to
have
communicated
,
and
by
that
means
induced
them
to
enter
into
measures
injurious
to
their
country
,
and
which
they
would
not
have
consented
to
had
the
true
state
of
things
been
disclosed
to
them
.
&quot;
</hi>
<p>
Bonifaz
says
that
the
official
minutes
of
a
secret
US-UK
meeting
were
the
impetus
for
the
request
.
Those
minutes
were
recently
leaked
to
<hi rend="italic">
The
Sunday
Times
</hi>
,
and
are
popularly
known
as
the
&quot;
Downing
Street
memo
&quot;
or
alternatively
the
&quot;
smoking
gun
memo
&quot;
.
In
it
,
British
intelligence
MI-6
director
Richard
Dearlove
said
,
<hi rend="italic">
&quot;
Bush
wanted
to
remove
Saddam
,
through
military
action
,
justified
by
the
conjunction
of
terrorism
and
WMD
.
<hi rend="bold">
But
the
intelligence
and
facts
were
being
fixed
around
the

<p>
The
phrase
&quot;
the
intelligence
and
facts
were
being
fixed
around
the
policy
.
&quot;
has
been
the
center
of
attention
in
reports
and
discussions
surrounding
the
memo
.
It
has
received
this
attention
because
critics
of
the
Iraq
war
believe
that
it
reaffirms
their
fundamental
criticisms
:
that
Bush
's
decision
to
go
to
war
was
not
based
on
the
intelligence
,
but
,
rather
,
intelligence
was
used
selectively
and
exaggerated
,
while
debunking
intelligence
was
forcefully
suppressed
,
for
the
sole
purpose
of
rallying
consent
for
the
war
,
and
that
this
was
all
done
deliberately
.

The
recent
release
of
the
Downing
Street
Memo
provides
new
and
compelling
evidence
that
the
President
of
the
United
States
has
been
actively
engaged
in
a
conspiracy
to
deceive
and
mislead
the
United
States
Congress
and
the
American
people
.
&quot;
</hi>
</p>
<p>
Some
Republican
congressmen
who
had
voted
for
the
war
have
since
stated
that
they
believe
the
war
was
a
mistake
.
For
example
,
Walter
Jones
,
the
coiner
of
the
phrase
&quot;
freedom
fries
&quot;
,
is
now
the
most
vociferous
opponent
on
Capitol
Hill
.
&quot;
If
we
were
given
misinformation
intentionally
by
people
in
this
administration
,
to
commit
the
authority
to
send
boys
,
and
in
some
instances
girls
,
to
go
into
Iraq
,
that
is
wrong
,
&quot;
he
has
stated
,
&quot;
Congress
must
be
told
the
truth
.

</p>
<p>
On
May
26th
,
the
group
<ref target="http://www.afterdowningstreet.org">
AfterDowningStreet.org

launched
a
campaign
to
Congress
to
investigate
whether
President
Bush
committed
impeachable
offenses
relating
to
the
Iraq
war
