Earlier
yesterday
,
Trump
issued
a
statement
that
his
executive
order
was
being
carried
out
smoothly
:
&quot;
It
's
not
a
Muslim
ban
,
but
we
were
totally
prepared
.
It
's
working
out
very
nicely
.
You
see
it
at
the
airports
,
you
see
it
all
over
.

Customs

at
John
F.

Airport
in
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/New_York_City">

</ref>
detained
about
twelve
people
.
Others
were
prevented
from
boarding
planes
bound
for
the
U.S.
This
included
both
individuals
coming
to
the
U.S.
for
the
first
time
and
those
in
possession
of
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/green%20card">
green
card
</ref>
as
proof
of
legal
residency
,
such
as
international
students
returning
for
the
spring
semester
and
legal
residents
returning
from
visits
to
their
home
countries
.
According
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeland%20Security">
Homeland
Security
</ref>
,
109
people
were
in
transit
when
the
order
was
issued
and
were
prevented
from
entering
the
U.S.
upon
arrival
and
173
were
prevented
from
boarding
planes
,
of
which
81
were
later
given
waivers
admitting
them
to
the
country
.
</p>
<p>
The
stay
applies
to
individuals
who
are
already
in
the
United
States
and
those
who
are
currently
traveling
to
the
United
States
under
legal
visas
but
does
not
clearly
apply
to
anyone
who
has
not
yet
departed
for
the
U.S.
While
it
prevents
these
people
from
being
deported
,
it
does
not
specifically
allow
them
to
enter
the
United
States
either
.
It
is
not
clear
whether
they
will
be
allowed
to
do
so
or
held
in
detention
.
