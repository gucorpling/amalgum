We
lived
through
the
long
years
of
incineration
at
the
sewage
treatment
plant
,
and
know
first-hand
what
the
impacts
can
be
on
human
health
and
the
host
community
's
environment
.
We
know
the
struggles
that
ensue
to
make
change
.

A
:
</hi>
I
love
my
community
and
my
city

I
feel
I
can
make
a
difference
and
I
have
the
skills
and
ability
to
bring
citizens
together
to
make

change

My
professional
experience
spans
assignments
as

legislative
researcher
at
Queen
's
Park
for
Members
of
Provincial
Parliament
,
to
elected
Public
School
Trustee
and
City

Finding
funding
partners
and
convincing
City
Council
to
approve
projects
for
our
ward
is
my
forte
.
I
bring
creative
problem-solving
skills
,
combined
with
a
sense
of
vision
,
toward
the
determination
of
the
path
we
should
take
--

life
in
our
City

Why
do

<hi rend="bold">
A
:
</hi>
I
want
to
represent
Beaches-East
York
,
Ward
32
,
because
it
is
the
community
I
was
raised
in
and
where
I
have
raised
my
family
.
I
know
the
people
,
I
know
the
streets
,
and
I
know
the
neighbourhoods
.
It
is
an
honour
to
be
receiving
the
confidence
and
trust
of
the
people
in
my
community
to
represent
their
interests
.
I
have
a
vision
of
where
we
should
go
as
a
City
and
a
community
,
and
believe
I
have
the
skills
to
achieve
results
.

</hi>
I

I
have
achieved
many
successful
projects
in

drawing
together
the
right
partnerships
to
make
things
happen
.
Listening
to
residents
,
I
learn
what
people
want
.
For
example
,
improvements
to
the
Beaches
Branch
Library
were
suggested
.
I
was
successful
in
getting
this
request
put
on
the
priority
list
for
the
Library
Board
with
the
required
funding
.
The
result
is
glorious
!
Today
,
the
Beaches
Library
is
restored
to
it
past
splendour
and
improved
with
an
attractive
and
fitting
expansion
.
