would
not
get
a
renewed
private
hire
operator
license
after
their
current
permit
expires
at
the
end
of
the
month
.
The
regulatory
body
released
an
official
statement
on
their
website
and
stated
Uber
London
Limited
was
&quot;
not
fit
and
proper
to
hold
a
private
hire
operator
license
&quot;
.
</p>
<p>
TfL
said
Uber
London
&quot;
demonstrate[d
]
a
lack
of
corporate
responsibility
&quot;
for
reporting
serious
criminal
offences
,
and
for
obtaining
background
of
the
drivers
and
medical
certificates
.
In
August
,
police
said
Uber
allowed
a
driver
despite
allegations
of
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Sexual_assault">
sexually
assaulting
</ref>
a
passenger
.
The
company
has
been
accused
of
sexism
and
bullying
.
TfL
in
its
statement
also
complained
about
possible
use
of
&quot;
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greyball">
greyball
</ref>
&quot;
software
to
prevent
officials
from
accessing
the
application
for
law
enforcement
duties
.
</p>
<p>
According
to
Uber
's
statistics
,
about
3.5
million
people
in
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/London">
London
</ref>
use
Uber
.
There
are
some
40
thousand
drivers
tied
with
Uber
within
the
British
capital
.
Per
the
Private
Hire
Vehicles
(
London
)
Act
1998
,
Uber
can
appeal
against
TfL
's
decision
within
three
weeks
.
Uber
received
an
interim
renewal
for
four
months
in
May
,
and
it
is
set
to
expire
at
the
end
of
the
month
.
To
this
announcement
,
Uber
London
's
General
Manager
Tom
Elvidge
said
,
&quot;
By
wanting
to
ban
our
app
from
the
capital
Transport
for
London
and
the
Mayor
have
caved
in
to
a
small
number
of
people
who
want
to
restrict
consumer
choice
.
If
this
decision
stands
,
it
will
put
more
than
40,000
licensed
drivers
out
of
work
and
deprive
Londoners
of
a
convenient
and
affordable
form
of
transport
.
To
defend
the
livelihoods
of
all
those
drivers
,
and
the
consumer
choice
of
millions
of
Londoners
who
use
our
app
,
we
intend
to
immediately
challenge
this
in
the
courts
.
&quot;
He
also
added
,
&quot;
This
ban
would
show
the
world
that
,
far
from
being
open
,
London
is
closed
to
innovative
companies
who
bring
choice
to
consumers
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
TfL
said
Uber
's
irresponsibility
could
compromise
the
safety
and
security
of
the
public
.
In
contrast
,
Uber
's
response
said
their
service
enhances
safety
.
London

<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Facebook">

,
said
,
&quot;
[
...
]all
companies
in
London
must
play
by
the
rules
and
adhere
to
the
high
standards
we
expect
—
particularly
when
it
comes
to
the
safety
of
customers
.
Providing
an
innovative
service
must
not
be
at
the
expense
of
customer
safety
and
security
.
I
fully
support
TfL
's
decision
—
it
would
be
wrong
if
TfL
continued
to
license
Uber
if
there
is
any
way
that
this
could
pose
a
threat
to
Londoners
'
safety
and
security
.
Any
operator
of
private
hire
services
in
London
needs
to
play
by
the
rules
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Uber
has
received
criticism
from
traditional
taxi
drivers
as
well
as
government
officials
.
Uber
was
banned
from
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Bulgaria">
Bulgaria
</ref>
and
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Denmark">
Denmark
</ref>
,
and
faces
regulatory
issues
in
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/France">
France
</ref>
,
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Italy">

,
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Hungary">
Hungary
</ref>
,
and
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Spain">
Spain
</ref>
.
It
also
faced
legal
inquiry
for
use
of
greyball
in
the
US
to
resist
government
regulation
of
the
application
.
Regarding
the
complaint
about
improper
use
of
use
of
Greyball
,
Elvidge
cited
an
independent
review
and
said
it
&quot;
found
that
'
greyball
'
has
never
been
used
or
considered
in
the
UK
for
the
purposes
cited
by
TfL
&quot;
.
Uber
operates
in
over
40
cities
and
towns
in
the
UK
.
