Idle
a
Car
</head>
<p>
If
you
’re
working
on
your
car
,
you
may
need
to
idle
the
car
to
warm
up
its
engine
.
Idling
is
also
great
for
warming
up
your
car
in
winter
.
To
idle
your
vehicle
,
all
you
need
to
do
is
let
it
run
while
stationary
.
But
before
you
do
,
check
the
EPA
’s
website
to
find
out
if
your
local
laws
allow
you
to
leave
your
car
idling
.
In
some
states
,
idling
for
long
periods
is
illegal
and
could
result
in
a
fine
.

Some
car
models

temperature
.
Warmup
times
will
depend

model
,
but
if

watch
the
RPM
gauge
,
after
the
car
cycles
through
a
period
of
high
RPMs
,
it
should
be
warmed
up
.

off
if

Drive
your
car
to
warm
up
its
cabin
in
cold
weather

Driving
your
car
for
a
short
while
will
warm
it
up
twice
as
fast
in
cold
weather
as
it
would
idling
.
Additionally
,
a
short
drive
generally
uses
less
fuel
than
it
would
take
to
warm
up
the
engine
with
idling
.

Refrain
from
using
the
drive-through
window

Drive-through
windows
at
establishments
generally
require
you
to
wait
with
your
car
idling
while
the
items
you
ordered
are
prepared
.
Instead
,
park
your
car

make
your
order
inside
the
establishment
to
save
fuel

When
you
hop
into
your
car
,
make
sure
you
buckle
up
your
seatbelt
.
Seatbelts
greatly
reduce
the
risk
of
serious
injury
or
harm
in
the
event
of
an
accident
,
and
in
many
places
,
buckling
up
is
the
law
.
