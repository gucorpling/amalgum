Write
About
Mental
Illness
</head>
<p>
Writing
about
serious
topics
is
difficult
for
those
who
may
have
never
experienced
them
.
Subjects
like
mental
health
can
be
sensitive
for
many
,
making
addressing
them
in
an
informative
essay
or
a
work
of
fiction
a
hard
thing
to
do
.
Here
,
we
discuss
what
to
do
when
writing
about
mental
health
.
</p>
<head>
Steps
</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Educate
yourself
.
Find
information
about
the
mental
illness
you
want
to
write
about
from
reputable
,
authoritative
sources
in
the
psychology
field
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Ideally
,
going
to
professionals
who
specialize
in
the
mental
illness
you
choose
to
pursue
can
help
to
make
your
writing
factual
and
understandable
for
your
audience
,
while
still
being
able
to
keep
an
audience
hooked
on
your
writing
.
</item>
<item>
Talk
to
real
people
with
mental
illnesses
,
if
possible
.
People
with
the
ability
to
give
firsthand
accounts
of
mental
health
experiences
are
amazing
resources
for
making
your
piece
respectful
for
those
who
suffer
from
the
illness
.
It
also
can
help
bring
a
more
personal
feeling
in
your
character
if
you
write
with
the
people
you
talk
with
in
mind
.
Be
respectful
of
their
privacy
and
any
identifying
traits
or
personal
stories
they
share
with
you
.
</item>
<item>
Do
n't
be
afraid
to
ask
questions
.
Many
people
are
comfortable
talking
about
the
mental
disorders
they
have
and
will
give
you
a
sense
of
what
living
with
a
mental
health
issue
is
like
.
Just
be
respectful
of
the
person
and
understand
that
not
everyone
wants
to
share
information
about
this
sensitive
of
a
subject
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Figure
out
what
your
motive
is
for
incorporating
mental
health
issues
in
your
work
.
This
is
particularly
important
if
you
're
writing
a
fictional
piece
;
remember
why
you
plan
to
address
mental
illness
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Many
people
use
mental
illnesses
to
emphasize
character
traits
.
For
example
,
a
character
that
is
supposed
to
be
angsty
might
be
given
depression
,
but
only
because
it
emphasizes
the
stereotypical
depressed
individual
that
the
author
wants
.
However
,
this
is
an
inappropriate
use
of
the
illness
and
is
n't
seen
as
respectable
in
the
mental
health
community
.
</item>
<item>
Do
n't
let
the
mental
health
issue
define
your
character
.
While
someone
may
suffer
from
bipolar
disorder
,
that
does
n't
mean
that
is
all
they
are
.
Writing
a
character
that
is
only
notable
for
their
illness
is
a
very
forced
way
of
incorporating
mental
health
into
your
book
.
Characters
with
mental
disorders
need
to
maintain
the
same
level
of
depth
as
every
other
character
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Be
precise
with
your
language
.
Avoid
inaccurate
or
inflammatory
words
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Never
use
words
like
&quot;
retarded
&quot;
.
Words
like
this
often
get
used
a
lot
in
situations
where
it
's
inaccurate
and
offensive
.
As
an
author
,
you
need
to
be
sure
to
use
appropriate
terminology
and
not
to
use
certain
words
that
are
seen
as
offensive
.
Language
evolves
as
our
society
changes
,
and
this
is
especially
true
for
terminology
surrounding
mental
health
and
disability
.
</item>
<item>
Learn
what
terms
are
accepted
in
the
community
.
Often
there
are
slight
nuances
to
speaking
on
mental
health
,
and
while
the
distinctions
may
seem
small
,
they
can
make
your
writing
less
respected
by
the
community
.
For
example
,
it
's
generally
not
acceptable
to
say
&quot;
a
schizophrenic
&quot;
or
&quot;
a
schizophrenic
person
&quot;
.
Instead
,
say
&quot;
a
person
with
schizophrenia
&quot;
or
&quot;
a
person
who
has
schizophrenia
&quot;
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Be
open
to
changing
things
.
Take
feedback
from
others
,
including
those
better
versed
in
the
subject
you
're
writing
about
or
who
are
directly
affected
by
it
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Even
if
your
overall
writing
is
sound
,
you
may
have
certain
sentences
that
come
off
wrong
and
need
fine-tuning
.
Keeping
an
open
mind
on
improving
things
in
your
writing
will
make
writing
a
respectful
piece
much
easier
.
</item>
<item>
Understand
that
people
may
get
upset
.
Mental
health
is
often
a
controversial
topic
,
and
not
everyone
agrees
on
certain
aspects
.
Be
understanding
,
but
also
know
that
it
is
tough
to
please
everyone
and
that
sometimes
you
ca
n't
change
who
gets
offended
by
what
.
</item>
<item>
Always
take
into
account
that
if
you
write
about
discrimination
,
there
may
be
controversy
in
whether
that
should
be
talked
about
.
However
,
this
controversy
is
n't
necessarily
something
that
you
,
as
an
author
,
need
to
take
personally
,
as
this
is
an
issue
bigger
than
your
writing
.
