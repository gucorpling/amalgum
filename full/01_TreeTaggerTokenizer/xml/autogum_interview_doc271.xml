<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin">
Dublin
</ref>
,
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Ireland">
Ireland
</ref>
have
occupied
their
offices
in
response
to
management
's
announcement
of
earlier
closure
dates
for
the
sites
.
On
Friday
,
July
31
,
40
employees
at
the
Thomas
Cook
store
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grafton%20Street">
Grafton
Street
</ref>
began
an
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sit-in">
occupation
protest
</ref>
after
the
sudden
announcement
of
the
store
's
immediate
closure
;
workers
at
the
store
had
previously
been
told
,
when
the
closures
were
announced
on
May
12
,
that
the
businesses
would
remain
open
until
September
6
.
The
day
after
,
employees
at
the
Thomas
Cook-owned
Direct
Holidays
store
in
nearby
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talbot%20Street">
Talbot
Street
</ref>
began
their
own
occupation
.
A
third
Thomas
Cook
store
in
the
capital
,
in
North
Earl
Street
,
closed
without
incident
;
according
to
one
employee
who
spoke
to
<hi rend="italic">
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikinews">
Wikinews
</ref>
</hi>
,
this
is
because
the
North
Earl
Street
store
was
closed
up
and
stripped
out
while
employees
were
at
home
,
leaving
the
workers
to
find
an
empty
space
instead
of
an
office
when
they
arrived
for
work
the
next
morning
.
</p>
<p>
Employees
are
demanding
an
improved
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layoff">
redundancy
</ref>
package
from
Thomas
Cook
and
allege
a
string
of
abuses
by
management
.
Thomas
Cook
management
has
offered
the
employees
five
weeks
'
redundancy
pay
for
every
year
worked
at
the
company
,
in
excess
of
the
minimum
two
weeks
'
pay
per
year
worked
required
by
Irish
employment
law
,
and
says
that
the
Grafton
Street
location
had
been
losing
money
for
five
years
.
Employees
,
demanding
eight
weeks
'
pay
,
counter
that
the
company
realised
a
profit
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK%20pound">
£
</ref>
400
million
in
the
past
fiscal
year
,
of
which
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro">
€
</ref>
4
million
originated
from
Ireland
;
and
that
Thomas
Cook
's
UK
&amp;
Ireland
chief
,
Manny
Fontenla-Novoa
,
was
given
a
bonus
of
€
7
million
earlier
this
year
.
60
jobs
would
be
lost
in
the
closure
of
the
two
stores
,
which
constitute
all
of
Thomas
Cook
's
retail
operation
in
the
Republic
of
Ireland
;
a
further
17
jobs
were
lost
in
the
closure
of
the
North
Earl
Street
store
.

Before
the
occupations
began
,
workers
at
Thomas
Cook
's
locations
,
who
are
members
of
trade
union
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport%20Salaried%20Staffs'%20Association">
Transport
Salaried
Staffs
'
Association
</ref>
(
TSSA
)
had
voted
unanimously
to
strike
,
alleging
that
the
closures
were
being
done
without
sufficient
consultation
of
staff
by
Thomas
Cook
management
.
Caroline
Cullen
,
accounts
assistant
and
TSSA
staff
representative
at
the
Grafton
Street
location
,
characterises
the
behaviour
of
Thomas
Cook
management
as
&quot;
intimidation
&quot;
.
When
the
consultation
period
had
finished
,
she
said
,
Thomas
Cook
management
sent
Simon
Robinson
,
an
executive
director
of
the
company
,
and
a
male
colleague
of
his
to
close
the
office
.
The
presence
of
the
Thomas
Cook
executives
,
two
high-ranking
,
business-suited
men
,
in
an
office
where
forty-two
of
forty-four
employees
are
women
is
itself
intimidating
,
Cullen
asserts
;
she
says
that
Robinson
furthermore
attempted
to
&quot;
bully
&quot;
the
employees
into
accepting
the
five-week
redundancy
offer
by
saying
that
if
they
did
not
accept
,
they
would
receive
only
the
statutory
minimum
.
&quot;
You
cannot
live
on
5
weeks
&quot;
,
says
Cullen
.
&quot;
Travel
agents
are
closing
every
week
.
There
's
a
hiring
freeze
at
the
banks
.
There
are
no
jobs
out
there
...
We
need
8
weeks
to
live
on
for
the
next
two
years
while
we
look
for
jobs
.
&quot;
The
extra
three
weeks
'
redundancy
pay
would
,
she
estimates
,
cost
Thomas
Cook
€
400,000
.
