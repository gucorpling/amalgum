The
US
Navy
's
5th
Fleet
,
based
in
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Bahrain">
Bahrain
</ref>
,
reported
that
four
pirates
riding
in
a
fast
skiff
came
within
270
meters
of
the
container
ship
.
The
<hi rend="italic">
Maersk
Alabama
</hi>
was
about
965
kilometers
off
the
northeast
coast
of
Somalia
and
was
steaming
toward
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Kenya">
Kenyan
</ref>
port
city
of
Mombasa
when
it
came
under
attack
.
</p>
<p>
The
Navy
said
the
crew
of
Maersk
Alabama
undertook
evasive
maneuvers
and
deployed
long-range
acoustical
devices
,
which
make
noise
painful
to
the
human
ear
.
The
crew
also
responded
with
small-arms
fire
after
pirates
fired
automatic
weapons
at
the
ship
.
The
pirates
abandoned
the
attack
without
causing
injuries
or
damage
to
the
vessel
.

&quot;
We
have

with

American
flag
—
we
tried
to
throw
our
ladders
for
climbing
[
but
]
it
sped
and
[

gone
away

It
narrowly
escaped
and
opened
fire
on
us

One
of
our
colleagues
was
injured
in
the
attack

Nor

<p>
US
Vice
Admiral
Bill
Gortney
,
from
the
Naval
Forces
Central
Command
,
issued
a
statement
in
which
he
praised
<hi rend="italic">
Maersk
Alabama
'
</hi>
s
owner
and
crew
for
following
maritime
industry
's
best
practices
,

having

security
team
on

to
help
prevent
a

<p>
&quot;
Due
to
<hi rend="italic">
Maersk
Alabama
</hi>
following
maritime
industry
’s
best
practices
,
such
as
embarking
security
teams
,
the
ship
was
able
to
prevent
being
successfully
attacked
by
pirates
.
This
is
a
great
example
of
how
merchant
mariners
can
take
pro-active
action
to
prevent
being
attacked
,
&quot;
he
remarked
.
</p>
<p>
In
April
,
the
155-meter
vessel
made
international
headlines
when
it
was
seized
by
pirates
who
held
captain
Richard
Phillips
hostage
at
gunpoint
for
five
days
in
a
lifeboat
.
He
was
freed
by
US
commandos
who
killed
three
of
the
pirates
.
</p>
<p>
A
spokesman
for
the
European
Naval
Force
described
the
second
attempted
hijacking
of
the
Maersk
Alabama
as
&quot;
pure
chance
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Wednesday
's
attack
came
soon
after
a
report
released
by
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_Nations">
United
Nations
</ref>
,
which
said
the
presence
of
international
warships
off
the
coast
of
Somalia
,
as
well
as
improved
efforts
by
ships
to
protect
themselves
,
have
considerably
reduced
the
number
of
successful
hijackings
in
the
region
this
year
,
especially
in
the
Gulf
of
Aden
.
</p>
<p>
But
the
report
,
submitted
by
UN
Secretary
General
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Ban_Ki-Moon">
Ban
Ki-Moon
</ref>
,
noted
that
intensified
anti-piracy
activity
in
the
Gulf
of
Aden
is
also
forcing
pirates
to
hunt
for
targets
in
the
Indian
Ocean
,
closer
to
the
island
nation
of
the
Seychelles
.
</p>
<p>
Since
the
beginning
of
October
,
seven
of
the
eight
vessels
seized
by
pirates
have
been
in
the
vicinity
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Seychelles">
Seychelles
</ref>
.
Recently
,
the
government
began
allowing
the
US
Navy
to
use
the
airport
in
the
capital
Mahe
to
deploy
unmanned
aerial
vehicles
to
combat
piracy
.
The
Seychelles
also
signed
an
agreement
last
week
to
allow
European
warships
and
military
personnel
to
pursue
pirates
from
the
high
seas
into
Seychellian
waters
and
to
use
necessary
force
.
