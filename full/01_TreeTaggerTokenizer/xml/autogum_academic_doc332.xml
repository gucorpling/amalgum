Introduction

<p>
Tight
gas
has
attracted
worldwide
attention
since
the
exploration
of
the
large
Cretaceous
Balnco
low-permeability
gas
field
in
the
San
Juan
Basin
in
North
America
.
Tight
sandstone
gas
serves
as
an
important
alternative
to
the
conventional
petroleum
resources
and
shows
good
resource
prospect
.
Tight
sandstone
gas
has
been
discovered
in
more
than
70
basins
worldwide
,
which
are
mainly
distributed
in
North
America
,
Europe
,
and
Asia
.
The
United
States
and
China
are
two
main
producers
of
tight
sands
gas
;
the
United
States
has
a
tight
sandstone
gas
reserve
of
42.5
×
1012
m3
with
an
annual
production
of
1754
×
108
m3
.
The
exploration
of
tight
sandstone
gas
has
developed
rapidly
in
the
past
decades
in
China
,
and
prolific
tight
gas
reservoirs
have
been
discovered
in
the
Ordos
Basin
,
Sichuan
Basin
,
and
Songliao
Basin
.

Tight
sandstone
gas
is
generally
referred
to
as
the
tight
sandstone
reservoirs
with
complex
gas
and
water
distributions
,
low
gas
saturation
,
and
continuous
accumulation
characteristics
.
The
tight
gas
sandstone
reservoir
is
defined
as
gas-bearing
sandstone
reservoirs
with
porosity
&lt;10
%
,
in
situ
permeability
&lt;0.1
×
10−3
mD
or
absolute
permeability
&lt;1.0
×
10−3
mD
,
gas
saturation
&lt;60
%
,
and
pore-throat
radius
&lt;1
μm
.
</p>
<p>
Tight
sandstone
gas
reservoirs
are
characterized
by
inter-bedded
or
closely
distributed
source
rock
and
reservoirs
,
small
pore
and
throat
radii
,
high
water
saturation
,
and
non-tectonic
controlled
gas
distributions
.
The
low
gas
saturation
and
complex
gas
and
water
distributions
are
the
main
risks
for
the
exploration
and
recovery
enhancement
of
tight
sandstone
gas
.
The
gas
saturation
varies
and
has
a
heterogeneous
distribution
poorly
correlated
with
reservoir
quality
.
Porosity
and
permeability
are
no
longer
suitable
for
the
prediction
of
gas
enrichment
zones
in
tight
sandstone
gas
reservoirs
.
Moreover
,
gas
saturation
and
distribution
are
determined
by
the
gas
migration
and
accumulation
patterns
.
Due
to
the
nano-micrometer
pore
system
in
tight
sandstone
reservoirs
,
the
capillary
pressure
increases
evidently
in
tight
sandstone
.
The
buoyancy
is
invalid
in
driving
gas
flow
and
the
overpressure
becomes
the
dominant
driving
force
for
gas
migration
.
Spencer
has
emphasized
that
driving
pressure
difference
decides
the
degrees
of
gas
migration
and
accumulation
in
tight
sandstone
reservoirs
.
The
ultra-high
capillary
pressure
generated
by
formation
water
in
the
pore
space
becomes
the
main
resistance
for
the
gas
migration
in
tight
sandstone
reservoirs
.
As
the
resistance
is
determined
by
the
pore
geometries
,
pore
structure
becomes
an
important
factor
for
gas
migration
and
accumulation
.
The
heterogeneity
of
gas
saturation
and
distribution
is
attributable
to
the
complex
microscopic
pore
structure
of
tight
sandstone
reservoirs
.
Therefore
,
pore
structure
characterization
and
gas
migration
characteristics
have
become
the
focus
of
current
studies
.
Pore
size
,
genesis
,
morphology
,
and
fractal
characteristics
have
been
thoroughly
investigated
by
various
techniques
including
mercury
intrusion
porosimetry
(
MIP
)
,
scanning
electron
microscopy
(
SEM
)
,
nuclear
magnetic
resonance
(
NMR
)
,
low
temperature
N2
absorption
(
LTNA
)
,
and
X-ray
computed
tomography
(
X-CT
)
.
Recent
studies
tend
to
characterize
the
full-range
pore
size
distribution
by
integration
of
several
techniques
,
such
as
NMR
and
MIP
,
LTNA
and
NMR
,
and
MIP
and
X-CT
.
These
studies
provide
mature
methodology
and
sufficient
information
for
the
pore
structure
of
tight
sandstone
reservoirs
.
The
gas
flow
regimes
have
been
clearly
stated
by
experimental
and
numerical
simulations
,
including
the
Darcy
,
high-velocity
non-Darcy
,
and
low-velocity
non-Darcy
flows
.
However
,
these
results
are
based
on
the
discussions
of
single-phase
fluid
flow
and
have
differences
with
the
gas
migration
process
,
which
is
rarely
involved
.
Zeng
firstly
proposed
the
minimum
migration
pressure
gradients
by
investigating
the
gas
flow
in
migration
in
tight
sandstone
reservoirs
and
indicated
that
porosity
and
permeability
influences
the
gas
flow
patterns
,
minimum
migration
pressure
gradients
,
and
gas
saturation
.
Moreover
,
absent
evaluations
in
the
relationships
between
pore
structures
and
gas
flows
result
in
uncertainties
in
the
intrinsic
microscopic
controlling
factors
for
the
gas
flow
in
migration
.
Therefore
,
combined
pore
structure
characterization
and
gas
migration
simulation
appear
to
be
necessary
in
revealing
the
impacts
of
pore
structure
on
the
gas
migration
and
accumulation
.

The
Upper
Paleozoic
Permian
Daniudi
gas
field
in
the
Ordos
Basin
was
chosen
as
the
study
area
for
the
heterogeneous
reservoir
qualities
,
complicated
gas-water
distribution
,
low
gas
saturation
,
and
their
poor
internal
relationships
,
which
are
similar
to
the
tight
gas
reservoirs
in
the
sedimentary
basins
in
the
North
Sea
and
in
North
America
.
In
order
to
reveal
the
impacts
of
pore
structure
on
the
gas
flow
in
migration
and
accumulation
process
in
the
tight
sandstone
,
physical
simulation
experiments
of
gas
migration
and
accumulation
combined
with
X-ray
computed
tomography
(
X-CT
)
and
casting
thin
section
(
CTS
)
analyses
were
conducted
on
the
13
samples
collected
from
Shanxi
and
Lower
Shihezi
formations
in
the
Daniudi
gas
field
.
The
aims
of
this
paper
were
as
follows
:
(
1
)
clarifying
the
gas
flow
regimes
in
migration
and
gas
accumulation
patterns
in
the
tight
sandstone
reservoirs
,
(
2
)
characterizing
nano-micrometer
scale
pore
structure
of
the
tight
sandstone
reservoirs
,
(

)
revealing
the
intrinsic
microscopic
controlling
factors
for
gas
flow
and
their
impacts
on
gas
migration
and
accumulation
.
