<p>
Cavite
City
lies
at
the
hook-shaped
peninsula
that
lends
Cavite
province
its
name
.
Until
the
Spaniards
constructed
a
causeway
as
a
permanent
link
to
the
rest
of
Cavite
,
most
of
the
peninsula
is
a
sandbar
,
which
becomes
flooded
during
high
tide
and
also
pose
a
risk
for
ships
,
and
Cavite
City
,
then
a
town
,
virtually
turns
into
a
an
island
.
</p>
<p>
The
population
is
around
103,000
,
as
of
2015
.

History
</head>
<p>
Cavite
City
has
its
share
of
historical
charms
,
and
was
the
capital
of
<ref target="Cavite">
Cavite
</ref>
until
it
is
transfer
to
<ref target="Trece%20Martires">
Trece
Martires
</ref>
.
It
is
established
as
a
town
since
its
discovery
by
Miguel
López
de
Legazpi
,
and
at
the
midst
of
Spanish
colonial
rule
,
Cavite
,
then
called
<hi rend="italic">
Cavite
La
Punta
</hi>
,
served
as
an
important
point
for
the
Manila-
<ref target="Acapulco">
Acapulco
</ref>
galleons
,
and
serves
as
the
<hi rend="italic">
de
facto
</hi>
Port
of
Manila
because
of
the
sandbank
that
prevents
ships
from
entering
the
mouth
of
the
Pasig
River
.
As
the
town
grew
,
Cavite
since
ceded
four
independent
towns
,
like
San
Roque
,
La
Caridad
,
San
Antonio
,
Santa
Cruz
,
and
Dalahican
,
which
remain
as
barangays
.
The
Spaniards
built
a
causeway
over
the
sandbank
to
connect
the
town
with
mainland
Cavite
,
but
erosion
reduced
this
to
an
isthmus
;
the
causeway
remains
today
as
part
of
Manila-Cavite
Road
.
</p>
<p>
During
American
occupation
,
Corregidor
Island
and
other
smaller
islands
are
added
to
the
city
,
and
the
Port
of
Cavite
is
converted
into
a
US
Navy
station
,
Naval
Station
Sangley
Point
.
Cavite
gained
city
status
in
1940
,
one
year
before
World
War
II
broke
out
in
the
Pacific
.
Cavite
City
is
devastated
by
the
1945
Allied
bombings
;
Sangley
Point
,
the
walls
of
Porta
Vaga
,
and
the
old
town
is
badly
destroyed
by
bombs
.
Most
damaged
structures
are
required
to
be
demolished
,
and
only
a
few
remains
of
the
old
Port
of
Cavite
.
