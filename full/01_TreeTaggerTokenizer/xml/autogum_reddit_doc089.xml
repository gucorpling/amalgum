My
Xenoverse
3
Opening
.
</head>
<sp who="#Feraligreater328">
<p>
Upon
reading
a
post
by
u/SawkyScribe
,
I
decided
that
I
wanted
to
give
my
own
take
on
what
I
think
would
make
for
a
good
opening
and
base
to
Xenoverse
3
.
As
well
as
several
feature
I
had
bouncing
around
in
my
head
.
:
)
First
off
,
the
beginning
.
I
would
begin
Xenoverse
3
the
same
way
Xenoverse
2
began
.
Except
,
I
would
have
one
small
difference
.
You
get
to
choose
the
roles
of
the
XV1
Time
Patroller
and
the
XV2
Time
Patroller
.
One
is
now
a
God
of
Destruction
in
Training
and
the
other
has
joined
Trunks
as
an
administrator
of
the
Time
Patrol
,
as
well
as
being
the
protector
of
the
newly
christened
Contoki
City
.
Alongside
this
,
I
would
have
a
cold
open
cinematic
for
the
game
.
Nothing
too
serious
.
Goku
(
in
his
End
of
Z
Gi
)
is
training
with
Uub
in
the
mountains
.
There
's
a
small
fight
where
you
control
Uub
to
get
a
feeling
for
the
game
.
After
this
fight
,
Goku
and
Uub
both
talk
about
the
boys
progress
.
And
then
,
Goku
notices
something
powerful
.
He
turns
,
immediately
gets
serious
,
turns
Blue
...
and
then
fade
to
black
.
Otherwise
,
same
song
and
dance
.
I
'd
have
everyone
go
through
the
same
Raditz
mission
(
he
dodges
the
Special
Beam
Cannon
,
lol
)
.
After
that
,
more
of
the
same
.
You
're
sent
on
a
mission
to
fight
a
newly
powered
up
Nappa
and
Vegeta
.
More
of
the
same
,
you
fight
the
Saibamen
and
everything
goes
normal
...
until
something
removes
the
Saibamen
from
existence
.
A
blast
you
were
firing
at
one
zoom
right
through
where
it
was
and
hits
Vegeta
.
He
gets
pissed
,
immediately
takes
to
the
air
and
screams
about
you
drawing
his
blood
,
and
then
,
with
a
Galick
Gun
...
you
're
transported
back
to
Contoki
.
Elder
Kai
and
Trunks
scold
you
for
being
reckless
,
as
does
the
Hero
CaC
,
but
Chronoa
notices
something
is
off
.
She
says
she
's
going
to
look
in
it
...
but
then
things
get
weird
.
The
Time
Scrolls
all
go
gray
.
You
all
go
outside
and
see
that
the
Toki
Toki
Hourglass
has
stopped
.
Tokitoki
himself
is
flipping
out
.
And
then
shit
gets
real
.
A
time
storm
has
enveloped
Contoki
and
Chronoa
collapses
.
Elder
Kai
helps
her
up
and
she
demands
to
be
helped
back
to
the
Time
Nest
.
She
looks
horrified
as
she
declares
they
might
all
die
if
she
does
n't
hurry
.
After
she
leaves
,
Trunks
sends
the
Hero
and
You
to
go
and
get
all
of
the
Contoki
residents
to
safety
.
You
do
as
you
're
told
,
going
and
talking
to
several
NPC
's
,
perhaps
blowing
some
rubble
away
with
a
Super
attack
to
save
some
trapped
citizens
.
And
then
,
to
your
shock
,
a
voice
calls
out
behind
you
.
You
turn
...
and
see
Raditz
.
This
is
n't
the
Raditz
of
old
.
He
feels
different
.
He
's
wearing
the
updated
Tagoma
armor
in
his
standard
Black
and
Brown
.
He
's
wearing
a
green
visor
Scouter
.
And
...
he
remembers
you
.
He
,
against
the
very
laws
of
time
themselves
,
remembers
you
stepping
in
and
snatching
a
victory
from
him
.
You
got
him
killed
.
Raditz
cackles
and
sneers
,
and
the
he
goes
SUPER
SAIYAN
.
A
fight
with
Raditz
.
Harder
difficulty
than
you
'd
expect
in
a
game
this
early
.
Not
impossible
,
but
difficult
.
Once
you
bring
his
health
bar
down
a
third
,
the
Hero
comes
crashing
in
.
They
shake
the
dust
off
and
motion
to
you
.
Then
,
to
your
shock
,
a
similarly
updated
SUPER
SAIYAN
Nappa
flies
in
.
He
and
Raditz
evilly
laugh
and
then
the
two
of
them
charge
you
.
Another
fight
,
the
Hero
's
AI
make
up
for
your
lack
of
levels
,
skill
points
,
and
better
techniques
.
The
fight
ends
when
you
get
one
of
the
two
Saiyans
at
1/3
of
their
health
remaining
.
Nappa
and
Raditz
mock
you
for
fighting
your
new
fate
.
You
were
all
doomed
from
the
start
.
And
then
they
both
go
SUPER
SAIYAN
BLUE
!
They
prepare
to
attack
once
more
,
but
then
Trunks
and
the
GoD
in
Training
show
up
.
Nappa
and
Raditz
retreat
,
promising
that
you
'll
all
be
dead
before
you
know
it
.
They
fly
into
the
Time
Storm
and
vanish
.
The
four
of
you
go
into
the
Time
Nest
and
find
Chronoa
desperately
trying
to
disperse
the
Time
Storm
.
Chronoa
asks
if
everyone
in
Contoki
is
safe
,
you
give
her
the
affirmation
.
Tears
build
in
her
eyes
as
she
's
filled
with
relief
,
and
then
she
releases
a
burst
of
pure
temporal
energy
.
A
massive
quake
rocks
across
all
of
Contoki
City
and
then
all
is
still
.
Chronoa
falls
into
a
comatose
state
and
is
attended
to
by
Tokitoki
and
the
Elder
Kai
.
The
rest
of
you
exit
the
Time
Nest
,
now
not
seperated
from
the
rest
of
the
world
by
that
barrier
,
and
observe
things
around
you
.
Contoki
City
has
been
displaced
,
the
Toki
Toki
Hourglass
is
broken
.
You
see
the
living
Dragon
Statue
flying
away
.
You
've
officially
entered
the
Time
Broken
Universe
.
And
...
that
's
how
I
'd
open
Xenoverse
3
.
Any
thoughts
?
I
'd
appreciate
your
opinions
and
comments
on
what
I
've
come
up
with
and
I
'd
love
to
share
more
if
anyone
is
interested
.
Like
I
said
,
I
have
a
full
story
for
the
game
planned
out
a
well
as
several
new
gameplay
mechanics
lined
up
that
I
think
people
would
enjoy
.
And
,
of
course
,
thank
you
for
reading
!
</p>

<sp who="#SawkyScribe">
<p>
Well
first
off
thanks
for
the
mention
:D
this
is
a
lot
more
fleshed
out
than
my
interpretation
.
</p>
<p>
As
for
my
opinion
,
the
XV
1
character
being
a
GoD
is
a
really
great
idea
and
reduces
the
redundancy
of
having
both
CaC
from
the
previous
games
their
(
not
to
mention
all
2
million
people
who
dress
like
beerus
in
the
lobby
finally
getting
some
recognition
lol
)
.
I
'm
also
fond
of
the
XV
2
CaC
being
an
admin
,
I
feel
like
that
game
made
the
connection
between
Trunks
and
the
CaC
to
be
much
closer
so
that
seems
like
a
fitting
conclusion
.
</p>
<p>
The
establishing
of
a
serious
threat
is
done
well
with
no
only
your
first
two
CaCs
but
also
Goku
taking
notice
(
that
and
playing
as
Uub
sounds
nice
because
I
'm
a
sucker
for
changing
perspective
in
games
)
but
there
's
something
in
there
that
I
'm
not
too
fond
of
unless
you
have
plans
to
change
it
as
the
hypothetical
story
continues
.
</p>
<p>
I
felt
the
first
two
games
really
lacked
stakes
by
the
virtue
of
the
fact
than
the
Supreme
Kai
of
Time
could
pluck
fighters
from
any
point
in
history
so
even
if
you
fail
,
Goku
,
Vegeta
,
Whis
or
Beerus
can
just
come
and
clean
up
.
Not
only
that
,
but
the
CaC
is
often
portrayed
as
being
several
levels
below
them
in
power
which
felt
like
a
slap
in
the
face
so
personally
I
would
like
to
minimise
the
role
of
Major
characters
in
the
story
.
</p>
<p>
The
distortion
in
time
you
mentioned
with
Raditz
and
Nappa
remembering
fixes
a
huge
problem
with
the
very
premise
of
most
XV
missions
,
none
of
the
changes
stick
around
long
enough
to
make
an
impact
so
this
sounds
like
a
fun
idea
.
I
'd
say
SSBE
is
a
bit
much
considering
what
fodder
characters
they
are
and
I
feel
that
bombshell
would
be
better
spent
on
different
characters
but
I
think
I
see
the
idea
behind
it
.
</p>
<p>
All
and
all
,
sounds
like
a
pretty
good
start
to
give
this
game
it
's
own
story
</p>
