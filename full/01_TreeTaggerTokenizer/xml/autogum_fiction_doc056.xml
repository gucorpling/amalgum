SUBMERGED

<p>
The
chamber
which
was
destined
to
be
the
scene
of
our
unforgettable
experience
was
a
charmingly
feminine
sitting-room
,
some
fourteen
or
sixteen
feet
square
.
At
the
end
of
it
,
divided
by
a
curtain
of
red
velvet
,
was
a
small
apartment
which
formed
the
Professor
's
dressing-room
.
This
in
turn
opened
into
a
large
bedroom
.
The
curtain
was
still
hanging
,
but
the
boudoir
and
dressing-room
could
be
taken
as
one
chamber
for
the
purposes
of
our
experiment
.
One
door
and
the
window
frame
had
been
plastered
round
with
varnished
paper
so
as
to
be
practically
sealed
.
Above
the
other
door
,
which
opened
on
to
the
landing
,
there
hung
a
fanlight
which
could
be
drawn
by
a
cord
when
some
ventilation
became
absolutely
necessary
.
A
large
shrub
in
a
tub
stood
in
each
corner
.

<p>
&quot;
How
to
get
rid
of
our
excessive
carbon
dioxide
without
unduly
wasting
our
oxygen
is
a
delicate
and
vital
question
,
&quot;
said
Challenger
,
looking
round
him
after
the
five
iron
tubes
had
been
laid
side
by
side
against
the
wall
.
&quot;
With
longer
time
for
preparation
I
could
have
brought
the
whole
concentrated
force
of
my
intelligence
to
bear
more
fully
upon
the
problem
,
but
as
it
is
we
must
do
what
we
can
.
The
shrubs
will
be
of
some
small
service
.
Two
of
the
oxygen
tubes
are
ready
to
be
turned
on
at
an
instant
's
notice
,
so
that
we
cannot
be
taken
unawares
.
At
the
same
time
,
it
would
be
well
not
to
go
far
from
the
room
,
as
the
crisis
may
be
a
sudden
and
urgent
one
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
There
was
a
broad
,
low
window
opening
out
upon
a
balcony
.
The
view
beyond
was
the
same
as
that
which
we
had
already
admired
from
the
study
.
Looking
out
,
I
could
see
no
sign
of
disorder
anywhere
.
There
was
a
road
curving
down
the
side
of
the
hill
,
under
my
very
eyes
.
A
cab
from
the
station
,
one
of
those
prehistoric
survivals
which
are
only
to
be
found
in
our
country
villages
,
was
toiling
slowly
up
the
hill
.
Lower
down
was
a
nurse
girl
wheeling
a
perambulator
and
leading
a
second
child
by
the
hand
.
The
blue
reeks
of
smoke
from
the
cottages
gave
the
whole
widespread
landscape
an
air
of
settled
order
and
homely
comfort
.
Nowhere
in
the
blue
heaven
or
on
the
sunlit
earth
was
there
any
foreshadowing
of
a
catastrophe
.
The
harvesters
were
back
in
the
fields
once
more
and
the
golfers
,
in
pairs
and
fours
,
were
still
streaming
round
the
links
.
There
was
so
strange
a
turmoil
within
my
own
head
,
and
such
a
jangling
of
my
overstrung
nerves
,
that
the
indifference
of
those
people
was
amazing
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Those
fellows
do
n't
seem
to
feel
any
ill
effects
,
&quot;
said
I
,
pointing
down
at
the
links
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Have
you
played
golf
?
&quot;
asked
Lord
John
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
No
,
I
have
not
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Well
,
young
fellah
,
when
you
do
you
'll
learn
that
once
fairly
out
on
a
round
,
it
would
take
the
crack
of
doom
to
stop
a
true
golfer
.
Halloa
!
There
's
that
telephone-bell
again
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
From
time
to
time
during
and
after
lunch
the
high
,
insistent
ring
had
summoned
the
Professor
.
He
gave
us
the
news
as
it
came
through
to
him
in
a
few
curt
sentences
.
Such
terrific
items
had
never
been
registered
in
the
world
's
history
before
.
The
great
shadow
was
creeping
up
from
the
south
like
a
rising
tide
of
death
.
Egypt
had
gone
through
its
delirium
and
was
now
comatose
.
Spain
and
Portugal
,
after
a
wild
frenzy
in
which
the
Clericals
and
the
Anarchists
had
fought
most
desperately
,
were
now
fallen
silent
.
No
cable
messages
were
received
any
longer
from
South
America
.
In
North
America
the
southern
states
,
after
some
terrible
racial
rioting
,
had
succumbed
to
the
poison
.
North
of
Maryland
the
effect
was
not
yet
marked
,
and
in
Canada
it
was
hardly
perceptible
.
Belgium
,
Holland
,
and
Denmark
had
each
in
turn
been
affected
.
Despairing
messages
were
flashing
from
every
quarter
to
the
great
centres
of
learning
,
to
the
chemists
and
the
doctors
of
world-wide
repute
,
imploring
their
advice
.
The
astronomers
too
were
deluged
with
inquiries
.
Nothing
could
be
done
.
The
thing
was
universal
and
beyond
our
human
knowledge
or
control
.
It
was
death
--
painless
but
inevitable
--
death
for
young
and
old
,
for
weak
and
strong
,
for
rich
and
poor
,
without
hope
or
possibility
of
escape
.
Such
was
the
news
which
,
in
scattered
,
distracted
messages
,
the
telephone
had
brought
us
.
The
great
cities
already
knew
their
fate
and
so
far
as
we
could
gather
were
preparing
to
meet
it
with
dignity
and
resignation
.
Yet
here
were
our
golfers
and
laborers
like
the
lambs
who
gambol
under
the
shadow
of
the
knife
.
It
seemed
amazing
.
And
yet
how
could
they
know
?
It
had
all
come
upon
us
in
one
giant
stride
.
What
was
there
in
the
morning
paper
to
alarm
them
?
And
now
it
was
but
three
in
the
afternoon
.
Even
as
we
looked
some
rumour
seemed
to
have
spread
,
for
we
saw
the
reapers
hurrying
from
the
fields
.
Some
of
the
golfers
were
returning
to
the
club-house
.
They
were
running
as
if
taking
refuge
from
a
shower
.
Their
little
caddies
trailed
behind
them
.
Others
were
continuing
their
game
.
The
nurse
had
turned
and
was
pushing
her
perambulator
hurriedly
up
the
hill
again
.
I
noticed
that
she
had
her
hand
to
her
brow
.
The
cab
had
stopped
and
the
tired
horse
,
with
his
head
sunk
to
his
knees
,
was
resting
.
Above
there
was
a
perfect
summer
sky
--
one
huge
vault
of
unbroken
blue
,
save
for
a
few
fleecy
white
clouds
over
the
distant
downs
.
If
the
human
race
must
die
to-day
,
it
was
at
least
upon
a
glorious
death-bed
.
And
yet
all
that
gentle
loveliness
of
nature
made
this
terrific
and
wholesale
destruction
the
more
pitiable
and
awful
.
Surely
it
was
too
goodly
a
residence
that
we
should
be
so
swiftly
,
so
ruthlessly
,
evicted
from
it
!
