Oh
man
!
I
originally
thought
I
was
gonna
get
into
film-making
,
but
that
's
such
a
slow
and
arduous
process
,
and
sort
of
relinquish
control
to
so
many
people
because
of
such
a
big
team
and
everything
,
that
I
sort
of
fell
into
comics
as
something
where
you
,
where
the
writer
has
a
little
bit
more
control
,
like
,
directly
.
Major
influence-wise
,
I
was
a
huge
fan
of
old-school
Vertigo
stuff
:
say
,
<hi rend="italic">
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandman%20(DC%20Comics)">
Sandman
</ref>
</hi>
,
<hi rend="italic">
Lucifer
</hi>
,
<hi rend="italic">
Swamp
Thing
</hi>
,
<hi rend="italic">
Doom
Patrol
</hi>
:
those
were
the
books
that
really
made
me
want
to
write
.

was

like

My
first
comics
job
?
[
...
]
Ah
,
well
,
Caspar
Wijngaard
the
artist
and
I
pitched
<hi rend="italic">
Limbo
</hi>
to
Image
Comics
,
in-person
at
a
festival
,
a
ComicCon
,
in
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/UK">
UK
</ref>
called
Thought
Bubble
,
and
,
we
got
the
go
ahead
,
to
go
away
and
make
that
book
,
but
we
were
brand-new
,
we
had
no
idea
of
what
we
were
doing
.
And
we
entirely
had
to
essentially
work
,
or
feel
our
way
through
.
So
we
were
n't
doing
a
book
that
had
an
editor
,
or
had
other
people
in
charge
.
It
was
just
the
two
of
us
making
this
book
,
which
was
just
amazing
and
terrifying
,
but
such
a
sort
of
trial
by
fire
as
far
as
these
things
go
so
there
's
no
one
to
tell
us
how
to
do
things
things
,
but
it
was
great
,
I
mean
,
really
happy
how
the
book
came
out
.

How
has
the
times
changed
since
then
?

Well
,
now
I
am
working
with
a
,
because
I
have
done
a
lot
of
work
stuff
on
licensed
works
,
doing
stuff
which
is
other
people
's
properties
:
so
be
it
big
franchises
,
like
<hi rend="italic">
Assassin
's
Creed
</hi>
and
<hi rend="italic">
Wolfenstein
</hi>
where
it
's
very
well
established
things
that
you
have
to
sort
of
,
you
know
,
there
's
certain
fan
expectations
in
that
and
things
that
you
need
to
,
things
you
need
to
have
.
To
something
like
<hi rend="italic">
Lucifer
</hi>
which
I
am
doing
now
,
which
is
a
spin-off
of
<hi rend="italic">
Sandman
</hi>
,
so
it
's
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil%20Gaiman">
Neil
Gaiman
</ref>
worlds
,
that
I
'm
writing
.
And
so
it
's
a
big
difference
between
writing
from
something
that
's
entirely
your
own
and
you
can
do
anything
with
it
;
and
writing
something
that
's
someone
else
's
that
has
the
weight
of
history
,
you
know
,
has
a
weight
of
series
history
behind
it
.
But
,
I
enjoy
all
of
it
.
