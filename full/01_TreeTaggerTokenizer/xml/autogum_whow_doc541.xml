Internet
search

pet-adoption
agencies

a
breed-specific
rescue
group

a
breeder

A
good
breeder
or
rescue
group
is
concerned

the
welfare
of
the
animal
and
of
the
family

will
work
to
make
sure
that
you
adopt
or
buy
a
pet
that
is
a
good
match
.
Find
one
that
will
accept
the
return

Tips

<list type="unordered">

You
may
want
to
adopt
a
pet
that
is
full-grown
.
These
pets
have
often
been
house
trained
,
or
may
have
lived
in
a
foster
home
that
will
have
helpful
information
about
the
individual
animal
.

Your
rescue
group
or
breeder
may
not
immediately
have
the
pet
you
are
looking
for
,

Warnings
</head>
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Most
animal
experts
advise
against
purchasing
pets
from
pet
shops
.
Animals
sold
in
pet
shops
are
often
from
mass-breeding
operations
where
little
or
no
attention
is
paid
to
temperament
or
the
long-term
health
of
the
animals
being
bred
.
These
animals
frequently
are
less
socialized
than
pets
obtained
from
a
humane
society
or
breeder
.
Adopt
or
buy
a
pet
after
careful
consideration
and
research
,
not
on
impulse
.
