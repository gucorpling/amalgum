Why
are
you
running
for
political
office
,
why
at
the
federal
level
,
why
this
party
,
and
why
in
this
riding
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
I
am
serving
for
the
3rd
time
as
candidate
because
I
believe
in
principles
which
do
not
change
.
I
believe
in
strong
families
and
I
believe
is
social
order
.
When
we
as
a
country
supported
our
families
and
enabled
them
to
raise
their
children
without
fear
of
government
interference
then
we
had
a
strong
social
order
.
We
had
4
levels
of
government
,
self
government
,
family
government
,
church
(
spiritual
)
government
,
and
civil
government
)
which
created
healthy
,
balanced
social
order
.
The
government
did
not
interfere
in
family
and
spiritual
government
unless
there
was
good
reason
.
Today
we
have
government
interference
in
our
homes
,
in
our
places
of
worship
,
in
our
thoughts
,
how
we
express
ourselves
.
This
is
a
dangerous
precedent
!
Government
has
been
allowed
to
grow
unfettered
in
this
country
for
too
long
.
The
CHP
genuinely
believes
in
4
levels
of
government
...
each
operating
within
it
's
sphere
of
authority
.
We
believe
in
smaller
government
.
We
believe
in
healthy
families
.
We
believe
in
a
future
for
this
country
free
from
the
all
pervasive
power
of
the
state
!

Previous

you

How
will
you
apply
your
previous
work/volunteer/life
experience

serving
your
constituents
?
