Paderno
d'Adda
is
famous
for
its
old
iron
bridge
(
the
<hi rend="bold">
San
Michele
Bridge
</hi>
)
and
it
is
a
good
gateway
to
the
Adda
river
.
It
has
a
connection
with
Leonardo
Da
Vinci
,
who
lived
and
worked
for
some
time
in
the
nearby
town
of
Vaprio
d'Adda
.
An
open
air
museum
(
Ecomuseo
Adda
di
Leonardo
)
celebrates
the
Italian
genius
and
his
works
along
the
Adda
river
.

</head>
<p>
The
village
is
quite
small
and
the
river
bank
is
only
accessible
by
foot
or
by
bike
.

The
San

Bridge
</hi>
.
The
<hi rend="bold">
San
Michele
Bridge
</hi>
(
locally
known
simply
as
the
<hi rend="italic">
Paderno
Bridge
</hi>
)
is
more
than
100
years
old
,
since
it
was
built
in
1889
to
cross
the
Adda
river
.
The
iron
bridge
is
85mt
high
and
266mt
long
,
and
Its
structure
resembles
closely
the
<ref target="Eiffel%20Tower">
Eiffel
Tower
</ref>
.
It
has
a
double-deck
structure
,
with
the
upper
deck
reserved
to
vehicular
traffic
and
the
lower
deck
used
by
the
Milano-Bergamo
train
line
.
The
bridge
is
still
opened
to
vehicles
,
with
a
traffic
light
regulating
the
traffic
(
only
one
way
by
turns
)
.
Be
aware
that
,
due
to
the
advanced
age
of
the
structure
,
heavier
vehicles
are
forbidden
to
cross
the
bridge
.
The
train
crosses
the
bridge
between
Paderno
d'Adda
and
Calusco
stations
.
While
Paderno
station
is
near
the
bridge
,
Calusco
is
quite
far
away
.

Do
</head>
<p>
From
San
Michele
Bridge
,
you
can
reach
the
<hi rend="bold">
Adda
river
bank
</hi>
.
At
the
left
of
the
bridge
you
will
see
a
little
chapel
,
here
departs
the
road
which
leads
to
the
river
bank
.
Pay
attention
to
the
difference
in
height
:
the
river
lies
85mt
below
the
bridge
level
and
there
is
a
steep
road
to
climb
when
you
return
.
</p>
<p>
The
river
bank
is
reserved
to
pedestrian
and
cyclists
.
Expect
a
lot
of
people
during
sunny
week-ends
,
since
this
is
favourite
place
for
locals
to
go
walking
,
biking
and
jogging
.
Pay
attention
to
little
children
,
especially
if
you
ride
a
bike
.
</p>
<p>
The
river
bank
is
a
great
spot
for
photographers
and
can
also
be
a
quiet
and
peaceful
place
(
when
it
's
not
packed
with
people
)
.

Imbersago
and
Leonardo
's
ferry
boat
</hi>
.
you
can
reach
Imbersago
and
its
ferry
boat
.
It
's
a
40
minutes
long
walk
,
on
a
flat
path
.
During
the
trip
you
can
enjoy
the
quiet
river
bank
and
spot
many
birds
and
little
animals
.
In
Imbersago
you
can
see
Leonardo
's
ferry
boat
.
The
ferry
boat
has
no
engine
,
it
crosses
the
river
using
solely
the
river
flow
force
.
Leonardo
wrote
down
some
notes
about
this
kind
of
boat
,
although
it
's
not
certain
if
he
designed
it
or
he
just
observed
some
of
these
boats
already
active
during
the
time
he
spent
here
.
Leonardo
's
notes
and
drawings
about
the
ferry
are
contained
in
the
Windsor
Codex
and
copies
are
on
display
at
the
ferry
's
embarcadero
.
In
the
past
up
to
five
of
these
boats
crossed
the
river
at
various
locations
.
Nowadays
this
is
the
only
ferry
left
using
the
moving
principle
drawn
by
Leonardo
.
It
operates
daily
and
it
can
carry
persons
,
bikes
and
even
one
or
two
cars
,
but
there
is
not
much
to
see
on
the
other
bank
.
The
service
may
be
suspended
if
the
water
level
is
too
low
.

Naviglio
di
Paderno
</hi>
.
Naviglio
di
Paderno
is
an
artificial
channel
built
to
overcome
the
rapids
on
this
part
of
the
river
and
make
the
navigation
between
Milan
(
via
the
Martesana
channel
)
and
Como
lake
possible
.
The
first
project
was
made
by
Leonardo
on
behalf
of
Francis
I
of
France
,
but
it
was
not
built
until
1777
.
Unfortunately
the
channel
is
not
used
anymore
,
due
to
the
lack
of
interest
in
river
navigation
.
It
is
now
active
as
a
dam
for
nearby
hydroelectric
plants
.

Continuing
southward
you
will
reach
the
<hi rend="bold">
Forra
d'Adda
rapids
</hi>
(
1km/0.6mi
from
the
bridge
)
,
this
is
where
the
river
flows
most
rapidly
.
A
detail
of
three
rock
emerging
from
the
river
is
believed
to
be
painted
on
the

of
Leonardo

The

Continuing
along

it
's
possible
to
reach
the

Bertini

and
<hi rend="bold">
Carlo
Esterle
</hi>
(
5km/3mi
from
the
bridge

power
plants
,
the
second
one
is
a
real
monument
:
it
's
build
to
look
like
an
eclectic-style
palace
rather
than
an
ordinary
power
plant
.

The
path
on
the
river
bank
then
continues
for
many
kilometers
,
eventually
joining
the
Martesana
channel
which
goes
straight
to
the
center
of
Milan
.
Pay
attention
to
not
push
yourself
too
far
,
remember
that
you
have
to
go
back
and
there
are
no
easy
transportation
systems
to
rely
upon
.
Be
also
aware
that
the
path
climbs
down
on
this
direction
,
always
remember
that
you
have
to
go
back
.
