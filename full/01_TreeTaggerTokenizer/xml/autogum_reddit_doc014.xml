If
you
look
in
/r/kratom
,
you
will
see
a
lot
of
people
who
do
not
think
kratom
is
an
opioid
.
Definition
of
an
opioid
-
Opioids
are
substances
that
act
on
opioid
receptors
to
produce
morphine-like
effects
.
Definition
of
an
opiate
-
a
drug
derived
from
opium
.
Opioid
,
a
more
modern
term
,
is
used
to
designate
all
substances
,
both
natural
and
synthetic
,
that
bind
to
opioid
receptors
in
the
brain
(
including
antagonists
)
.
Kratom
is
NOT
an
opiate
.
It
is
an
opioid
.
It
acts
on
the
opioid
receptors
to
produce
a
psychoactive
effect
that
is
not
entirely
dissimilar
to
alkaloids
such
as
morphine
and
codeine
and
is
even
addictive
.
So
if
this
is
the
definition
of
an
opioid
,
why
are
there
people
saying
kratom
is
not
an
opioid
?
Let
's
examine
:
One
big
issue
people
have
is
that
the
alkaloids
in
kratom
do
not
recruit
beta
arrestin
2
(
which
is
responsible
in
part
for
respiratory
depression
)
like
opiates
do
.
Why
does
this
matter
when
defining
what
is
and
is
n't
an
opioid
?
It
completely
does
n't
,
not
at
all
,
not
according
to
the
scientific
community
.
There
are
a
couple
of
papers
that
people
will
throw
around
that
argue
that
it
SHOULD
be
classified
as
something
other
than
an
opioid
,
but
obviously
a
few
scientists
saying
something
SHOULD
be
does
not
mean
it
IS
.
People
will
then
say
that
kratom
is
in
the
same
family
as
coffee
(
rubiacea
)
because
they
think
it
makes
it
seem
harmless
,
but
also
in
that
family
is
psychotria
viridis
,
a
DMT/MAOI
containing
plant
that
is
often
used
in
the
preparation
of
ayahuasca
.
Likewise
,
the
solanacae
family
houses
nightshade
,
datura
,
potatoes
,
bell
peppers
,
tobacco
,
petunias
,
gooseberries
,
etc.
So
clearly
there
is
a
lot
of
fucking
room
for
variation
within
taxonomic
families
.
Another
argument
is
that
we
do
n't
consider
the
casomorphins
in
cheese
and
milk
to
be
opioids
,
which
we
totally
do
,
but
even
if
we
did
n't
it
is
totally
fucking
ridiculous
because
you
are
comparing
a
natural
protein
found
in
mammal
milk
to
a
psychoactive
,
addictive
drug
.
Casomorphins
are
NOT
psychoactive
,
but
they
ARE
opioids
.
They
are
mildly
psychoactive
,
but
have
not
been
shown
to
cause
addiction
.
You
'd
have
to
do
an
extraction
if
you
wanted
to
feel
anything
,
because
there
is
no
way
your
stomach
could
hold
enough
dairy
to
get
any
effects
from
casomorphins
.
Then
there
's
the
argument
that
kratom
is
n't
an
opioid
,
but
simply
contains
opioids
,
which
is
again
,
pretty
fucking
insane
.
I
mean
it
's
TECHNICALLY
correct
,
but
if
that
is
the
logic
you
want
to
use
,
the
poppy
plant
is
not
an
opiate
,
and
coffee
is
not
a
stimulant
.
I
do
n't
think
anybody
is
arguing
that
kratom
,
the
plant
,
is
in
itself
a
single
psychoactive
compound
,
so
there
should
be
no
arguments
trying
to
dispute
that
claim
.
When
somebody
claims
that
X
plant
is
an
agonist
for
ABC
receptor
,
you
know
that
they
mean
that
the
plant
simply
contains
agonists
of
that
receptor
.
I
just
wanted
to
get
this
information
out
there
in
case
anybody
is
finding
themselves
lost
in
the
arguments
of
/r/kratom
.
It
's
funny
,
you
will
literally
find
these
arguments
nowhere
else
on
the
internet
.
It
is
a
complete
propaganda
sub
now
,
which
is
a
real
fucking
shame
.
Kratom
is
an
amazing
plant
that
has
quite
literally
saved
my
life
.
I
am
9
months
clean
thanks
to
it
.
We
should
be
using
science
to
show
how
kratom
is
different
,
instead
of
trying
to
change
the
science
itself
.
The
bit
about
it
not
recruiting
beta
arrestin
2
is
HUGE
.
That
it
is
a
partial
agonist
over
a
full
agonist
is
another
great
quality
.
These
are
the
properties
which
differentiate
kratom
from
other
,
more
dangerous
opioids
.
This
is
what
makes
it
safe
.
These
facts
should
be
paraded
.
There
is
concrete
scientific
evidence
behind
it
to
refute
all
those
scare-articles
on
kratom
overdoses
and
kratom
addiction
.
I
think
it
is
a
much
better
argument
than
fighting
over
the
semantics
over
whether
or
not
it
is
an
opioid
.
What
's
even
worse
is
that
you
ca
n't
even
present
these
arguments
in
the
kratom
sub
without
being
banned
.
They
are
pushing
complete
propaganda
and
the
people
of
that
sub
are
buying
into
it
completely
.
It
's
actually
pretty
fucking
scary
.
I
think
the
focus
on
these
arguments
over
more
scientific
ones
could
definitely
hurt
the
fight
to
keep
kratom
legal
.
Not
that
they
are
n't
helping
.
The
sub
is
big
on
activism
.
But
anybody
who
does
even
some
mild
research
will
be
able
to
see
that
these
people
are
not
in
line
with
what
the
scientific
community
is
saying
.
You
ca
n't
fight
fire
with
fire
when
propaganda
is
the
fire
.
You
have
to
fight
it
with
truth
.
</p>

Yeah
I
think
it
's
great
if
a
person
switches
their
heroin
addiction
to
a
kratom
addiction
.
</p>
<p>
Obviously
leaps
and
bounds
safer
.
But
if
you
have
any
sort
of
serious
tolerance
to
opiates
,
you
will
be
blowing
through
that
shit
like
it
's
going
out
of
style
.
There
were
periods
of
time
during
my
addiction
were
I
would
take
close
to
80-100
GRAMS
of
the
shot
a
day
lol
.
</p>
<p>
The
duration
is
even
shorter
than
regular
opiates
so
the
compulsion
to
redose
has
constantly
was
even
more
prevalent
.
</p>
<p>
My
life
actually
got
WORSE
when
I
let
my
newfound
kratom
habit
soar
to
insane
levels
.
Granted
I
'm
an
extreme
case
.
It
's
an
opiate
and
it
can
absolutely
run
your
life
just
like
any
other
full
agonist
opiate
can
.
</p>
<p>
I
went
from
oxys-kratom-suboxone-kratom-7
day
sub
taper
and
finally
sobriety
.
</p>
<p>
Unless
you
want
to
remain
chained
to
a
drug
it
's
just
more
of
the
same
and
it
always
ends
up
in
the
same
place
.
Dosing
just
to
wake
up
,
dosing
to
go
to
the
store
,
dosing
to
go
to
family
events
etc.
</p>
<p>
Life
is
SO
fucking
much
better
when
you
can
wake
up
without
drowning
20g
of
green
leafy
garbage
puking
all
over
the
place
occasionally
lol
.
