I
gave
recently
gave
birth
within
the
last
month
to
a
baby
boy
,
we
will
call
G.
Ever
since
bringing
him
home
and
for
some
of
our
stay
at
the
hospital
,
I
have
n’t
felt
attached
to
him
.
When
he
was
born
he
swallowed
some
of
his
first
stool
(
I
do
n’t
know
the
actual
term
for
it
)
and
required
observation
.
He
also
was
required
to
be
kept
in
a
warmer
and
on
oxygen
for
the
majority
of
our
stay
so
i
had
little
to
no
interaction
with
him
.
I
was
unable
to
go
into
the
nursery
to
check
on
him
,
the
nurses
would
simply
say
he
was
okay
and
tell
me
to
return
to
my
room
.
When
I
saw
him
through
the
nursery
windows
,
it
pained
me
to
see
him
in
an
incubator
and
with
tubes
sticking
out
of
him
.
After
the
first
few
times
of
being
turned
away
from
actually
seeing
him
when
he
happened
to
be
out
of
the
incubator
,
I
did
n’t
want
to
see
him
.
I
did
n’t
want
to
see
him
through
the
windows
or
at
all
.
It
’s
gotten
better
since
we
got
to
come
home
though
.
I
still
do
n’t
have
that
overwhelming
love
and
desire
to
basically
helicopter
over
him
at
all
hours
that
seems
the
norm
.
When
people
ask
me
what
I
think
about
him
,
all
that
I
can
think
is
that
he
is
my
son
,
but
he
is
a
baby
just
like
the
other
babies
in
the
world
.
I
do
n’t
wait
on
him
with
baited
breath
to
see
if
he
did
a
thing
,
I
still
go
about
and
clean
and
indulge
in
my
hobbies
when
he
is
sleeping
.
I
’m
not
saying
that
I
do
n’t
run
to
him
when
he
cries
,
but
I
give
G
a
chance
to
self-soothe
as
encouraged
by
his
doctor
.
I
check
on
him
multiple
times
during
the
night
to
make
sure
he
is
still
breathing
and
does
n’t
require
oxygen
.
I
ordered
a
tank
at
home
at
the
insistence
of
his
doctor
as
a
precaution
in
case
he
begins
to
have
issues
again
.
I
try
to
make
sure
that
he
does
n’t
sit
in
a
dirty
diaper
for
long
,
to
the
extent
that
I
will
wake
him
up
when
he
is
sleeping
to
check
.
But
it
’s
been
brought
up
multiple
times
by
my
family
that
I
will
probably
be
a
mom
just
like
mine
was
.
I
admit
that
I
’m
not
attached
to
him
but
it
does
n’t
automatically
mean
that
I
’m
going
to
be
neglectful
or
abusive
to
him
.
It
’s
been
brought
up
that
since
I
do
n’t
like
holding
my
son
,
that
I
must
not
want
to
be
around
him
at
all
and
it
’s
the
first
sign
that
I
will
be
neglectful
.
I
’ve
been
trying
to
bond
with
him
.
I
’ve
been
babbling
to
him
even
though
I
find
it
awkward
since
he
ca
n’t
say
anything
back
.
I
do
n’t
let
anyone
else
except
his
father
watch
him
since
my
family
is
heavy
smokers
and
I
do
n’t
trust
them
to
not
smoke
around
him
.
They
all
smoke
in
their
houses
and
get
petty
when
they
come
to
visit
and
I
make
them
smoke
outside
and
wash
their
hands
before
they
touch
him
.
I
just
do
n’t
know
how
to
make
my
family
see
that
I
am
trying
to
bond
with
my
son
but
their
remarks
are
making
it
harder
to
do
so
.

<p>
Give
it
time
.
Its
hard
at
the
start
and
it
takes
time
to
fall
in
love
with
someone
new
.
</p>
<p>
As
for
the
holding
etc
,
I
say
fake
it
til
you
feel
it
.
I
know
I
did
that
sometimes
when
my
twins
were
infants
.
They
were
in
the
NICU
for
9
weeks
,
so
we
had
a
delay
to
the
bonding
etc
too
.
I
held
them
,
kissed
them
,
did
all
the
things
I
knew
they
needed
from
me
...
even
if
I
was
n't
feeling
it
at
the
time
.
</p>
<p>
And
holy
shit
did
I
fall
in
love
with
them
.
For
me
,
this
did
n't
happen
until
they
were
7
months
old
and
I
realized
I
had
postpartum
depression
and
got
help
for
it
.
If
you
are
healthy
,
it
will
likely
happen
way
sooner
for
you

</p>
<p>
Hang
in
there
,
it
's
really
hard
having
a
newborn
(
or
two
!
)
.
