Hold
a
Fork
</head>
<p>
Proper
table
etiquette
may
vary
depending
on
where
you
are
.
There
are
two
traditional
Western
schools
of
eating
with
a
fork
and
knife
:
the
European
&quot;
continental
&quot;
style
,
and
the
American
&quot;
cut-and-switch
&quot;
or
&quot;
zig-zag
&quot;
style
.
However
,
the
American
version
may
have
actually
begun
several
hundred
years
ago
in
France
.
In
most
modern
settings
,
however
,
it
does
n't
much
matter
how
you
hold
the
fork
as
long
as
you
're
able
to
eat
efficiently
.

Hold
your
fork
in
your
left
hand
.
Most
European
eaters
keep
the
knife
in
their
right
hand
for
cutting
,
and
they
keep
the
fork
in
their
left
hand
for
eating
.
In
the
American
style
,
eaters
switch
the
fork
over
to
their
right
hand
to
eat
the
pieces
that
they
have
cut
.
Traditionally
,
this
is
the
main
difference
between
the
European
and
American
forking
styles
.
The
European
style
is
often
considered
more
efficient
because
you
do
n't
have
to
remove
the
fork
from
you
hand
until
you
are
done
eating
.

If
you
're
setting
the
table
for
&quot;
European-style
&quot;
eating
:
make
sure
to
arrange
the
fork
on
the
left-hand
side
of
the
plate
,
and
the
knife
on
the
right-hand
side
.

Use
the
fork
with
the
tines
facing
down
.
This
is
traditional
European
etiquette
.
Be
aware
,
however
,
that
many
modern
Europeans
not
longer
pay
much
heed
to
which
way
their
tines
are
facing
.
Hold
the
handle
between
your
thumb
and
your
middle
,
ring
,
and
pinky
fingers
.
Place
your
index
finger
at
the
end
of
the
handle
where
it
meets
the
base
of
the
fork
tines
.
Let
the
end
of
the
handle
rest
in
the
crease
of
your
palm
.

Pick
up
knife
in
your
right
hand
.
Hold
it
in
your
hand
in
the
same
closed-fist
manner
that
you
hold
your
fork
.
Use
it
to
rake
the
food
onto
your
fork
.
Fold
or
push
the
food
onto
the
tines
of
your
fork
with
your
knife
if
it
is
a
salad
or
soft
food
.
Use
a
gentle
sawing
motion
with
the
knife
if
you
are
cutting
meat
,
pizza
or
a
similar
food
.
You
can
actually
push
more
food
securely
onto
your
fork
with
the
European
method
than
with
the
scooping
American
method
.

Eat
your
meal
.
Insert
the
fork
into
your
mouth
with
the
tines
still
scooping
down
.
Do
n't
turn
the
fork
or
put
it
into
your
right
hand
.
When
you
are
finished
,
rest
your
fork
and
knife
parallel
on
the
plate
with
the
tines
facing
down
.
If
you
see
the
plate
as
a
clock
face
:
the
tines
and
blade
should
be
at
10
o'clock
,
and
the
handles
at
4
o'clock
.

Cut
food
with
the
knife
in
your
right
hand
and
the
fork
in
your
left
.
Hold
the
food
in
place
with
the
tines
of
your
fork

Then
,
saw
with
the
knife
to
slice
the
food
item
into
a
bite-sized
piece
.
This
part
is
essentially
the
same
as
the
European
method
.

Point
the
tines
down
.
According
to
traditional
&quot;
etiquette
,
&quot;
your
tines
should
face
down
,
with
your
palm
wrapped
around
the
end
of
the
handle
.
Extend
your
index
finger
to
the
base
of
the
fork

Do
n't
worry
about
which
way
the
tines
are
turned
.
It
may
be
easier
to
pick
up
food
if
you
turn
your
tines
upward
,
like
a
shovel

Switch
your
fork

to
eat

After
you
've
cut
the
piece
of
food
,
place
your
knife
on
the
edge
of
the
plate

Switch
your
fork
to
your
right
hand

The
end
of
the
fork
will
rest
in
the
area
between
your
thumb
and
index
finger
.
Use
your
right
hand
to
bring
the
food
to
your
mouth
,
and
then
switch
the
fork
back
over
to
your
left
hand
so
that
you
can
cut
another
piece
with
the
knife
in
your
right
hand
.
Repeat
,
switching
hands
each
time
you
take
a
bite

The
American
method
may
be
more
efficient
if
you
cut
your
entire
meal
into
pieces
before
you
switch
the
fork
to
your
right
hand
.
This
way
,
you
wo
n't
have
to
keep
switching
the
utensils
back
and
forth
.

<item>
Decide
which
way
is
more
efficient
.
Many
modern
eaters
and
etiquette
critics
claim
that
the
European
style
is
less
formal
and
more
efficient
than
the
American
method
.
It
is
less
disruptive
to
the
eating
process
.
Know
that
archaic
social
rules
notwithstanding
,
there
is
truly
no
&quot;
right
&quot;
or
&quot;
wrong
&quot;
way
to
hold
a
fork
as
long
as
you
can
eat
your
meal
.
