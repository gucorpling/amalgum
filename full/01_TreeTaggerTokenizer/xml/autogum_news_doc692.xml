U.S.

passed
a
revised

designed
to

struggling
U.S.

,
which
has
measures
nearly
identical
to

rejected
by
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/U.S._House_of_Representatives">

House
of

on

</p>
<p>
&quot;
Senate
Democrats
and
Republicans
believe
it
is
essential
that
we
work
quickly
on
this
important
legislation
to
restore
confidence
to
our
financial
system
and
strengthen
the
economy

Senate
Majority
Leader

</p>
<p>
The
new
revisions
include
raising
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FDIC">

insurance
cap
to
$
250,000
,
a
move
designed
to
please
progressives
.
However
,
the
$
110
billion
in

tax
breaks
</ref>
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earmark%20(politics)">

</ref>
and
what
has
been
called
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pork%20barrel">
pork
barrel
</ref>
spending
is
not
offset
by
any
increases
in
revenues
and
has
added
opposition
to
the
bill
from
some
Representatives
in
the
House
.
</p>
<p>
Earmarks
added
into
the
bailout
bill
included
$
192
million
in
tax
rebates
for
the
Virgin
Islands
rum
industry
,
$
148
million
in
tax
cuts
for
the
wool
industry
,
$
100
million
tax
cuts
to
the
auto
racing
industry
,
and
$
48
million
in

tax
incentives

,
Steve
Ellis
,
offered
his
explanation
for
the
pork
and
earmarks
added
in
.
&quot;
People
who
support
some
of
these
provisions
will
forget
about
the
$
700
billion
and
concerns
they
may
have
on
that
,
and
say
,
'
If
you
give
me
a
few
million
in
tax
breaks
for
my
constituents
,
I
'll
go
along
'
&quot;
.
</p>
<p>
The
tactic
seems
to
have
worked
,
however
,
managing
to
flip
enough
votes
to
pass
the
bill
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
The
inclusion
of
parity
,
tax
extenders
and
the
FDIC
increases
has
caused
me
to
reconsider
my
position

&quot;
All
three
additions
have
greatly
improved
the
bill

the

HAVE
YOUR
SAY
Do
you
think
the
bailout
bill
will
help
the
US
economy
,
hurt
it
,
or
be
a
waste
of
money
?
