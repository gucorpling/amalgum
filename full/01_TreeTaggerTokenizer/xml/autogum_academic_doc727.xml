Reflexive
and
engaged
design
involvements
towards
ensuring
adequate
and
sustained
access
to
resources
and
services
at
the
margins
in
an
inclusive
and
socially
embedded
way
,
is
a
need
for
the
hour
,
particularly
when
the
global
South
,
including
rural
India
,
is
experiencing
severe
structural
,
discursive
,
and
power
disparities
.
Design
for
sustainable
social
change
,
according
to
scholars
,
needs
to
pay
diligent
attention
to
address
contextual
issues
and
disparities
experienced
by
these
underserved
populations
.
Such
design
engagements
,
by
paying
attention
to
social
,
political
,
moral
and
ecological
dimensions
,
envision
a
just
society
that
promotes
cultural
diversity
and
plurality
,
create
equal
opportunity
as
well
as
fight
against
all
kinds
of
disparities
.
In
global
South
contexts
,
many
designers
oftentimes
not
only
take
their
privileges
for
granted
in
an
unreflexive
way
,
but
also
their
expertise
oftentimes
lacks
contextual
knowledge
(
including
historical
,
social
and
cultural
understanding
)
,
and
primarily
emphasize
technical
knowledge
.
Future
of
design
could
imagine
and
potentially
ensure
engaged
interaction
between
designers
and
non-designers
as
well
as
between
universal
and
local
epistemologies
to
integrate
technical
knowledge
with
cultural
nuances
,
situated
values
and
aspirations
.
</p>
<p>
Thus
,
effective
design
initiatives
for
sustainable
social
change
is
essentially
contingent
on
our
understanding
of
human
behavior
,
values
,
and
contextual
realities
,
as
well
as
our
commitment
to
meaningfully
address
human
needs
and
expectations
.
Guided
by
our
mindfulness
,
competence
,
sensibilities
,
and
preparedness
as
well
as
by
agentic
capabilities
,
values
,
practices
,
and
situated
knowledge
of
cultural
participants
,
such
design
engagements
would
potentially
co-create
avenues
for
meaningful
change
,
empowerment
,
and
equality
.
Some
of
the
key
components
of
such
an
approach
are
defining
the
design
problem(s)
and
identifying
the
solution
avenues
together
with
local
people
;
transdisciplinary
knowledge
production
through
collaborations
and
conversations
;
and
empowering
and
enhancing
local
capacities
by
reducing
existing
dependencies
.
While
the
aforementioned
principles
and
aspects
guided
and
shaped
my
research
journey
,
my
design
engagements
at
the
margins
emanated
three
thoughts
and/or
reflections
,
which
I
elaborate
on
in
the
following
paragraphs
.
</p>
<head>
5.1
.
Re-Calibrating
and
Re-Forming
Myself
</head>
<p>
As
a
design
researcher
it
is
crucial
for
me
to
unlearn
and
introspectively
de-construct
my
embodied
ethnocentrism
,
unearned
privileges
as
well
as
unexamined
presumptions
and
practices
that
potentially
cause
formidable
barriers
to
learning
and
innovating
.
Such
engagements
helped
me
in
exploring
new
learning
and
relearning
endeavors
that
potentially
opened
up
socio-culturally
meaningful
knowledge
production
and
problem-solving
avenues
.
In
other
words
,
challenging
my
unearned
privileges
,
ethnocentric
assumptions
,
and
sub-/un-conscious
senses
of
superiority
as
well
as
self-introspecting
to
act
mindfully
,
compassionately
,
and
ethically
was
pivotal
to
my
design
journey
.
Apart
from
unlearning
and
relearning
,
reflexive
communicative
engagements
(
including
critical
listening
and
mindful
dialogue
)
and
intercultural
competence
was
essential
to
re-build
and
prepare
myself
.
Scholars
have
noted
that
critical
listening
engagements
essentially
question
societal
power
dynamics
and
uncritical
assumptions
that
foreclose
local
voices
;
whereas
a
dialogic
involvement
fundamentally
opens
up
avenues
for
co-constructing
respectful
and
impactful
interactive
environment
in
bringing
about
transformations
.
Such
engagements
were
crucial
for
me
to
potentially
bridge
situated
interactive
barriers
,
silences
and
even
the
communicative
impossibilities
that
divide
the
societies
,
and
to
make
design
research
open
,
inclusive
,
and
conducive
.
Moreover
,
in
less-known
cultural
contexts
,
inculcating
and
nurturing
the
qualities
of
intercultural
competence
such
as
empathy
and
compassion
are
crucial
for
me
in
making
design
engagements
conducive
,
respectful
,
and
emancipatory
.

Beyond
Participation
—
Self-Organization
</head>
<p>
As
opposed
to
modernist
and
top-down
approaches
to
design
,
scholars
have
argued
in
favor
of
participatory
and
co-creative
involvements
,
where
the
designers
and
community
members
work
hand
in
hand
as
co-researchers
to
potentially
reduce
dependency
on
external
resources
and
expertise
,
and
to
build
avenues
for
empowerment
and
change
.
Questioning
the
West-centric
and
hegemonic
approaches
,
critical
scholars
envision
cultural
participants
as
the
central
organizing
force
and
active
guiding
entity
for
community
mobilization
.
Furthermore
,
scholars
have
called
for
critically
examining
and
de-centering
the
exogenous
experts
and
knowledge
production
practices
to
bring
about
sustainable
transformations
at
the
margins
of
the
global
South
.
In
my
design
engagements
,
legitimizing
situated
social
and
cultural
resources
as
valuable
entities
,
and
prioritizing
local
autonomy
were
important
for
me
towards
co-creating
affordable
,
customized
and
sustainable
designs
.
In
my
design
journey
,
I
sought
to
legitimize
meaningful
community
mobilization
and
agentic
control
over
the
process
,
encouraging
cultural
participants
to
take
over
and
independently
organize
design
initiatives
.
Scholars
term
such
approaches
as
self-organization
(
i.
e.
,
extending
beyond
participation
;
e.
g.
,
von
Unger
,
,
where
participants
collectively
assume
the
leadership/ownership
by
minimizing
or
eliminating
dependence
on
external
resources
and
knowledge
.
