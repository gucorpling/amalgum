Prepare
for
Herniated
Disk
Surgery
</head>
<p>
A
herniated
disk
occurs
when
the
cushion
between
your
vertebrae
begins
to
wear
down
.
Instead
of
acting
as
a
cushion
,
the
vertebrae
can
actually
press
on
nerves
,
resulting
in
pain
.
Surgery
is
necessary
for
a
herniated
disk
if
other
methods
to
relieve
the
back
pain
do
not
work
.
Preparing
for
herniated
disk
surgery
is
largely
a
matter
of
knowing
what
to
expect
.

Undergo
a

complete
any
tests
deemed
necessary
by
your

--
possibly
a
urine
sample
and
an
X-ray
.
You
'll
also
need
to
supply
your
medical
history

Make

you
have

Ask
your
doctor
questions
you
have
in
regards
to
your
herniated
disk
surgery
and
fully
research
the
procedure
.
There
are
three
common
types
of
herniated
disc
surgery
:
laminectomy
,
corpectomy
,
and
anterior
cervical
discectomy
and
fusion
.

Eat
fruits
and
vegetables
,
and
drink
plenty
of
water
in
the
days
and
weeks
leading
up
to
your
herniated
disk
surgery
.
Adequate
hydration
will
help
your
body
before
and
after
surgery
,
so
aim
for
10
glasses
of
water
per
day
.

time
to
rest
and
relax
prior

your
herniated
disk
surgery
.
Seek
help
around
the
house

any
chores

you
do
n't
re-injure
your
back
prior
to
surgery

Stop
smoking
.
Smoking
can
cause
surgery
complications
and
can
lengthen
your
healing
time
.
Some
doctors
recommend
quitting
6
to
8
weeks
prior
to
surgery
,
while
others
only
insist
on
no
cigarettes
for
24
hours
prior
to
surgery
.
Check
with
your
doctor
on
this
issue
.

Your

other
ways
for
12

surgery
.

Plan
ahead
for
an
overnight
stay
at
the
hospital
.

you
make
proper
arrangements
ahead
of
time
just
in
case
.

for
your
recovery
at
home
following
your
herniated

the
hospital

also
want

around
to

you
at
home
as
you

progressing
.
However
,
you
must
wait
about
6
weeks
to

anything
other
than
desk
work
