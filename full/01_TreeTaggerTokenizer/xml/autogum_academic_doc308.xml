Introduction
to
ALD
</head>
<p>
A
key
strategy
for
the
direct
growth
of
thin
films
with
controllable
dimensions
at
the
nanometer
scale
is
atomic
layer
deposition
(
ALD
)
.
ALD
is
based
on
sequential
and
self-limiting
chemical
reactions
,
allowing
the
preparation
of
inorganic
nanomaterials
such
as
oxides
,
nitrides
and
metals
,
with
a
(
sub)nanometer
thickness
control
.
Typically
,
during
an
ALD
cycle
,
alternate
pulses
of
precursors
and
co-reactant
gas
molecules
are
injected
in
a
vacuum
reactor
,
separated
by
purge/pumping
steps
.
The
advantages
of
the
ALD
technique
are
thickness
control
at
the
atomic-level
,
the
excellent
uniformity
and
the
conformality
over
the
substrate
surface
.
This
route
is
therefore
an
excellent
technique
to
coat
complex
3D
substrates
such
as
nanowires
and
other
nanostructures
.
These
key
benefits
allowed
this
technology
to
become
a
key
route
for
the
deposition
of
thin
films
for
a
wide
range
of
applications
,
especially
microelectronics
,
but
the
technique
is
also
used
for
catalysis
,
membranes
,
photovoltaics
and
sensing
.

ALD
Layers
for
the
Enhancement
of
Gas
Sensors
</head>
<p>
Semiconductor
metal
oxide
materials
are
used
as
gas
sensors
because
of
their
chemoresistant
behavior
.
The
incorporation
of
the
gas
sensitive
material
in
a
sensor
as
a
thin
film
is
very
advantageous
,
as
it
makes
the
sensor
production
compatible
with
semiconductor
manufacturing
processes
,
allows
for
miniaturization
and
relatively
low
costs
.
Furthermore
,
a
thin
sensing
layer
results
typically
in
high
sensitivity
,
fast
response
,
and
minimal
power
consumption
.
Therefore
,
ALD
has
been
used
for
the
fabrication
of
various
gas
sensing
materials
.
For
example
,
Du
and
George
synthesized
SnO2
films
for
CO
sensing
,
and
Aronniemi
et
al.
applied
ALD
for
the
production
of
iron
oxide
films
applied
to
CO
and
O2
sensing
.
Other
gas
sensing
semiconductor
compounds
have
been
fabricated
by
ALD
such
as
TiO2
,
ZnO
,
or
In2O3
for
examples
.
Recently
,
our
group
reported
a
novel
route
for
the
preparation
of
gas
sensors
with
enhanced
hydrogen
selectivity
,
by
using
ultrathin
BN
layers
prepared
by
ALD
.
The
sensors
presented
in
this
study
were
based
on
ZnO
nanowires
coated
with
a
5
nm
BN
film
prepared
by
ALD
decorated
with
Pd
NPs
.
<figure>
Figure

</figure>
shows
TEM
images
of
these
nanowires
.
</p>
<p>
Due
to
the
difference
in
work
function
between
ZnO
and
the
BN
monolayer
,
electrons
from
Schottky
barriers
are
formed
on
the
interfaces
which
expand
the
electron
depletion
layer
,
when
compared
to
pristine
ZnO
NWs
.
Upon
exposure
of
the
gas
sensor
to
dihydrogen
gas
and
release
of
electrons
to
ZnO
NWs
surface
,
the
barrier
height
is
decreased
,
leading
to
a
higher
modulation
of
the
resistance
and
thus
a
higher
sensor
response
.
Furthermore
,
as
Pd
can
efficiently
adsorb
and
dissociate
H2
molecules
upon
exposure
to
dihydrogen
gas
,
the
metallic
Pd
may
be
partially
converted
to
PdHx
.
Due
to
the
difference
in
the
resistance
of
Pd
and
PdHx
,
this
conversion
is
also
expected
to
increase
the
gas
sensor
sensitivity
.
Finally
,
due
to
the
BN
structure
which
is
somewhat
similar
to
graphene
,
the
ultrathin
film
can
act
as
an
efficient
nanomembrane
and
let
hydrogen
atoms
reach
the
surface
of
the
ZnO
NWs
forming
the
transducer
of
the
sensor
.
Due
to
their
very
small
size
,
hydrogen
atoms
could
pass
the
BN
layer
,
whereas
the
other
molecules
tested
such
as
C6H6
,
C7H8
,
C2H6O
and
C3H6O
could
not
cross
this
layer
.
This
phenomenon
enabled
to
considerably
improve
the
sensor
selectivity
towards
hydrogen
.
</p>

Similarly
,
Mirzaei
et
al.
prepared
ZnO
layers
by
ALD
to
cap
Fe2O3
nanorods
based
gas
sensors
.
The
sensing
characteristics
of
the
core/shell
nanorods
for
ethanol
were
studied
.
The
increased
response
of
the
Fe2O3
–
ZnO
nanorods
sensor
are
linked
to
the
modulation
of
the
width
of
the
conduction
channel
and
the
potential
barrier
height
at
the
level
of
the
interface
,
as
well
as
to
a
nanomembrane
effect
of
the
ZnO
coating
.
In
fact
,
crystallographic
defects
are
formed
at
the
Fe2O3
–
ZnO
interface
resulting
from
the
lattice
mismatch
between
the
two
nanomaterials
,
providing
preferential
adsorption
sites
and
paths
for
small
molecules
such
as
oxygen
and
ethanol
,
also
contributing
to
the
increased
ethanol
sensing
properties
of
the
core-shell
structured
nanorod
sensor
.
</p>
<p>
Although
this
is
not
typically
desired
and
strongly
depends
on
the
process
used
,
ALD
films
can
present
a
residual
porosity
.
Using
ellipsometric
porosimetry
,
Perrotta
et
al.
extensively
studied
the
residual
nanoporosity
(
0.3
–
2
nm
)
in
alumina
and
SiO2
layers
fabricated
by
(
plasma-assisted
)
ALD
and
its
role
in
controlling
the
oxygen
and
moisture
barrier
performance
.
A
correlation
between
the
nanoporosity
of
the
films
and
their
intrinsic
barrier
properties
has
been
observed
,
regardless
of
the
film
chemistry
.
In
fact
,
pores
presenting
diameters
higher
than
1
nm
with
a
relative
content
above
1
%
have
been
found
responsible
for
the
low
barrier
performances
obtained
.
</p>
<p>
When
taking
into
account
this
residual
nanoporosity
,
thin
films
prepared
by
ALD
can
advantageously
be
employed
as
selective
nanomembranes
to
coat
functional
materials
,
for
different
purposes
such
as
catalysis
and
gas
sensing
.
Thus
,
ALD
nanolayers
can
also
be
used
to
enhance
the
selectivity
using
the
molecular
sieving
effect
.
