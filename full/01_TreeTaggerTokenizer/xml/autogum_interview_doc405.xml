Is
it
always
pine
trees
that
you
see
?

</hi>
Yes
,
pine
trees
and
sky
,
I

.

What
things
in

inspire
you

</hi>
I
feel
drained
thematically
if
I
'm
in
the
city
too
long
.
I
think
that
when
I
'm
in
nature
â€”
for
example
,
I
went
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big%20Sur">
Big
Sur
</ref>
last
year
on
a
road
trip
and
just
looking
up
and
seeing
dark
shadows
of
trees
and
starry
skies
really
gets
me
and
makes
me
feel
happy
.
I
would
sit
right
by
the
sea
,
and
any
time
I
have
been
a
bit
stuck
I
will
go
for
a
long
walk
along
the
ocean
and
it
's
just
really
good
to
see
vast
horizons
,
I
think
,
and
epic
,
huge
,
all-encompassing
visions
of
nature
really
humble
you
and
give
you
a
good
sense
of
perspective
and
the
fact
that
you
are
just
a
small
particle
of
energy
that
is
vibrating
along
with
everything
else
.
That
really
helps
.

:
Are
there
man-made
things
that
inspire
you
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
NK
:
</hi>
Things
that
are
more
cultural
,
like
open
air
cinemas
,
old
Peruvian
flats
and
the
Chelsea
Hotel
.
Funny
old
drag
queen
karaoke
bars

<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
I
photographed
some
of
the
famous
drag
queens
here
in
New
York
.
They
are
just
such
great
creatures
to
photograph
;
they
will
do
just
about
anything
for
the
camera
.
I
photographed
a
famous
drag
queen
named
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss%20Understood">
Miss
Understood
</ref>
who
is
the
emcee
at
a
drag
queen
restaurant
here
named
Lucky
Cheng
's
.
We
were
out
in
front
of
Lucky
Cheng
's
taking
photographs
and
a
bus
was
coming
down
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First%20Avenue%20(Manhattan)">
First
Avenue
</ref>
,
and
I
said
,
&quot;
Go
out
and
stop
that
bus
!
&quot;
and
she
did
!
It
's
an
amazing
shot
.

Oh

My

God

If
you
go
on
her
Wikipedia
article
it
's
there
.
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
NK
:
</hi>
That
's
so
cool
.
I
'm
really
getting
into
that
whole
psychedelic
sixties
and
seventies
<hi rend="italic">
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris%20Is%20Burning%20(film)">
Paris

Jack
Smith
and

</ref>
</hi>
.
Things
like
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Cockettes">
The
Cockettes
</ref>
.
There
seems
to
be
a
bit
of
a
revolution
coming
through
that
kind
of
psychedelic
drag
queen
theater
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
There
are
just
so
few
areas
left
where
there
is
natural
edge
and
art
that
is
not
contrived
.
It
's
taking
a
contrived
thing
like
changing
your
gender
,
but
in
the
backdrop
of
how
that
is
still
so
socially
unacceptable
.
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
NK
:
</hi>
Yeah
,
the
theatrics
and
creativity
that
go
into
that
really
get
me
.
I
'm
thinking
about
<hi rend="italic">
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Fisher%20King%20(film)">
The
Fisher
King
</ref>
</hi>
...
do
you
know
that
drag
queen
in
<hi rend="italic">
The
Fisher
King
</hi>
?
There
's
this
really
bad
and
amazing
drag
queen
guy
in
it
who
is
so
vulnerable
and
sensitive
.
He
sings
these
amazing
songs
but
he
has
this
really
terrible
drug
problem
,
I
think
,
or
maybe
it
's
a
drink
problem
.
It
's
so
bordering
on
the
line
between
fabulous
and
those
people
you
see
who
are
so
in
love
with
the
idea
of
beauty
and
elevation
and
the
glitz
and
the
glamor
of
love
and
beauty
,
but
then
there
's
this
really
dark
,
tragic
side
.
It
's
presented
together
in
this
confusing
and
bewildering
way
,
and
it
always
just
gets
to
me
.
I
find
it
really
intriguing
.
