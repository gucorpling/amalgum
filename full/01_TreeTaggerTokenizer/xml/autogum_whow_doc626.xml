Be
an
Antichrist
</head>
<p>
Some
believe
in
a
God
who
requires
a
blood
sacrifice
for
redemption
of
sins
,
and
a
subset
of
those
also
believe
in
a
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Understand_Messianic_Prophecies">
Messiah
</ref>
,
or
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Accept_Christ_As_Your_Savior">
Christ
</ref>
,
named
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Pray_to_Jesus">
&quot;
Jesus
&quot;
</ref>
or
<ref target="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahshua">
&quot;
Y'shua
&quot;
</ref>
,
who
died
for
our
sins
.
The
Antichrist
eschews
such
ideas
,
and
teaches
that
humans
can
and
should
live
freely
without
such
dependencies
on
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Believe_in_God">
invisible
entities
</ref>
.
You
can
be
an
Antichrist
for
your
own
edification
,
as
well
as
for
your
friends
and
family
.
</p>
<p>
This
particular
concept
of
Antichrist
was
inspired
by
the
fictional
work
<ref target="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Story_of_B">
The
Story
of
B
</ref>
,
by
author
<ref target="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Quinn">

Quinn
</ref>
,
but
is
also
influenced
by
other
ideas
.
It
provides
a
starting
point
for
those
who
disagree
with
deity
based
religions
such
as
Christianity
and
Wicca
,
but
who
wish
to
develop
their
beliefs
independently
of
,
or
who
otherwise
do
not
entirely
agree
with
,
existing
anti-deity
religions
such
as
LaVeyan
Satanism
.

<item>
Liberate
yourself
from
any
gods
,
messiahs
,
prophets
,
and
spiritual
teachers
by
deciding
to
believe
only
what
survives
rigorous
scientific
proof
(
or
predicate
logic
,
for
those
with
a
mathematical
bent
)
,
based
on
axioms
that
are
acceptable
to
you
;
then
question
your
axioms
,
and
repeat
.
It
is
quite
possible
you
will
find
you
believe
in
nothing
,
yet
you
still
have
goals
and
dreams
;
you
can
still
function
in
society
;
you
can
still
appreciate
beauty
in
the
world
around
you
.
This
realization
itself
can
be
liberating
on
many
levels
.

Live
for
your
own
self-interest
,
respecting
that
others
should
,
and
mostly
will
,
do
the
same
.

Pretend
for
a
moment
that
you
are
sinless
;
naked
and
unashamed
;
a
wild
animal
,
alive
and
free
,
in
a
pristine
world
of
endless
possibilities
.
Is
this
thought
pleasing
to
you
?
If
so
,
why
not
accept
it
as
one
of
your
axioms
?

Question
anyone
whose
motivation
appears
contrary
to
his
own
self-interest
,
especially
to
the
point
of
his
own
death
.
If
your
interest
is
in
life
,
then
gods
and
saviors
who
deal
in
death
,
and
glorify
it
,
should
be
highly
suspect
.

Study
pre-Neolithic
cultures
who
had
no
use
for
,
nor
even
concepts
for
,
saviors
or
&quot;
Messiahs
&quot;
,
and
see
if
they
were
philosophically
crippled
by
the
lack
of
such
concepts
.

Study
the
parallels
between
monotheistic
religions
and
the
hierarchical
societies
that
arose
with
the
growth
of
agriculture
.
That
the
perceived
need
for
salvation
grew
along
with
increased
servitude
to
rulers
can
be
illuminating
.

Observe
the
ways
that
the
spark
of
life
is
maintained
by
other
cultures
in
nature
,
without
having
to
have
any
god-prescribed
laws
,
expressed
by
B
as
the
Law
of
Limited
Competition
:
&quot;
Compete
to
the
best
of
your
ability
,
but
do
not
destroy
your
competitors
'
food
;
do
not
deny
them
access
to
food
;
and
do
not
hunt
down
your
competition
.

Teach
others
what
you
are
learning

This
will
liberate
others
and
help
cement
your
own
understanding

<item>
Associate
with
others
who
are
liberating
themselves
from
gods
and
saviors
,
and
read
authors
who
have
found
some
level
of
freedom
:
Ayn
Rand
,
Robert
Heinlein
,
Daniel
Quinn
,
and
Harry
Browne
provide
a
good
start
in
your
education
.
</item>
<item>
Be
familiar
with
<ref target="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism">
atheistic

and
perhaps
more
importantly

Warnings

<list type="unordered">
<item>
You
may
alienate
friends
,
family
,
and
members
of
your
community
by
rejecting
the
dominant
belief
systems
of
you
community
,
examples
:
<list type="unordered">
<item>
In
the
southern
United
States
rejecting
God/Jesus
may
inspire
suspicion
and
hatred
.
In
parts
of
Central
Asia
rejecting
Buddha
,
Tengri
or
Confucius
may
cause
unfavorable
bias
in
matters
of
job
selection
,
promotion
,
or
involvement
in
community
matters
;
but
generally
does
not
result
in
open
hostility
.
In
the
Middle
East
much
will
depend
on
the
specific
country
,
as
well
as
the
social
and
political
climate
at
the
time
;
however
,
organized
torture
and
public
execution
is
possible
.
