major
role

failed
coup
which
led
to
the
deaths
of
more
than
250
people
.
Last

,
Ankara
's
US
embassy
ambassador
John
Bass
said

&quot;
We
have
been
unable

determine
why
it
occurred
or
what
,
if
any
,
evidence
exists
against
the
employee
.

labelled
a

<p>
John
Bass
explained
the
ban
was
not
to
prevent
Turkish
citizens
from
entering
