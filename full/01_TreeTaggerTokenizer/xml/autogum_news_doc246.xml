The

</ref>
,
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Norway">
Norway
</ref>
on
June
7
and
8
to
discuss
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Palestine">
Palestinian
</ref>
economical
situation
in
Oslo
.
Its
mission
is
to
bring
the
key
donors
of
aid
and
relief
together
with
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Israel">
Israeli
</ref>
and
Palestinian
governments
to
address
the
current
state
of
affairs
between
the
two
countries
.
The
AHLC
keeps
track
on
how
donor
countries
interact
with
the
Palestinian
authorities
and
how
the
support
they
provide
is
handled
.

Early
on
the
first
day
,
Norwegian
Foreign
Minister
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonas%20Gahr%20Støre">
Jonas
Gahr
Støre
</ref>
and
Palestinian
Prime
minister
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salam%20Fayyad">
Salam
Fayyad
</ref>
both
expressed
optimism
and
hope
for
the
Palestinian
situation
.
Minister
Støre
underlined
the
importance
of
continuing
aid
,
but
stated
that
he
understood
that
most
countries
still
had
problems
because
of
the
world
economic
crisis
.
As
for
the
unstable
political
situation
in
Palestine
,
Prime
Minister
Fayyad
explained
that
&quot;
the
political
instability
is
also
a
reason
why
we
need
more
aid
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
During
the
second
day
,
a
press
conference
with
Minister
Støre
clarified
the
motives
of
the
donations
saying
,
&quot;
It
’s
is
important
to
stress
that
donors
are
not
doing
this
as
a
humanitarian
project
.
Our
donor
aid
is
a
political
project
aim[ed
]
at
supporting
and
sustaining
the
Palestinian
Authority
,
a
key
institution
in
what
is
supposed
to
become
an
independent
Palestinian
state
.
That
was
the
intention
of
the
Oslo
accords
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Minister
Støre
continued
,
stating
,
&quot;
It
’s
very
important
to
stress
that
without
a
political
horizon
what
we
do
as
donors
becomes
less
meaningful
.
So
the
current
states
of
affairs
where
the
political
horizon
is
unclear
and
where
we
do
n’t
have
political
negotiations
of
the
two
states
as
previous
commitments
indicates
and
obligate
the
party
’s
.
Donors
start
to
change
their
stand
and
other
agendas
get
the
upper
hand
.
So
in
2009
at
this
present
stage
,
donors
have
only
delivered
half
the
amount
they
had
at
this
time
last
year
.
You
can
leave
that
up
to
the
financial
crisis
,
but
at
the
big
donor
conferences
in
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Paris">
Paris
</ref>
December
2007
,
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharm%20el-Sheikh">
Sharm
el-Sheikh
</ref>
February
2009
there
were
pledges
enough
to
carry
this
through
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
On
the
question
if
the
donor
countries
had
offered
to
give
any
immediate
financial
relief
,
Minister
Støre
said
“
This
has
to
be
stressed
,
[
this
]
has
not
been
a
pledging
conference
.
This
has
not
been
a
donor
conference
where
governments
have
been
invited
to
come
and
make
new
pledges
,
as
I
said
if
everybody
lived
by
their
Paris
pledges
in
December
2007
,
which
were
three
year
pledges
,
we
are
exactly
half
way
in
that
,
we
would
have
been
more
or
less
fine
.
But
I
think
we
have
seen
a
forthcoming
approach
by
some
delegations
,
I
will
not
name
them
or
put
a
figure
on
it
but
I
think
it
follows
from
what
the
prime
minister
and
I
have
together
have
expressed
here
that
there
is
an
urgent
need
.
