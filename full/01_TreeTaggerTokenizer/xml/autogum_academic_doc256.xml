Introduction

<p>
In
recent
years
,
surveys
of
personal
travel
behavior
have
been
carried
out
around
the
world
,
and
these
surveys
have
been
used
for
understanding
the
characteristics
of
people
flow
and
for
urban
planning
.
In
addition
,
the
results
of
these
surveys
have
been
compiled
and
disclosed
to
the
public
and
it
is
possible
to
acquire
and
use
them
easily
.
For
example
,
the
“
National
Travel
Survey
”
(
NTS
)
in
the
UK
,
the
“
National
Household
Travel
Survey
”
(
NHTS
)
in
the
US
,
and
the
“
Mobility
in
Germany
”
survey
have
been
conducted
,
and
many
studies
using
the
data
from
these
surveys
have
been
carried
out
.
In
Japan
,
the
Person
Trip
(
PT
)
survey
and
the
Road
Traffic
Census
(
RTC
)
have
been
carried
out
since
after
World
War
II
.
The
first
extensive
PT
survey
was
done
in
1967
in
the
urban
areas
of
Hiroshima
City
,
and
PT
surveys
have
been
conducted
for
more
than
30
years
in
the
urban
areas
of
Japan
.
In
these
surveys
,
many
items
,
including
personal
properties
,
travel
objects
,
travel
times
,
type
of
mobility
,
and
so
on
,
have
been
investigated
to
understand
the
detailed
behavior
of
people
.
Many
studies
have
been
carried
out
using
such
data
.
Sekimoto
et
al.
(
2011
)
calculated
highly
detailed
people
flows
for
every
1
minute
from
PT
survey
data
,
and
some
secondary
studies
have
been
carried
out
based
on
this
flow
data
.
The
Road
Traffic
Census
(
RTC
)
is
a
traffic
survey
which
covers
the
whole
of
Japan
and
includes
investigations
,
such
as
origin-destination
(
OD
)
flows
,
using
questionnaires
about
daily
travel
,
road
state
investigating
surveys
,
the
traffic
census
,
and
travel
speed
investigations
.
Since
the
first
OD
survey
in
1958
,
it
has
been
conducted
approximately
every
5
years
.
Kohira
et
al.
(
2014
)
and
Fujita
et
al.
(
2016
)
examined
traffic
flows
based
on
the
results
of
these
OD
surveys
.
Recently
,
obtaining
various
data
concerning
human
mobility
has
become
easy
due
to
the
rapid
development
of
location
information
techniques
.
For
example
,
phone
call
data
,
smartcard
use
,
and
other
data
like
global
positioning
system
(
GPS
)
log
data
and
social
networking
service
data
have
been
used
for
human
mobility
studies
.
Studies
using
such
data
were
reviewed
by
Yue
et
al.
(
2014
)
.
Studies
concerning
vehicle
counts
from
inductive
loop
sensors
are
also
carried
out
.
However
,
these
surveys
have
been
conducted
mostly
after
World
War
II
,
when
these
information
technologies
became
available
,
and
it
is
impossible
to
acquire
people
and
traffic
flows
for
the
modern
era
.

<p>
Engineering
studies
on
human
movement
have
been
actively
reported
.
However
,
these
movements
have
been
studied
from
the
perspective
of
urban
planning
and
the
development
of
the
transportation
infrastructure
,
and
people
and
traffic
flows
in
the
past
have
not
been
considered
in
these
studies
.
The
studies
,
which
take
into
account
the
relationships
between
urban
structure
and
traffic
flow
,
examined
them
from
the
point
of
view
of
urban
transport
geography
;
however
,
quantitative
studies
about
the
estimation
of
old
traffic
flows
have
also
not
been
addressed
in
this
field
.
There
are
some
quantitative
studies
that
have
been
carried
out
,
including
analyzing
historical
demography
,
the
changes
of
urban
structure
,
and
land
use
from
the
past
to
the
present
age
.
On
the
other
hand
,
the
number
of
studies
on
historical
geography
using
the
geographic
information
system
(
GIS
)
has
risen
in
recent
years
.
However
,
these
studies
did
not
focus
on
human
mobility
.
