Protect
Acrylic
Paint
on
Wood
</head>
<p>
If
not
applied
properly
,
the
paint
on
wood
surfaces
can
begin
to
peel
and
chip
over
time
.
This
is
especially
true
of
wood
items
that
see
frequent
use
,
are
placed
in
direct
sunlight
,
or
were
not
properly
prepared
and
painted
in
the
first
place
.
By
preparing
your
wood
properly
before
you
paint
and
sealing
the
painted
wood
afterwards
,
your
painted
wood
items
will
maintain
their
quality
for
many
years
to
come
.

Preparing
the
Wood
before
You
Paint
</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Use
a
wet
cloth
to
clean
the
wood
.
Leaving
dirt
or
other
particles
on
the
wood
can
keep
it
from
properly
absorbing
the
paint
,
primer
,
and
sealant
.
Clean
the
wood
before
applying
sealant
by
wiping
it
down
with
a
damp
cloth
.

You
can
use
a
tack
cloth
to
pick
up
any
remaining
dirt
.
Tack
cloths
are
gauze-like
materials
treated
with
a
sticky
substance
and
can
be
purchased
at
any
home
improvement
store
.

Apply
2
coats
of
sealant
onto
the
raw
wood
.
Brush
a
thin
coat
of
glossy
acrylic
medium
sealant
onto
the
wood
using
a
dampened
sponge
or
paintbrush
.
Allow
the
sealant
to
dry
,
and
then
apply
another
coat
to
the
wood
.
Lightly
sand
the
wood
after
the
second
coat
of
sealant
has
dried
to
remove
any
excess
sealant
and
then
wipe
it
down
again
with
a
wet
cloth
and
tack
cloth
.

Use
a
sponge
for
wood
surfaces
with
grooves
and
curves
and
a
paintbrush
for
flat
surfaces
.

The
sandpaper
should
be
around
a
220
grit
.

<item>
Apply
a
coat
of
primer
to
help
the
paint
adhere
to
the
wood
.
Using
primer
provides
a
surface
to
which
paint
can
adhere
by
allowing
the
wooden
surface
to
regain
surface
tooth
(
ridges
and
valleys
)
.

An
acrylic
gesso
is
probably
your
best
option
for
using
primers
.
</item>
<item>
You
will
only
need
to
apply
one
coat
of
a
high
quality
primer
,
lower
quality
ones
might
require
a
second
coat
.

Allow
the
wood
to
dry
and
cure
.
In
order
to
maximize
paint
adhesion
,
you
’ll
need
to
allow
the
primer
time
to
dry
.
This
could
take
several
hours
.
Once
the
primer
is
dry
to
the
touch
,
you
can
start
applying
your
paint
.

Protecting
the
Paint
with
a
Clear
Sealant
</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Choose
a
wax-based
or
polycrylic
sealant
.
Wax-based
sealants
give
wooden
surfaces
more
of
a
flat
finish
,
while
polycrylic
ones
provide
a
glossier
one
.
Water-based
polycrylic
sealants
are
the
most
versatile
.

are
used
more
for
wax-based
sealants
,
sponges
for
polycrylic
sealants
applied

,
and
paintbrushes
for

Apply
a
second
coat
of
sealant
.
After
the

coat
of
sealant
has
dried
to
the
touch
,
repeat
the
process
of
applying
sealant
with
a
sponge
,
cloth
or
paintbrush

Doing
so
will
ensure
that
the
painted
wood
is
fully
protected

Allow
the
sealant
to
cure
for
2-3
weeks
.
Just
because
the
surface
of
the
wood
is
dry
to
the
touch
does
n’t
mean
that
it
is
fully
dry
.
Allow
the
sealant
to
dry
and
cure
for
2-3
weeks
after
application
.
Do
not
put
anything
on
the
surface
,
because
it
can
cause
damage
or
imperfections
.

should
be
allowed
to
sit
for
a
longer
period
of
time
