Diet
interventions
are
well-established
strategies
to
reduce
body
weight
and
improve
glucose
metabolism
,
however
no
evidence
exists
about
the
effects
of
periodic
fasting
on
NAFLD
.
This
study
is
the
first
to
show
the
beneficial
effects
of
periodic
fasting
on
fatty
liver
.
The
results
of
our
study
supported
the
hypothesis
that
FLI
,
a
surrogate
parameter
of
fatty
liver
,
significantly
decreases
in
individuals
with
and
without
T2DM
after
a
fasting
intervention
of
at
least
6
days
.
The
prospective
study
design
according
to
a
standardized
protocol
with
a
well-established
fasting
technique
and
a
close
clinical
monitoring
was
a
strength
of
this
study
.
</p>
<p>
Weight
reduction
and
improvement
of
fatty
liver
indicators
are
known
to
be
interrelated
.
Our
results
indicate
that
even
a
modest
reduction
of
BMI
improved
surrogate
markers
of
fatty
liver
.
Indeed
,
in
nearly
half
of
the
subjects
in
the
highest
risk
category
(
FLI
&gt;
60
)
,
a
BMI
reduction
of
less
than
5
%
was
sufficient
to
induce
a
shift
to
a
lower
risk
category
.
</p>
<p>
In
most
patients
,
NAFLD
is
associated
with
features
of
metabolic
syndrome
,
central
obesity
,
elevated
blood
pressure
,
dyslipidemia
,
hyperglycemia
,
and
insulin
resistance
.
Although
these
pathologies
can
be
addressed
by
lifestyle
interventions
,
in
daily
life
the
adherence
to
the
necessary
lifestyle
changes
is
poor
,
resulting
in
suboptimal
outcomes
.
In
contrast
,
in
pragmatic
programs
there
is
a
greater
benefit
in
a
more
substantial
weight
loss
,
particularly
at
early
stages
of
the
intervention
period
.
Hence
,
periodic
fasting
can
significantly
reduce
weight
,
and
this
effect
can
be
maintained
over
time
.
</p>
<p>
There
are
several
concerns
about
the
adverse
effects
of
fasting
.
Several
non-fatal
(
e.
g.
,
headache
)
and
rarely
fatal
(
e.
g.
,
ventricular
arrhythmia
)
events
have
been
reported
.
In
contrast
,
no
severe
adverse
events
were
found
in
a
cohort
of
1422
subjects
treated
with
a
periodic
fasting
lasting
4
–
21
days
,
.
Michalsen
et
al.
evaluated
the
acceptance
,
safety
,
effects
on
health-related
outcomes
,
and
lifestyle
adherence
of
fasting
therapy
in
different
chronic
internal
diseases
.
They
found
no
serious
adverse
events
throughout
their
study
.
Our
study
supports
the
hypothesis
that
fasting
therapy
provided
in
a
controlled
clinical
setting
is
a
safe
intervention
.
</p>
<p>
There
is
a
large
body
of
evidence
on
the
beneficial
effects
of
carbohydrate
restriction
and
hypocaloric
diets
on
NAFLD
.
It
has
also
been
shown
that-at
equal
levels
of
weight
reduction-a
carbohydrate-restricted
diet
leads
to
a
significantly
greater
intrahepatic
triglyceride
reduction
than
low-calorie
diet
alone
.
The
metabolic
advantage
of
carbohydrate
restriction
appears
to
be
related
to
a
more
pronounced
lipid
oxidation
and
enhanced
ketogenesis
.
In
recent
years
,
intermittent
and
periodic
fasting
has
gained
popularity
as
an
alternative
to
continuous
caloric
restriction
.
In
addition
to
the
weight
loss
effects
,
periodic
fasting
is
associated
with
several
metabolic
benefits
,
including
the
improvement
of
lipid
profiles
.
This
has
been
also
shown
for
intermittent
fasting
,
e.
g.
,
Ramadan
fasting
.
The
key
mechanism
responsible
for
many
of
these
beneficial
effects
is
the
metabolic
switch
from
the
utilization
of
glycogenolysis-derived
glucose
to
fatty
acids
and
fatty
acid-derived
ketones
,
i.
e.
,
a
fundamental
switch
from
lipid
synthesis
and
fat
storage
to
mobilization
of
fat
in
the
form
of
free
fatty
acids
and
fatty
acid-derived
ketones
.
This
occurs
between
12
and
36
hours
after
cessation
of
food
consumption
.
Hyperinsulinemia
suppresses
ketogenesis
and
therefore
prolongs
the
time
to
switch
in
cases
of
obesity
,
insulin
resistance
,
and
T2DM
.
Although
there
is
some
evidence
of
impaired
ketogenesis
during
the
progression
of
liver
disease
to
steatohepatitis
,
therapies
that
increase
hepatic
ketogenesis
are
expected
nonetheless
to
ameliorate
NAFLD
.
</p>
<p>
Our
data
provided
first
evidence
that
periodic
fasting
leads
to
a
clearance
of
liver
fat
:
fasting
significantly
reduced
FLI
and
increased
the
proportion
of
patients
without
NAFLD
(
FLI
&lt;
30
units
;
<figure>
Figure
2
</figure>
)
.
The
effects
of
fasting
therapy
were
stronger
in
males
and
in
individuals
with
higher
baseline
FLI
,
higher
GOT
,
and
higher
cholesterol
levels
.
Each
additional
fasting
day
further
decreased
the
FLI
.
The
binary
logistic
regression
showed
that
every
day
of
fasting
increase
by
40
%
the
chance
to
improve
a
manifest
fatty
liver
(
FLI
&gt;
60
)
and
switch
to
a
lower
category
of
risk
.
This
implies
that
the
duration
of
fasting
must
be
sufficient
to
influence
fatty
liver
positively
.
This
should
be
taken
into
account
when
periodic
fasting
is
considered
as
treatment
for
NAFLD
.
</p>
<p>
As
already
mentioned
,
insulin
resistance
,
T2DM
,
and
the
development
of
NAFLD
are
closely
associated
conditions
.
Taylor
et
al.
have
shown
that
remission
of
T2DM
requires
a
decrease
of
liver
fat
.
Patients
with
T2DM
tend
to
have
higher
FLI
scores
,
but
in
this
study
,
we
could
demonstrate
that
the
fasting
intervention
was
equally
effective
in
T2DM
patients
and
in
non-diabetic
subjects
in
terms
of
FLI
,
although
the
improvement
of
other
parameters
(
e.
g.
,
HDL
,
LDL
,
and
AP
)
was
not
as
complete
.
These
results
are
in
line
with
a
previous
study
on
periodic
fasting
in
T2DM
.
</p>
<p>
Liver
enzymes
,
insulin
resistance
,
and
cholesterol
levels
are
related
in
NAFLD
.
Our
results
supported
a
correlation
between
changes
in
FLI
and
changes
in
liver
enzymes
(
GGT
,
and
GOT
)
and
lipid
parameters
(
TG
)
after
fasting
intervention
,
although
this
was
limited
to
subjects
without
T2DM
.
