Q
:
</hi>
Who
was
everyone
's
favorite
competitor
,
at
any
point
in
the
competition
?

A
:
</hi>
We
really
liked
all
the
talent
who
made
it
to
the
finals
.
They
were
all
good
,
decent
people
,
who
had
worked
very
hard
to
get
where
they
were
at
that
point
in
their
lives
.
We
especially
enjoyed
all
the
other
young
people
.
Our
children
travelled
to
New
York
City
with
the
cloggers
(
All
That
)
for
<hi rend="italic">
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Today%20Show">
The
Today
Show
</ref>
</hi>
and
had
fun
getting
to
know
them
better
.
We
liked
the
Millers
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor%20Ware">
Taylor
</ref>
,
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bianca%20Ryan">

</ref>
,
and
became
good
friends
with
David
and
Dania
.
They
were
very
sympathetic
when
Piers
first
said
to
&quot;
dump
your
mum
,
dad
,
and
little
brother
.
&quot;
I
think
they
were
shocked
when
then
Piers
&quot;
attacked
&quot;
them
.
We
decided
that
Piers
went
after
the
family
acts
:
the
Millers
,
Celtic
Spring
,
and
David
and
Dania
(
who
were
a
married
couple
.
)
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Q
:
</hi>
Who
was
your
favourite
judge
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
A
:
</hi>
We
actually
liked
all
three
judges
.
Until
we
came
before
Piers
in
the
semi-finals
,
we
thought
his
judging
was
good
and
we
mostly
agreed
with
him
.
We
were
shocked
what
he
said
to
us
,
but
happy
that
he
could
not
find
something
specific
to
criticise
.
He
never
said
why
we
should
&quot;
dump
&quot;
the
parents
and
the
little
brother
.
After
we
had
won
the
semi-finals
,
he
said
&quot;
You
are
brilliant
!
&quot;
We
also
very
much
liked
David
.
During
the
all
the
time
of
filming
,
we
got
to
know
him
and
we
realized
that
he
is
different
in
real
life
than
the
show
depicted
him
.
We
were
really
touched
and
happy
,
and
felt
like
we
had
won
the
million
dollars
,
when
at
the
end
of
the
show
,
he
presented
us
with
a
photo
of
himself
that
said
:
To
Celtic
Spring
!
Your
family
values
,
your
talent
,
your
dedication
is
what
me
and
all
of
America
will
remember
.
See
you
on
the
big
stage
soon
!
&quot;
We
liked
Brandy
because
by
the
finals
we
had
her
appreciating
what
we
do
.
I
think
initially
our
Celtic
music
and
dance
was
not
a
genre
she
was
familiar
with
.
I
think
she
loved
our
rendition
of

&quot;
!

Q
:
</hi>
Celtic
Spring
has
performed
across
both
North
America
and
Europe
.
Where
have
audiences
been
the
most
responsive
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
A
:
</hi>
Wherever
we
have
performed
,
our
audiences
have
loved
Celtic
Spring
.
Music
and
dance
are
a
universal
language
and
speak
to
everyone
.
One
of
our
treasured
memories
of
performing
was
when
we
performed
in
an
Italian
village
for
a
really
enthusiastic
crowd
with
whom
we
could
not
speak
.
But
they
loved
our
show
and
afterwards
showered
us
with
their
treasures
:
a
gold
painted
horseshoe
,
poems
,
books
,
etc
...
We
were
so
grateful
to
be
able
to
bring
them
joy
through
our
music
and
dance
.
We
also
had
great
fun
performing
at
an
all
boys
boarding
school
in
England
.
Afterwards
they
showed
us
all
around
their
school
,
including
the
haunted
corridors
(
if
felt
like
something
our
of
<hi rend="italic">
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry%20Potter">
Harry
Potter
</ref>
</hi>
)
and
then
shared
their
music
with
us
:
a
jazz
band
and
madrigals
sung
at
dawn
in
the
tower
in
the
quad
to
welcome
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May%20Day">
May
Day
</ref>
.
When
we
perform
we
think
we
are
giving
something
special
to
our
audiences
but
we
are
deeply
moved
by
what
we
get
back
:
happy
faces
,
stories
,
friendships
...
