Respond
when
Someone
Wishes
You
Happy
Birthday
</head>
<p>
It
's
your
birthday
!
It
's
great
to
see
that
your
friends
care
about
you
,
but
what
's
an
appropriate
way
to
respond
?
In
person
,
just
say
&quot;
Thank
you
!
&quot;
If
the
well-wishes
are
sent
over
social
media
or
physical
mail
,
the
etiquette
can
be
a
little
different
,
but
it
's
not
difficult
to
learn
.

Post
one
thank
you
message
.
If
you
use
social
media
frequently
,
you
might
get
birthday
wishes
from
acquaintances
,
old
friends
,
and
people
you
do
n't
even
remember
.
Even
your
friends
are
probably
not
waiting
anxiously
to
receive
a
personalized
response
.
One
message
to
your
wall
thanking
everyone
for
the
birthday
wishes
is
common
practice
,
and
unlikely
to
offend
anyone
.
Here
are
some
example
responses
:

Post
a

(

.
If
you
want
to
thank
people
in
a
more
visible
way
,
take
a
photo
of
your
smiling
face
in
a
party
hat
,
a
birthday
cake
,
or
another
birthday
symbol
.
Post
it
along
with
a
comment
thanking
everyone
for
their
birthday
wishes
.
This
shows
that
you
put
a
little
effort
into
making
your
thanks
special
,
but
is
still
fairly
simple
to
do
.

Older
relatives

&quot;
low

do

are
all

You

friends
you
have

Respond

As
mentioned
above
,
there
is
no
need
to
respond
to
every
person
individually
.
However
,
if
you
'd
like
to
take
the
extra
time
,
you
could
&quot;
Like
&quot;
each
Facebook
post
,
or
reply
to
any
social
media
post
with
a
short
comment
such
as
&quot;
Thanks
for
thinking
of
me
!
&quot;
or
&quot;
Thanks
,
I
appreciate
it
!

Thank
someone

When
possible
,
thank
someone
in
person
after
he
gives
you
a
birthday
present
,
or
puts
extra
effort
into
a
birthday
wish

Give
each

group

your

attention

make
eye

delivering
your
thanks

Here

on
how
to
do
it

Send
a
card
,
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Respond_to_a_Thank_You_Email">
email
</ref>
or
letter
.
Relatives
and
friends
older
than
yourself
tend
to
appreciate
receiving
a
thank
you
card
in
the
mail
.
Always
add
a
handwritten
message
.
A
short
thank
you
message
is
fine
,
but
adding
a
heartfelt
message
is
recommended
for
people
who
have
been
unusually
generous
or
kind
.

bring

do
anything
else

upset
him

If

try

taking

time
