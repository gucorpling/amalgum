Court
</p>
<p>
Upon
his
escape
from
the
nation
Lai
became
China
's
most-wanted
fugitive
.
Twelve
years
of
negotiations
ended
with
a
Chinese
promise
Lai
would
be
spared
the
death
penalty
,
and
Canada
extradited
him
last
year
.
Numerous
lower-ranking
members
of
Lai
's
empire
have
already
been
given
life
imprisonment
or
death
sentences
.
With
execution
off
the
table
,
the
court
gave
Lai
the
highest
sentence
possible
:
in
addition
to
the
life
term
,
he
received
fifteen
years
for
bribery
and
had
all
his
possessions
confiscated
.
</p>
<p>
The
court
justified
the
&quot;
double
sentence
&quot;
on
the
grounds
&quot;
the
sums
involved
are
unusually
large
,
and
the
details
are
extraordinarily
serious
&quot;
.
&quot;
The
crimes
involve
massive
sums
and
particularly
serious
circumstances
,
&quot;
court
officials
told
<hi rend="italic">
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinhua">
Xinhua
</ref>
</hi>
.
Lai
had
denied
corruption
at
his
trial
,
although
he
accepted
exploiting
loopholes
to
avoid
import
duty
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
do
n't
have
a
good
family
background
,
&quot;
Lai
said
previously
in
a
press
interview
.
&quot;
I
have
to
do
things
step
by
step
by
myself
.
That
's
how
people
came
to
respect
me
.
I
never
fussed
about
big
money
.
&quot;
Lai
was
born
as
one
of
eight
siblings
in
the
midst
of
famine
.
