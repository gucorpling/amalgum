Do
you
think
it
’s
hurt
the
peace
process
,
the
Lebanese
War
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
SP
</hi>
:
I
do
n’t
think
so
.
You
know
what
is
promoting
the
peace
prospect
more
than
losing
it
?
That
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Iranian%20sentiment">
no
one
in
the
Middle
East
</ref>
wants
to
fall
under
the
spell
of
Iran
.
Iran
today
is
a
country
with
an
appetite
.
An
imperial
appetite
.
They
want
an
Iranian
hegemony
in
the
Middle
East
in
the
name
of
god
and
enriched
uranium
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran-Arab%20relations">
And
nobody
wants
it
</ref>
.
So
they
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annapolis%20Conference">
attended
Annapolis
</ref>
for
the
same
reason
.
So
everything
,
you
know
,
it
’s
not
a
one-sided
situation
.
It
’s
very
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectic">
dialectical
</ref>
,
including
Iran
.
So
they
think
they
won
.
What
did
they
win
?
They
are
less
accused
;
they
are
not
less
watched
,
not
less
disliked
and
not
less
suspected
.

Do
you
think
there
is
still
a
strong
peace
movement
in
Israel
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
SP
</hi>
:
I
think
the
situation
is
a
peace
movement
because
the
more
that
the
Arabs
are
learning
,
the
more
they
are
becoming
peaceful
.
Look
,
we
have
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab%20citizens%20of%20Israel">
in
Israel
50,000
Arab
citizens
</ref>
who
are
academicians
.
Ask
where
are
they
.
Some
of
them
are
teachers
who
will
remain
in
the
vicinity
of
their
university
.
Most
of
them
are
doctors
.
You
wo
n’t
find
in
Israel
today
a
hospital
without
Arab
doctors
and
Arab
nurses
.
Now
an
Israeli
that
goes
to
the
hospital
,
maybe
he
would
be
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Arabism#Israel">
reluctant
to
employ
an
Arab
</ref>
at
his
factory
but
he
does
n’t
hesitate
to
come
to
the
hospital
,
lie
on
the
bed
and
here
comes
an
Arab
doctor
with
a
knife
in
his
hand
and
operates
on
him
.
And
he
says
thank
you
.
So
if
you
have
healthy
relations
in
hospitals
,
maybe
it
’s
a
cure
for
the
others
.
The
more
people
who
become
professional
and
modern
from
both
sides
,
this
is
the
peace
movement
!
The
peace
movement
is
not
an
attempt
to
write
more
songs
about
peace
.
We
have
enough
songs
.
What
we
need
is
the
development
and
we
have
to
be
passionate
.

How
have
you
seen
America
’s
role
in
the
peace
process
change
between
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign%20policy%20of%20the%20Clinton%20Administration">
Clinton
</ref>
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign%20policy%20of%20the%20George%20W.%20Bush%20administration">

?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
SP
</hi>
:
Look
at
America
after
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United%20States%20general%20elections,%202006">
the
elections
</ref>
.
In
my
journal
,
the
two
parties
will
come
together
and
try
to
work
up
a
bipartisan
policy
.
You
know
somebody
said
that
the
difference
between
the
Republicans
and
Democrats
is
the
Democrats
are
reformers
and
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S.%20Republican%20Party">
Republicans
</ref>
are
maintainers
.
So
they
put
in
a
little
bit
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S.%20Democratic%20Party">
Democrats
</ref>
to
reform
,
then
they
put
in
the
Republican
to
maintain
.
Then
they
change
,
but
they
keep
basic
on
foreign
affairs
;
America
is
revolutionary
in
technology
,
in
economy
,
but
very
balanced
in
foreign
policy
and
even
when
the
United
States
commits
mistakes
in
her
foreign
policy
,
a
foreign
policy
without
America
would
be
the
greatest
mistake
of
our
generation
.
