Principles
of
Resolver-to-Digital
Conversion
</head>
<p>
In
this
section
we
first
introduce
the
basic
principle
of
the
resolver
and
its
subsequent
demodulation
methods
,
and
then
several
previous
RDC
solutions
are
presented
and
evaluated
for
their
advantages
and
drawbacks
.

Principle
of
Resolver
</head>
<p>
A
resolver
is
a
position
sensor
comprising
of
a
stator
and
a
rotor
,
which
is
connected
to
the
shaft
of
the
motor
for
detecting
its
angular
position
.
The
stator
portion
houses
three
windings
,
namely
one
excitation
winding
and
two
output
windings
(
sine
and
cosine
windings
)
,
of
which
the
voltage
output
amplitudes
are
orthogonally
symmetric
,
specifically
,
sinusoidally
and
cosinusoidally
related
to
the
shaft
angle
.
The
excitation
winding
is
responsible
for
inducing
voltage
in
the
rotator
windings
through
electromagnetic
induction
.
With
the
shaft
angle
changing
,
amplitudes
of
the
two-phase
voltages
from
sine
and
cosine
output
windings
are
measured
and
employed
to
determine
relative
position
between
the
stator
and
rotor
.
</p>
<p>
<figure>
Figure

</figure>
illustrates
the
configuration
of
a
resolver
and
subsequent
software-based
RDC
scheme
,
which
serves
as
an
integrated
position
estimation
system
.
The
excitation
windings
are
usually
applied
with
a
sinusoidal
reference
voltage
of
constant
amplitude
and
high
frequency
,
expressed
as
:
(

)
where
<hi rend="italic">
A
</hi>
is
the
amplitude
of
the
reference
voltage
and
<hi rend="italic">
ω
</hi>
<hi rend="italic">
ref
</hi>
is
the
angular
frequency
.
</p>
<p>
When
the
rotor
rotates
,
the
output
windings
will
generate
amplitude-modulated
pair
signals
as
:
(
2
)
where
<hi rend="italic">
K
</hi>
is
the
effective
transformation
ratio
of
the
resolver
and
<hi rend="italic">
θ
</hi>
represents
the
angular
position
of
the
rotor
with
respect
to
the
stator
winding
.
These
two
modulated
signals
<hi rend="italic">
u
</hi>
1(
<hi rend="italic">
θ
</hi>
,
<hi rend="italic">
t
</hi>
)
and
<hi rend="italic">
u
</hi>
2(
<hi rend="italic">
θ
</hi>
,
<hi rend="italic">
t
</hi>
)
have
the
form
of
sinusoidal
and
cosinusoidal
envelopes
.
Then
,
envelope
detection
is
necessary
to
obtain
the
needed
signal
.
In
practice
,
there
are
always
disturbances
from
imperfect
characteristics
,
namely
the
amplitude
imbalances
,
DC
offsets
and
imperfect
quadrature
,
which
arise
from
eccentric
rotor
,
unequal
winding
and
non-orthogonal
symmetry
of
the
windings
.
Hence
,
the
signal
after
envelope
detection
can
be
expressed
in
the
form
:
(
3
)
where
and
are
the
offsets
,
and
represents
the
imperfect
quadrature
.
Preprocessing
methods
(
noise
reduction
,
calibration
and
correction
)
are
carried
out
to
result
in
:
(
4
)
where
<hi rend="italic">
u
</hi>
sin
and
<hi rend="italic">
u
</hi>
cos
are
two
ortho-symmetric
signals
,
whose
trigonometric
features
aid
in
subsequent
demodulation
.
</p>
<p>
Finally
,
the
angular
position
<hi rend="italic">
θ
</hi>
and
velocity
are
calculated
through
suitable
demodulation
algorithms
(
for
example
,
phase-locked
loop
and
arctangent
algorithms
)
to
obtain
the
estimation
speed
and
position
.
</p>
<p>
As
is
demonstrated
in
the
resolver
’s
principle
,
the
orthogonal
symmetry
of
alignment
of
two
output
windings
results
in
the
orthogonal
symmetry
of
both
envelope
signals
and
post-envelope-detection
signals
.

Arctangent
Method
</head>
<p>
A
straightforward
method
is
to
obtain
the
angular
position
<hi rend="italic">
θ
</hi>
is
through
arctangent
operation
of
<hi rend="italic">
u
</hi>
sin
and
<hi rend="italic">
u
</hi>
cos
,
given
by
:
(

)
</p>
<p>
As
is
clearly
indicated
by
Equation
(
5
)
,
the
arctangent
method
suffers
from
its
highly
nonlinear
arctangent
operation
and
is
limited
to
application
on
low-speed
estimation
.
Also
,
with
a
nonlinear
feature
,
there
needs
to
be
a
look-up
table
for
the
arctangent
calculation
,
which
increases
the
software
loads
.

Conventional
PLL-Based
ATO
</head>
<p>
As
shown
in
<figure>
Figure
2
</figure>
,
the
conventional
ATO
method
tracks
angular
position
based
on
PLL
technique
.

the
actual
form
of
the
ATO
,
where
<hi rend="italic">
kI
</hi>
and
<hi rend="italic">
kP
</hi>
are
the
coefficients
for
the
integral
and
proportional
terms
,
respectively
,
and
<figure>
Figure

</figure>
b
shows
the
linearized
structure
.
</p>
<p>
The
estimated
angular
position
is
transformed
through
trigonometric
function
and
multiplied
by
the
demodulated
signals
.
By
utilizing
the
feature
of
orthogonal
symmetry
in
the
resolver
signals
in
Equation
(
4
)
,
the
phase
error
can
be
derived
from
the
phase
detector
(
PD
)
,
expressed
as
:
(

)
</p>
<p>
When
the
ATO
functions
properly
,
the
position
error
is
small
enough
,
that
is
,
,
so
the
input
error
signal
can
be
expressed
as
.
Therefore
,
linearization
of
the
ATO
can
be
implemented
,
as
shown
in
<figure>
Figure

</figure>
b
,
and
the
closed
loop
transfer
function
is
derived
as
:
(

)
</p>
<p>
The
conventional
ATO
is
a
representative
closed-loop
estimation
system
which
overcomes
noise
and
track
the
input
signal
with
a
relatively
high
precision
.
The
linearized
structure
of
the
ATO
belongs
to
a
type-II
system
.
</p>
<head>
2.2.3
.
Compensated
Type-III
ATO
</head>
<p>
In
,
an
acceleration-compensated
ATO
was
proposed
by
employing
the
estimated
speed
to
generate
a
compensation
module
for
the
position
error
,
comprising
a
differentiator
and
a
first-order
low-pass
filter
,
which
finally
makes
this
ATO
a
type-III
system
.
The
actual
scheme
of
this
method
is
shown
in
<figure>
Figure
3
</figure>
and
a
linearized
structure
of
this
ATO
is
analogous
to
<figure>
Figure
2
</figure>
b.
Compared
with
<figure>
Figure
2
</figure>
,
there
is
a
third
parameter
<hi rend="italic">
T
</hi>
representing
the
time
constant
of
the
low-pass
filter
.
</p>
<p>
The
linearized
closed-loop
transfer
function
can
be
denoted
as
:
(
8
)
</p>
<p>
This
compensated
type-III
ATO
has
the
basic
structure
inherited
from
the
conventional
ATO
but
resolves
the
steady-error
of
estimating
constant
acceleration
signal
(
<hi rend="italic">
θ
</hi>
=
<hi rend="italic">
α
</hi>
<hi rend="italic">
t
</hi>
2
)
with
a
time-saving
and
simple
technique
of
adding
a
compensation
module
,
which
achieves
a
higher
precision
in
tracking
the
position
of
an
accelerating
motor
.
However
,
this
method
fails
to
eliminate
steady-state
error
resulting
from
a
first-
or
higher-order
acceleration
signal
.
