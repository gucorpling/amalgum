CHAPTER
XVII
</head>
<p>
The
evening
of
the
second
day
had
already
come
,
when
Ar-hap
arrived
home
after
weekending
amongst
a
tribe
of
rebellious
subjects
.
But
any
imposing
State
entry
which
might
have
been
intended
was
rendered
impossible
by
the
heat
and
the
threat
of
that
baleful
world
in
the
western
sky
.
</p>
<p>
It
was
a
lurid
but
disordered
spectacle
which
I
witnessed
from
my
room
in
the
gate-house
just
after
nightfall
.
The
returning
army
had
apparently
fallen
away
exhausted
on
its
march
through
the
town
;
only
some
three
hundred
of
the
bodyguard
straggled
up
the
hill
,
limp
and
sweating
,
behind
a
group
of
pennons
,
in
the
midst
of
which
rode
a
horseman
whose
commanding
presence
and
splendid
war
harness
impressed
me
,
though
I
could
not
make
out
his
features
;
a
wild
,
impressionist
scene
of
black
outlines
,
tossing
headgear
,
and
spears
glittering
and
vanishing
in
front
of
the
red
glare
in
the
sky
,
but
nothing
more
.
Even
the
dry
throats
of
the
suitors
in
the
courtyard
hardly
mustered
a
husky
cry
of
welcome
as
the
cavalcade
trooped
into
the
enclosure
,
and
then
the
shadows
enfolded
them
up
in
silence
,
and
,
too
hot
and
listless
to
care
much
what
the
morrow
brought
forth
,
I
threw
myself
on
the
bare
floor
,
tossing
and
turning
in
a
vain
endeavour
to
sleep
until
dawn
came
once
more
.
</p>
<p>
A
thin
mist
which
fell
with
daybreak
drew
a
veil
over
the
horrible
glare
in
the
west
for
an
hour
or
two
,
and
taking
advantage
of
the
slight
alleviation
of
heat
,
I
rose
and
went
into
the
gardens
to
enjoy
a
dip
in
a
pool
,
making
,
with
its
surrounding
jungle
of
flowers
,
one
of
the
pleasantest
things
about
the
wood-king
's
forest
citadel
.
The
very
earth
seemed
scorched
and
baking
underfoot
--
and
the
pool
was
gone
!
It
had
run
as
dry
as
a
limekiln
;
nothing
remained
of
the
pretty
fall
which
had
fed
it
but
a
miserable
trickle
of
drops
from
the
cascade
above
.
Down
beyond
the
town
shone
a
gleam
of
water
where
the
bitter
canal
steamed
and
simmered
in
the
first
grey
of
the
morning
,
but
up
here
six
months
of
scorching
drought
could
not
have
worked
more
havoc
.
The
very
leaves
were
dropping
from
the
trees
,
and
the
luxuriant
growths
of
the
day
before
looked
as
though
a
simoon
had
played
upon
them
.
</p>
<p>
I
staggered
back
in
disgust
,
and
found
some
show
of
official
activity
about
the
palace
.
It
was
the
king
's
custom
,
it
appeared
,
to
hear
petitions
and
redress
wrongs
as
soon
after
his
return
as
possible
,
but
today
the
ceremony
was
to
be
cut
short
as
his
majesty
was
going
out
with
all
his
court
to
a
neighbouring
mountain
to
&quot;
pray
away
the
comet
,
&quot;
which
by
this
time
was
causing
dire
alarm
all
through
the
city
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Heaven
's
own
particular
blessing
on
his
prayers
,
my
friend
,
&quot;
I
said
to
the
man
who
told
me
this
.
&quot;
Unless
his
majesty
's
orisons
are
fruitful
,
we
shall
all
be
cooked
like
baked
potatoes
before
nightfall
,
and
though
I
have
faced
many
kinds
of
death
,
that
is
not
the
one
I
would
choose
by
preference
.
Is
there
a
chance
of
myself
being
heard
at
the
throne
?
Your
peculiar
climate
tempts
me
to
hurry
up
with
my
business
and
begone
if
I
may
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Not
only
may
you
be
heard
,
sir
,
but
you
are
summoned
.
The
king
has
heard
of
you
somehow
,
and
sent
me
to
find
and
bring
you
into
his
presence
at
once
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
So
be
it
,
&quot;
I
said
,
too
hot
to
care
what
happened
.
&quot;
I
have
no
levee
dress
with
me
.
I
lost
my
luggage
check
some
time
ago
,
but
if
you
will
wait
outside
I
will
be
with
you
in
a
moment
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Hastily
tidying
myself
up
,
and
giving
my
hair
a
comb
,
as
though
just
off
to
see
Mr.
Secretary
for
the
Navy
,
or
on
the
way
to
get
a
senator
to
push
a
new
patent
medicine
for
me
,
I
rejoined
my
guide
outside
,
and
together
we
crossed
the
wide
courtyard
,
entered
the
great
log-built
portals
of
Ar-hap
's
house
,
and
immediately
afterwards
found
ourselves
in
a
vast
hall
dimly
lit
by
rays
coming
in
through
square
spaces
under
the
eaves
,
and
crowded
on
both
sides
with
guards
,
courtiers
,
and
supplicants
.
The
heat
was
tremendous
,
the
odour
of
Thither
men
and
the
ill-dressed
hides
they
wore
almost
overpowering
.
Yet
little
I
recked
for
either
,
for
there
at
the
top
of
the
room
,
seated
on
a
dais
made
of
rough-hewn
wood
inlet
with
gold
and
covered
with
splendid
furs
,
was
Ar-hap
himself
.
</p>
<p>
A
fine
fellow
,
swarthy
,
huge
,
and
hairy
,
at
any
other
time
or
place
I
could
have
given
him
due
admiration
as
an
admirable
example
of
the
savage
on
the
borderland
of
grace
and
culture
,
but
now
I
only
glanced
at
him
,
and
then
to
where
at
his
side
a
girl
was
crouching
,
a
gem
of
human
loveliness
against
that
dusky
setting
.
It
was
Heru
,
my
ravished
princess
,
and
,
still
clad
in
her
diaphanous
Hither
robes
,
her
face
white
with
anxiety
,
her
eyes
bright
as
stars
,
the
embodiment
of
helpless
,
flowery
beauty
,
my
heart
turned
over
at
sight
of
her
.
</p>
<p>
Poor
girl
!
When
she
saw
me
stride
into
the
hall
she
rose
swiftly
from
Ar-hap
's
side
,
clasped
her
pretty
hands
,
and
giving
a
cry
of
joy
would
have
rushed
towards
me
,
but
the
king
laid
a
mighty
paw
upon
her
,
under
which
she
subsided
with
a
shiver
as
though
the
touch
had
blanched
all
the
life
within
.
