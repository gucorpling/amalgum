CHAPTER
IX
</head>
<p>
Realising
that
she
was
rapidly
losing
ground
by
exercising
her
advantage
over
Alfred
in
the
matter
of
quick
retort
,
Zoie
,
with
her
customary
cunning
,
veered
round
to
a
more
conciliatory
tone
.
“
Well
,
”
she
cooed
,
“
suppose
I
DID
eat
lunch
with
a
man
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Ah
!
”
shrieked
Alfred
,
as
though
he
had
at
last
run
his
victim
to
earth
.
</p>
<p>
She
retreated
with
her
fingers
crossed
.
“
I
only
said
suppose
,
”
she
reminded
him
quickly
.
Then
she
continued
in
a
tone
meant
to
draw
from
him
his
heart
's
most
secret
confidence
.
“
Did
n't
you
ever
eat
lunch
with
any
woman
but
me
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Never
!
”
answered
Alfred
firmly
.
</p>
<p>
There
was
an
unmistakable
expression
of
pleasure
on
Zoie
's
small
face
,
but
she
forced
back
the
smile
that
was
trying
to
creep
round
her
lips
,
and
sidled
toward
Alfred
,
with
eyes
properly
downcast
.
“
Then
I
'm
very
sorry
I
did
it
,
”
she
said
solemnly
,
“
and
I
'll
never
do
it
again
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
So
!
”
cried
Alfred
with
renewed
indignation
.
“
You
admit
it
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Just
to
please
you
,
dear
,
”
explained
Zoie
sweetly
,
as
though
she
were
doing
him
the
greatest
possible
favour
.
</p>
<p>
“
To
please
me
?
”
gasped
Alfred
.
“
Do
you
suppose
it
pleases
me
to
know
that
you
are
carrying
on
the
moment
my
back
is
turned
,
making
a
fool
of
me
to
my
friends
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Your
friends
?
”
cried
Zoie
with
a
sneer
.
This
time
it
was
her
turn
to
be
angry
.
“
So
!
It
's
your
FRIENDS
that
are
worrying
you
!
”
In
her
excitement
she
tossed
Alfred
's
now
damaged
hat
into
the
chair
just
behind
her
.
He
was
far
too
overwrought
to
see
it
.
“
<hi rend="italic">
I
</hi>
have
n't
done
you
any
harm
,
”
she
continued
wildly
.
“
It
's
only
what
you
think
your
friends
think
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
You
have
n't
done
me
any
harm
?
”
repeated
Alfred
,
in
her
same
tragic
key
,
“
Oh
no
!
Oh
no
!
You
've
only
cheated
me
out
of
everything
I
expected
to
get
out
of
life
!
That
's
all
!
”
</p>
<p>
Zoie
came
to
a
full
stop
and
waited
for
him
to
enumerate
the
various
treasures
that
he
had
lost
by
marrying
her
.
He
did
so
.
</p>
<p>
“
Before
we
were
married
,
”
he
continued
,
“
you
pretended
to
adore
children
.
You
started
your
humbugging
the
first
day
I
met
you
.
I
refer
to
little
Willie
Peck
.
”
</p>
<p>
A
hysterical
giggle
very
nearly
betrayed
her
.
Alfred
continued
:
</p>
<p>
“
I
was
fool
enough
to
let
you
know
that
I
admire
women
who
like
children
.
From
that
day
until
the
hour
that
I
led
you
to
the
altar
,
you
'd
fondle
the
ugliest
little
brats
that
we
met
in
the
street
,
but
the
moment
you
GOT
me
--
--
”
</p>
<p>
“
Alfred
!
”
gasped
Zoie
.
This
was
really
going
too
far
.
</p>
<p>
“
Yes
,
I
repeat
it
!
”
shouted
Alfred
,
pounding
the
table
with
his
fist
for
emphasis
.
“
The
moment
you
GOT
me
,
you
declared
that
all
children
were
horrid
little
insects
,
and
that
someone
ought
to
sprinkle
bug-powder
on
them
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Oh
!
”
protested
Zoie
,
shocked
less
by
Alfred
's
interpretation
of
her
sentiments
,
than
by
the
vulgarity
with
which
he
expressed
them
.
</p>
<p>
“
On
another
occasion
,
”
declared
Alfred
,
now
carried
away
by
the
recital
of
his
long
pent
up
wrongs
,
“
you
told
me
that
all
babies
should
be
put
in
cages
,
shipped
West
,
and
kept
in
pens
until
they
got
to
be
of
an
interesting
age
.
'
Interesting
age
!
'
”
he
repeated
with
a
sneer
,
“
meaning
old
enough
to
take
YOU
out
to
luncheon
,
I
suppose
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
never
said
any
such
thing
,
”
objected
Zoie
.
</p>
<p>
“
Well
,
that
was
the
idea
,
”
insisted
Alfred
.
“
I
have
n't
your
glib
way
of
expressing
myself
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
You
manage
to
express
yourself
very
well
,
”
retorted
Zoie
.
“
When
you
have
anything
DISAGREEABLE
to
say
.
As
for
babies
,
”
she
continued
tentatively
,
“
I
think
they
are
all
very
well
in
their
PLACE
,
but
they
were
NEVER
meant
for
an
APARTMENT
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
offered
you
a
house
in
the
country
,
”
shouted
Alfred
.
</p>
<p>
“
The
country
!
”
echoed
Zoie
.
“
How
could
I
live
in
the
country
,
with
people
being
murdered
in
their
beds
every
night
?
Read
the
papers
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Always
an
excuse
,
”
sighed
Alfred
resignedly
.
“
There
always
HAS
been
and
there
always
would
be
if
I
'd
stay
to
listen
.
Well
,
for
once
,
”
he
declared
,
“
I
'm
glad
that
we
have
no
children
.
If
we
had
,
I
might
feel
some
obligation
to
keep
up
this
farce
of
a
marriage
.
As
it
is
,
”
he
continued
,
“
YOU
are
free
and
<hi rend="italic">
I
</hi>
am
free
.
”
And
with
a
courtly
wave
of
his
arm
,
he
dismissed
Zoie
and
the
entire
subject
,
and
again
he
started
in
pursuit
of
Mary
and
his
hat
.
</p>
<p>
“
If
it
's
your
freedom
you
wish
,
”
pouted
Zoie
with
an
abused
air
,
“
you
might
have
said
so
in
the
first
place
.
”
</p>
<p>
Alfred
stopped
in
sheer
amazement
at
the
cleverness
with
which
the
little
minx
turned
his
every
statement
against
him
.
</p>
<p>
“
It
's
not
very
manly
of
you
,
”
she
continued
,
“
to
abuse
me
just
because
you
've
found
someone
whom
you
like
better
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
That
's
not
true
,
”
protested
Alfred
hotly
,
“
and
you
know
it
's
not
true
.
”
Little
did
he
suspect
the
trap
into
which
she
was
leading
him
.
</p>
<p>
“
Then
you
DON'T
love
anybody
more
than
you
do
me
?
”
she
cried
eagerly
,
and
she
gazed
up
at
him
with
adoring
eyes
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
did
n't
say
any
such
thing
,
”
hedged
Alfred
.
</p>
<p>
“
Then
you
DO
,
”
she
accused
him
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
DON'T
,
”
he
declared
in
self
defence
.
</p>
<p>
With
a
cry
of
joy
,
she
sprang
into
his
arms
,
clasped
her
fingers
tightly
behind
his
neck
,
and
rained
impulsive
kisses
upon
his
unsuspecting
face
.
</p>
<p>
For
an
instant
,
Alfred
looked
down
at
Zoie
,
undecided
whether
to
strangle
her
or
to
return
her
embraces
.
As
usual
,
his
self-respect
won
the
day
for
him
and
,
with
a
determined
effort
,
he
lifted
her
high
in
the
air
,
so
that
she
lost
her
tenacious
hold
of
him
,
and
sat
her
down
with
a
thud
in
the
very
same
chair
in
which
she
had
lately
dropped
his
hat
.
Having
acted
with
this
admirable
resolution
,
he
strode
majestically
toward
the
inner
hall
,
but
before
he
could
reach
it
,
Zoie
was
again
on
her
feet
,
in
a
last
vain
effort
to
conciliate
him
.
Turning
,
Alfred
caught
sight
of
his
poor
battered
hat
.
This
was
the
final
spur
to
action
.
Snatching
it
up
with
one
hand
,
and
throwing
his
latchkey
on
the
table
with
the
other
,
he
made
determinedly
for
the
outer
door
.
