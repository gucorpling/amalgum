DR
Sister
has
never
been
the
same
emotionally
post-concussion
,
and
has
disowned
me
rather
than
face
the
truth
.
Does
she
need
to
get
out
of
denial
before
the
family
can
productively
support
her
?

Cross
posting
from
r/TBI
.
My
twin
sister
had
a
series
of
concussions
playing
rugby
back
in
the
'
00s
.
After
the
last
one
,
the
whole
family
noticed
that
although
her
intellect
seemed
unaffected
,
she
was
emotionally
very
fragile
,
and
her
fuse
(
always
short
)
pretty
much
disappeared
.
If
anyone
suggested
that
she
had
not
recovered
from
her
concussion
,
she
would
lose
it
completely
even
when
it
had
only
been
several
months
post-injury
.
So
we
all
got
into
the
habit
of
making
sure
we
did
n't
mention
it
.
She
was
doing
pretty
good
for
a
while
.
She
joined
the
Army
after
9/11
,
served
as
a
medic
in
Iraq
,
and
then
got
married
.
Her
husband
was
a
helicopter
pilot
,
and
great
with
heading
off
her
incidents
.
Then
in
2009
,
we
both
had
sons
.
In
the
years
thereafter
,
she
seemed
to
get
worse
.
It
seemed
like
every
time
they
visited
,
there
was
some
ugly
scene
,
usually
involving
her
raging
at
me
for
something
extremely
minor
,
and
then
blaming
me
.
I
think
because
we
are
twins
,
she
has
lower
inhibitions
with
me
,
and
because
she
thinks
of
us
as
equal
in
everything
,
if
she
is
being
an
incredible
asshole
,
then
I
must
be
too
.
She
also
began
suffering
from
insomnia
around
this
time
(
no
shit
with
a
new
kid
,
right
,
but
it
never
went
away
)
.
They
moved
to
the
same
city
as
the
rest
of
the
family
when
her
husband
retired
from
the
army
in
2014
.
This
was
the
beginning
of
the
end
,
and
she
eventually
wound
up
'
divorcing
'
me
.
When
she
called
a
family
meeting
to
censure
me
(
which
backfired
,
since
no
one
else
agreed
with
her
take
on
it
)
,
I
brought
up
TBI
,
and
everyone
backed
me
up
,
but
she
would
not
hear
it
and
followed
through
with
the
'
divorce
'
.
My
Dad
was
not
there
,
and
thinks
bringing
it
up
was
a
mistake
(
&quot;
you
ca
n't
reason
with
an
irrational
person
&quot;
)
.
We
tried
to
go
to
therapy
together
,
but
it
was
a
complete
disaster
.
I
have
never
suffered
a
greater
betrayal
than
her
'
divorce
'
(
she
is
my
IDENTICAL
twin
!
)
,
and
was
not
in
a
very
constructive
place
at
the
time
.
It
will
be
two
years
this
summer
.
We
have
not
spoken
or
seen
each
other
since
the
failed
therapy
sessions
a
year
ago
.
I
have
had
a
hard
time
forgiving
her
,
mostly
because
I
struggle
between
blaming
her
for
the
things
she
did
in
the
same
way
you
would
an
unimpaired
person
,
because
that
is
how
she
wants
to
be
seen
,
and
not
blaming
her
,
because
deep
down
,
I
know
she
IS
impaired
.
The
main
thing
I
struggle
with
now
that
I
am
becoming
more
resigned
to
the
latter
view
,
is
what
tact
we
should
take
with
her
.
Should
we
try
again
to
convince
her
that
she
does
in
fact
still
suffer
the
effects
of
her
old
concussions
?
I
feel
that
would
be
the
most
productive
,
since
we
would
all
be
on
the
same
page
,
and
it
feels
demeaning
to
her
to
have
everyone
in
on
the
big
secret
about
her
except
her
.
But
at
the
same
time
,
I
am
afraid
that
if
we
tried
to
have
an
'
intervention
'
or
something
,
she
might
go
totally
over
the
edge
,
or
just
'
divorce
'
the
whole
family
and
stop
letting
her
husband
and
son
associate
with
us
.
Should
we
just
sweep
it
all
under
the
rug
and
ignore
the
elephant
in
the
room
like
we
used
to
?
I
find
that
especially
difficult
,
since
I
am
(
almost
)
always
her
scapegoat
.

<p>
I
would
not
try
to
convince
her
of
anything
.
Since
there
is
not
a
cure
for
TBI
I
do
nâ€™t
know
how
making
her
digest
such
a
huge
thing
would
be
beneficial
.
Have
you
accepted
who
she
is
now
and
let
go
of
the
sister
you
had
?
