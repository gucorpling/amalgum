And
you
think
that
they
are
equal

No

not

DS

You
’re
saying
in
today
’s
culture
they
are
equal
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
BW
:
</hi>
Both
can
be
famous
.
That
’s
not
the
kind
of
fame
that
I
would
want
and
the
other
kind
of
fame
is
a
certain
flavor
of
misery
too
because
there
’s
a
trade-off
that
you
lose
your
personal
life
.
I
spent
enough
time
in
the
fantasy
world
.
I
do
n’t
watch
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality%20television">
reality
shows
</ref>
.
These
are
the
kind
of
people
I
could
n’t
wait
to
get
away
from
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High%20School">
high
school
</ref>
and
I
’m
going
to
chronicle
their
stupid
adventures
,
you
know
?
I
do
n’t
live
there
.
I
do
n’t
watch

<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
I
do
n’t
have
cable
,
so
I
know
how
you
feel
.
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
BW
:
</hi>
Yeah
,
but
even
if
I
had
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable%20television">
cable
</ref>
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite%20television">
satellite
</ref>
,
everything
,
I
do
n’t
watch
television
.
I
surround
myself
with
things
that
edify
me
,
not
because
it
’s
there
.
I
’m
an
information
freak
.
I
’m
a
news
freak
.
But
it
’s
got
to
be
truthful
news
and
that
’s
why
I
’ll
go
to
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/BBC_News">
BBC
News
</ref>
on
the
Internet
.
There
’s
less
pressure
with
the
truth
teller
over
there
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
It
’s
amazing
when
you
hear
the
BBC
interview
British
politicians
.
We
find
it
shocking
that
they
’ll
say
things
like
“
Are
n’t
you
essentially
lying
when
you
say
that
?
”
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
BW
:
</hi>
But
that
was
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth%20Estate">
Fourth
Estate
</ref>
.
That
was
the
idea
that
you
owe
your
readers
.
You
’ve
been
entrusted
to
deliver
news
to
them
and
even
if
it
’s
an
editorial
or
an
interview
,
the
idea
is
to
get
as
much
true
information
so
people
can
decide
for
themselves
.
I
do
n’t
care
if
the
interviewer
’s
biased
.
If
I
get
enough
information
,
I
have
a
chance
to
be
biased
or
not
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
That
's
an
argument
on
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Wikipedia">
Wikipedia
</ref>
:
people
make
the
argument
,
'
let
's
present
the
information
out
there
and
<hi rend="italic">
let
the
reader
decide
.
</hi>
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
BS
:
</hi>
Yeah
,
but
if
a
lot
of
times
the
information
is
totally
incorrect
to
begin
with
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
Exactly
,
and
it
can
be
difficult
to
decide
what
to
believe
when
reasonable
minds
can
differ
,
but
I
think
it
's
very
problematic
to
ever
argue
&quot;
just
let
the
reader
decide
.
&quot;
I
do
n't
know
if
Wikipedia
is
the
place
for
that
fight
,
but
in
the
news
media
,
that
is
the
place
for
the
fight
.
I
interviewed
Gay
Talese
,
who
quoted
Norman
Mailer
who
said
the
media
is
like
a
donkey
,
and
you
must
feed
the
donkey
every
day
;
the
donkey
will
eat
anything
:
garbage
,
tin
cans
,
slop
.
And
report
on
whatever
they
are
fed
.
