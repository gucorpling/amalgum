African
Parks
(
Majete
)
Ltd.
is
the
local
company
established
by
African
Parks
for
the
management
,
rehabilitation
,
and
development
of
Majete
Wildlife
Reserve
from
2003
to
2028
.
</p>
<p>
Since
African
Park
's
arrival
,
restocking
has
taken
place
in
phases
,
and
will
continue
with
the
aim
of
restoring
populations
of
the
original
species
that
were
present
in
the
Reserve
.
To
date
these
animals
include
:
two
black
rhino
,
buffalo
,
waterbuck
,
bushbuck
,
eland
,
hartebeest
,
zebra
,
bush
pig
,
impala
,
nyala
,
and
sable
.
we
aim
to
restock
the
Reserve
with
populations
of
exterminated
species
,
acquired
from
other
protected
areas
in
Malawi
and
neighboring
countries
.
</p>
<p>
A
42-km
intermediate
fence
was
constructed
in
2003
for
the
initial
phase
of
the
project
,
which
encloses
14,000
ha
,
where
all
the
restocking
of
game
species
takes
place
.
When
the
park
's
perimeter
fence
is
completed
,
and
the
intermediate
fence
is
removed
,
the
game
animals
will
be
able
to
disperse
freely
into
the
total
area
of
Majete
Wildlife
Reserve
.
</p>
<p>
The
infrastructure
has
been
upgraded
,
including
construction
and
maintenance
by
hand
of
150
km
of
new
roads
within
the
Reserve
,
with
one
drift
,
and
maintenance
of
the
16-km

from
Chikwawa
to
Majete
,
clearing
and
maintenance
40
km
of
firebreaks
for
fire
management
,
completion
of
6
scout

<p>
Majete
Wildlife
Reserve
covers
691
km
²
and
lies
at
the
low
attitude
of
about
100
m
(
see

)
.
The
Shire
River
forms
part
of
the
eastern
boundary
.
It
was
gazetted
as
a
Game
Reserve
in
1955
.
Further
extensions
occurred
in
1969
to
include
dry
season
water
sources
,
and
in
1976
it
was
extended
to
include
the
full
width
of
the
Shire
River
.
In
1988
there
were
estimated
to
be
over
200
elephants
in
Majete
,
but
by
1992
all
had
been
exterminated
.

marula
savannah

All
the

a
fringe
of
riverine
thicket

the
rugged
western
highlands
are
dominated
by
miombo
woodland
.

<p>
Majete
Wildlife
Reserve
was
,
at
one
time
,
hugely
rich
in
a
variety
of
species
of
animals
and
vegetation
.
Whilst
the
flora
is
undoubtedly
varied
and
flourishing
,
it
will
continue
to
take
a
while
before
the
Reserve
is
fully
habited
by
its
entire
indigenous
species
once
again
.
</p>
<p>
To
rehabilitate
Majete
’s
wildlife
,
the
agreement
between
African
Parks
and
the
Malawi
Government
stipulated
provisions
being
made
for
the
restocking
of
wildlife
with
populations
of
exterminated
species
acquired
from
other
protected
areas
in
Malawi
and
,
in
certain
circumstance
,
from
elsewhere
in
Africa
.
769
animals
have
been
moved
to
Majete
from
other
national
parks
in
Malawi
,
with
a
further
77
animals
coming
from
private
sources
in
Zambia
.

:
black
rhino
,
buffalo
,
waterbuck

,
Lichtenstein
’s
hartebeest
,
sable
antelope
,
nyala
,
Burchell
’s
zebra
,
impala
and
warthog
–
nearly
all
of
which
have
bred
successfully
and
increased
their
populations
by
at
least
10
%
since
reintroduction
.
Very
large
numbers
of
crocodiles
and
hippos
still
occur
in
the
Shire
River
.
Majete
Wildlife
Reserve
is
also
very
rich
in
birdlife
,
the
total
number
of
species
recorded
being
311
,
which
is
a
reflection
of
the
varied
habitat

Get

the
environment
,
there

no
tarmac
roads

kept
