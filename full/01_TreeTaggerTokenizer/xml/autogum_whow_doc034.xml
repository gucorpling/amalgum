Get
Better
at
Drawing
or
Painting
</head>
<p>
Being
artistic
is
a
respectable
talent
,
but
it
does
n't
come
naturally
to
everyone
.
Some
of
us
are
born
to
be
the
next
Vincent
van
Gogh
,
and
some
of
us
are
still
working
on
stick
figures
.
This
article
is
here
to
help
you
improve
your
artistic
skills
-
no
matter
where
on
the
talent
spectrum
you
are
.

Steps

<list type="ordered">
<item>
Expose
yourself
to
art
.
As
you
learn
more
about
different
styles
and
art
principles
,
you
will
be
able
to
incorporate
them
into
your
own
art
.
Go
to
art
museums
and
get
art
books
from
your
local
library
.
Learn
about
art
in
all
of
its
forms
.
Make
sure
to
do
your
research
before
you
begin
.
</item>
<item>
Practice
your
skills
.
Draw
or
paint
every
day
.
You
can
buy
a
notebook
that
you
fill
completely
with
doodles-
just
to
get
your
creativity
flowing
.
It
's
okay
if
you
just
do
one
stroke
a
day
-
just
make
sure
to
do
that
one
stroke
with
an
artistic
flair
.
</item>
<item>
Experiment
freely
.
If
you
like
the
flow
of
the
sky
in
&quot;
Starry
Night
&quot;
,
try
to
replicate
it
in
a
painting
of
your
own
.
Try
out
any
technique
or
style
that
intrigues
you
.
You
might
find
that
you
're
a
natural
at
a
style
you
never
tried
before
.
If
not
,
that
does
n't
mean
it
's
not
for
you
.
Keep
trying
.
Mix
styles
.
See
what
works
and
what
does
n't
.
Slowly
you
will
begin
to
develop
a
style
of
your
own
.
</item>
<item>
Do
n't
fall
into
autopilot
.
It
has
been
said
that
anything
you
do
without
thinking
will
not
be
your
best
work
.
Concentrate
on
your
art
.
Think
about
what
you
're
doing
from
beginning
to
end
.
</item>
<item>
Take
it
slow
.
Some
people
fly
through
a
painting
in
half
an
hour
and
are
frustrated
by
the
subpar
results
.
Do
n't
rush
;
even
if
you
're
incredibly
talented
,
trying
to
squeeze
art
into
a
tiny
span
of
time
will
never
go
well
.
Leave
the
piece
for
later
if
you
need
a
break
.
</item>
<item>
Get
your
own
supplies
.
It
's
good
to
have
them
on
hand
instead
of
going
to
a
community
center
or
similar
public
place
.
That
way
you
'll
have
more
opportunities
to
create
art
.

For
painting
,
you
should
have
canvases
;
normal
paper
shrinks
and
becomes
malformed
under
paint
.
Have
a
paint
palette
,
a
water
bowl
to
clean
your
brushes
,
a
few
different
types
of
brushes
,
and
red
,
yellow
,
blue
,
white
paint
at
least
.
To
darken
a
mixture
,
it
's
best
not
to
use
pure
black
,
so
find
a
variation
of
black
as
well
.
</item>
<item>
For
drawing
,
have
plenty
of
paper-
printer
paper
works
,
but
go
for
a
drawing
pad/sketchbook
if
you
want
to
.
Have
a
good
eraser
and
a
variety
of
pencils
:
4H
,
2H
,
HB
,
2B
,
4B
,
and
6B
,
primarily
.
This
will
give
you
a
greater
variety
of
potential
shades
to
use
.
</item>
<item>
If
you
're
on
a
tight
budget
,
buy
your
supplies
over
time
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Take
proper
care
of
your
supplies
.
They
will
be
no
use
to
you
otherwise
.
Wash
all
the
paint
out
of
your
brushes
after
use
and
then
dry
them
.
Keep
your
pencils
in
a
place
where
they
will
not
be
broken
.
</item>
<item>
Practice
shading
and
highlights
to
bring
depth
to
your
art
.
</item>
<item>
Show
your
work
to
family
and
friends
and
ask
for
suggestions
.
Use
the
suggestions
to
your
advantage
-
improve
what
you
are
n't
doing
well
.
</item>
<item>
Take
an
art
class
...
or
two
...
or
three
.
Learn
tips
and
tricks
from
people
who
are
paid
to
teach
them
.
</item>
<item>
Most
importantly
,
do
n't
throw
away
your
creativity
.
It
's
there
,
and
it
's
the
best
tool
you
'll
ever
have
.
Let
it
run
wild
,
no
matter
how
silly
you
feel
.
