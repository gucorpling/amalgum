PART
TEN
</head>
<p>
We
are
sitting
at
a
table
and
we
are
writing
this
upon
paper
made
thousands
of
years
ago
.
The
light
is
dim
,
and
we
cannot
see
the
Golden
One
,
only
one
lock
of
gold
on
the
pillow
of
an
ancient
bed
.
This
is
our
home
.
</p>
<p>
We
came
upon
it
today
,
at
sunrise
.
For
many
days
we
had
been
crossing
a
chain
of
mountains
.
The
forest
rose
among
cliffs
,
and
whenever
we
walked
out
upon
a
barren
stretch
of
rock
we
saw
great
peaks
before
us
in
the
west
,
and
to
the
north
of
us
,
and
to
the
south
,
as
far
as
our
eyes
could
see
.
The
peaks
were
red
and
brown
,
with
the
green
streaks
of
forests
as
veins
upon
them
,
with
blue
mists
as
veils
over
their
heads
.
We
had
never
heard
of
these
mountains
,
nor
seen
them
marked
on
any
map
.
The
Uncharted
Forest
has
protected
them
from
the
Cities
and
from
the
men
of
the
Cities
.
</p>
<p>
We
climbed
paths
where
the
wild
goat
dared
not
follow
.
Stones
rolled
from
under
our
feet
,
and
we
heard
them
striking
the
rocks
below
,
farther
and
farther
down
,
and
the
mountains
rang
with
each
stroke
,
and
long
after
the
strokes
had
died
.
But
we
went
on
,
for
we
knew
that
no
men
would
ever
follow
our
track
nor
reach
us
here
.
</p>
<p>
Then
today
,
at
sunrise
,
we
saw
a
white
flame
among
the
trees
,
high
on
a
sheer
peak
before
us
.
We
thought
that
it
was
a
fire
and
stopped
.
But
the
flame
was
unmoving
,
yet
blinding
as
liquid
metal
.
So
we
climbed
toward
it
through
the
rocks
.
And
there
,
before
us
,
on
a
broad
summit
,
with
the
mountains
rising
behind
it
,
stood
a
house
such
as
we
had
never
seen
,
and
the
white
fire
came
from
the
sun
on
the
glass
of
its
windows
.
</p>
<p>
The
house
had
two
stories
and
a
strange
roof
flat
as
a
floor
.
There
was
more
window
than
wall
upon
its
walls
,
and
the
windows
went
on
straight
around
the
corners
,
though
how
this
kept
the
house
standing
we
could
not
guess
.
The
walls
were
hard
and
smooth
,
of
that
stone
unlike
stone
which
we
had
seen
in
our
tunnel
.
</p>
<p>
We
both
knew
it
without
words
:
this
house
was
left
from
the
Unmentionable
Times
.
The
trees
had
protected
it
from
time
and
weather
,
and
from
men
who
have
less
pity
than
time
and
weather
.
We
turned
to
the
Golden
One
and
we
asked
:
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Are
you
afraid
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
But
they
shook
their
head
.
So
we
walked
to
the
door
,
and
we
threw
it
open
,
and
we
stepped
together
into
the
house
of
the
Unmentionable
Times
.
</p>
<p>
We
shall
need
the
days
and
the
years
ahead
,
to
look
,
to
learn
,
and
to
understand
the
things
of
this
house
.
Today
,
we
could
only
look
and
try
to
believe
the
sight
of
our
eyes
.
We
pulled
the
heavy
curtains
from
the
windows
and
we
saw
that
the
rooms
were
small
,
and
we
thought
that
not
more
than
twelve
men
could
have
lived
here
.
We
thought
it
strange
that
men
had
been
permitted
to
build
a
house
for
only
twelve
.
</p>
<p>
Never
had
we
seen
rooms
so
full
of
light
.
The
sunrays
danced
upon
colors
,
colors
,
more
colors
than
we
thought
possible
,
we
who
had
seen
no
houses
save
the
white
ones
,
the
brown
ones
and
the
grey
.
There
were
great
pieces
of
glass
on
the
walls
,
but
it
was
not
glass
,
for
when
we
looked
upon
it
we
saw
our
own
bodies
and
all
the
things
behind
us
,
as
on
the
face
of
a
lake
.
There
were
strange
things
which
we
had
never
seen
and
the
use
of
which
we
do
not
know
.
And
there
were
globes
of
glass
everywhere
,
in
each
room
,
the
globes
with
the
metal
cobwebs
inside
,
such
as
we
had
seen
in
our
tunnel
.
</p>
<p>
We
found
the
sleeping
hall
and
we
stood
in
awe
upon
its
threshold
.
For
it
was
a
small
room
and
there
were
only
two
beds
in
it
.
We
found
no
other
beds
in
the
house
,
and
then
we
knew
that
only
two
had
lived
here
,
and
this
passes
understanding
.
What
kind
of
world
did
they
have
,
the
men
of
the
Unmentionable
Times
?
</p>
<p>
We
found
garments
,
and
the
Golden
One
gasped
at
the
sight
of
them
.
For
they
were
not
white
tunics
,
nor
white
togas
;
they
were
of
all
colors
,
no
two
of
them
alike
.
Some
crumbled
to
dust
as
we
touched
them
.
But
others
were
of
heavier
cloth
,
and
they
felt
soft
and
new
in
our
fingers
.
</p>
<p>
We
found
a
room
with
walls
made
of
shelves
,
which
held
rows
of
manuscripts
,
from
the
floor
to
the
ceiling
.
Never
had
we
seen
such
a
number
of
them
,
nor
of
such
strange
shape
.
They
were
not
soft
and
rolled
,
they
had
hard
shells
of
cloth
and
leather
;
and
the
letters
on
their
pages
were
so
small
and
so
even
that
we
wondered
at
the
men
who
had
such
handwriting
.
We
glanced
through
the
pages
,
and
we
saw
that
they
were
written
in
our
language
,
but
we
found
many
words
which
we
could
not
understand
.
Tomorrow
,
we
shall
begin
to
read
these
scripts
.
</p>
<p>
When
we
had
seen
all
the
rooms
of
the
house
,
we
looked
at
the
Golden
One
and
we
both
knew
the
thought
in
our
minds
.
