Communicate
Effectively
With
a
Teenage
Daughter
</head>
<p>
Teenage
girls
have
a
lot
on
their
minds
,
and
because
they
're
young
,
sometimes
do
n't
know
how
to
cope
with
it
all
.
This
unfortunate
fact
can
sometimes
create
tension
between
them
and
you
.
But
what
they
may
not
know
is
that
you
are
their
biggest
fan
,
and
this
article
will
tell
you
how
to
show
them
that
,
and
how
to
develop
a
comfortable
,
expressive
,
loving
relationship
with
her
.

Steps

<list type="ordered">
<item>
Figure
out
what
makes
her
tick
.
If
you
know
what
she
likes
and
dislikes
,
this
will
give
you
common
ground
.

Let
her
know
that
you
love
her
.
Do
n't
be
overbearing
with
this
one
.
Maybe
you
could
start
small
.
Write
a
little
note
and
stick
it
on
her
mirror
.
Make
her
cookies
.
Give
her
a
ride
somewhere
.
Come
to
her
games
or
plays
.

Forgive
her
.
She
is
young
and
is
still
figuring
things
out
.
Teach
her
what
she
did
wrong
if
she
's
made
a
mistake
,
but
make
sure
she
knows
you
still
love
her
.
Let
her
know
that
you
forgive
her
and
understand
that
everybody
makes
mistakes
.

Realize
that
teenage
girls
are
EXTREMELY
emotional
.
This
is
true
for
every
single
teenage
girl
,
whether
they
show
it
on
the
outside
or
not
.
Just
because
she
yells
at
you
does
n't
mean
she
hates
you
.
If
she
does
,
it
's
probably
because
she
has
reached
the
end
of
her
rope
and
does
n't
know
how
to
react
to
her
situation
.
Let
her
cry
if
she
needs
to
.
Cry
with
her
,
but
not
too
much
.
Rejoice
with
her
.
Be
a
strong
anchor
for
her
while
her
emotions
are
unsettled
from
hormones
,
lack
of
sleep
,
and
too
much
going
on
.

<item>
Do
things
with
her
.
Find
activities
you
both
enjoy
and
spend
time
together
.
<figure rend="Communicate Effectively With a Teenage Daughter Step 5.jpg">

</item>
<item>
Try
to
see
things
from
her
perspective
.
This
is
a
big
one
.
Try
to
see
what
circumstances
and
emotions
are
making
her
think
the
ways
she
does
.

Make
sure
she
knows
she
can
come
to
you
with
concerns
.
This
is
huge
.
When
a
teenage
daughter
knows
that
they
can
go
to
their
parent(s)
with
concerns
,
problems
,
and
joys
,
it
makes
communication
meaningful
and
easy
.

Make
sure
she
knows
that
you
are
interested
in
her
life
and
concerns
.

Tips
</head>
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Give
her
hugs
,
if
she
likes
it
.
But
even
if
she
does
n't
hug
her
once
in
a
while
.
</item>
<item>
Make
sure
you
have
a
general
idea
of
where
she
is
and
what
she
's
doing
.
</item>
<item>
Make
sure
she
knows
that
you
are
there
for
more
than
just
telling
her
what
to
do
.
</item>
<item>
Even
if
it
seems
like
you
're
not
getting
through
to
her
,
you
really
are
.
She
is
probably
too
proud
or
emotional
to
show
it
.
</item>
<item>
Every
once
in
a
while
,
give
her
a
break
with
chores
and
such
if
she
needs
it
.
This
will
help
her
know
that
you
realize
she
needs
breaks
sometimes
and
that
you
love
her
.
</item>
<item>
Sometimes
,
but
not
always
,
you
need
to
initiate
the
conversations
.
There
's
a
delicate
balance
of
initiating
and
not
initiating
conversation
which
depends
on
each
girl
.

Warnings
</head>
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Do
n't
scold
her
in
front
of
her
friends
or
other
people
she
cares
about
.
</item>
<item>
Do
n't
let
her
control
you
.
That
is
,
make
sure
that
you
are
still
the
boss
.
Parents
need
to
teach
their
children
,
but
do
it
gently
.
</item>
<item>
Do
n't
let
her
have
too
much
or
too
little
freedom
.
Both
of
these
can
have
very
bad
outcomes
.
</item>
<item>
Do
n't
tease
about
boys
too
much
.
This
will
push
away
open
conversation
about
boys
and
dating
.
