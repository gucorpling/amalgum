Accept
Yourself
,
Your

and
Your
Reality
</head>
<p>
It
can
be
hard
to
accept
yourself
,
your
life
,
and
you
the
reality
that
you
live
.
Maybe
you
do
n't
like
your
future
prospects
,
or
dislike
an
aspect
of
your
personality
,
or
some
days
you
do
n't
like
something
about
how
you
look
.
It
is
common
for
people
to
be
critical
of
themselves
,
but
there
are
a
number
of
ways
to
learn
to
accept
yourself
and
your
life

Acknowledge
your
strengths
.
It
's
so
easy
to
look
in
the
mirror
and
point
out
your
insecurities
.
But
,
instead
of
counting
all
the
things
you
wish
you
could
be
,
try
counting
all
the
things
that
you
are
.
Make
a
list
of
your
strengths
,
such
as
the
things
you
are
good
at
,
the
values
that
you
hold
,
and
the
friends
that
you
have
.

If

ask

what
they

are
your

Be
honest
with
yourself
.
</ref>
This
is
one
of
the
hardest
things
for
many
of
us
to
do
,
but
it
is
a
necessary
step
toward
navigating
your
life
.
In
many
of
today
's
societies
that
focus
on
the
individual
,
we
are
encouraged
to
strive
for
success
,
and
often
we
look
for
praise
as
the
acknowledgment
of
that
success
.
We
take
any
criticism
as
a
negative
thing
,
so
we
shy
away
from
seeing
anything
about
ourselves
that
elicits
that
reaction
.

To
try
to
be
honest
with
yourself
,
imagine
that
you
are
observing
yourself
through
a
stranger
's
eyes
.
Ask
yourself
what
that
person
thinks
about
you
,
and
be
as
objective
as
possible
based
on
the
facts
,
rather
than
what
you
think
about
yourself
.

Admit
Mistakes
.
Remember
that
you
ca
n't
fix
it
until
you
can
admit
there
is
a
problem
.
You
can
view
mistakes
that
you
make
as
learning
opportunities
,
as
ways
to
get
where
you
want
to
go
in
life
.
Have
faith
in
yourself
,
realize
only
you
can
change
you
,
only
you
can
control
your
destiny
.
Decide
what
is
important
to
you
and
set
your
mind
to
it
.
Remove
self-doubt
and
have
faith
you
can
become
what
you
envision
.

When
you
realize
that
mistakes
are
learning
opportunities
and
that
your
reality
is
n't
always
fixed
,
you
will
be
more
likely
to
persist
in
the
face

challenge

to
persevere

to

Talk
to
someone
you
trust
.
Vent
your
feelings
about
your
life
to
a
friend
or
family
member
who
cares
for
you
and
will
give
you
the
attention
that
you
need
.
You
may
find
that
just
by
putting
your
thoughts
out
in
the
open
that
you
realize
that
they
are
excessive
or
that
your
life
is
n't
so
bad
after
all
.

If
you
do
n't
feel
like
just
venting
,
try
asking
your
friend
or
family
member
for
advice
on
how
to
change
or
improve
your
life
in
the
ways
that
you

Seek
professional
help
.
Sometimes
it
is
easier
or
more
efficient
to
get
outside
help
from
a
professional
.
A
therapist
can
help
you
to
learn
to
accept
yourself
and
your
reality
.
This
could
be
a
psychologist
,
a
psychiatrist
,
or
a
licensed
counselor
or
other
mental
health
professional
.
