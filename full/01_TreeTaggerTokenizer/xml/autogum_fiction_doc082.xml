The
Battle
of
Ludlow
Street
</head>
<p>
Rarely
was
a
more
genuine
tribute
paid
to
entrancing
girlhood
than
when
Aubrey
compelled
himself
,
by
sheer
force
of
will
and
the
ticking
of
his
subconscious
time-sense
,
to
wake
at
six
o'clock
the
next
morning
.
For
this
young
man
took
sleep
seriously
and
with
a
primitive
zest
.
It
was
to
him
almost
a
religious
function
.
As
a
minor
poet
has
said
,
he
&quot;
made
sleep
a
career
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
But
he
did
not
know
what
train
Roger
might
be
taking
,
and
he
was
determined
not
to
miss
him
.
By
a
quarter
after
six
he
was
seated
in
the
Milwaukee
Lunch
(
which
is
never
closed
--
Open
from
Now
Till
the
Judgment
Day
.
Tables
for
Ladies
,
as
its
sign
says
)
with
a
cup
of
coffee
and
corned
beef
hash
.
In
the
mood
of
tender
melancholy
common
to
unaccustomed
early
rising
he
dwelt
fondly
on
the
thought
of
Titania
,
so
near
and
yet
so
far
away
.
He
had
leisure
to
give
free
rein
to
these
musings
,
for
it
was
ten
past
seven
before
Roger
appeared
,
hurrying
toward
the
subway
.
Aubrey
followed
at
a
discreet
distance
,
taking
care
not
to
be
observed
.
</p>
<p>
The
bookseller
and
his
pursuer
both
boarded
the
eight
o'clock
train
at
the
Pennsylvania
Station
,
but
in
very
different
moods
.
To
Roger
,
this
expedition
was
a
frolic
,
pure
and
simple
.
He
had
been
tied
down
to
the
bookshop
so
long
that
a
day
's
excursion
seemed
too
good
to
be
true
.
He
bought
two
cigars
--
an
unusual
luxury
--
and
let
the
morning
paper
lie
unheeded
in
his
lap
as
the
train
drummed
over
the
Hackensack
marshes
.
He
felt
a
good
deal
of
pride
in
having
been
summoned
to
appraise
the
Oldham
library
.
Mr.
Oldham
was
a
very
distinguished
collector
,
a
wealthy
Philadelphia
merchant
whose
choice
Johnson
,
Lamb
,
Keats
,
and
Blake
items
were
the
envy
of
connoisseurs
all
over
the
world
.
Roger
knew
very
well
that
there
were
many
better-known
dealers
who
would
have
jumped
at
the
chance
to
examine
the
collection
and
pocket
the
appraiser
's
fee
.
The
word
that
Roger
had
had
by
long
distance
telephone
was
that
Mr.
Oldham
had
decided
to
sell
his
collection
,
and
before
putting
it
to
auction
desired
the
advices
of
an
expert
as
to
the
prices
his
items
should
command
in
the
present
state
of
the
market
.
And
as
Roger
was
not
particularly
conversant
with
current
events
in
the
world
of
rare
books
and
manuscripts
,
he
spent
most
of
the
trip
in
turning
over
some
annotated
catalogues
of
recent
sales
which
Mr.
Chapman
had
lent
him
.
&quot;
This
invitation
,
&quot;
he
said
to
himself
,
&quot;
confirms
what
I
have
always
said
,
that
the
artist
,
in
any
line
of
work
,
will
eventually
be
recognized
above
the
mere
tradesman
.
Somehow
or
other
Mr.
Oldham
has
heard
that
I
am
not
only
a
seller
of
old
books
but
a
lover
of
them
.
He
prefers
to
have
me
go
over
his
treasures
with
him
,
rather
than
one
of
those
who
peddle
these
things
like
so
much
tallow
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Aubrey
's
humour
was
far
removed
from
that
of
the
happy
bookseller
.
In
the
first
place
,
Roger
was
sitting
in
the
smoker
,
and
as
Aubrey
feared
to
enter
the
same
car
for
fear
of
being
observed
,
he
had
to
do
without
his
pipe
.
He
took
the
foremost
seat
in
the
second
coach
,
and
peering
occasionally
through
the
glass
doors
he
could
see
the
bald
poll
of
his
quarry
wreathed
with
exhalements
of
cheap
havana
.
Secondly
,
he
had
hoped
to
see
Weintraub
on
the
same
train
,
but
though
he
had
tarried
at
the
train-gate
until
the
last
moment
,
the
German
had
not
appeared
.
He
had
concluded
from
Weintraub
's
words
the
night
before
that
druggist
and
bookseller
were
bound
on
a
joint
errand
.
Apparently
he
was
mistaken
.
He
bit
his
nails
,
glowered
at
the
flying
landscape
,
and
revolved
many
grievous
fancies
in
his
prickling
bosom
.
Among
other
discontents
was
the
knowledge
that
he
did
not
have
enough
money
with
him
to
pay
his
fare
back
to
New
York
,
and
he
would
either
have
to
borrow
from
someone
in
Philadelphia
or
wire
to
his
office
for
funds
.
He
had
not
anticipated
,
when
setting
out
upon
this
series
of
adventures
,
that
it
would
prove
so
costly
.
</p>
<p>
The
train
drew
into
Broad
Street
station
at
ten
o'clock
,
and
Aubrey
followed
the
bookseller
through
the
bustling
terminus
and
round
the
City
Hall
plaza
.
Mifflin
seemed
to
know
his
way
,
but
Philadelphia
was
comparatively
strange
to
the
Grey-Matter
solicitor
.
He
was
quite
surprised
at
the
impressive
vista
of
South
Broad
Street
,
and
chagrined
to
find
people
jostling
him
on
the
crowded
pavement
as
though
they
did
not
know
he
had
just
come
from
New
York
.
</p>
<p>
Roger
turned
in
at
a
huge
office
building
on
Broad
Street
and
took
an
express
elevator
.
Aubrey
did
not
dare
follow
him
into
the
car
,
so
he
waited
in
the
lobby
.
He
learned
from
the
starter
that
there
was
a
second
tier
of
elevators
on
the
other
side
of
the
building
,
so
he
tipped
a
boy
a
quarter
to
watch
them
for
him
,
describing
Mifflin
so
accurately
that
he
could
not
be
missed
.
By
this
time
Aubrey
was
in
a
thoroughly
ill
temper
,
and
enjoyed
quarrelling
with
the
starter
on
the
subject
of
indicators
for
showing
the
position
of
the
elevators
.
Observing
that
in
this
building
the
indicators
were
glass
tubes
in
which
the
movement
of
the
car
was
traced
by
a
rising
or
falling
column
of
coloured
fluid
,
Aubrey
remarked
testily
that
that
old-fashioned
stunt
had
long
been
abandoned
in
New
York
.
The
starter
retorted
that
New
York
was
only
two
hours
away
if
he
liked
it
better
.
This
argument
helped
to
fleet
the
time
rapidly
.
