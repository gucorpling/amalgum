allegations
of

sexually
abusing

The

to
the

does

<p>
Collins
was
a
science
teacher
in
St
Peters
when
allegations
against
him
of
sexual
abuse
involving
pupils
in
the
school
dormitory
were
made
in
1966
.
He
was
transferred
to
a
parish
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster">
Westminster
</ref>
but
the
Bishop
of
Ferns
,
Donal
J.
Herlihy
did
not
disclose
that
allegations
had
been
lodged
against
Collins
,
an
omission
described
by
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ferns_Inquiry">
The
Ferns
Inquiry
</ref>
as
warranting
very
serious
criticism
.
Collins
returned
to
St
Peters
in
1968
and
was
allowed
to
fully
take
up
all
duties
associated
with
a
teacher
in
a
boarding
school
including
mentoring
pupils
for
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Scientist_and_Technology_Exhibition">

,
facilitating
school
trips
to
the
public
swimming
pool
in
Ferrybank
,
Wexford
,
and
accompanying
pupils
on
annual
school
tours
abroad
.
His
nickname
among
the
students
was
&quot;
Slinker
&quot;
.
Fourteen
pupils
are
cited
in
the
Ferns
Report
as
being
abused
by
Collins
between
the
1960s
and
early
1990s
.
</p>
<p>
The
first
report
subsequent
to
the
1966
allegations
came
to
Bishop
Comiskey
's
attention
within
seven
months
of
his
appointment
as
Principal
in
1988
.
Collins
resigned
as
principal
in
1991
after
an
anonymous
letter
was
sent
to
Comiskey
.
Comiskey
sent
Collins
for
counselling
to
Florida
in
1991
.
Collins
was
attached
to
a
parish
in
Florida
during
that
period
.
</p>
<p>
Collins
admitted
the
abuse
in
1993
.
He
was
charged
in
1995
with
21
counts
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indecent_assault">
indecent
assault
</ref>
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indecency_with_Children_Act_1960">
gross
indecency
</ref>
and
one
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buggery">
buggery
</ref>
against
four
former
pupils
.
Collins
served
a
one-year
jail
sentence
on
conviction
.
He
was
laicised
in
2004
(
38
years
after
sex
abuse
allegations
against
him
first
surfaced
)
.
He
took
civil
proceedings
by
way
of
judicial
review
in
May
1996
,
seeking
a
prohibition
of
the
hearing
of
the
charges
.
That
application
was
refused
.
In
March
1998
,
he
pleaded
guilty
to
four
charges
of
gross
indecency
and
one
of
indecent
assault
.
He
was
sentenced
to
four
years
imprisonment
and
served
one
year
at
the
Curragh
prison
.
He
was
released

as
one
of
12
priests
involved
in
100
cases
of
child
sexual
abuse
in
the
diocese
between
1962
and
2002
.
The
Report
explains
that
at
least
six
priests
in
the
Diocese
of
Ferns
and
associated
with
St
Peters
College
were
aware
of
troubling
rumours
concerning
the
reasons
for
Collins
removal
in
1966
but
they
did
not
notify
Church
authorities
in
the
diocese
of
the
potential
danger
posed
by
Collins
when
his
appointment
as
Principal
was
suggested
.
No
diocesan
records
were
maintained
concerning
the
removal
of
Collins
from
Ferns
in
1966
.
When
anonymous
allegations
against
Collins
first
emerged
and
in
the
face
of
denial
by
Collins
of
the
sexual
allegations
against
him
,
Comiskey
spent
two
years
seeking
evidence
to
substantiate
these
.
Collins
was
finally
removed
in
1991
.
Comiskey
also
made
erroneous
statements
to
the
Garda√≠
and
media
concerning
Collins
against
the
background
of
information
available
to
Comiskey
.
