Create
a
Crisis
Management
Strategy
</head>
<p>
All
organizations
should
have
a
crisis
management
policy
which
is
at
the
same
level
of
importance
as
the
mission
statement
and
business
plan
.
A
proper
crisis
management
policy
can
rapidly
restore
normality
and
confidence
for
workers
in
the
organization
.
It
also
provides
a
good
source
of
PR
material
for
the
media
.

Determine
whether
it
is
a
crisis
.
This
question
is
important
to
ask
,
as
there
are
many
situations
that
go
wrong
because
the
right
person
to
handle
it
is
not
around
.
You
may
be
in
charge
of
a
project
until
your
supervisor
comes
back
and
are
unable
to
contact
him
during
a
crisis
.
You
have
to
make
your
own
decisions
in
his
absence
and
your
action
is
dependent
on
the
level
of
authority
given
.

See
the
Big
Picture
.
It
is
not
easy
to
handle
a
crisis
if
you
are
not
aware
of
the
all
the
facts
.
The
final
outcome
may
not
be
the
way
you
envisage
.
If
your
role
is
a
leader
,
you
have
to
be
detached
from
the
emotional
side
of
the
crisis
and
rationally
take
stock
of
how
to
move
on
.
Again
,
this
is
not
as
easy
as
it
sounds
as
you
may
have
longtime
colleagues
who
are
involved
in
this
crisis
.

Gather
the
Relevant
Team
.
It
is
important
to
be
able
to
meet
up
with
the
relevant
team
to
discuss
about
the
situation
.
This
is
to
ensure
that
the
team
is
able
to
analyse
and
make
a
united
stand
about
handling
this
crisis
.
This
team
should
also
comprise
of
the
authorities
,
if
the
crisis
is
serious
.

Set
a
Timeline
.
You
must
construct
a
timeline
and
ensure
that
each
process
scenario
is
highlighted
.
This
practice
will
be
a
check
to
prevent
your
team
from
spending
too
much
time
in
one
aspect
of
handling
the
crisis
.

Develop
a
Procedural
Manual
.
Is
there
an
organizational
situational
manual
that
you
can
use
for
this
situation
?
Are
you
able
to
recollect
the
tips
that
were
given
to
you
when
you
participated
in
a
mock
drill
?
<figure rend="Create a Crisis Management Strategy Step 5.jpg">

<item>
Seek
External
Experts
.
You
should
get
external
experts
to
access
the
situation
if
the
crisis
is
totally
unanticipated
.
However
,
you
must
have
had
a
close-door
meeting
with
your
inner
circle
.
This
is
essential
,
as
you
do
not
want
to
unnecessarily
reveal
confidential
information
to
external
parties
.
<figure rend="Create a Crisis Management Strategy Step 6.jpg">

<item>
Speak
To
The
Media
.
It
is
important
to
prepare
a
press
kit
which
provides
a
full
detailed
report
about
the
crisis
.
If
you
are
comfortable
to
conduct
a
press
interview
,
you
have
to
ensure
that
you
have
the
full
details
first
.

Fine
tune
Your
Communication
Style
.
You
have
to
ensure
that
your
communication
style
is
in
sync
with
the
crisis
.
Remember
to
be
forthcoming
with
reliable
information
and
try
not
to
speculate
.
This
will
also
ensure
that
the
victims
'
immediate
families
do
not
overly
worry
.
It
will
also
not
help
if
you
come
across
as
very
emotional
in
the
media
as
you
want
to
communicate
that
your
organization
has
everything
under
control
.

Protect
your
reputation
.
If
the
crisis
involves
the
loss
of
lives
,
it
is
not
unthinkable
that
your
credibility
and
organisation
's
reputation
is
put
into
question
.
Assuming
that
the
crisis
was
beyond
your
organisation
's
control
,
you
have
to
stick
to
your
best
judgement
and
not
be
led
into
a
debate
that
may
open
your
organisation
to
possible
legal
action
.
