Introduction
</head>
<p>
Food
digestion
within
the
gastrointestinal
tract
is
a
good
example
for
biofermentation
processes
in
our
daily
life
,
in
which
many
different
types
of
microorganisms
can
be
involved
.
Without
microbes
,
large
and
complex
food
molecules
cannot
be
broken
down
into
required
nutrients
for
the
human
body
.
In
the
food-research
sector
,
complex
microbial
interactions
have
been
studied
to
enhance
,
for
instance
,
the
aroma
profile
and
flavor
in
soy
sauce
during
the
fermentation
process
.
As
another
example
,
microorganisms
play
a
major
role
in
coffee
fermentation
by
degrading
the
mucilage
to
alcohols
,
acids
,
and
enzymes
.
In
agricultural
biogas
plants
,
various
types
of
bacteria
contribute
to
the
conversion
of
biomass
(
e.
g.
,
maize
silage
)
into
a
usable
energy
source
(
e.
g.
,
methane
gas
)
.
In
all
applications
of
bioreactor
technology
,
the
on-line
monitoring
of
the
metabolic
activity
of
microorganisms
should
be
seriously
considered
to
avoid
undesired
,
time-consuming
,
and
cost-intensive
interventions
,
which
can
reduce
the
yield
at
the
end
of
the
production
chain
.
Related
fields
of
application
include
:
cell
health
monitoring
in
bioreactors
,
continuous
non-invasive
monitoring
of
cell
growth
in
disposable
bioreactors
,
on-line
near-infrared
bioreactor
monitoring
of
cell
density
,
online
monitoring
of
cell
concentration
in
high-cell
density
<hi rend="italic">
Escherichia
coli
</hi>
cultivations
,
sensing
metabolites
for
monitoring
the
tissue-engineered
cellularity
in
perfusion
bioreactors
,
and
micro-biosensors
for
fed-batch
fermentation
with
integrated
online
monitoring
.
In
all
of
those
examples
,
analytical
sensors
are
the
enabling
element
for
rapid
,
sensitive
,
and
cost-effective
detection
of
various
parameters
(
e.
g.
,
health
,
growth
,
and
density
of
cells
in
bioreactors
)
.
In
this
context
,
light-addressable
potentiometric
sensors
(
LAPS
)
can
be
applied
as
suitable
tools
for
monitoring
the
extracellular
acidification
of
cells
.
A
LAPS
is
a
field-effect-based
chemical
sensor
with
the
ability
to
monitor
concentration
changes
of
biochemical/biological
species
in
a
spatially
resolved
way
.
It
belongs
to
the
family
of
electrolyte/insulator/semiconductor
(
EIS)-based
capacitive
sensors
.
By
addressing
defined
regions
of
interest
on
a
sensor
chip
with
modulated
light
beams
such
as
laser-diode
modules
,
two-dimensional
(
2D
)
chemical
images
of
concentration
distributions
can
be
recorded
.
In
comparison
to
other
2D
potentiometric
chemical
imaging
sensors
applying
e.
g.
,
arrays
of
ion-sensitive
field-effect
transistors
(
ISFETs
)
or
charge-coupled
devices
(
CCDs
)
,
LAPS
require
no
sensor
patterns
to
record
chemical
images
:
The
LAPS
surface
does
not
require
pattering
,
wiring
or
passivation
,
which
allows
bacteria
to
come
directly
into
contact
with
the
pH-sensitive
transducer
layer
to
determine
the
extracellular
acidification
.
Furthermore
,
on
its
planar
sensor
surface
,
multi-chamber
structures
can
be
attached
to
perform
differential
measurements
with
distinct
cell
suspensions
.
The
principle
of
differential
measurements
allows
elimination
of
unwanted
external
influences
such
as
sensor
signal
drift
and
pH
value
variations
of
the
measurement
solution
during
experiments
.
Beside
the
chemical
imaging
technique
visualizing
the
pH
distribution
on
the
sensor
surface
,
there
are
a
variety
of
further
LAPS
sensing
techniques
such
as
the
scanned
light-pulse
technique
(
SLPT
)
in
studies
of
interface
properties
(
e.
g
<hi rend="italic">
.
,
</hi>
flat-band
voltage
)
,
or
scanning
photo-induced
impedance
microscopy
(
SPIM
)
analyzing
impedance
changes
e.
g
<hi rend="italic">
.
,
</hi>
in
PAH/PSS
polyelectrolyte
microcapsules
labeled
with
Au
nanoparticles
.
The
equivalent
circuit
diagram
for
designing
the
LAPS
set-up
consists
of
three
key
parts
(
illumination
area
,
non-illumination
area
,
and
an
external
circuit
)
,
which
are
described
in
details
in
.
The
sensor
fabrication
steps
are
described
in
Section
2.1
.
Explanations
about
LAPS
operation
modes
(
e.
g.
,
constant-bias
,
constant-current
,
potential-tracking
,
and
phase-mode
)
can
be
found
in
.

<p>
A
few
examples
of
on-going
research
for
LAPS-based
biosensing
are
the
determination
of
the
extracellular
acidification
of
<hi rend="italic">
Escherichia
coli
</hi>
,
and
differential
imaging
of
the
metabolism
of
bacteria
and
eukaryotic
cells
.
In
this
regard
,
quantitative
differential
monitoring
of
the
metabolic
activity
of
<hi rend="italic">
Corynebacterium
glutamicum
</hi>
,
and
image
detection
of
yeast
<hi rend="italic">
Saccharomyces
cerevisiae
</hi>
have
been
recently
discussed
.
Correspondingly
,
dual
functional
extracellular
recording
for
better
signal
transduction
,
and
monitoring
secretion
of
adrenal
chromaffin
cells
by
local
extracellular
acidification
are
further
applications
.
</p>
<p>
In
this
work
and
for
the
first
time
,
the
extracellular
acidification
of
three
model
microorganisms
,
namely
<hi rend="italic">
Escherichia
coli
</hi>
(
<hi rend="italic">
E.
coli
</hi>
)
K12
,
<hi rend="italic">
Corynebacterium
glutamicum
</hi>
(
<hi rend="italic">
C.
glutamicum
</hi>
)
ATCC13032
,
and
<hi rend="italic">
Lactobacillus
brevis
</hi>
(
<hi rend="italic">
L.
brevis
</hi>
)
ATCC
14869
is
assessed
simultaneously
by
means
of
a
four-chamber
differential
LAPS
set-up
by
varying
the
cell
number
and/or
glucose
concentration
.
These
model
microorganisms
were
selected
,
as
acid-forming
,
facultative
anaerobe
,
easy-to-cultivate
,
and
commonly
used
bacteria
in
laboratory
and
industrial
applications
.
Both
<hi rend="italic">
E.
coli
</hi>
and
<hi rend="italic">
C.
glutamicum
</hi>
have
been
studied
in
separate
LAPS
experiments
recently
,
however
,
the
cellular
metabolism
of
<hi rend="italic">
L.
brevis
</hi>
has
not
been
analyzed
by
LAPS
so
far
.
In
a
first
experimental
step
,
the
extracellular
acidification
of
<hi rend="italic">
L.
brevis
</hi>
cells
has
been
evaluated
:
calibration
curves
were
established
,
which
render
the
potential-change
rate
as
a
function
of
glucose
concentration
and
cell
number
.
Data
were
compared
with
results
of
already
in
literature
discussed
microorganisms
such
as
<hi rend="italic">
E.
coli
</hi>
and
<hi rend="italic">
C.
glutamicum
</hi>
.
Finally
,
a
novel
parallelized
measurement
procedure
is
introduced
,
which
allows
sequentially
and
simultaneously
performed
LAPS
measurements
with
all
three
types
of
bacteria
.
