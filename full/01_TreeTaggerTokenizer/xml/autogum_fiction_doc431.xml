THE
TRAP
</head>
<p>
Had
it
not
been
for
the
stop
the
car
had
previously
made
,
for
the
possibility
that
he
might
have
obtained
a
glimpse
outside
when
the
door
had
been
opened
,
the
scarf
over
his
eyes
would
have
been
superfluous
;
for
now
,
with
it
removed
,
he
could
scarcely
distinguish
the
forms
of
the
three
men
around
him
,
since
the
window
curtains
of
the
car
were
tightly
drawn
.
Nor
was
he
given
the
opportunity
to
do
more
,
even
had
it
been
possible
.
The
car
stopped
,
the
door
was
opened
,
he
was
pushed
toward
it
--
and
even
as
he
reached
the
ground
,
the
door
was
closed
behind
him
,
and
the
car
was
speeding
on
again
.
But
where
he
could
not
see
before
,
it
took
now
but
a
glance
to
obtain
his
bearings
--
he
was
standing
on
a
corner
on
Riverside
Drive
,
within
a
few
doors
of
his
own
house
.
</p>
<p>
Jimmie
Dale
stood
still
for
a
moment
,
watching
the
car
as
it
disappeared
rapidly
up
the
Drive
.
And
with
a
sort
of
grim
facetiousness
his
brain
began
to
correlate
time
and
distance
.
Where
had
he
come
from
?
Where
was
this
Crime
Club
?
They
had
been
,
as
nearly
as
he
could
estimate
,
two
hours
in
making
the
journey
;
and
,
as
nearly
as
he
could
estimate
,
in
their
turnings
and
twistings
had
covered
at
least
twice
the
distance
that
would
be
represented
by
a
direct
route
.
Granting
,
then
,
an
average
speed
of
forty
miles
an
hour
,
which
was
overgenerous
to
be
on
the
safe
side
,
and
the
fact
that
they
certainly
had
not
crossed
the
Hudson
,
which
now
lay
before
him
,
flanking
the
Drive
,
the
Crime
Club
was
somewhere
within
the
area
of
a
semicircle
,
whose
centre
was
the
corner
on
which
he
now
stood
,
and
whose
radius
was
forty
miles
--
OR
FORTY
YARDS
!
He
forced
a
laugh
.
It
was
just
that
,
no
more
,
no
less
--
he
was
as
likely
to
have
started
on
his
ride
from
within
a
biscuit
throw
of
where
he
now
stood
,
as
to
have
started
on
it
from
miles
away
!
</p>
<p>
But
--
he
aroused
himself
with
a
start
--
he
was
wasting
time
!
It
must
be
very
late
,
near
morning
,
and
he
would
have
need
for
every
moment
that
was
left
between
now
and
daylight
.
He
turned
,
walked
quickly
to
his
house
,
mounted
the
steps
,
and
with
his
latch-key
--
they
had
at
least
permitted
him
to
retain
the
contents
of
his
pockets
when
they
had
forced
him
to
change
his
clothes
--
opened
the
front
door
softly
,
and
,
stepping
inside
,
closed
the
door
as
silently
as
he
had
opened
it
.
</p>
<p>
He
paused
for
an
instant
to
listen
.
There
was
not
a
sound
.
The
servants
,
naturally
,
would
have
been
in
bed
hours
ago
.
Even
old
Jason
--
Jimmie
Dale
smiled
,
half
whimsically
,
half
affectionately
--
whose
paternal
custom
it
was
to
sit
up
for
his
Master
Jim
,
who
,
as
he
was
fond
of
saying
,
he
had
dandled
as
a
baby
on
his
knee
,
had
evidently
given
it
up
as
a
bad
job
on
this
occasion
and
had
turned
in
himself
.
Jason
,
however
,
had
left
the
light
burning
here
in
the
big
reception
hall
.
</p>
<p>
Jimmie
Dale
stepped
to
the
switch
and
turned
off
the
light
;
then
stood
hesitant
in
the
darkness
.
Was
there
anything
to
be
gained
by
rousing
Jason
now
and
telling
him
what
he
intended
to
do
--
to
instruct
him
to
answer
any
inquiries
by
the
statement
that
“
Mr.
Dale
had
gone
away
for
a
trip
”
?
He
could
trust
Jason
;
Jason
already
knew
much
--
more
than
one
of
those
mysterious
letters
of
the
Tocsin
's
had
passed
through
Jason
's
hands
.
</p>
<p>
Jimmie
Dale
shook
his
head
.
No
;
he
could
communicate
with
Jason
from
downtown
in
the
morning
.
He
had
half
expected
to
find
Jason
up
,
and
,
in
that
case
,
would
have
taken
the
other
,
as
far
as
necessary
,
into
his
confidence
;
but
it
was
not
a
matter
that
pressed
for
the
moment
.
He
could
get
into
touch
with
Jason
at
any
time
readily
enough
.
Was
there
anything
else
before
he
went
?
He
would
not
be
able
to
get
back
as
easily
as
he
got
out
!
Money
!
He
shook
his
head
again
--
a
little
grimly
this
time
.
He
had
been
caught
once
before
as
Larry
the
Bat
without
funds
!
There
was
plenty
of
money
now
hidden
in
the
Sanctuary
,
enough
for
any
emergency
,
enough
to
last
him
indefinitely
.
</p>
<p>
He
stepped
forward
along
the
hall
,
his
tread
noiseless
on
the
rich
,
heavy
rug
,
passed
into
the
rear
of
the
house
,
descended
the
back
stairs
,
and
reached
the
cellar
.
It
was
below
the
level
of
the
ground
,
of
course
;
but
a
narrow
window
here
,
though
quite
large
enough
to
permit
of
egress
,
gave
on
the
driveway
at
the
side
of
the
house
that
led
to
the
garage
in
the
rear
.
</p>
<p>
Cautiously
now
,
for
the
cement
flooring
was
,
in
the
stillness
,
little
less
than
a
sounding
board
,
Jimmie
Dale
reached
the
wall
and
felt
along
it
to
the
window
,
the
lower
edge
of
whose
sill
was
just
slightly
below
the
level
of
his
shoulder
.
It
opened
inward
,
if
he
remembered
correctly
.
His
fingers
were
feeling
for
the
fastenings
.
It
was
too
dark
to
see
a
thing
.
He
muttered
in
annoyance
.
Where
were
the
fastenings
!
At
the
sides
,
or
at
the
bottom
?
His
hand
began
to
make
a
circuit
of
the
sill
--
and
then
suddenly
,
with
a
low
,
sharp
cry
,
he
leaned
forward
!
