Wrapping/Covering
is
one
of
the
most
proficient
food
storage
techniques
most
widely
used
around
the
globe
.
This
method
is
suitable
for
travelers
who
cannot
carry
any
other
food
storage
with
them
.
The
main
thing
while
storing
food
is
to
preserve
the
moisture
in
the
food
without
letting
the
air
get
to
it
.
By
wrapping
the
food
,
you
can
hold
the
moisture
in
it
and
also
the
food
will
remain
fresh
for
an
extended
period
.
So
,
what
material
should
you
use
wrap
food
?
Well
,
there
are
many
food
wrappers
available
these
days
.
Aluminum
foil
is
the
best
material
to
wrap
and
store
food
while
traveling
.
If
you
wish
to
store
your
food
in
freezers
,
the
best
options
are
freezer
storage
bags
,
plastic
wraps
and
plastic
coated
freezer
paper
.

Freezing

Poultry

<item>
Poultry
and
meat
are
the
most
troublesome
ingredients
to
store
.
Cooked
meat
contains
more
content
of
moisture
than
the
raw
meat
,
so
it
is
important
to
preserve
the
moisture
.
For
storing
cooked
meat
and
poultry
in
a
freezer
,
the
best
technique
is
to
wrap
the
meat
tightly
in
a
plastic
wrapper/aluminum
foil
or
keep
it
in
a
plastic
box
.
Make
sure
to
debone
the
meat
and
keep
it
in
larger
pieces
before
wrapping
.
Also
,
you
should
ensure
that
the
air
cannot
get
into
the
food
.
After
wrapping
,
immediately
store
the
food
in
zero
degrees
Fahrenheit
.

You
can
freeze
almost
all
kinds
of
meat
.
People
sometimes
ask
whether
they
can
freeze
tenderized
meat
or
not
.
As
tenderizing
comes
into
effect
while
cooking
meat
,
it
can
be
frozen
.
However
,
you
cannot
store
or
freeze
canned
meat
because

•
Most
canned
foods
have
liquids
inside
them
,
and
seals
of
the
can
prone
to
breakage
while
you
freeze
it
.
•
Canned
items
are
covered
with
moisture
.
Hence
,
the
food
inside
a
can
is
already
stored
,
so
there
is
no
need
to
store
a
can
full
of
foods
.
You
can
keep
it
in
a
cool
place
,
on
your
shelf
or
in
the
refrigerator
in
a
normal
cooling
mode

One
common
issue
about
storing
the
food
is
freezing
time
.
Well
,
there
is
no
such
limit
regarding
how
long
you
should
store/
freeze
the
foods
in
a
refrigerator
.
But
due
to
dehydration
,
the
food
may
lose
somewhat
its
flavor
.
Wrapping
your
foods
well
can
keep
the
flavor
of
the
foods
for
a
long
time
.
If
you
wrap
the
food
well
it
may
remain
fresh
for
years
or
two
.

There
is
another
primary
objective
of
food
storage
and
it
is
to
preserve
the
nutrients
of
food
.
Hence
,
food
storage
addresses
to
the
requirement
very
well
.
While
you
freeze
the
food
,
it
does
not
lose
the
nutrients
.
Sometimes
,
the
food
only
loses
the
flavor
.
However
,
the
protein
content
of
meat
or
poultry
slightly
reduces
while
freezing
.
But
it
only
occurs
if
you
store
it
crossing
the
limited
time
of
9
months

Modern
day
pressure
cookers
are
like
hotpot
.
After
cooking
your
dish
,
you
can
also
store
it
in
a
pressure
cooker
.
If
you
cook
large
dishes
like
a
roast
with
vegetables

fish

meat
dishes
,
and
chicken
,
then
you
may

to

Freezer
Burns
is
the
process
where
the
surface
of
the
food
dries
off
in
a
while
freezing
.
In
case
you
forget
to
cover
your
food
before
storing
it
in
the
freezer
,
there
can
be
high
chances
of
freezer
burns
to
your
food
.
It
makes
food
dehydrated
,
and
the
dehydrated
spot
is
left
dry
,
tasteless
and
affects
the
quality
of
food
.
Freezer
burns
happen
because
insufficient
covering
allows
the
air
to
get
to
the
food
.
Leaked
plastic
bags
are
also
responsible
for
freezer
burn
.
Freezer
burns
leave
brownish
gray
spots
on
foods
,
and
the
food
becomes
dry
.
However
,
it
damages
the
food
to
an
extent
where
the
food
no
longer
remains
eatable
.
