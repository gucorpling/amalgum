Relevance

Ecological

</head>
<p>
Sustainable
conservation
and
management
of
wildlife
inside
and
outside
core
protected
areas
,
such
as
the
WMAs
in
Tanzania
,
is
largely
anchored
on
reliable
ecological
monitoring
data
.
In
Kenya
,
inadequate
ecological
management
of
the
conservation
areas
has
been
linked
with
deficiencies
in
ecological
information
,
ultimately
leading
to
loss
of
wildlife
.
The
researchers
call
for
serious
ecological
monitoring
of
multi-species
and
their
habitat
variables
.
This
has
an
implication
for
the
application
of
a
technologically
effective
and
efficient
ecological
monitoring
system
.
The
UAV
technology
,
as
the
newly
emerged
remote
sensing
aerial
platform
,
has
significant
potentials
for
sustainable
conservation
of
wildlife
in
the
community
wildlife
management
areas
.

The
WMAs
are
a
new
protected
area
category
in
Tanzania
formed
on
village
land
whereby
neighboring
villages
contribute
part
of
their
land
to
form
a
jointly
managed
WMA
.
The
establishment
strives
to
ensure
conservation
and
management
of
wildlife
,
biodiversity
,
and
habitats
on
community
lands
.
The
WMA
’s
concept
is
a
strategy
for
wildlife
conservation
outside
core
protected
areas
while
supporting
the
National
Strategy
for
Growth
and
Reduction
of
Poverty
of
2005
.
This
is
also
in
line
with
the
Communal
Areas
Management
Programme
for
Indigenous
Resources
(
CAMPFIRE
)
program
in
Zimbabwe
designed
to
tackle
environmental
problems
and
help
rural
communities
to
manage
their
resources
for
their
development
.
The
approach
was
based
on
the
rationale
that
many
wildlife
and
biodiversity
found
outside
core
protected
areas
face
many
threats
,
including
illegal
harvest
and
habitats
loss
,
particularly
buffer
zones
,
dispersal
areas
,
and
migratory
corridors
.
The
WMAs
,
thus
,
serve
as
strategic
buffers
,
dispersal
areas
,
and/or
migratory
corridors
for
the
wildlife
.
These
areas
are
jointly
managed
through
the
establishment
of
a
Community
Based
Organization
that
will
later
be
upgraded
to
Authorized
Association
(
AA
)
status
by
the
Ministry
of
Natural
Resources
and
Tourism
once
they
have
accomplished
all
the
requirements
stipulated
by
the
Wildlife
Management
Area
Regulations
of
2012
.

Despite
all
the
aforementioned
conservation
policy
efforts
to
establish
community
conservation
areas
,
problems
and
challenges
still
persist
on
their
ecological
monitoring
for
appropriate
actions
to
address
them
.
Ecological
monitoring
in
the
WMAs
is
especially
challenging
due
to
the
lack
of
a
quick
,
effective
,
and
technologically
user-friendly
monitoring
system
that
can
be
applied
by
both
researchers
and
locally-based
monitoring
teams
to
generate
useful
real-time
data
as
an
alternative
to
the
traditional
biodiversity
and
habitats
assessment
techniques
.
These
ecological
monitoring
gaps
form
the
basis
for
this
review
to
ascertain
how
much
ecologists
,
researchers
,
and
local
communities
can
rely
on
the
UAV
technology
for
ecological
monitoring
of
wildlife
and
habitats
in
the
community
conservation
areas
.
Inadequately
monitored
wildlife
corridors
and
dispersal
areas
,
including
those
embedded
in
the
community
WMAs
,
result
in
the
decline
of
wildlife
populations
.
</p>
<p>
Effective
monitoring
of
animals
and
their
habitats
detect
changes
that
are
taking
place
and
the
quality
of
biodiversity
,
informing
decision-makers
to
address
the
possible
causes
of
the
changes
.
Monitoring
is
the
information
system
that
deals
with
the
observation
,
estimation
,
and
forecast
of
changes
in
the
environment
,
created
to
allocate
the
anthropogenic
component
of
these
changes
on
the
background
of
natural
processes
.
It
is
the
“
process
of
repeated
observations
(
for
specific
purposes
)
of
one
or
more
elements
of
the
environment
according
to
pre-arranged
schedules
in
space
and
time
”
.
Monitoring
data
can
indicate
any
need
for
correction
of
the
management
strategies
towards
achieving
the
intended
objectives
.
Ultimately
,
such
data
is
useful
in
improving
conservation
and
management
practices
and
the
performance
evaluations
of
the
community
WMAs
.
