In
the
present
section
we
compute
the
relaxation
rate
of
the
1D
KLS
model
with
bulk-adapted
boundary
conditions
,
for
(
that
is
,
in
the
case
of
the
dashed
line
in
<figure>
Figure
1
</figure>
)
,
as
a
function
of
the
reservoir
densities
.
We
choose
this
particular
value
because
in
this
case
the
NESS
phase
diagram
,
reported
for
convenience
in
<figure>
Figure
2
</figure>
,
has
already
been
determined
in
Reference
by
means
of
extremal
current
principles
which
turn
out
to
be
exact
in
the
case
of
bulk-adapted
boundary
conditions
.
In
Reference
,
it
has
been
shown
indeed
that
,
as
far
as
the
NESS
is
concerned
,
this
case
exhibits
all
relevant
new
features
of
the
model
.
</p>
<p>
This
NESS
phase
diagram
exhibits
7
different
phases
and
a
symmetry
with
respect
to
the
diagonal
due
to
the
particle
–
hole
symmetry
of
the
model
.
In
the
portion
of
the
phase
diagram
corresponding
to
each
phase
we
report
an
identifier
of
the
phase
(
I
to
VII
)
and
the
value
of
the
bulk
density
.
This
is
indeed
a
quantity
which
characterizes
the
NESS
because
,
in
the
thermodynamical
limit
,
the
local
density
tends
to
the
bulk
density
over
the
whole
lattice
,
except
in
boundary
regions
whose
size
remains
finite
as
.
Phases
I
and
VI
are
LD
phases
,
whose
bulk
density
is
determined
by
the
left
reservoir
.
Symmetrically
,
phases
III
and
V
are
HD
phases
,
whose
bulk
density
is
determined
by
the
right
reservoir
.
In
addition
,
there
are
the
2
maximal
current
phases
II
and
VII
,
whose
bulk
densities
and
correspond
to
the
maxima
of
the
fundamental
diagram
along
the
dashed
line
in
<figure>
Figure
1
</figure>
,
and
the
minimal
current
phase
IV
,
whose
bulk
density
corresponds
to
a
minimum
in
the
fundamental
diagram
.
Among
the
various
NESS
transitions
separating
these
phases
,
it
is
important
to
observe
here
that
LD
and
HD
phases
are
always
separated
by
discontinuous
(
in
the
bulk
density
)
transitions
,
denoted
by
solid
lines
in
<figure>
Figure
2
</figure>
.
Exactly
at
these
transitions
,
the
2
phases
coexist
.
</p>
<p>
In
the
following
we
will
compute
the
relaxation
rate
,
using
the
PA
,
the
mDWT
and
extrapolation
of
finite
size
exact
results
,
in
the
HD
phases
.
The
corresponding
results
for
the
LD
phases
can
be
obtained
by
symmetry
,
and
vanishes
at
the
discontinuous
transitions
between
LD
and
HD
phases
.
In
the
maximal
and
minimal
current
phases
instead
the
relaxation
is
not
exponential
,
so
the
relaxation
rate
is
not
defined
.
More
precisely
,
the
relaxation
is
power-law
in
these
phases
,
and
the
relaxation
rate
vanishes
upon
approaching
these
phases
from
LD
or
HD
phases
.
</p>
<p>
We
will
be
especially
interested
in
singularities
in
the
relaxation
rate
,
representing
dynamical
transitions
,
which
separate
regions
where
depends
only
on
the
bulk
density
(
that
is
,
on
just
one
reservoir
density
)
from
regions
where
it
depends
on
both
reservoir
densities
.
In
order
to
exemplify
the
various
possible
transitions
,
we
shall
consider
three
cases
in
detail
,
corresponding
to
the
thin
solid
lines
in
<figure>
Figure
2
</figure>
,
that
is
(
HD
phase
V
)
,
0.98
(
HD
phase
V
)
and
0.45
(
HD
phase
III
)
.
</p>
<p>
Before
turning
to
a
detailed
analysis
,
let
us
anticipate
our
main
results
.
For
a
situation
similar
to
pure
TASEP
is
found
,
that
is
a
slow
phase
close
to
the
coexistence
line
,
separated
from
a
fast
phase
by
a
dynamical
transition
.
For
,
due
to
the
proximity
of
the
minimal
current
phase
,
new
features
appear
,
suggesting
the
possibility
of
a
new
dynamical
phase
and
additional
dynamical
transitions
.
Finally
,
for
,
we
clearly
find
2
slow
phases
close
to
the
coexistence
lines
.
According
to
the
PA
,
these
slow
phases
are
separated
by
2
dynamical
transitions
from
a
central
phase
which
is
a
TASEP-like
fast
phase
,
although
this
picture
is
not
fully
confirmed
by
BST
results
,
maybe
due
to
small
system
sizes
.
</p>
<p>
As
previously
mentioned
,
we
start
our
analysis
with
the
simplest
case
,
that
is
,
in
HD
phase
V.
The
relaxation
rate
as
a
function
of
is
reported
in
<figure>
Figure
3
</figure>
.
The
PA
results
(
black
lines
)
clearly
suggest
that
,
in
the
thermodynamical
limit
,
2
phases
can
be
distinguished
.
For
small
(
slow
phase
)
,
close
to
the
(
discontinuous
)
transition
with
the
LD
phase
VI
,
depends
on
,
starting
from
0
at
the
transition
and
then
increasing
.
Notice
that
in
this
phase
the
size
dependence
is
very
weak
,
in
particular
the
asymptotic
value
is
approached
with
an
exponential
decay
in
<hi rend="italic">
N
</hi>
.
For
large
(
fast
phase
)
,
becomes
independent
of
(
while
the
size
dependence
can
be
appreciated
,
the
approach
to
the
asymptotic
value
is
)
and
a
singularity
,
corresponding
to
a
dynamical
transition
,
can
be
clearly
identified
.
This
is
the
same
behaviour
observed
in
pure
TASEP
.
We
can
approximately
locate
the
dynamical
transition
by
extrapolating
,
using
the
BST
algorithm
with
,
the
relaxation
rate
in
the
fast
phase
for
and
by
looking
for
the
point
where
the
results
reaches
this
value
.
The
corresponding
estimate
of
the
transition
point
,
computed
for
,
will
be
reported
in
the
dynamical
phase
diagram
with
a
blue
line
.
