We
have
seen
the
construction
of
several
aggregates
of
tetrahedra
.
Each
of
these
structures
contains
tetrahedra
with
coincident
faces
,
offset
angularly
by
or
a
closely
related
angle
(
)
.
We
will
now
explore
some
of
the
interesting
features
of
these
structures
.
As
already
noted
,
it
is
interesting
that
appears
in
the
face
junctions
of
structures
generated
by
“
closing
”
gaps
between
tetrahedral
aggregates
.
It
is
additionally
interesting
that
when
this
angle
is
employed
in
the
construction
of
a
helical
chain
of
tetrahedra
,
a
periodic
structure
emerges
(
whereas
the
canonical
BC
helix
has
no
non-trivial
translational
or
rotational
symmetries
)
.
</p>
<p>
The
features
we
will
highlight
in
this
section
involve
the
reduction
of
the
overall
number
of
“
plane
classes
”
and
the
linear
displacements
between
facial
centers
in
a
face
function
.
Here
,
we
say
that
two
planes
belong
to
the
same
plane
class
if
and
only
if
their
normal
vectors
are
parallel
.
The
number
of
plane
classes
for
a
collection
of
tetrahedra
,
then
,
is
defined
as
the
number
of
distinct
plane
classes
comprising
the
collection
’s
two-dimensional
faces
.
By
rotating
tetrahedra
so
as
to
bring
faces
into
contact
(
as
in
Section
2.1
and
Section
2.2
)
,
or
rotating
tetrahedra
to
obtain
periodicity
(
as
in
Section
2.3
)
,
the
overall
number
of
plane
classes
for
an
aggregate
is
reduced
.
Clearly
,
as
the
values
of
,
,
and
are
such
that
they
bring
faces
of
adjacent
tetrahedra
into
contact
,
we
would
expect
to
see
a
reduction
in
the
number
of
plane
classes
in
the
corresponding
aggregations
of
tetrahedra
featured
in
Section
2.1
and
Section
2.2
.
It
is
interesting
,
however
,
that
rotation
of
the
tetrahedra
in
a
BC
helix
by
(
observed
in
the
face
junctions
of
<figure>
Figure
1
</figure>
c
,
<figure>
Figure
2
</figure>
c
and
<figure>
Figure
3
</figure>
c
)
obtains
a
reduction
from
an
arbitrarily
large
number
of
plane
classes
(
,
where
<hi rend="italic">
n
</hi>
is
the
number
of
tetrahedra
in
the
helix
)
to
relatively
small
numbers
:
9
plane
classes
in
the
case
of
the
3-BC
helix
,
10
plane
classes
in
the
case
of
the
5-BC
helix
.
Table
1
provides
the
numbers
of
plane
classes
for
the
tetrahedral
aggregates
described
in
Section
2
before
and
after
their
transformations
.
</p>
<p>
Finally
,
an
appealing
feature
is
observed
in
the
face
junction
projections
of
the
tetrahedral
aggregates
discussed
in
this
paper
.
<figure>
Figure
7
</figure>
provides
a
side-by-side
comparison
of
these
face
junctions
.
As
the
angular
displacement
between
tetrahedra
in
all
face
junctions
is
related
to
,
we
can
see
that
translation
of
a
tetrahedron
in
one
junction
can
produce
any
of
the
other
junctions
.
Let
the
displacement
between
tetrahedra
in
the
face
junction
of
5
tetrahedra
about
a
common
edge
be
denoted
by
,
where
<hi rend="italic">
a
</hi>
is
the
tetrahedron
edge
length
.
Starting
from
the
face
junction
of
a
3-
or
5-BC
helix
,
the
remaining
face
junctions
corresponding
to
20
tetrahedra
about
a
vertex
,
5
tetrahedra
about
an
edge
,
and
3
tetrahedra
about
an
edge
may
be
obtained
by
translating
a
tetrahedron
of
the
junction
by
,
,
and
,
respectively
.
