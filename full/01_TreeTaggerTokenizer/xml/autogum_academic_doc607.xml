Introduction
</head>
<p>
The
world
population
aged
over
65
years
has
increased
considerably
in
recent
years
.
Due
to
hormonal
changes
(
i.
e.
,
menopause
)
,
the
effect
of
ageing
in
women
is
resulting
in
chronic
diseases
,
functional
dependence
,
the
prevalence
of
sarcopenia
and
frailty
and
the
risk
of
falls
and
injuries
,
increasing
the
risk
of
hospitalization
and
mortality
.
This
generates
significant
economic
cost
for
health
systems
to
prevent
or
treat
age-related
chronic
diseases
and
dependency
situations
.
</p>
<p>
Recently
,
physical
exercise
has
become
relevant
for
the
maintenance
of
health
and
functional
ability
in
middle-aged
and
older
women
,
functional
ability
being
understood
as
the
capacity
to
carry
out
activities
of
daily
living
.
This
has
been
evidenced
in
recent
studies
indicating
that
maintaining
high
levels
of
strength
,
balance
,
gait
and
cardiorespiratory
fitness
are
the
main
objectives
for
the
optimal
achievement
of
the
basic
and
instrumental
daily
living
activities
for
middle-aged
and
older
women
,
as
well
as
to
delay
the
onset
of
sarcopenia
and
frailty
.
Similarly
,
physical
exercise
also
helps
maintain
healthy
body
mass
index
(
BMI
)
values
,
which
is
an
important
factor
in
their
relationship
to
chronic
diseases
that
cause
dependence
in
older
women
populations
.
</p>
<p>
For
these
reasons
,
governments
and
the
healthcare
system
are
implementing
physical
exercise
programmes
for
middle-aged
and
older
people
at
day
centres
.
As
the
training
sessions
are
usually
in
groups
,
circuit
training
is
one
of
the
most
common
types
of
training
.
Circuit
training
consists
of
performing
a
series
of
exercises
for
all
muscle
groups
,
allowing
strength
and
cardiorespiratory
fitness
to
be
influenced
simultaneously
.
Body
weight-based
circuit
training
can
be
considered
a
functional
training
method
because
they
are
based
on
the
imitation
of
daily
living
activities
in
which
only
body
weight
is
used
(
i.
e.
,
body
weight
squats
and
lunges
)
.
</p>
<p>
Some
research
involving
the
elderly
has
shown
that
moderate-intensity
circuit
training
(
MICT
)
has
positive
effects
on
strength
,
cardiorespiratory
fitness
,
balance
,
body
composition
and
quality
of
life
.
Furthermore
,
during
recent
years
a
new
type
of
training
called
high-intensity
interval
training
(
HIIT
)
has
been
included
as
an
alternative
method
of
training
in
healthy
people
and
as
part
of
the
treatment
of
pathologies
,
especially
in
cardiac
rehabilitation
programmes
.
HIIT
consists
of
intermittent
short
high-intensity
work
periods
(
85
–
100
%
of
maximal
oxygen
uptake
)
and
relative
rest
periods
.
Some
research
has
shown
strong
evidence
that
HIIT
is
an
effective
method
for
improving
maximal
oxygen
uptake
,
strength
,
cardiorespiratory
fitness
,
gait
and
body
composition
in
older
people
with
pathologies
.
In
fact
,
there
is
a
trend
that
indicates
that
health
indices
and
markers
are
more
favourable
after
HIIT
than
after
MICT
.
Otherwise
,
this
is
still
not
clear
regarding
other
functional
parameters
.
</p>
<p>
However
,
although
the
benefits
of
HIIT
are
known
,
there
is
little
evidence
on
including
HIIT
methodology
in
circuit
training
(
HIICT
)
in
healthy
middle-aged
and
older
women
.
In
this
sense
,
HIICT
is
an
alternative
form
of
training
for
improving
physical
condition
and
performance
in
daily
living
activities
due
to
integrated
multiplanar-based
movements
(
squatting
,
pulling
,
etc.
)
performed
at
maximal
speed
,
which
makes
it
very
functional
and
with
high
transfer
in
older
adults
.
</p>
<p>
For
these
reasons
,
the
main
objective
of
the
present
study
was
to
determine
what
type
of
training
(
HIICT
or
MICT
)
induces
greater
adaptations
in
the
functional
ability
and
BMI
of
middle-aged
and
older
women
.
Based
on
the
previous
research
,
our
hypothesis
was
that
HIICT
would
significantly
improve
the
strength
,
gait
,
cardiorespiratory
fitness
,
static
and
dynamic
balance
and
BMI
in
middle-aged
and
older
women
.
In
addition
,
it
was
hypothesized
that
HIICT
would
induce
greater
adaptations
in
these
variables
than
MICT
.
