Akwasi
Osei-Adjei
</ref>
is
Ghana
’s
foreign
minister
.
He
tells
<hi rend="italic">
VOA
</hi>
reporter
Peter
Clottey
that
President
Kufuor
is
concerned
about
the
tensions
in
Kenya
.
</p>
<p>
“
Basically
,
the
president
has
been
invited
to
Kenya
to
see
for
himself
the
situation
and
offer
advise
as
to
how
the
two
leaders
can
come
together
to
stop
what
is
happening
in
Kenya
.
As
you
know
,
people
are
being
killed
and
there
are
a
lot
of
disturbances
in
Kenya
and
Kenya
is
like
a
pillar
of
a
democratic
country
is
now
blowing
up
in
our
faces
.
And
I
do
n’t
think
it
is
for
any
African
country
to
stand
by
and
more
so
the
chair
of
the
AU
(
Africa
Union
)
to
sit
by
for
such
a
thing
to
happen
to
Kenya
.
He
(
president
Kufuor
)
is
going
there
to
offer
advice
,
”
Osei-Adjei
noted
.
</p>
<p>
He
reckoned
that
President
Kufuor
’s
expected
trip
would
yield
positive
results
that
would
help
alleviate
the
escalating
violence
in
Kenya
.
</p>
<p>
“
We
hope
so
.
He
(
President
Kufuor
)
would
n’t
move
from
Ghana
to
Kenya
not
expecting
to
make
a
difference
to
make
the
situation
calm
and
normal
.
You
know
so
that
is
what
we
expect
,
”
he
said
.
</p>
<p>
Osei-Adjei
denied
speculations
that
President
Kufuor
’s
mediation
efforts
could
possibly
worsen
the
situation
just
like
in
Zimbabwe
.
</p>
<p>
“
No
,
I
do
n’t
think
so
.
Zimbabwe
is
quite
a
different
issue
.
This
is
coming
out
as
a
result
of
elections
,
the
recent
elections
and
what
is
happening
that
we
have
to
be
there
to
ensure
that
the
two
leaders
can
sit
down
and
then
calm
the
situation
,
”
Osei-Adjei
pointed
out
.
</p>
<p>
He
said
President
Kibaki
invited
the
Ghanaian
president
to
help
solve
the
escalating
violence
,
which
is
blamed
on
the
controversy
surrounding
the
December
elections
.
</p>
<p>
“
Well
,
the
envoy
came
yesterday
to
brief
the
president
of
Ghana
and
at
the
same
time
the
chair
of
the
AU
the
situation
before
elections
,
during
elections
and
after
the
elections
.
Upon
this
then
he
also
added
the
President
(
Kibaki
)
has
also
asked
him
to
invite
the
president
of
Ghana
that
is
President
Kufuor
of
Ghana
to
be
there
to
help
calm
the
situation
.
This
is
what
was
said
yesterday
that
President
Kufuor
is
going
to
Kenya
to
talk
to
the
two
leadership
and
then
make
them
come
to
if
you
like
some
the
peace
pipe
so
that
things
in
Kenya
will
calm
down
so
that
of
course
the
necessary
things
could
be
done
,
and
then
ensure
that
people
go
about
their
normal
businesses
,

he
said
