Make
sure
that
your
dog
will
sleep
in
your
bed
.
Some
dogs
do
n't
like
to
sleep
with
their
owners
and
that
's
perfectly
fine
.
If
they
do
n't
want
then
just
let
it
go
for
a
while
and
maybe
try
again
later
.
Make
sure
that
you
do
n't
force
anything
.
If
your
dog
usually
sleeps
somewhere
that
that
is
not
your
bed
do
n't
be
surprised
if
your
dog
jumps
off
and
goes
back
there
in
the
middle
of
the
night
.
Make
sure
that
your
dog
can
easily
get
up
and
down
off
your
bed
or
you
will
get
very
tired
very
quickly
of
putting
them
up
there
every
time
.
Know
that
in
the
wild
,
dogs
tend
to
find
a
place
to
sleep
and
call
it
's
den
for
a
very
long
time
so
do
n't
be
surprised
if
your
dog
wants
to
stay
there
.
If
your
dog
is
having
trouble
try
moving
their
crate
,
pillow
or
whatever
else
they
sleep
on
into
your
room
for
a
while
so
they
get
used
to
sleeping
in
that
room
</item>
<item>
Have
a
couple
trial
nights
.
Have
a
couple
of
nights
where
you
try
to
sleep
with
your
dog
to
see
some
of
the
patterns
the
dogs
do
.
Do
they
like
to
sleep
at
the
top
of
the
bed
?
Do
they
move
or
bark
a
lot
in
their
sleep
?
Do
they
tend
to
lick
their
paws
or
pant
a
lot
before
going
to
sleep
?
Make
sure
that
you
pick
a
pretty
open
week
to
do
this
where
you
do
n't
have
to
worry
about
being
tired
the
next
day
if
your
dog
kept
you
up
all
night
.
</item>
<item>
Fix
any
patterns
that
you
do
n't
like
.
Now
you
need
to
fix
any
problem
that
you
come
across
.
If
your
dog
has
a
tendency
to
do
something
in
bed
that
you
do
n't
like
now
is
the
time
to
fix
it
.
If
your
dog
tends
to
sleep
somewhere
that
you
find
difficult
to
lay
down
comfortably
try
moving
them
to
your
preferred
spot
before
you
go
you
sleep
.
If
they
lick
their
paws
a
lot
,
pant
,
spin
in
circles
,
or
something
else
like
that
before
they
go
to
sleep
try
to
get
into
bed
earlier
so
they
can
do
that
before
you
need
to
sleep
.

And
you
are
done
!
Your
fluffy
friend
and
you
should
have
no
problem
sleeping
together

few

Having
a
nice
big
bed
helps
a
lot
.
I
used
to
sleep
with
my
two
dogs
on
a
twin
sized
mattress
and
it
did
n't
really
work
.
But
I
've
since
then
gotten
a
queen
and
it
is
much
better
.

If
your
dog
tends
to
be
a
blanket
hogger
get
them
another
blanket
that
they
can
sleep
on
so
you
can
have
yours
all
to
your
self
.
</item>
<item>
If
your
dog
is
keeping
you
up
because
they
keep
walking
around
and
moving
try
taking
them
for
a
walk
or
playing
fetch
before
bed
to
try
to
wear
them
out
.
</item>
<item>
Do
n't
be
afraid
to
move
them
if
they
are
laying
somewhere
or
doing
something
that
you
do
n't
like
.
It
does
n't
make
them
not
love
you
any
more
or
anything
so
just
do
it
and
get
it
over
with
and
then
you
will
be
much
more
comfortable
