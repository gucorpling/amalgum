<p>
Top

transitioning
for
some
transgender
men
,
and
as
such
it
is
important
to
prepare
.
Here
are
some
suggestions
for
how
to
prepare
for
top
surgery
,
both

and
emotionally
.

Know
if
this
is
right
for
you
.
If
you
feel
unsure
of
having
top
surgery
,
try
to
understand
why
you
feel
unsure
of
this
.
It
's
a
good
idea
to
talk
to
a
gender
therapist
or
a
trusted
friend
to
discuss
about
this
issue
.
You
<hi rend="italic">
must
</hi>
listen
to
yourself
.
You
have
to
listen
what
your
gut
instinct
is
telling
you
about
getting
the
top
surgery
.
There
are
plenty
of
trans
men
who
are
comfortable
with
having
breasts
.
Do
not
let
people
tell
you
what
's
best
for
you
.
Only
you
can
tell
yourself
what
's
right
for
you
.

Look
into
the
two
different
types
of
top
surgery
,
double
incision
vs.
keyhole
.
Keyhole
is
generally
only
an
option
for
people
with
smaller
breasts
.
</item>

Understand
.
Be
cautious
when
considering
surgery
.
It
can
take
several
months
for
your
scars
to
heal
,
although
they
will
be
considerably
less
noticeable
with
the
keyhole
procedure
.
Your
chest
may
not
end
up
looking
exactly
the
way
you
were
expecting
.
Some
trans/gender
non-conforming
people
feel
unhappy
with
their
chests
even
after
this
surgery
.
You
must
let
go
of
higher
expectations
you
have
about
your
chest
.
Getting
top
surgery
will
not
always
end
all
the
intense
dysphoria
you
have
,
though
it
does
for
some
people
.
Everyone
feels
differently
about
their
own
body
.
Decide
what
is
right
for
you
and
look
at
pictures
of
other
people
who
have
had
top
surgery
.
Consider
examples
you
consider
&quot;
good
&quot;
and
&quot;
bad
&quot;
and
decide
how
you
would
deal
with
it
if
your
result
was
not
what
you
had
hoped
for
.

Bring
things
you
may
need
when
your
recovering
from
surgery
.
After
the
procedure
,
you
will
have
to
limit
your
arm
movements
to
reduce
the
risk
of
pulling
a
stitch
out
or
injuring
yourself
.
Rearrange
furniture
and
other
items
in
your
house
beforehand
to
make
it
easier
for
you
to
reach
things
in
case
you
do
n't
have
somebody
to
assist
you
while
you
recover
.
Clothes
that
are
easy
to
put
on
and
remove
can
be
especially
helpful
for
you
.
Sweatpants
and
button-up/zip-up
shirts
and
hoodies
are
good
choices
.

Make
sure
you
are
healthy
.
This
is
an
important
part
of
any
pre-op
care
for
any
surgery
.
For
one
thing
,
it
is
important
to
make
sure
you
are
as
physically
fit
as
possible
.
If
you
do
not
exercise
regularly
,
try
starting
an
exercise
routine
.
Nutrition
is
also
very
important
-
try
to
ensure
that
you
're
eating
a
healthy
,
balanced
diet
with
lots
of
whole
grains
,
fresh
fruit
and
vegetables
.
If
you
smoke
,
it
is
a
good
idea
for
you
to
try
to
quit
.
Try
your
best
not
to
put
yourself
under
a
lot
of
stress
before
<hi rend="italic">
and
</hi>
after
you
have
the
top
surgery
.
Being
stressed
can
make
it
harder
for
you
to
heal
after
you
have
the
surgery
.

Contact
a
surgeon
and
discuss
the
operation
.
Try
to
select
a
reputable
surgeon
.
If
you
are
not
sure
which
surgeon
to
pick
,
you
can
ask
men
who
have
already
had
top
surgery
who
they
would
recommend
,
or
go
online
and
research
.
Transbucket
is
a
very
helpful
guide
.
It
's
important
to
ask
questions
to
your
surgeon
about
getting
surgery
.
You
might
be
given
suggestions
about
what
kind
of
top
surgery
you
should
have
;
depending
on
your
size
,
you
may
be
eligible
for
certain
types
.

Be
wary
of
any
surgeon
that
does
n't
require
a
letter
from
a
therapist
,
as
the
WPATH
standards
of
care
call
for
a
letter
.
Surgery
may
cost
about
$USD
6,000
to
10,000
and
is
n't
typically
covered
by
insurance
.

Prepare
for
the
big
day
.
If
you
're
anxious
,
talking
to
a
therapist
can
help
.
This
is
a
big
change
in
your
life
and
it
's
important
to
be
prepared
.
It
's
important
to
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Relax">
relax
</ref>
on
the
day
you
're
having
the
operation
.
Try
to
think
positive
.
The
risks
are
very
low
,
particularly
for
young
,
healthy
people
.
