Soil
microorganisms
,
one
of
the
most
active
components
in
the
forest-soil
ecosystem
,
play
a
critical
role
in
plant
functioning
,
improving
plant
health
,
the
cycling
of
nutrient
elements
(
C
,
N
,
P
,
and
S
)
,
the
maintenance
of
ecological
balance
,
soil
purification
,
and
bioremediation
.
Beneficial
rhizospheric
microorganisms
,
which
secrete
phytohormones
such
as
auxin
,
gibberellin
,
and
cytokinin
,
enhance
plant
growth
,
root
length
,
and
leaf
surface
area
,
xylem
function
,
photosynthesis
,
and
stress
resistance
.
In
addition
,
beneficial
rhizospheric
microorganisms
occupy
space
and
trophic
niches
by
competing
with
other
counterparts
and
improve
nutrient
uptake
,
plant
health
,
and
growth
by
establishing
interactions
with
the
plant
rhizosphere
.
In
the
present
study
,
NMDS
showed
that
there
is
no
difference
between
CK
and
SS
soil
bacterial
community
structure
,
but
other
sampling
showed
differences
during
May
and
other
months
.
At
the
phylum
level
,
Proteobacteria
,
Actinobacteria
,
and
Acidobacteria
were
common
dominant
species
in
CK
and
SS
soil
in
three
seasons
(
the
relative
abundance
&gt;
10
%
)
.
The
abundance
of
Proteobacteria
in
coniferous
forests
was
recorded
to
be
about
29.5
%
,
while
it
was
only
25
%
in
the
previous
report
.
The
relative
abundance
of
Actinobacteria
and
Acidobacteria
in
<hi rend="italic">
P.
thunbergii
Parl
</hi>
soil
has
been
reported
to
range
from
24
%
to
32
%
and
from
14
%
to
51
%
,
respectively
,
which
is
similar
to
our
findings
.
At
the
phylum
level
,
no
significant
difference
was
reported
in
this
study
.
However
,
of
the
19
significantly
different
bacterial
genera
,
six
were
classified
as
beneficial
rhizospheric
microorganisms
,
which
could
be
attributed
to
the
stability
of
soil
bacterial
community
structure
and
the
property
of
<hi rend="italic">
P.
sylvestris
</hi>
var.
<hi rend="italic">
mongolica
</hi>
sphaeropsis
blight
,
which
is
host-dependent
.
A
number
of
studies
(
national
as
well
as
international
)
have
explored
certain
important
measures
for
the
prevention
and
control
of
this
disease
,
such
as
the
selection
of
trees
suitable
for
the
environment
,
young
growth
tending
,
tending
felling
,
pruning
and
disposal
of
blighted
needles
,
twigs
,
and
cones
,
cleaning
stands
,
planting
mixed
stands
,
and
so
on
.
Moreover
,
the
growth
and
health
of
<hi rend="italic">
P.
sylvestris
</hi>
var.
<hi rend="italic">
mongolica
</hi>
can
be
enhanced
by
filtering
the
beneficial
rhizospheric
microorganisms
and
using
them
as
biological
fertilizers
.
At
the
same
time
,
these
also
help
to
reduce
the
use
of
chemical
pesticides
and
the
problems
associated
with
these
,
including
widespread
disease
,
polluted
soil
,
weakening
of
plants
,
etc.
.
<hi rend="italic">
Bacillus
</hi>
,
with
excellent
tolerance
to
leanness
,
heat
,
and
cold
and
the
ability
to
produce
phytohormone
(
auxin
)
could
improve
plant
stress
resistance
and
plant
growth
.
An
earlier
study
proved
that
<hi rend="italic">
Burkholderia
</hi>
and
<hi rend="italic">
Rhodococcus
</hi>
enhance
the
growth
and
health
of
<hi rend="italic">
P.
sylvestris
</hi>
var.
<hi rend="italic">
mongolica
</hi>
.
<hi rend="italic">
Bacillus
cereus
HB12
</hi>
and
<hi rend="italic">
HB59
</hi>
were
found
to
be
beneficial
for
pine
growth
and
disease
resistance
.
<hi rend="italic">
Acidothermus
</hi>
,
with
its
acid
resistance
,
helps
in
the
degradation
of
cellulose
,
hemicellulose
,
and
lignin
.
In
addition
,
<hi rend="italic">
A.
cellulolyticus
</hi>
degraded
soluble
soils
and
improved
plant
growth
and
biomass
by
secreting
endo-
and
exoglucanase
.
By
virtue
of
interactions
with
plant
rhizosphere
,
<hi rend="italic">
Rhizomicrobium
</hi>
produced
auxin
and
enhanced
plant
growth
,
simultaneously
promoting
plant
production
of
Î²-glucanase
and
protease
,
thereby
improved
anticoagulant
resistance
and
plant
health
.
Soil
nutrient
and
enzymatic
activity
were
enhanced
after
<hi rend="italic">
Rhizobium
</hi>
sp
.
was
inoculated
into
<hi rend="italic">
Cicer
arietinum
</hi>
Linn
,
which
subsequently
improved
plant
health
and
biomass
.
In
a
separate
study
,
<hi rend="italic">
Bradyrhizobium
japonicum
</hi>
also
improved
plant
and
root
growth
after
being
inoculated
into
<hi rend="italic">
Glycine
max
</hi>
.
Several
studies
have
reported
the
successful
isolation
of
mycorrhizal
fungi
,
<hi rend="italic">
Trichoderma
</hi>
,
dark
septate
endophytes
,
and
bacteria
in
the
Zhanggutai
area
.
In
the
present
study
,
we
successfully
isolated
mycorrhizal
fungi
,
bacteria
,
and
<hi rend="italic">
Trichoderma
</hi>
,
which
had
antagonistic
effect
on
Sphaeropsis
blight
and
wilt
disease
in
the
in
vitro
condition
;
afterward
,
the
inoculation
experiment
was
tested
with
annual
and
perennial
seedlings
of
<hi rend="italic">
P.
sylvestris
</hi>
var.
<hi rend="italic">
mongolica
</hi>
.
