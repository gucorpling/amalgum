<p>
Injury
rates
in
men
’s
elite
ice
hockey
are
higher
in
professional
leagues
such
as
the
Swedish
Elite
League
and
Finnish
National
League
than
college
hockey
.
This
may
be
due
to
the
differing
demands
as
professional
players
play
more
games
in
a
season
,
and
therefore
may
experience
more
overuse
injuries
.
It
may
also
be
due
to
the
athlete
exposure
estimation
(
player-game
hours
vs.
player-games
)
used
to
calculate
injury
rate
.
Style
of
play
and
hockey
rink
dimensions
are
additional
variables
that
may
influence
injury
rate
.
Overall
,
we
observed
the
trend
that
injury
rates
have
increased
over
time
in
professional
European
leagues
and
college
hockey
,
while
decreasing
in
men
’s
international
ice
hockey
.
</p>
<p>
We
observed
a
wide
range
of
injury
definitions
.
This
affects
both
the
reliability
and
comparability
of
injury
surveillance
research
.
There
is
currently
a
consensus-based
injury
definition
in
sports
such
as
soccer
and
rugby
;
however
,
there
is
no
consensus
injury
definition
in
ice
hockey
.
We
recommend
that
hockey
forms
a
consensus
injury
definition
as
this
will
resolve
an
important
issue
that
currently
impedes
hockey
injury
research
.
A
consistent
injury
definition
would
create
clarity
as
to
which
injury
is
considered
a
recordable
event
.
We
identified
the
International
Ice
Hockey
Federation
’s
(
IIHF
)
definition
of
injury
as
the
most
appropriate
as
it
only
captures
events
that
are
sufficiently
severe
that
they
influence
participation
in
practices
or
games
.
The
IIHF
’s
definition
describes
a
reportable
event
as
“
any
injury
sustained
in
a
practice
or
game
that
prevented
the
player
from
returning
to
the
same
practice
or
game
;
any
injury
sustained
in
a
practice
or
game
that
caused
the
player
to
miss
a
subsequent
practice
or
game
;
a
laceration
which
required
medical
attention
;
all
dental
injuries
;
all
concussions
;
all
fractures
”
.
Although
no
single
definition
suits
all
needs
,
the
time
loss
definition
is
the
most
common
and
easy
to
identify
.
It
is
considered
reliable
and
allows
for
the
comparison
of
data
between
teams
,
seasons
and
various
leagues
.
It
is
also
used
in
other
professional
sports
such
as
cricket
and
Australian
football
.
The
choice
of
definition
should
reflect
the
aims
and
goals
of
surveillance
.
With
its
consistency
,
ease
of
use
,
and
comparability
of
published
data
among
the
most
important
variables
,
we
feel
the
time-loss
definition
best
meets
the
needs
of
injury
surveillance
in
men
’s
elite
ice
hockey
.
However
,
like
all
definitions
there
are
limitations
in
choosing
this
metric
.
First
,
athletes
often
continue
to
compete
in
the
presence
of
injury
.
Delaying
treatment
may
lead
to
missed
injuries
.
Finally
,
the
threshold
for
time
loss
may
depend
on
the
time
of
season
and
how
important
the
player
is
to
team
success
.
Despite
these
drawbacks
,
we
feel
the
strengths
of
the
time-loss
definition
outweigh
its
limitations
and
that
the
IIHF
’s
time-loss
definition
is
warranted
in
elite
men
’s
ice
hockey
.
</p>
<p>
We
also
noted
that
athlete
exposure
estimations
were
inconsistent
in
the
literature
.
The
major
confusion
lies
in
how
many
participants
are
included
in
the
injury
rate
calculation
.
Several
researchers
used
player-game
exposure
based
on
the
entire
team
,
or
average
team
roster
(
19
players
)
,
while
others
used
player-game
hour
exposures
based
on
6
players
.
This
leads
to
difficulty
in
interpreting
injury
rates
and
comparing
research
.
It
was
proposed
that
the
gold
standard
in
athlete
exposure
during
games
is
time
on
ice
.
As
much
as
three
times
the
amount
of
exposure
was
accounted
for
by
estimating
exposure
rates
using
the
player-game
approximation
compared
to
time
on
ice
.
However
,
when
comparing
the
time
on
ice
metric
to
the
estimated
player
game-hour
metric
(
based
on
one
hour
per
game
,
rather
than
the
actual
amount
of
time
that
players
spent
on
ice
)
it
appears
that
this
difference
is
small
.
Therefore
,
the
simplest
and
easiest
way
to
calculate
athlete
exposure
is
to
use
six
players
on
the
ice
(
player-game
hours
)
unless
position
specific
injury
rate
information
is
warranted
.
Using
a
consistent
athlete
exposure
metric
will
increase
intra-
and
inter-league
injury
rate
reliability
.
</p>
<p>
The
majority
of
studies
reviewed
found
that
collision
with
other
players
is
the
leading
mechanism
of
injury
as
well
as
contact
with
the
boards
,
opponent
’s
hockey
sticks
and
hockey
pucks
.
This
leads
to
an
injury
paradox
:
the
goal
of
the
sports
performance
specialist
is
to
build
bigger
,
faster
,
stronger
,
leaner
,
more
powerful
,
robust
players
.
However
,
these
types
of
players
also
travel
faster
,
and
hit
harder
,
elevating
the
risk
of
injury
.
This
situation
emphasizes
the
need
for
accurate
injury
surveillance
methods
as
these
may
help
reinforce
rules
and/or
govern
the
addition
of
new
rules
enforcing
safety
for
active
players
.

Limitations
</head>
<p>
There
are
limitations
to
this
study
.
There
is
a
relative
paucity
of
studies
evaluating
injury
rates
in
men
’s
elite
ice
hockey
,
and
the
definitions
of
injury
and
athlete
exposures
vary
between
studies
.
Accordingly
,
the
reported
injury
rates
differ
between
studies
and
are
difficult
to
interpret
.
Two
databases
(
PubMed
and
SPORTDiscus
)
were
used
to
identify
research
papers
that
were
relevant
to
injury
definition
,
injury
rates
and
athlete
exposure
in
elite
ice
hockey
.
While
these
databases
are
an
excellent
source
for
research
articles
in
sports
,
life
sciences
and
biomedicine
,
supplemental
databases
may
have
identified
additional
research
studies
.
