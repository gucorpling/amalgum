Eat
Neatly
</head>
<p>
Eating
neatly
is
a
sign
that
you
care
about
the
appearance
you
are
presenting
at
the
table
and
that
you
appreciate
your
food
and
the
effort
that
someone
has
gone
to
in
putting
the
food
together
.
Unless
you
suffer
from
a
disease
or
you
are
under
the
age
of
12
years
old
,
you
should
be
able
to
overcome
messy
eating
habits
.

Steps

<item>
Use
your
silverware
properly
.
Except
for
some
foods
(
sandwiches
,
pizza
,
etc
;
)
you
have
to
use
your
fork
and
knife
.
If
you
are
at
a
fancy
restaurant
,
the
salad
fork
is
the
small
fork
and
the
larger
one
is
for
the
main
course
.
If
you
are
uncertain
of
these
utensils
,
just
watch
the
host
,
they
should
know
what
they
are
doing
.
If
you
are
eating
certain
foods
,
(
steak
,
etc
;
)
you
will
have
to
use
a
knife
.
Hold
the
fork
in
your
left
hand
and
the
knife
in
your
right
.

Eat
slowly
.
This
way
you
can
actually
have
have
a
conversation
with
the
person
you
are
eating
with
.
It
also
helps
you
to
digest
your
food
properly
,
which
makes
you
feel
more
full
,
so
you
eat
less
and
become
fitter
,

<item>
Stay
polite
throughout
the
meal
.
Do
n't
hog
the
conversation
,
chew
with
your
mouth
<hi rend="italic">
closed
</hi>
and
finally
,
do
n't
pick
at
your
food
.

Use
your
napkin
.
Always
keep
it
in
your
lap
,
and
if
somebody
tells
you
that
you
need
to
wipe
your
mouth
,
do
n't
get
mad
about
it
.
Just
say
,
&quot;
Thank
you
.
&quot;
When
you
eat
with
your
napkin
,
either
stuff
it
down
your
shirt
so
you
do
n't
get
it
on
yourself
or
put
it
on
your
lap
and
lean
more
closely
to
the
table
when
you
eat
.

<item>
When
you
're
full
,
stop
.
It
's
not
impolite
to
leave
food
on
your
plate
,
and
if
you
are
finished
you
could
just
save
it
and
warm
the
rest
up
for
your
supper
.
Eat
as
much
as
you
can
until
you
feel
full
,
but
there
is
an
easy
way
to
eat
it
all
.
Chew
it
into
tiny
pieces
and
take
smaller
amounts
and
also
after
every
three
mouthfuls
stop
for
a
bit
to
let
the
food
go
down
.
If
everyone
else
grabs
desert
,
and
you
're
not
hungry
,
do
n't
give
into
&quot;
Social
Snacking
.
&quot;
Instead
,
keep
drinking
water
in
between
chats
.

Turn
off
your
mobile
phone
.
However
tempting
it
may
be
to
send
a
text
to
everyone
about
your
new
pair
of
shoes
,
it
's
very
impolite
and
distracts
the
entire
dinner
party
.
</item>
<item>
When
eating
a
food
that
drips
or
has
crumbs
,
bring
your
plate
closer
to
the
edge
of
the
table
or
your
mouth
closer
to
the
plate
.
This
allows
your
plate
to
catch
any
drips
or
crumbs
and
avoids
a
mess
.
</item>
<item>
Keep
your
posture
from
slouching
because
it
kind
of
is
impolite
.
