<p>
In
the
research
,
we
look
at
two
different
forms
of
gendered
in-work
poverty
:
(

Female
working
poor
in
a
highly
industrialized
society
—
Belgium
.
As
one
of
the
earliest
countries
to
be
industrialized
on
the
continent
of
Europe
,
Belgium
is
a
classical
case
,
which
went
through
the
Industrial
Revolution
in
the
1830s
.
Nowadays
,
Belgium
is
a
developed
country
with
an
advanced
high-income
economy
and
relatively
well-integrated
social
security
system
.
In
this
Western
European
society
,
workers
have
experienced
significant
structural
changes
in
the
economic
framework
,
e.
g.
,
the
progressive
process
of
agricultural
decline
and
a
knowledge-based
service
sector
development
.
These
features
contribute
to
promote
women
’s
participation
in
employment
,
but
many
women
have
low-quality
jobs
and
face
work-family
conflicts
.
With
this
background
,
the
gendered
in-work
poverty
mirrors
a
series
of
industrial
(
or
postindustrial
)
problems
in
a
highly
developed
economy
.

Female
working
poor
in
a
developing
country
under
social
transition
and
rapid
economic
development
—
China
.
The
Western
mainstream
discourse
has
accumulated
rich
materials
for
exploring
the
in-work
poverty
issue
and
has
provided
a
reference
for
further
research
in
this
field
.
However
,
this
conceptualization
does
not
include
female
in-work
poverty
in
the
Chinese
specific
context
.
Different
from
Western
society
,
China
is
a
big
developing
oriental
nation
based
on
a
long
history
of
self-sufficient
peasant
economy
;
furthermore
,
with
thousands
of
years
of
civilization
history
,
China
has
cultivated
its
own
strong
system
of
compound
culture
and
formed
its
atypical
Eastern
culture
.
In
a
developing
country
with
the
transition
from
an
agricultural
to
an
industrial
society
,
many
social
problems
are
overlapping
with
ambiguous
boundaries
.
In
this
context
,
the
issue
of
female
working
poverty
seems
both
more
complicated
and
more
challenging
.
It
thus
shows
a
specific
profile
of
this
kind
of
in-work
poverty
with
its
over-represented
rural
features
;
it
reflects
the
issues
socioeconomically
related
to
both
agricultural
and
industrial
stages
.

Two
Distinct
Types
According
to
a
Society
’s
Level

Pluralistic
Modernity

<p>
The
selection
in
Belgium
and
China
is
also
a
reflection
of
two
spatial
logics
in
the
spread
of
poverty
(
and
even
misery
)
placed
at
the
same
time
.
One
is
the
female
in-work
poverty
in
full
urbanization
.
After
having
experienced
rapid
industrialization
and
urbanization
,
by
1870
,
most
Belgians
lived
in
cities
and
depended
directly
on
industry
or
trade
.
Belgium
has
ancient
industrial
traditions
with
a
large
number
of
developed
professional
guilds
and
with
social
mutual
assistance
(
or
solidarity
)
as
the
core
of
a
social
spirit
,
which
constitutes
the
foundation
of
Belgium
’s
well-developed
social
security
in
which
people
achieve
quite
high
standards
of
living
,
life
quality
,
and
healthcare
.
On
this
basis
,
female
working
poverty
reveals
the
severity
of
increasing
social
differentiation
in
the
labor
market
and
social
welfare
;
this
is
our
first
form
of
in-work
poverty
.
The
other
is
the
rural
female
poverty
type
in
a
“
contradictory
compressed
modernization
”
in
which
both
agricultural
and
industrial
societies
coexist
.
Indeed
,
despite
the
dramatic
economic
growth
,
the
socioeconomic
transformation
is
still
in
the
process
.
China
is
an
ancient
agricultural
country
with
a
long
history
of
land
development
and
utilization
.
Land
remains
the
core
to
understand
the
nature
of
Chinese
social
structure
,
and
the
Chinese
social
relationships
based
on
this
continue
to
shape
the
specificity
of
this
type
of
female
in-work
poverty
.
