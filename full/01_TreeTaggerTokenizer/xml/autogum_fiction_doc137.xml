MY
COUSIN
FANNY
</head>
<p>
We
do
not
keep
Christmas
now
as
we
used
to
do
in
old
Hanover
.
We
have
not
time
for
it
,
and
it
does
not
seem
like
the
same
thing
.
Christmas
,
however
,
always
brings
up
to
me
my
cousin
Fanny
;
I
suppose
because
she
always
was
so
foolish
about
Christmas
.
</p>
<p>
My
cousin
Fanny
was
an
old
maid
;
indeed
,
to
follow
St.
Paul
’s
turn
of
phrase
,
she
was
an
old
maid
of
the
old
maids
.
No
one
who
saw
her
a
moment
could
have
doubted
it
.
Old
maids
have
from
most
people
a
feeling
rather
akin
to
pity
--
a
hard
heritage
.
They
very
often
have
this
feeling
from
the
young
.
This
must
be
the
hardest
part
of
all
--
to
see
around
them
friends
,
each
“
a
happy
mother
of
children
,
”
little
ones
responding
to
affection
with
the
sweet
caresses
of
childhood
,
whilst
any
advances
that
they
,
their
aunts
or
cousins
,
may
make
are
met
with
indifference
or
condescension
.
My
cousin
Fanny
was
no
exception
.
She
was
as
proud
as
Lucifer
;
yet
she
went
through
life
--
the
part
that
I
knew
of
--
bearing
the
pity
of
the
great
majority
of
the
people
who
knew
her
.
</p>
<p>
She
lived
at
an
old
place
called
“
Woodside
”
,
which
had
been
in
the
family
for
a
great
many
years
;
indeed
,
ever
since
before
the
Revolution
.
The
neighborhood
dated
back
to
the
time
of
the
colony
,
and
Woodside
was
one
of
the
old
places
.
My
cousin
Fanny
’s
grandmother
had
stood
in
the
door
of
her
chamber
with
her
large
scissors
in
her
hand
,
and
defied
Tarleton
’s
red-coated
troopers
to
touch
the
basket
of
old
communion-plate
which
she
had
hung
on
her
arm
.
</p>
<p>
The
house
was
a
large
brick
edifice
,
with
a
pyramidal
roof
,
covered
with
moss
,
small
windows
,
porticos
with
pillars
somewhat
out
of
repair
,
a
big
,
high
hall
,
and
a
staircase
wide
enough
to
drive
a
gig
up
it
if
it
could
have
turned
the
corners
.
A
grove
of
great
forest
oaks
and
poplars
densely
shaded
it
,
and
made
it
look
rather
gloomy
;
and
the
garden
,
with
the
old
graveyard
covered
with
periwinkle
at
one
end
,
was
almost
in
front
,
while
the
side
of
the
wood
--
a
primeval
forest
,
from
which
the
place
took
its
name
--
came
up
so
close
as
to
form
a
strong
,
dark
background
.
During
the
war
the
place
,
like
most
others
in
that
neighborhood
,
suffered
greatly
,
and
only
a
sudden
exhibition
of
spirit
on
Cousin
Fanny
’s
part
saved
it
from
a
worse
fate
.
After
the
war
it
went
down
;
the
fields
were
poor
,
and
grew
up
in
briers
and
sassafras
,
and
the
house
was
too
large
and
out
of
repair
to
keep
from
decay
,
the
ownership
of
it
being
divided
between
Cousin
Fanny
and
other
members
of
the
family
.
Cousin
Fanny
had
no
means
whatever
,
so
that
it
soon
was
in
a
bad
condition
.
The
rest
of
the
family
,
as
they
grew
up
,
went
off
,
compelled
by
necessity
to
seek
some
means
of
livelihood
,
and
would
have
taken
Cousin
Fanny
too
if
she
would
have
gone
;
but
she
would
not
go
.
They
did
all
they
could
for
her
,
but
she
preferred
to
hang
around
the
old
place
,
and
to
do
what
she
could
with
her
“
mammy
”
,
and
“
old
Stephen
”
,
her
mammy
’s
husband
,
who
alone
remained
in
the
quarters
.
She
lived
in
a
part
of
the
house
,
locking
up
the
rest
,
and
from
time
to
time
visited
among
her
friends
and
relatives
,
who
always
received
her
hospitably
.
She
had
an
old
piece
of
a
mare
(
which
I
think
she
had
bought
from
Stephen
)
,
with
one
eye
,
three
legs
,
and
no
mane
or
tail
to
speak
of
,
and
on
which
she
lavished
,
without
the
least
perceptible
result
,
care
enough
to
have
kept
a
stable
in
condition
.
In
a
freak
of
humor
she
named
this
animal
“
Fashion
”
,
after
a
noted
racer
of
the
old
times
,
which
had
been
raised
in
the
county
,
and
had
beaten
the
famous
Boston
in
a
great
race
.
She
always
spoke
of
“
Fash
”
with
a
tone
of
real
tenderness
in
her
voice
,
and
looked
after
her
,
and
discussed
her
ailments
,
which
were
always
numerous
,
as
if
she
had
been
a
delicate
child
.
Mounted
on
this
beast
,
with
her
bags
and
bundles
,
and
shawls
and
umbrella
,
and
a
long
stick
or
pole
,
she
used
occasionally
to
make
the
tour
of
the
neighborhood
,
and
was
always
really
welcomed
;
because
,
notwithstanding
the
trouble
she
gave
,
she
always
stirred
things
up
.
As
was
said
once
,
you
could
no
more
have
remained
dull
where
she
was
than
you
could
have
dozed
with
a
chinkapin-burr
down
your
back
.
Her
retort
was
that
a
chinkapin-burr
might
be
used
to
rouse
people
from
a
lethargy
(
she
had
an
old
maid
’s
tongue
)
.
By
the
younger
members
of
the
family
she
was
always
welcomed
,
because
she
furnished
so
much
fun
.
She
nearly
always
fetched
some
little
thing
to
her
host
--
not
her
hostess
--
a
fowl
,
or
a
pat
of
butter
from
her
one
old
cow
,
or
something
of
the
kind
,
because
,
she
said
,
“
Abigail
had
established
the
precedent
,
and
she
was
‘
a
woman
of
good
understanding’
--
she
understood
that
feeding
and
flattery
were
the
way
to
win
men
.
”
She
would
sometimes
have
a
chicken
in
a
basket
hung
on
the
off
pummel
of
her
old
saddle
,
because
at
times
she
fancied
she
could
not
eat
anything
but
chicken
soup
,
and
she
did
“
not
wish
to
give
trouble
.
”
She
used
to
give
trouble
enough
;
for
it
generally
turned
out
that
she
had
heard
some
one
was
sick
in
the
neighborhood
,
and
she
wanted
the
soup
carried
to
her
.
I
remember
how
mad
Joe
got
because
she
made
him
go
with
her
to
carry
a
bucket
of
soup
to
old
Mrs.
Ronquist
.
