Microchip
Your
Dog
</head>
<p>
Microchipping
is
a
technology
used
to
locate
your
dog
if
she
ever
gets
lost
or
is
stolen
.
Collars
and
tags
can
be
helpful
when
you
need
to
find
a
missing
dog
,
but
there
's
always
the
chance
that
they
could
fall
off
.
Microchips
,
on
the
other
hand
,
are
placed
just
under
your
dog
's
skin
,
so
they
're
a
more
reliable
and
permanent
form
of
ID
.
If
your
dog
's
collar
comes
off
,
a
microchip
is
the
perfect
backup
option
,
ensuring
that
you
and
your
dog
will
be
reunited
much
sooner
.

Bathe
your
dog
.
Before
you
get
your
dog
microchipped
,
she
needs
to
be
clean
.
This
is
so
the
injection
site
is
nice
and
clean
when
the
vet
injects
the
microchip
into
your
dog
.

Refrain
from
microchipping
your
dog
yourself
.
You
should
not
inject
your
dog
with
a
microchip
at
home
.
It
is
illegal
in
many
states
to
implant
your
dog
yourself
and
you
can
have
legal
action
brought
against
you
.

Even
if
you
are
able
to
buy
a
microchip
from
a
third
part
source
,
do
not
implant
the
chip
yourself
.

Take
your
dog
to
the
vet
.
Microchips
should
always
be
injected
by
a
qualified
medical
professional
.
It
is
much
safer
for
your
dog
because
your
vet
knows
exactly
where
the
microchip
should
be
placed
,
how
much
pressure
should
be
used
,
and
what
to
look
for
in
the
rare
chance
there
is
any
reaction
to
the
microchip
.

Fill
out
the
paperwork
.
When
you
are
having
your
dog
microchipped
,
you
need
to
fill
out
the
paperwork
that
comes
with
the
microchip
so
the
microchip
is
registered
.
The
information
that
you
list
on
these
forms
is
how
your
dog
will
be
returned
to
you
if
she
is
ever
lost
or
recovered
.
Your
vet
will
then
send
off
the
paperwork
to
the
manufacturer
's
database
for
you
.
<figure rend="Microchip Your Dog Step 4.jpg">

There
is
a

the
paperwork

Make
a
copy
of
this
paperwork
if
your
vet
does
n't
offer
you
one
.
This
will

that
you
have
all

microchip

Check
the
microchip
's
ID
number
.
Before
your
vet
injects
the
microchip
,
she
will
place
the
microchip
reader
over
the
needle
with
the
microchip
in
it
to
make
sure
it
reads
clearly
and
emits
the
right
unique
ID
number

Have
the
nurse
hold
your
dog
still
.
Your
vet
can
perform
the
microchip
injection
in
the
normal
exam
room
.
She
will
require
the
assistance
of
a
nurse
to
help
her
with
the
injection
.
The
nurse
will
gently
hold
your
dog
steady
by
placing
one
arm
beneath
your
dog
's
body
and
gently
place
the
crook
of
his
arm
under
her
neck
.

<item>
Have
the
vet
inject
the
microchip
.
Once
the
nurse
has
your
dog
secure
,
your
vet
can
locate
the
place
between
your
dog
's
shoulder
blades
where
the
chip
will
be
implanted
.
You
vet
will
gently
pull
up
the
skin
in
this
area
and
she
will
implant
the
microchip
,
about
the
size
of
a
grain
of
rice
,
directly
under
the
skin
with
the
applicator
.

Recheck

recheck
the
chip
to
make
sure
it
is
still

now
that
it

in
your
dog
's
skin

Once

reads
the

your
dog
is
ready
to
go

Learn
why
you
should
microchip
.
Microchips
greatly
increase
your
chances
of
having
your
dog
returned
to
you
if
she
is
lost
.
Collars
and
other
identifying
tags
can
fall
off
,
but
microchips
never
leave
your
dog
once
they
are
implanted
.

Understand
how
a
microchip
works
.
A
microchip
is
a
device
that
emits
radio
waves
at
a
certain
frequency
.
There
are
typically
three
different
frequencies
that
a
chip
may
emit
at
,
but
there
are
universal
readers
that
will
read
all
three
frequencies
.
When
the
frequency
is
read
,
the
reader
will
display
the
unique
ID
number
attached
to
your
paperwork
as
well
as
the
manufacturer
of
the
chip
.
This
will
tell
them
which
database
to
contact
in
order
to
find
your
information
.
<figure rend="Microchip Your Dog Step 11.jpg">

The
chip
itself
does
not
contain
your
contact
information
.
It
just
has
your
unique
ID
,
which
is
used
to
access
your
paperwork

Know
how
long
microchips
last
.
Microchips
do
not
run
on
power
.
They
simply
reflect
a
signal
back
to
the
scanner
.
Once
your
dog
has
been
implanted
with
a
microchip
,
it
will
last
for
her
whole
life
.

Learn
how
much
microchips
cost
.
Most
vets
charge
between
$
25
to
$
50
for
the
implantation
of
a
microchip
.
This
will
vary
depending
on
your
vet
.

Be
aware
that
it
does
n't
affect
your
dog
's
health
.
Microchipping
has
a
very
minimal
chance
of
any
side
effects
.
There
is
only
a
small
pain
felt
when
the
microchip
is
injected
,
similar
to
that
of
any
shot
.
Your
dog
may
react
to
this
a
little
bit
,
but
it
will
only
sting
for
a
few
moments
.
<figure rend="Microchip Your Dog Step 14.jpg">

<list type="unordered">
<item>
If
your
dog
is
smaller
,
there
may
be
a
little
more
pain
at
the
moment
of
injection
because
she
is
has
less
padding
.
</item>
<item>
No
surgery
or
anesthesia
is
required
to
implant
the
microchip
.
However
,
many
owners
opt
to
have
the
microchip
implanted
at
the
same
time
she
is
spayed
(
or
neutered
if
male
)
so
she
gets
both
procedures
handled
at
one
time
.
</item>
<item>
There
have
been
a
few
documented
cases
of
extreme
side
effects
,
such
as
microchip
migration
that
leads
to
abscesses
or
,
in
one
case
,
death
,
but
these
are
very
rare
.
