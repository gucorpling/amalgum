Identify
Cold
Spots
in
Your
Fridge
</head>
<p>
Cold
spots
in
your
refrigerator
can
ruin
some
foods
or
add
on
unnecessary
thaw
time
to
your
meal
preparation
.
This
is
a
common
problem
with
refrigerators
.
But
by
identifying
cold
spots
in
your
fridge
,
you
can
avoid
them
and
the
unwanted
freezing
they
cause
.
You
can
find
cold
spots
through
trial
and
error
,
or
you
can
more
accurately
locate
them
with
a
thermometer
.
Once
you
know
where
they
are
,
you
can
troubleshoot
the
problem
until
it
's
fixed
.

Gather
a
notebook
and
writing
utensil
.
The
main
problem
with
cold
spots
is
that
they
're
invisible
,
which
makes
them
easy
to
forget
.
Having
a
notebook
and
writing
utensil
handy
in
the
kitchen
will
give
you
the
opportunity
to
make
a
log
of
freezing
.

You
might
find
it
even
easier
to
remember
this
if
you
use
a
magnetic
pen/notepad
.
This
way
,
when
you
look
at
the
fridge
,
you
'll
be
reminded
about
cold
spots
.

Your
fridge
may
have
a
few
cold
spots
.
To
hone
in
on
the
location
of
these
,
you
may
want
to
draw
a
simple
diagram
of
the
shelves
of
your
fridge
and
mark
potential
cold
spots
.

Track
the
location
of
frozen
food
in
your
fridge
.
Location
is
the
key
element
you
'll
need
to
track
to
find
cold
spots
.
The
location
of
cold
spots
is
usually
consistent
,
so
by
tracking
frozen
food
in
your
notebook
,
you
'll
be
identifying
cold
spots
.
<figure rend="Identify Cold Spots in Your Fridge Step 2.jpg">

You
should
observe
freezing
in
your
fridge
for
two
weeks
for
the
most
accurate
cold
spot
identification
.
</item>
<item>
Various
factors
,
including
the
amount
of
food
in
your
fridge
,
can
influence
freezing
and
give
you
false
results
.
More
observations
will
provide
more
reliable
data
.
</item>

<item>
Chart
your
observations
to
find
cold
spots
.
Now
that
you
have
a
log
of
where
food
freezes
in
your
fridge
,
you
should
be
able
to
easily
determine
cold
spots
.
Areas
where
food
has
consistently
frozen
are
where
you
have
cold
spots
in
your
fridge
.

Even
after
finding
the
cold
spots
in
your
fridge
,
you
might
still
forget
where
they
are
located
from
time
to
time
.
Mark
these
spots
with
a
visible
piece
of
tape
,
like
a
colored
piece
of
painters

Using

</head>

<item>
Select
a
suitable
thermometer
.
A
regular
thermometer
should
work
for
this
method
of
finding
cold
spots
,
but
a
higher
quality
one
will
give
the
most
accurate
reading
.
Being
able
to
clearly
differentiate
between
temperatures
will
make
it
easier
to
pinpoint
cold
spots
.

Avoid
touching
the
temperature
gauge
of
your
thermometer
with
your
hands
or
fingers
.
Oil
and
heat
from
your
hands
can
influence
the
temperature
reading

Fill
multiple
glasses
with
equal
amounts
of
water
.
Use
the
same
kind
of
glass
for
each
one
.
Different
glasses
may
cool
down
more
or
less
easily
and
ruin
your
results
.
The
amount
of
water
in
each
glass
should
also
be
equal
.
Larger
amounts
of
water
cool
less
quickly
than
smaller
amounts
.
<figure rend="Identify Cold Spots in Your Fridge Step 5.jpg">

Fill
enough
glasses
so
that
each
shelf
has
at
least
one
in
each
corner
of
the
shelf
and
another
glass
in
the
middle
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Insert
the
glasses
in
your
fridge
and
wait
.
Generally
,
one
glass
per
shelf
corner
and
one
in
the
middle
of
each
shelf
should
be
sufficient
for
identifying
cold
spots
.
You
may
have
to
rearrange
items
in
your
fridge
to
fit
the
glasses
.
Once
the
water
is
inside
,
wait
for
approximately
one
hour
.

You
can
create
a
more
precise
temperature
map
of
your
fridge
with
more

Arrange
the
glasses
around
the

of
shelves

across
the

of
the
shelves
,
left

front

Take
the
temperature
of
each
glass
of
water
.
Once
the
time
is
up
,
take
your
thermometer
and
use
it
to
check
the
temperature
of
each
glass
of
water
.
Some
glasses
will
be
colder
than
others
.
These
colder
glasses
are
where
the
cold
spots
are

Position
temperature
sensitive
food
away
from
vents
.
Food
directly
beneath
cooling
vents
will
receive
the
brunt
of
the
cold
,
which
may
cause
freezing
.
In
most
cases
,
you
can
find
the
cold
air
vent
above
or
to
the
side
of
the
top
shelf
.
<figure rend="Identify Cold Spots in Your Fridge Step 8.jpg">

<list type="unordered">
<item>
Many
of
these
vents
will
have
a
slatted
or
narrow
opening
through
which
the
cold
air
passes
.
</item>
<item>
If
you
have
difficulty
identifying
the
cold
air
vent
in
your
refrigerator
,
open
the
door
and
feel
around
potential
vent
areas
with
your
hand
.
If
you
feel
cold
air
being
emitted
,
you
've
likely
found
the
vent

Investigate
the
freezer
settings
.
Your
freezer
can
influence
the
coldness
of
your
refrigerator
,
especially
for
refrigerator
models
with
a
freezer
at
the
bottom
.
By
raising
the
temperature
of
your
freezer
,
you
could
solve
your
cold
spot
problem
.

Be
sure
not
to
raise
the
temperature
of
your
freezer
above
freezing
(
32°F/0°C

This
can

Add
food
to
your
refrigerator
.
The
food
in
your
refrigerator
acts
like
a
sponge
for
the
cold
air
.
The
more
food
you
have
in
it
,
the
more
evenly
distributed
the
cold
air
will
be
.
Keeping
your
refrigerator
more
fully
stocked
could
be
a
simple
solution
to
your
fridge
's
cold
spots

This
is
especially
true
for
the
bottom
