The
community
readiness
model
aims
to
assess
how
ready
a
community
is
for
change
to
occur
;
this
group
of
highly
engaged
participants
provides
insight
into
overall
community
readiness
.
This
is
because
the
readiness
for
change
in
this
group
of
early
adopters
will
necessarily
be
higher
than
the
overall
community
due
to
their
previous
engagement
;
thus
,
their
views
can
inform
prevention
efforts
at
all
levels
of
the
community
.
Focus
group
participants
who
were
further
from
the
locus
of
planning
around
prevention
efforts
tended
to
align
more
closely
with
the
lower
ends
of
community
readiness
.
Participants
acknowledged
FV
as
a
serious
problem
and
as
common
in
the
community
,
but
in
terms
of
conscious
change
,
only
a
few
had
a
comprehensive
knowledge
of
prevention
theory
and
efforts
to
address
it
.
In
these
early
stages
,
leaders
and
community
members
believe
that
FV
is
an
issue
for
the
community
,
but
there
is
no
immediate
intent
to
act
,
and
the
decisional
balance
is
tipped
towards
the
negatives
.
This
tilted
decisional
balance
is
seen
in
the
plethora
of
perceived
barriers
to
implementation
that
were
mentioned
in
the
focus
groups
,
such
as
organizations
being
too
small/too
big
,
having
too
much
hierarchy
,
an
inability
to
make
policy
changes
,
not
enough
time
,
external
management
,
difficulties
in
understanding
the
prevention
efforts
,
worries
about
backlash
,
macho
workplace
values
,
and
a
lack
of
workplace
buy-in
.
Of
note
,
Kelly
and
colleagues
have
stated
that
identifying
barriers
is
an
important
stage
in
that
it
indicates
thinking
about
the
need
to
raise
awareness
and
develop
concrete
ideas
to
address
the
problem
.
</p>
<p>
Certain
key
organizational
stakeholders
were
more
progressed
,
at
or
beyond
the
planning
phase
,
recognizing
a
strong
impetus
for
change
but
impeded
by
limited
resources
and
without
detailed
and
focused
plans
or
efforts
to
address
FV
.
Participants
understood
the
difficulty
of
the
task
and
many
of
the
specific
challenges
.
They
also
had
important
suggestions
around
strategy
implementation
and
evaluation
,
including
increasing
the
participation
of
men
,
reducing
silence
and
shame
about
the
subject
of
FV
,
and
bringing
the
experiences
of
victim/survivors
and
perpetrators
into
the
conversation
.
</p>
<p>
Overall
,
community
attitudes
in
this
subpopulation
are
positive
and
pro-change
,
but
the
knowledge
of
causal
pathways
of
FV
is
lacking
.
While
all
participants
agreed
that
FV
is
a
problem
in
the
community
,
many
do
not
see
gender
inequality
as
the
main
driver
of
FV
.
Participants
often
had
trouble
understanding
what
a
community
that
prevents
FV
would
look
like
due
to
a
lack
of
knowledge
about
what
primary
prevention
entails
.
Participants
were
clear
about
‘
changing
the
conversation
’
as
a
metaphor
for
preventing
FV
,
and
they
had
suggestions
about
who
should
be
involved
,
what
‘
the
conversation
’
should
include
and
how
prevention
efforts
could
be
evaluated
.
However
,
the
conceptual
link
between
increasing
gender
equality
and
preventing
FV
is
not
well
understood
,
possibly
due
to
the
CRE
Plan
’s
lack
of
focus
on
this
driver
of
FV
.
Continued
education
at
all
levels
of
the
community
is
necessary
to
help
service
providers
and
leaders
conceptualize
what
prevention
would
look
like
,
to
engage
community
members
in
a
conversation
that
takes
FV
beyond
the
simplistic
victim/perpetrator
dichotomy
,
and
to
change
the
story
for
regional
women
.
</p>
<p>
The
most
common
misunderstanding
around
the
primary
cause
of
FV
revolves
around
alcohol
and
drugs
.
The
main
argument
against
alcohol
and
drug
use
as
a
primary
cause
of
FV
is
that
it
cannot
explain
the
highly
gendered
patterns
of
violence
perpetration
and
victimization
.
Identifying
alcohol
and
drug
use
as
a
primary
cause
of
FV
can
also
work
to
excuse
violence
,
thus
reinforcing
the
culture
which
condones
it
.
</p>
<p>
The
rates
of
harm
from
alcohol
are
considerably
higher
in
rural
than
metropolitan
areas
,
with
rural
residents
more
likely
to
engage
in
alcohol
consumption
that
exceeds
thresholds
for
short-term
harm
and
long-term
harm
.
With
both
high
rates
of
FV
and
high
rates
of
alcohol
misuse
,
it
is
not
surprising
there
is
considerable
overlap
.
Unfortunately
,
the
misunderstanding
that
alcohol
and
drugs
“
cause
”
FV
has
proven
to
be
difficult
to
change
.
One
study
found
that
the
percentage
of
people
believing
that
alcohol
consumption
is
the
single
largest
predictor
of
FV
actually
increased
following
training
that
did
not
advocate
this
view
.
This
may
be
due
to
the
phenomenon
described
by
cognitive
science
,
that
when
facts
are
presented
in
a
manner
than
is
incongruent
with
a
person
’s
values
,
the
facts
will
be
rejected
,
not
the
values
framework
within
which
the
person
is
functioning
.
This
model
recognizes
that
communication
is
not
a
purely
rational
endeavor
;
rather
it
theorizes
that
the
frameworks
of
values
and
norms
that
each
individual
functions
within
have
a
large
impact
on
their
understanding
and
acceptance
of
facts
.
For
someone
to
accept
new
facts
,
they
must
be
presented
in
a
way
that
is
not
incongruent
with
their
values
systems
.
This
points
to
a
key
challenge
of
a
primary
prevention
strategy
that
aims
to
change
a
deeply
ingrained
value
system
.
Only
by
understanding
resistance
to
change
can
we
determine
how
best
to
engage
the
population
and
refocus
the
conversation
on
primary
prevention
.
