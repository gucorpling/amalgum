The
terrain
in
Nanda
Devi
National
Park
is
almost
vertical
.
Therefore
,
<ref target="altitude%20sickness">
altitude
sickness
</ref>
is
definitely
a
risk
while
trekking
in
the
park
.
It
is
advisable
to
strictly
follow
best
practices
,
especially
an
acclimatization
drill
,
and
carry
enough
woolens
,
water
,
emergency
rations
and
medicine
kit
.
Avoid
zipped
itineraries
that
propose
trekking
straight
to
Lata
Kharak
in
a
single
day
.
Most
of
the
health
issues
in
the
Nanda
Devi
National
Park
region
are
due
to
rapid
altitude
gain
.
