Police
in

Zimbabwe

have
stopped
opposition
leader

Morgan
Tsvangirai
</ref>
(
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement%20for%20Democratic%20Change">
MDC
</ref>
)
en
route
to
a
campaign
rally
.
His
convoy
was
then
escorted
to
a
police
station
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esigodini">
Esigodini
</ref>
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Tsvangirai
and
other
MDC
leaders
were
detained
again
in
Umzingwane
.
They
are
being
taken
to
Esigodini
police
station
,
&quot;
said
MDC
spokesperson
Nelson
Chamisa
.
</p>
<p>
Wayne
Bvudzijena
,
a
spokesman
for
the
police
,
said
that
he
was
not
aware
of
this
incident
,
but
added
that
roadblocks
are
used
by
the
police
to
conduct
weapons
searches
.
&quot;
Tsvangirai
and
his
convoy
are
not
immune
to
search
,
&quot;
he
said
.
&quot;
They
can
be
searched
at
any
roadblock
they
pass
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Afterwards
,
the
government
banned
political
rallies
in
support
of
Tsvangirai
,
effectively
ending
his
campaigning
.
Officials
said
the
decision
was
made
to
protect
the
safety
of
Tsvangirai
and
MDC
party
leaders
.
</p>
<p>
George
Sibotshiwe
,
a
spokesperson
for
Tsvangirai
,
called
the
ban
&quot;
a
clear
indication
that
the
regime
will
do
everything
necessary
to
remain
in
power
,
&quot;
and
said
its
justification
was
&quot;
nonsense
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Earlier
today
,
Tsvangirai
was
prevented
from
attending
a
rally
at
a
mine
near
Zimbabwe
's
second-largest
city
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulawayo">
Bulawayo
</ref>
,
when
police
blocked
the
road
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
One
of
our
leading
vehicles
was
stopped
,
then
the
rest
of
us
were
stopped
as
well
.
We
tried
to
get
an
explanation
from
the
police
and
they
said
we
should
have
told
them
in
advance
that
Mr
Tsvangirai
was
going
to
visit
,
&quot;
said
Lovemore
Moyo
,
MDC
chairman
,
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence%20France-Presse">
AFP
</ref>
.
&quot;
They
then
turned
us
back
and
we
had
to
use
a
smaller
road
to
get
back
to
the
main
road
.
We
are
now
proceeding
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
We
were
unable
to
speak
at
the
mine
as
we
heard
at
the
gate
,
there
were
ZANU-PF
activists
blocking
the
entrance
.
We
only
managed
to
speak
to
our
local
councillors
,
&quot;
Moyo
said
.
</p>
<p>
Also
today
,
the
government
announced
a
ban
on
all
foreign
aid
groups
operating
in
the
country
.
Some
groups
,
including
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CARE%20(relief)">
CARE
International
</ref>
had
already
been
banned
earlier
this
week
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
hereby
instruct
all
PVOs/NGOs
to
suspend
all
field
operations
until
further
notice
,
&quot;
said
social
welfare
minister

<p>
James
Elder
,
a
spokesperson
for
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United%20Nations%20Children's%20Fund">
United
Nations
Children
's
Fund
</ref>
(
UNICEF
)
,
called
it
&quot;
completely
unacceptable
and
hugely
concerning
.
Hundreds
of
thousands
of
children
are
in
need
of
immediate
assistance
.
With
the
onset
of
the
winter
in
Zimbabwe
,
the
timing
is
critical
for
children
who
are
among
the
most
vulnerable
and
most
in
need
of
support
.

not
to
starve
the
population
and
to
allow
international
organizations
to
function
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
It
's
unbelievable
that
the
government
will
actually
kick
out
the
organizations
which
are
providing
services
to
the
people

said

told
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice%20of%20America">

that
halting
food
aid
is
unconscionable

the
opinion
of

.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
To
deprive
people
of
food
because
of
an
election
is
a
complete
perversion
of
democracy
.
How
can
you
possibly
deprive
people
with
food
and
then
ask
for
a
democratic
vote
?
&quot;
Colville
said
.
</p>
<p>
Speaking
at
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United%20Nations%20Headquarters">
United
Nations
Headquarters
</ref>
,
the
Zimbabwean
ambassador
Boniface
Chidyauskiku
said
that
the
government
was
not
using
food
as
a
tool
in
the
election
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
There
is
no
use
of
food
as
a
political
weapon
.
It
is
the
other
way
around
.
It
is
the
relief
agencies
,
followed
by
the
U.S.
government
,
that
have
been
using
food
as
a
political
weapon
,
&quot;
Chidyauskiku
said
to
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated%20Press">
Associated
Press
</ref>
.
&quot;
They
have
gone
out
into
the
countryside
and
they
have
been
telling
Zimbabweans
that
if
you
do
n't
vote
for
the
opposition
,
if
you
do
n't
change
your
vote
,
there
's
no
food
for
you
.

United

and
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_Kingdom">

diplomats
were
stopped
in
their
vehicles
in
an
incident
the
US
called
&quot;
outrageous
&quot;
and
said
that
they
were
threatened
with
being
burned
alive
in
their
cars
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Basically
,
the
police
told
them
they
were
not
going
anywhere
unless
they
got
out
of
the
car
,
&quot;
said
deputy
information
minister
Bright
Matonga
.
&quot;
The
police
told
them
they
should
respect
the
laws
of
the
country
unless
they
have
something
to
hide
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Two
days
ago
,
Tsvangirai
was
detained
for
several
hours
before
being
released
without
charges
.
