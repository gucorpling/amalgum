Introduction
</head>
<p>
Nonalcoholic
fatty
liver
disease
(
NAFLD
)
represents
the
leading
cause
of
progressive
liver
disorders
worldwide
,
affecting
between
20
%
to
40
%
of
the
adult
population
.
NAFLD
is
defined
by
increased
hepatic
fat
accumulation
not
explained
by
alcohol
abuse
,
and
it
encompasses
a
wide
spectrum
of
liver
injuries
,
ranging
from
simple
steatosis
(
&gt;5
%
of
liver
weight
)
to
its
inflammatory
form
nonalcoholic
steatohepatitis
(
NASH
)
.
NASH
may
be
complicated
by
the
presence
of
fibrosis
and
,
eventually
,
it
may
progress
to
cirrhosis
and
hepatocellular
carcinoma
(
HCC
)
.
NAFLD
has
a
strong
inherited
component
,
and
variants
in
proteins
regulating
hepatocellular
lipid
handling
,
including
patatin-like
phospholipase
domain-containing
3
(
PNPLA3
)
,
transmembrane
6
superfamily
member
2
(
TM6SF2
)
,
membrane
bound
O-acyltransferase
domain-containing
7
(
MBOAT7
)
,
predispose
to
the
disease
development
and
progression
to
NASH
and
fibrosis
.
Dietary
habits
such
as
excessive
caloric
intake
,
fructose
consumption
,
and
physical
inactivity
represent
other
risk
factors
for
NAFLD
development
.
In
addition
,
its
pathogenesis
is
closely
intertwined
with
excessive
adiposity
,
insulin
resistance
(
IR
)
,
and
metabolic
syndrome
.
</p>
<p>
IR
even
correlates
with
the
severity
of
liver
fibrosis
,
the
main
determinant
of
NAFLD
prognosis
.
Indeed
,
fibrosis
has
been
observed
in
diabetic
patients
with
NAFLD
even
independently
of
NASH
,
and
genetic
variants
that
impair
insulin
receptor
(
InsR
)
signaling
favor
fibrosis
development
in
NAFLD
patients
.
The
mechanism
whereby
IR
aggravates
fibrosis
may
be
related
to
reduced
extracellular
matrix
(
ECM
)
degradation
and
to
the
induction
of
proteins
involved
in
collagen
crosslinking
.
</p>
<p>
A
new
perspective
of
NAFLD
pathogenesis
and
management
is
provided
by
epigenetics
,
which
modulate
transcriptome
in
response
to
environmental
cues
.
In
particular
,
microRNAs
(
miRNAs
)
are
short
non-protein
coding
,
single-strand
RNAs
of
19
–
22
nucleotides
that
regulate
gene
expression
and
cell-to-cell
communication
as
it
occurs
between
hepatocytes
and
hepatic
stellate
cells
(
HSCs
)
during
fibrogenesis
.
Alteration
of
miRNA
expression
in
response
to
genetic/epigenetic
factors
or
environmental
conditions
may
contribute
to
steatosis
onset
and
NAFLD
progression
to
fibrosis
and
cancer
,
mirroring
the
histological
features
and
the
molecular
events
occurring
in
NAFLD
.
Thus
,
they
could
be
exploited
as
attractive
candidate
biomarkers
for
an
accurate
profiling
of
the
different
stages
of
liver
injury
,
enabling
early
and
non-invasive
diagnosis
and
the
clinical
monitoring
of
the
disease
progression
.
</p>
<p>
Therefore
,
we
aimed
to
explore
the
mechanisms
through
which
epigenetics
and
environmental
factors
interact
to
promote
progressive
NAFLD
in
the
context
of
IR
.
To
this
purpose
,
we
first
assessed
which
miRNAs
were
deregulated
by
IR
in
HSCs
whose
activation
represents
the
hallmark
of
liver
fibrosis
.
Secondly
,
we
evaluated
whether
the
miRNAs
differentially
expressed
in
insulin
resistant
HSCs
could
impact
on
NAFLD-related
fibrosis
by
using
an
experimental
model
of
IR-NASH
.
Thus
,
to
investigate
the
independent
contribution
of
IR
and
NASH
that
is
usually
intertwined
in
patients
on
miRNAs
expression
,
IR
was
induced
in
mice
by
haploinsufficiency
for
InsR
(
InsR+/−
)
,
which
determines
an
impairment
of
hepatic
insulin
signaling
recapitulating
that
has
been
observed
in
NAFLD
patients
.
Conversely
,
to
model
fibrogenic
NASH
,
we
exploited
the
methionine
choline
deficient
(
MCD
)
diet
,
which
impairs
phospholipid
metabolism
without
altering
IR
.
Finally
,
we
tested
the
expression
of
the
candidate
miRNAs
in
immortalized
human
hepatoma
cells
(
HepG2
)
and
in
HSCs
(
LX-2
)
in
the
presence
or
absence
of
miRNA
mimics
.
Here
,
we
showed
that
miR-101-3p
was
downregulated
in
InsR+/−
HSCs
and
hepatocytes
,
its
expression
was
reduced
even
in
total
livers
of
insulin
resistant
mice
,
and
it
was
associated
with
all
stages
of
liver
disease
.
</p>
<p>
Consistently
with
these
results
,
target
prediction
analysis
revealed
that
miR-101-3p
is
involved
in
insulin
signaling
,
lipid
metabolism
,
cell
proliferation
,
fibrogenesis
,
and
cancer
susceptibility
,
possibly
representing
a
molecular
signature
in
NAFLD
during
IR
.
Furthermore
,
miR-101-3p
overexpression
in
HepG2
and
LX-2
reduced
proliferation
,
migration
,
and
invasiveness
,
regulating
pro-fibrotic
and
pro-carcinogenic
markers
.
