The

palm

stands
on
the
northern
fringe
of
the
Sahara

Surrounded
by
little
other
than
desert
and
dry
scrub
land
,
historically
it
was
an
important
stop
on
the
trans-Saharan
caravan
routes
.
Today
tourists
come
in
numbers
,
many
on
organized
coach
tours
from

coastal
resorts
,
to
get
a
taste
of
the
mighty
Sahara
for
themselves
.

Be
warned
though
-
despite
pictures
in

in

the

somewhat
more
basic
and
bathroom
facilities
may
be
somewhat
primitive
.
Still
,
it
is
a
great
experience
with
campfire
,
ad
hoc
drumming/dancing
sessions
,
fire-baked
flat
bread
for
breakfast
and
camel
treks
back
