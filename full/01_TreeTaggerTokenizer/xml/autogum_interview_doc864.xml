Tim
,
who
had
a
longer
experience
with
the
internet
world
,
convinced
me
that
the
web
could
only
survive
if
all
the
code
was
freely
available
for
everyone
who
wanted
to
tinker
with
it
.
In
1992-1993
I
then
worked
patiently
for
some
6
months
with
CERN
's
Legal
Service
to
draft
a
document
that
put
the
source
code
into
the
public
domain
.
This
also
implied
working
to
convince
the
management
,
up
to
the
Directors
,
of
the
need
to
do
so
.
The
result
was
the
document
signed
on
30
April
1993
that
gave
the
WWW
technology
to
the
world
.
</p>
<p>
During
the
same
period
I
also
perceived
that
the
web
as
a
technology
had
very
many
aspects
.
Tim
drew
what
he
called
the
&quot;
metro
&quot;
:
a
diagram
of
the
relationships
between
the
existing
systems
(
FTP
,
SMTP
,
HTTP
,
...
)
in
the
form
of
a
stylised
map
resembling
that
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London%20Underground">
London
Underground
</ref>
.
That
made
me
think
that
we
needed
to
deal
with
a
lot
more
hard
computer
science
than
our
small
team
of
four
or
five
could
intellectually
handle
.
Therefore
I
began
to
toy
with
the
idea
of
an
international
conference
on
WWW
technologies
.
Tim
was
not
convinced
,
but
I
went
ahead
.
</p>
<p>
NCSA
(
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National%20Center%20for%20Supercomputing%20Applications">
National
Center
for
Supercomputer
Applications
</ref>
in
the
U.S.
)
had
just
released
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic%20(web%20browser)">
Mosaic
</ref>
,
first
for
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X%20Window%20System">
X-Window
</ref>
/
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix">
Unix
</ref>
systems
,
then
for
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh">
Mac
</ref>
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal%20computer">
PC
</ref>
.
Their
group
not
only
had
a
lot
more
people
,
but
their
leader
,
Joseph
Hardin
,
was
a
sociologist
of
my
age
.
I
suspected
that
he
was
thinking
along
the
same
lines
,
and
I
was
right
:
when
I
launched
the
call
for
papers
for
the
first
WWW
conference
in
December
1993
,
I
did
so
just
one
day
before
NCSA
would
have
done
the
same
thing
.
It
was
a
Friday
and
on
Saturday
Hardin
phoned
me
at
home
to
discuss
the
matter
.
Fortunately
our
relations
were
good
and
he
was
also
very
fair
by
teaming
up
with
my
conference
in
the
end
.
But
our
team
at
the
time
was
very
weak
:
NCSA
had
a
big
success
with
Mosaic
and
they
could
easily
have
used
their
weight
to
wipe
us
off
the
map
.
</p>
<p>
It
was
also
a
time
to
understand
how
underdeveloped
our
idea
of
Europe
here
is
.
We
know
that
we
have
to
live
together
on
this
assembly
of
peninsulas
,
but
when
we
have
to
pull
in
the
same
direction
then
that
is
politically
rather
difficult
.
</p>
<p>
Finally
for
two
years
I
worked
quite
hard
contributing
to
the
setting
up
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World%20Wide%20Web%20Consortium">
Web
Consortium
</ref>
.
Even
afterwards
that
took
much
effort
and
a
lot
of
my
time
.

<hi rend="bold">
Wikinews
</hi>
:
There
are
some
fun
anecdotes
about
the
beginning
of
the
World
Wide
Web
.
We
've
just
offered
you
a
virtual
beer
,
but
the
idea
of
the
WWW
started
with
a
beer
too
,
in
this
case
with
a
(
real
)
beer
with
Tim
Berners-Lee
,
right
?
And
there
is
a
reason
that
the
original
WWW-logo
is
green
,
right
?
Why
is
it
not
called
world-wide
web
,
with
a
hyphen
?
Are
there
other
anecdotes
you
want
to
share
with
our
readers
?
