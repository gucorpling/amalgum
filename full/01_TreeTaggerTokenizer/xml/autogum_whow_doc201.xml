Support
Your
Child
's
Unique
Gifts
in
the
School
Environment
</head>
<p>
So
you
have
a
child(s)
that
has
a
unique
gift
,
and
depending
on
your
stance
with
views
,
you
've
decided
the
best
way
to
fully
support
it
in
anyway
possible
.
And
with
the
even
more
troubling
task
of
doing
so
in
a
school
environment
.
This
article
will
explain
the
nature
,
possible
causation
,
and
a
way
to
support
the
gift
.

Steps
</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Recognize
the
full
potential
of
the
gift
.
Under
any
circumstance
,
If
you
do
not
support
it
,
your
child
will
fail
to
understand
why
you
support
it
,
but
do
not
see
it
's
full
potential
.
Every
object
in
this
world
has
a
purpose
,
no
matter
how
small
,
it
's
there
to
do
something
.
</item>
<item>
Let
your
child
know
you
care
.
Depending
on
the
age
,
the
presence
of
this
gift
in
your
household
(
or
another
)
is
the
physical
representation
of
your
child
's
thoughts
and
views
of
society
as
a
whole
.
Their
view
right
now
is
you
.
That
's
about
it
.
If
they
do
n't
know
you
care
,
their
view
of
you
will
become
darker
with
each
passing
day
.
Ca
n't
let
that
happen
can
we
?
With
the
positive
response
of
them
knowing
you
care
,
two
things
can
happen
.
The
first
one
being
(
if
the
original
view
of
the
world
is
above
a
neutral
,
ie
.
happy
,
joyful
)
that
their
gift
will
continue
to
grow
.
On
the
other
hand
that
gift
will
either
decay
and
cease
to
exist
,
or
become
as
volatile
as
car
wreck
.
Follow
the
next
step
to
continue
with
the
first
option
,
for
the
second
.
And
if
both
of
these
are
not
a
problem
,
continue
on
.

Loss
.
If
you
came
to
this
step
then
the
reason
your
child
quit
acknowledging
the
gift
,
is
due
to
the
possibility
that
the
child
's
subconscious
mind
made
a
goal
to
gain
attention
from
you
and
that
the
goal
has
been
met
.
With
you
at
his/her
side
,
they
are
set
free
of
doubt
and
misery
.
They
know
they
can
trust
you
.
</item>
<item>
Resentment
.
If
you
came
to
this
step
then
the
reason
your
child
became
so
volatile
is
because
he/she
thinks
you
are
&quot;
playing
&quot;
his/her
.
The
distrust
has
become
more
prominent
,
immediate
action
must
take
place
at
once
to
stop
this
from
getting
out
of
control
.
Unfortunately
,
this
must
be
placed
into
your
hands
to
be
solved
.

Make
it
known
at
their
school
.
Try
not
to
make
it
too
known
at
their
school
.
The
child
will
be
made
fun
of
if
too
known
,
which
defeats
the
purpose
of
this
wikiHow
.
Stick
to
the
principal
and
teacher(s)
at
their
grade
level
.

point
you

nothing

to
give
constant
support

telling
them
they
are
good
at
what
they
have
,
and
cherishing
what
they
give
you

and
never
letting
them
feel
alone
