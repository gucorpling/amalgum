Nioumachoua
</head>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
<ref target="http://www.moheli-tourisme.com">
Nioumachoua
</ref>
</hi>
is
the
second-largest
town
in
<ref target="Moheli">
Moheli
</ref>
.
In
the
south
of
the
island
,
it
is
the
base
to
explore
Moheli
Natural
Park
.
</p>
<head>
By
bus
</head>
<p>
There
is
a
regular
bus
service
from
Fomboni
.
Buses
start
running
at
7AM
from
the
market
,
one
way
ticket
costs
FC750
and
it
takes
around
two
hours
.
</p>
<p>
Buses
departing
from
Nioumachoua
leave
at
5AM
,
it
is
important
to
reserve
you
seat
with
the
driver
the
day
before
.
All
buses
departing
from
Nioumachoua
have
Fomboni
as
final
destination
,
but
they
can
drive
from
east
or
west
road
.
The
west
road
is
longer
than
the
east
road
,
but
it
is
in
much
better
conditions
.
</p>
<p>
Travelling
from
Nioumachoua
to
Itsamia
by
bus
is
tricky
.
The
easiest
is
travelling
back
to
the
capital
,
Fomboni
,
and
then
taking
a
new
bus
or
shared
taxi
to
Itsamia
(
shared
taxis
to
Itsamia
cost
FC500
)
.
It
can
happen
that
no
taxi
driver
wants
to
drive
to
Itsamia
,
as
it
is
far
away
.
In
this
case
take
a
taxi
to
Wanani
or
Kangani
.
Wanani
is
just
12
km
to
Itsamia
,
9
km
Kangani-Itsamia
,
from
here
try
to
catch
a
taxi
,
hitchhike
or
just
walk
.
</p>
<p>
Another
option
is
taking
the
bus
back
to
Fomboni
but
stopping
in
Wanani
(
12
km
far
from
Itsamia
)
.
From
here
you
can
try
to
catch
a
taxi
,
hitchhike
or
walk
.
There
are
not
many
cars
to
hitchhike
,
but
the
few
that
are
around
take
passengers
easily
.
</p>
<head>
By
shared
taxi
</head>
<p>
Shared
taxis
from
Fomboni
to
Nioumachoua
run
all
day
long
.
Take
in
consideration
that
due
to
the
fuel
shortage
and
the
conditions
of
the
road
finding
a
taxi
to
travel
between
the
cities
in
the
south
can
be
difficult
and
expensive
(
up
to
FC12,500
)
.
</p>
<p>
Otherwise
in
Nioumachoua
there
are
a
couple
of
private
cars
that
for
a
price
will
take
wherever
you
wish
.
Take
in
consideration
that
the
fuel
is
expensive
,
so
private
cars
are
expensive
as
well
.
By
November
2018
one
litre
of
fuel
costs
FC1,000
.
</p>
<head>
By
motorbike
</head>
<p>
If
you
are
based
in
Nioumachoua
a
very
good
option
is
renting
a
motorbike
for
yourself
.
Renting
a
motorbike
costs
FC7,500
per
day
.
</p>
<head>
By
rented
car
</head>
<p>
Renting
a
car
without
driver
is
very
difficult
,
it
cost
FC20,000
per
day
.
But
the
real
problem
is
to
convince
someone
to
rent
you
a
car
,
locals
do
n't
trust
a
lot
on
tourist
's
skills
in
these
roads
.
</p>
<head>
By
boat
</head>
<p>
You
can
travel
to
other
cities
in
the
coast
with
fisherman
boats
,
every
trip
may
cost
more
than
FC10,000
depending
on
how
far
you
wanna
go
.
Prices
might
look
a
bit
expensive
,
but
fuel
is
expensive
.

built
up
in
collaboration
with
the
European
Community
with
the
pursue
of

Since
