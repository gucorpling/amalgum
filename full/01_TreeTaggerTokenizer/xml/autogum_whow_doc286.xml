that
Appeal
to
You

Avoid
recipes
that
rely
on
ingredients
with
a
strong
aroma
.
This
might
include
cooked
onions
or
garlic
,
strong
spices
,
or
other
aromas
you
find
displeasing
.
If
a
recipe
calls
for
a
strongly
scented
food
,
omit
it
or
find
a
replacement
that
is
more
pleasing
to
you
.

For
example
,
substitute
other
vegetables
(
such
as
broccoli
or
green
pepper
)
in
place
of
onions
.

<item>
Some
other
foods
to
avoid
cooking
because
of
their
aroma
might
include
ginger
,
cinnamon
,
or
meat
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Choose
preparation
methods
that
are
quiet
.
If
noise
bothers
you
,
avoid
recipes
that
require
loud
sounds
,
such
as
the
blender
or
mixer
.
This
might
mean
mixing
ingredients
by
hand
or
cutting
foods
into
small
pieces
on
your
own
.

For
example
,
if
you
want
to
make
a
smoothie
but
do
n’t
want
to
listen
to
the
blender
,
make
a
simplified
smoothie
by
adding
a
powdered
protein
mix
to
a
liquid
(
such
as
almond
milk
)
and
shaking
it
in
a
covered
cup

Stick
to
your
preferred
food
textures
.
You
may
prefer
soft
foods
or
crunchy
foods
.
Whatever
your
preference
,
you
can
choose
recipes
that
use
those
types
of
foods
.
For
example
,
if
you
enjoy
eating
soft
textures
,
choose
recipes
which
cook
the
vegetables
instead
of
eating
them
raw
,
or
choose
mashed
potatoes
over
potato
wedges
.
If
you
prefer
crunchy
textures
,
add
nuts
to
your
meals
as
a
garnish
.

Build
off
of
preferred
textures
.
Narrow
your
choices
by
searching
recipes
which
include
a
food
with
a
pleasant
texture
as
a
base
.
It
might
be
too
much
to
venture
into
trying
full
new
recipes
,
so
stick
to
the
textures
you
prefer
and
add
onto
them
.

Prepare
foods
with
an
undesirable
texture

If
you
avoid
foods
due
to
their
texture
,
think
about
using
a
new
method
to
prepare
or
eat
them
.
For
example
,
you
may
dislike
soggy
cereal
,
so
eat
it
dry
or
with
yogurt
instead
of
milk
.
Find
creative

Make
mealtime
predictable
.
One
way
to
reduce
stress
around
foods
is
to
make
mealtimes
predictable
and
routine
.
Serve
meals
at
the
same
time
each
day
.
Eat
off
of
the
same
dinnerware
each
time
.
While
these
routines
are
simple
,
they
can
help
ease
stress
by
creating

Keep
a
record
of
which
foods
you
enjoy
.
Have
some
‘
go-to
’
foods
that
you
know
you
enjoy
and
can
eat
regularly
.
People
with
sensory
processing
problems
often
enjoy
bland
foods
such
as
pasta
,
rice
,
or
potatoes
.
Try
using
these
foods
as
a
base
for
a
recipe
and
try
something
new
to
go
with
it
.
That
way
,
you
’ll
eat
something
you
know
you

but
also
have
the
opportunity
