Chopsticks

naturally
believed

have
originated
in

olden
days

The
traditional
eating
tools
are
a
pair
of
small
identical
,
even-length
tapered
sticks
.

Tips
</head>
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Chopsticks
generally
should
be
held
at
the
thicker
end
about
one-third
along
their
length
for
balance
and
accuracy
.
For
greater
touch
to
pick
up
food
further
away
,
hold
the
chopsticks
at
the
upper
ends
.
</item>
<item>
If
the
tips
fail
to
its
position
,
it
will
be
difficult
to
hold
things
.
Hold
the
chopsticks
upright
with
one
of
the
tips
lightly
touching
the
table
,
and
gently
push
the
chopsticks
down
or
gently
loosen
your
grip
for
a
moment
to
let
both
tips
become
equal
in
length
.
You
can
also
alter
your
grip
or
holding
position
this
way
.
</item>
<item>
With
practice
,
it
is
likely
to
perform
step
one
and
two
according
on
lifting
up
the
chopsticks
with
one
hand
.
Adjust
your
grip
if
possible
.
