<head>
General
Topography
</head>
<p>
Port
Elizabeth
is
situated
on
the
west
side
of
Algoa
Bay
,
which
is
a
wide
indentation
on
the
South
African
east
coast
,
some
683
km
east
of
the
Cape
of
Good
Hope
.
The
bay
is
bounded
in
the
west
by
Cape
Recife
and
in
the
east
by
Cape
Padrone
,
and
much
of
the
shoreline
is
sandy
beaches
.
The
greter
metropolitan
area
extends
some
distance
to
the
west
of
Cape
Recife
,
and
this
rocky
part
of
the
coastline
includes
a
number
of
the
most
popular
dive
sites
.
</p>
<head>
Climate
,
Weather
and
Sea
conditions
</head>
<p>
&quot;
The
Windy
City
&quot;
has
a
subtropical
climate
with
light
rain
throughout
the
year
.
The
area
lies
between
the
winter
rainfall
,
Mediterranean
climate
zones
of
the
Western
Cape
and
the
summer
rainfall
regions
of
eastern
South
Africa
.
The
proximity
to
the
ocean
has
a
moderating
effect
on
the
climate
,
so
winters
are
cool
but
mild
and
summers
are
warm
but
considerably
less
humid
and
hot
than
more
northerly
parts
of
South
Africa
's
east
coast
.

<head>
The
Marine
Ecology
</head>
<p>
Port
Elizabeth
is
within
the
warm
temperate
Agulhas
ecoregion
,
which
extends
from
Cape
Point
to
the
Mbashe
River
.
It
is
some
360
km
from
Mbashe
mouth
and
660
km
from
Cape
Point
,
so
is
somewhat
towards
the
warmer
side
of
the
region
.
Upwelling
on
the
south
coast
of
South
Africa
is
largely
driven
by
the
Agulhas
current
and
the
continental
shelf
.
This
form
of
upwelling
forces
cold
deep
water
up
onto
the
continental
shelf
,
but
not
necessarily
above
the
thermocline
.
In
the
region
east
of
the
Agulhas
bank
,
wind
enhanced
upwelling
,
occurring
mainly
in
summer
,
augments
the
current
driven
upwelling
bringing
the
colder
deeper
waters
to
the
surface
.
This
enhances
biological
productivity
by
supply
of
nutrients
to
the
euphotic
zone
(
where
plants
have
sufficient
light
to
flourish
)
which
fuels
phytoplankton
production
,
and
rocky
shores
that
are
supplied
with
the
nutrient
rich
water
support
rich
algal
biomass
.
The
annual
chokka
(
squid
)
spawning
takes
place
largely
in
this
region
.
</p>
<head>
Equipment
</head>
<p>
No
special
equipment
is
required
for
most
of
the
sites
.
Wet
or
semi-dry
suits
will
be
adequate
for
most
divers
most
of
the
time
,
though
for
those
who
wish
to
do
multiple
dives
of
longer
duration
,
or
are
sensitive
to
the
cold
,
a
dry
suit
is
recommended
.
</p>
<p>
If
you
intend
to
dive
autonomously
,
rather
than
follow
thr
divemaster
,
a
DSMB
(
Delayed/deployable
Surface
Marker
Buoy
)
and
reel
or
spool
is
recommended
,
so
the
boat
will
know
where
you
are
surfacing
,
particularly
if
there
is
a
current
running
.
This
will
also
help
alert
other
vessels
of
your
proximity
to
the
surface
so
they
can
avoid
you
in
time
.
</p>
<p>
Nitrox
is
available
at
some
filling
stations
,
but
your
choice
of
mix
may
be
limited
.
</p>
<head>
Respect
</head>
<p>
Some
of
the
dive
sites
of
Port
Elizabeth
are
in
the
Addo
Elephant
National
Park
Marine
Protected
Area
.
A
permit
is
required
to
scuba
dive
in
any
MPA
.
The
permits
are
valid
for
a
year
and
are
available
at
some
branches
of
the
Post
Office
.
Temporary
permits
,
valid
for
a
month
,
may
be
available
at
dive
shops
or
from
dive
boat
operators
.
The
permits
are
valid
for
all
South
African
MPAs
.
</p>
<p>
Boundaries
of
the
Addo
Elephant
National
Park
Marine
Protected
Area
are
shown
in
the

,
which
also
shows
the
Restricted
zones
,
where
in
theory
,
no
fishing
or
harvesting
activities
are
allowed
.
