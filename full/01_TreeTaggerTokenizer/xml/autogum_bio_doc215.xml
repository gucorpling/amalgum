Early
life
</head>
<p>
Born
<hi rend="bold">
Lawrence
Buchanen
English
</hi>
,
he
soon
received
the
nickname
&quot;
Buck
.
&quot;
The
English
family
feuded
with
the
Durbin
family
for
years
,
which
led
to
three
of
Buck
's
brothers
dying
.
When
Buck
was
thirteen
,
he
became
obligated
to
take
revenge
on
the
Durbin
family
.
Unlike
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bolles">
Black
Bart
</ref>
,
Lake
County
's
other
notorious
thief
,
Buck
was
rash
and
openly
flaunted
his
overconfident
capacity
.
</p>
<p>
He
was
only
22
years
old
when
he
and
a
companion
held
up
the
Lower
Lake
stage
coach
and
took
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo">
Wells
Fargo
</ref>
strongbox
from
the
driver
.
Instead
of
the
usual
gold
or
silver
for
the
miners
,
the
box
yielded
only
two
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brass">
brass
</ref>
castings
.
The
local
newspaper
later
said
,
&quot;
Shortly
before
this
robbery
,
he
and
his
companion
met
four
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China">
Chinese
</ref>
miners
coming
down
from
the
Great
Western
Mine
(
near
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middletown,_California">
Middletown
</ref>
)
,
and
robbed
them
of
their
watches
and
money
.

<p>
Wells
Fargo
strongboxes
were
often
the
target
of
stagecoach
robbers
in
Middletown
.
After
the
mid-19th
century
,
the
payroll
money
was
brought
in
on
the
stagecoach
with
an
armed
guard
beside
the
driver
.
Not
all
of
the
holdups
in
the
area
were
the
doing
of
Buck
and
his
gang
,
although
he
was
a
scourge
to
the
local
vicinity
for
a
number
of
years
.
Buck
worked
the
road
near
Mountain
Hill
House
,
south
of
Middletown
,
or
near
the
double
bridge
north
of
Middletown
near
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Lake,_California">
Lower
Lake
</ref>
.
For
20
years
,
Buck
roamed
the
countryside
,
making
little
effort
to
hide
his
identity
or
his
disreputable
enterprise
.
</p>
<head>
Duel
</head>
<p>
Buck
walked
the
streets
of
Middletown
with
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-shooter">
six-shooter
</ref>
strapped
to
his
side
,
daring
any
who
insulted
his
authority
to
a
contest
.
One
day
,
he
ran
into
Captain
Good
on
the
main
street
,
and
harsh
words
were
exchanged
.
Later
in
the
day
,
they
met
again
,
and
this
time
it
was
a
shooting
affair
,
with
Buck
emerging
unscathed
.
The
captain
was
seriously
wounded
in
the
arm
and
legs
.
In
another
unrelated
incident
,
Buck
shot
and
killed
a
man
in
the
Middletown
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_rink">
skating
rink
</ref>
,
turning
the
arena
into
a
scene
of
pandemonium
.

After

time
</head>
<p>
After
his
release
from
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Quentin">
San
Quentin
</ref>
in
1882
,
Buck
returned
to
Middletown
.
Soon
after
his
arrival
,
the
Lebree
store
in
town
was
robbed
of
some
watches
and
jewelry
.
</p>
<p>
Buck
left
Middletown
for
a
few
years
,
but
upon
his
return
,
he
showed
he
had
not
changed
.
It
was
not
long
before
he
held
up
the
stage
at
the
foot
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Saint_Helena">
Mount
Saint
Helena
</ref>
,
near
the
summer
home
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor">
mayor
</ref>
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco">
San
Francisco
</ref>
.
The
six
passengers
were
ordered
out
of
the
stage
,
and
stripped
of
their
possessions
.
Buck
made
no
effort
to
hide
his
identity
.
He
greeted
the
driver
of
a
passing
wagon
,
who
quickly
drove
on
when
he
realized
a
robbery
was
in
progress
.

<head>
Capture
</head>
<p>
This
occurred
on
May
7
,
1895
.
A
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posse_comitatus_(common_law)">
posse
</ref>
was
formed
and
they
set
off
to
capture
Buck
.
They
discovered
him
on
a
stagecoach
going
from
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monticello,_California">
Monticello
</ref>
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napa,_California">
Napa
</ref>
,
and
a
wild
chase
ensued
.
The
<hi rend="italic">
San
Francisco
Examiner
</hi>
reported
the
next
day
:
</p>
<p>
One
of
the
robbers
jumped
to
the
horses
ahead
and
leveled
his
guns
.
He
waved
weapons
and
spouted
profanity
,
all
the
while
threatening
to
'
blow
'
the
driver
off
of
the
seat
.
The
two
robbers
were
armed
with
old
style
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_revolver">
Colt
revolvers
</ref>
,
and
he
cursed
at
everyone
,
especially
the
Chinamen
</p>
<p>
The
capture
of
Buck
by
Sheriff
Bell
reads
like
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_West">
Wild
West
</ref>
novel
.
He
was
so
badly
wounded
and
had
lost
so
much
blood
that
many
thought
he
would
not
survive
.
He
did
recover
,
however
,
and
returned
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Quentin">
San
Quentin
</ref>
to
serve
yet
another
sentence
.
</p>
<p>
Buck
was
not
as
well
known
as
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Bart_(outlaw)">
Black
Bart
</ref>
and
other
Western
gunmen
of
the
time
,
but
he
created
fear
wherever
he
went
.
Although
he
was
arrested
for
his
robberies
and
attacks
on
the
general
population
,
Buck
had
his
hands
in
many
other
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime">
criminal
</ref>
activities
,
including
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle_rustling">
cattle
rustling
</ref>
,
but
he
was
never
brought
to
justice
for
any
of
these
crimes
.

Later
life
</head>
<p>
Buck
ended
up
living
long
enough
to
enjoy
freedom
again
after
his
release
from
prison
.
He
eventually
died
in
1915
of
natural
causes
,
unlike
his
brothers
,
all
of
whom
all
died
violent
deaths
.
