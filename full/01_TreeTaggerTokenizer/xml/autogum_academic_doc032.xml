Introduction
</head>
<p>
The
genus
<hi rend="italic">
Sideritis
</hi>
,
belonging
to
the
Lamiaceae
(
Labiatae
)
family
,
is
comprised
of
more
than
150
species
.
The
genus
is
further
divided
in
2
subgenera
and
7
sections
.
The
subgenus
<hi rend="italic">
Sideritis
</hi>
divided
into
four
sections
includes
approximately
125
species
,
the
majority
of
which
are
distributed
in
the
Mediterranean
.
The
taxonomy
of
<hi rend="italic">
Sideritis
</hi>
species
is
highly
intricate
due
to
frequent
hybridization
between
species
,
the
variation
of
ecotypes
and
the
degree
of
polymorphism
.
It
is
crucial
to
distinguish
the
different
<hi rend="italic">
Sideritis
</hi>
species
and
it
is
for
this
reason
that
secondary
metabolites
,
in
particular
diterpenoids
and
flavonoids
,
are
used
for
the
chemotaxonomic
identification
of
species
within
the
genus
.
However
,
modern
methods
such
as
high
resolution
melting
analysis
(
HMR
)
coupled
with
polymerase
chain
reaction
(
PCR
)
offer
rapid
detection
of
these
species
.

<p>
<hi rend="italic">
Sideritis
perfoliata
</hi>
L.
(
subsp
.
<hi rend="italic">
perfoliata
</hi>
)
belongs
to
section
Empedoclea
,
and
is
distributed
mainly
in
Greece
,
Cyprus
,
Turkey
and
in
other
Balkan
and
East
Mediterranean
countries
,
where
it
grows
in
the
wild
or
is
cultivated
.
This
perennial
species
has
a
woody
base
,
opposite
and
entire
leaves
(
dentate
or
serrate
)
and
is
widely
distributed
in
the
Mediterranean
Basin
which
is
characterized
by
a
rich
tradition
in
phytotherapy
,
dating
back
to
ancient
times
.
The
usage
of
<hi rend="italic">
Sideritis
</hi>
species
in
folklore
medicine
has
been
known
since
the
Dioskourides
era
(
1st
century
)
when
the
plant
was
used
to
treat
wounds
from
iron
weapons
like
swords
or
knives
.
The
name
<hi rend="italic">
Sideritis
</hi>
comes
from
the
word
“
sidero
”
which
means
iron
in
Greek
.
</p>
<p>
Plants
of
the
<hi rend="italic">
Sideritis
</hi>
genus
,
commonly
known
in
Cyprus
,
Greece
and
other
Balkan
countries
as
“
mountain
tea
”
,
are
used
as
teas
,
for
feeding
and
as
flavoring
agents
.
<hi rend="italic">
Sideritis
</hi>
species
are
used
extensively
in
European
and
Mediterranean
countries
as
traditional
medicines
with
anti-inflammatory
,
antimicrobial
,
vulnerary
,
antioxidant
,
antispasmodic
,
analgesic
,
stomachic
and
carminative
activities
.
Decoctions
and
infusions
of
<hi rend="italic">
S.
perfoliata
</hi>
are
widely
used
for
the
treatment
of
common
cold
,
flu
,
cough
,
gastrointestinal
disorders
such
as
dyspepsia
and
as
a
calmative
agent
.
Charami
et
al.
reported
the
use
of
<hi rend="italic">
S.
perfoliata
</hi>
for
its
antirheumatic
,
anti-ulcerative
,
digestive
and
vaso-protective
properties
.
Recently
,
botanical
and
pharmacological
studies
focusing
on
<hi rend="italic">
Sideritis
</hi>
,
is
likely
due
to
the
above-mentioned
properties
which
have
been
proven
and
have
been
attributed
to
the
diverse
chemical
profile
of
the
genus
,
that
is
rich
in
flavonoids
,
terpenoids
,
coumarins
,
sterols
and
iridoids
.
These
properties
,
the
advances
in
technology
and
the
current
popularity
and
the
use
of
natural
products
for
self-medication
,
and
as
dietary
supplements
,
generates
a
growing
interest
in
the
pharmaceutical
industry
to
exploit
plant-derived
products
to
serve
as
discovery
leads
to
new
prototypes
.

<p>
Medicinal
and
aromatic
plants
are
enriched
with
antioxidants
such
as
polyphenols
,
which
act
as
scavengers
of
free
radicals
by
adsorbing
and
neutralizing
reactive
oxygen
species
(
ROS
)
,
quenching
singlet
and
triplet
oxygen
or
decomposing
peroxides
.
The
Mediterranean
Basin
is
characterized
by
a
rich
tradition
of
phytotherapy
dating
back
to
ancient
times
,
in
addition
to
being
home
to
the
majority
of
the
<hi rend="italic">
Sideritis
</hi>
species
.
The
aim
of
the
current
study
was
to
explore
the
unknown
properties
of
<hi rend="italic">
S.
perfoliata
</hi>
investigating
nutritional
,
antioxidant
,
anticancer
,
antituberculosis
,
antiwrinkle
,
anti-acne
,
hyper/hypo-pigmentation
and
antibacterial
properties
.
