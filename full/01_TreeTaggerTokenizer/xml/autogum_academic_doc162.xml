Introduction
</head>
<p>
Cancer
has
been
a
major
threat
to
human
health
in
recent
years
.
In
the
past
forty
years
,
even
though
great
efforts
have
been
made
,
there
is
still
much
to
be
done
before
a
safe
therapy
is
achieved
.
Currently
,
chemotherapy
and
radiotherapy
are
still
the
main
therapeutic
methods
for
cancer
.
However
,
most
of
the
anticancer
drugs
have
toxic
side
effects
.
Therefore
,
it
is
critical
to
develop
novel
anticancer
drugs
that
have
no
toxic
side
effects
on
other
tissues
or
organs
in
vivo
,
and
only
target
the
lesion
area
.
Compared
with
traditional
chemotherapeutic
drugs
,
the
nano-anticancer
drug
therapy
has
potential
application
prospects
in
curing
cancer
diseases
.
</p>
<p>
One
of
the
major
concerns
about
the
nano-anticancer
drugs
is
the
drug-delivery
vector
.
The
ideal
delivery
vector
should
possess
such
characteristics
as
a
high
drug-loading
capacity
,
low
immunogenicity
,
low
toxicity
,
better
shelf-life
,
and
water
solubility
,
and
it
should
have
the
potential
to
be
further
modified
.
Synthetic
polymers
,
such
as
,
chitosan
,
polyetherimide
(
PEI
)
,
poly(lactic-co-glycolic
acid
)
(
PLGA
)
,
polyamidoamine
(
PAMAM
)
,
and
poly-l-lactic
acid
(
PLA
)
have
been
widely
used
in
gene-
and
drug-delivery
systems
.
However
,
stability
of
sustained-release
formulations
in
aqueous
solution
,
long
delivery
times
,
and
low
delivery
efficiency
are
only
a
small
part
of
the
challenges
highlighted
by
researchers
.
Dendrigraft
poly-l-lysines
(
DGL
)
have
emerged
as
a
new
kind
of
synthetic
polymer
consisting
of
lysine
and
have
been
employed
as
drug-
or
gene-delivery
carriers
,
due
to
their
biodegradability
and
rich
external
amino
groups
that
can
encapsulate
drugs
by
the
emulsion
crosslinking
method
or
plasmid
DNA
through
electric
interactions
.
Besides
their
biodegradability
,
they
can
also
be
modified
with
targeting
ligands
and
polyethylene
glycol
(
PEG
)
,
thereby
rendering
vectors
with
targeting
properties
and
long
circulation
.
As
yet
,
there
are
only
a
few
ways
available
for
targeted
delivery
of
anticancer
drugs
.
Recently
,
a
report
showed
that
VAR2CSA
,
which
is
exposed
on
the
membrane
of
<hi rend="italic">
Plasmodium
falciparum
</hi>
infected
red
blood
cells
(
iRBC
)
,
could
bind
to
90
%
of
tumors
,
which
was
verified
by
running
immunohistochemistry
on
a
tumor-tissue
array
.
Therefore
,
VAR2CSA
is
becoming
an
attractive
target
for
anticancer
drugs
â€™
development
.
<hi rend="italic">
P.
falciparum
</hi>
infection
during
pregnancy
results
in
the
sequestration
of
iRBC
in
the
placenta
by
adhering
to
a
distinct
type
of
chondroitin
sulfate
A
(
CSA
)
exclusively
expressed
on
trophoblast
via
VAR2CSA
.
Short
continuous
regions
of
VAR2CSA
with
affinity
for
multiple
types
of
CSA
were
defined
.
A
28
amino
acids
placenta
CSA-binding
peptide
(
plCSA-BP
)
from
the
VAR2CSA
region
was
recently
tested
as
a
guide
peptide
for
targeted
delivery
of
doxorubicin
to
choriocarcinoma
.
However
,
whether
it
could
be
used
to
modify
the
DGL
and
its
bioactivity
after
the
modification
was
not
evaluated
.
</p>
<p>
The
immunosuppressive
,
antimalarial
,
and
pro-cytotoxic
bacterial
prodigiosin
was
recently
described
as
a
potent
antimetastatic
and
anticancer
agent
.
It
can
induce
apoptosis
in
a
wide
range
of
cancer
cell
lines
,
including
hematopoietic
cancer
,
breast
cancer
,
gastric
cancer
,
colon
cancer
,
lung
cancer
,
and
rat
hepatocellular
carcinoma
cell
lines
,
with
no
marked
toxicity
in
nonmalignant
cells
.
However
,
prodigiosin
has
not
been
reported
for
the
treatment
of
choriocarcinoma
yet
.
It
is
selective
in
promoting
apoptosis
of
malignant
tumor
cells
,
rendering
prodigiosin
a
promising
anticancer
agent
.
The
antitumor
mechanism
of
prodigiosin
is
still
unclear
,
especially
in
regard
to
newly
acquired
prodigiosin
produced
by
a
small
number
of
microorganisms
,
including
<hi rend="italic">
Serratia
marcescens
</hi>
and
other
bacteria
,
such
as
<hi rend="italic">
Streptomyces
griseoviridis
</hi>
,
<hi rend="italic">
Serratia
</hi>
spp.
,
<hi rend="italic">
Zooshikellarubidus
,
Vibrio
</hi>
sp
.
,
<hi rend="italic">
Actinomycetes
</hi>
,
and
<hi rend="italic">
Hahella
chejuensis
</hi>
.
Research
on
the
mechanism
of
bacterial
origin
prodigiosin
is
very
important
for
clinical
application
and
drug
development
.
</p>
<p>
In
this
study
,
to
develop
a
new
type
of
targeted
drug
delivery
carrier
material
and
investigate
the
anticancer
mechanism
of
prodigiosin
,
we
first
used
plCSA-BP
as
a
guide
peptide
to
coat
on
the
DGL
vector
for
cancer-cell-targeted
delivery
of
prodigiosin
produced
from
<hi rend="italic">
Serratia
marcescens
</hi>
subsp
.
<hi rend="italic">
lawsoniana
</hi>
HDZK-BYSB107
.
Then
,
we
tested
the
binding
ability
of
the
newly
developed
DGL/CSA-PNPs
and
its
anticancer
effect
in
vitro
on
a
JEG3
choriocarcinoma
cell
line
and
<hi rend="italic">
in
vivo
</hi>
on
a
tumor
model
,
respectively
.
In
addition
,
the
mechanism
responsible
for
the
anticancer
effect
of
targeted
nano-prodigiosin
was
also
investigated
.
Overall
,
these
findings
suggested
that
the
DGL/CSA
vector
is
an
excellent
cancer-specific-drug
delivery
carrier
,
which
has
great
potential
as
a
novel
delivery
system
for
the
treatment
of
cancer
.
