Sell
a
Used
Boat
</head>
<p>
There
are
many
facets
to
consider
and
tips
to
follow
in
order
for
you
to
sell
your
boat
for
the
right
price
.
A
crucial
aspect
of
used
boat
selling
is
exposure
.
If
no
one
is
aware
your
boat
is
for
sale
,
you
will
most
likely
not
sell
it
.
The
market
for
used
boats
is
vast
because
boating
is
a
huge
enterprise
in
the
United
States
.
Use
these
used
boat
selling
tips
to
help
guide
you
through
the
process

Assess
the
boat
's
condition
.

Determine
if
the
boat
operates
.
Start
up
the
motor
(
if
it
's
a
motorized
boat
)
and
make
sure
it
floats
.
The
standard
of
used
boats
range
dramatically
.
Some
used
boats
are
sold
in
perfect
condition
;
others
hardly
run
at
all
.
Selling
a
used
boat
that
is
in
working
condition
is
much
easier
than
selling
a
poor-quality
boat
.

<item>
Check
for
surface
damage
.
A
boat
can
run
just
fine
but
be
plagued
with
dents
and
scratches
from
use
.
Some
of
the
superficial
issues
can
be
fixed
prior
to
sale
,
but
it
's
important
to
get
a
full
account
of
the
boat
's
problems
.

Decide
whether
to
repair
the
boat
or

it

is

Hire
a
professional
to
perform
boat
repairs
or
fix
minor
damage
yourself
.
If
the
damage
is
extensive
,
you
might
not
want
to
put
too
much
money
into
repairs
before
you
have
found
a
buyer
.
Otherwise
,
you
might
end
up
paying
more
money
to
repair
the
boat
then
you
will
make
off
its
sale
.

Clean
the
boat
thoroughly

Scrub
the
boat
from
bow
to
stern
.
If
there
is
considerable
grime
,
you
might
consider
renting
a
power
washer
.
A
brand
new
boat
would
be
hard
to
sell
if
it
were
dirty
,
so
cleaning
your
used
boat
until
it
shines
is
key
to
selling
it
.

from
all
angles
for
buyers
who

located
near
you
.
The
more
photos
and
the
higher
quality
of
photos
you
have
of
your
boat
,
the
more
likely
you
are
to
attract
a
buyer
