CHAPTER
XVII
--
THE
PHANTOM
CAPTURED
</head>
<p>
Surprise
held
Tom
and
his
friends
almost
spellbound
for
the
moment
.
The
young
inventor
's
hand
went
toward
the
pocket
where
he
carried
his
revolver
.
Mr.
Jenks
,
who
had
the
only
other
weapon
,
sought
to
draw
it
,
but
he
was
stopped
by
a
gesture
of
one
of
the
two
men
with
guns
.
</p>
<p>
“
Hold
on
,
strangers
!
”
the
man
cried
.
“
I
know
what
you
're
up
to
!
Better
not
try
to
draw
anything
--
it
might
not
be
healthy
.
Now
,
then
,
who
are
you
,
and
what
do
you
want
?
”
</p>
<p>
The
question
came
rather
as
a
surprise
,
at
least
to
Tom
and
Mr.
Jenks
.
They
had
taken
it
for
granted
that
these
men
--
if
they
were
the
diamond
makers
--
would
know
Mr.
Jenks
,
and
guess
at
his
errand
in
coming
back
to
Phantom
Mountain
.
But
,
it
seemed
,
that
they
took
them
all
for
casual
strangers
.
</p>
<p>
No
one
answered
for
a
moment
.
Tom
caught
the
eye
of
Mr.
Jenks
,
and
there
was
a
look
of
hope
in
it
.
If
ever
there
was
a
time
for
strategy
,
it
was
now
.
Evidently
Munson
,
the
stowaway
on
the
airship
,
had
not
yet
been
able
to
send
a
warning
to
his
confederates
.
And
neither
of
the
two
men
recognized
Mr.
Jenks
as
the
man
who
had
been
defrauded
of
his
rights
.
It
might
be
possible
to
conceal
the
real
object
of
the
adventurers
until
they
had
time
to
formulate
a
plan
of
action
.
</p>
<p>
“
Well
,
”
exclaimed
the
man
with
the
gun
,
impatiently
,
“
I
ask
you
folks
a
question
.
What
do
you
want
?
”
</p>
<p>
Fortunately
,
neither
Mr.
Damon
nor
Mr.
Parker
replied
.
The
former
because
he
deferred
to
Tom
and
Mr.
Jenks
,
and
the
scientist
because
he
was
busy
inspecting
some
curious
rocks
he
picked
up
.
As
it
turned
out
this
was
the
luckiest
thing
he
could
have
done
.
It
lent
color
to
what
Mr.
Jenks
said
a
moment
later
.
</p>
<p>
“
What
are
you
doing
up
here
?
”
demanded
the
man
again
.
“
Do
n't
you
know
this
is
private
property
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
We
--
we
were
just
looking
around
,
”
answered
Mr.
Jenks
,
which
was
true
enough
;
as
far
as
it
went
.
</p>
<p>
“
Prospecting
,
”
added
Tom
.
</p>
<p>
“
After
gold
?
”
demanded
the
second
man
,
suspiciously
.
</p>
<p>
“
We
'd
be
glad
to
find
some
,
”
retorted
the
lad
.
At
that
moment
Mr.
Parker
began
breaking
off
bits
of
rock
with
a
small
geologist
's
hammer
which
he
carried
.
The
men
with
the
guns
looked
at
him
.
</p>
<p>
“
So
you
think
you
'll
find
gold
up
here
?
”
asked
the
one
who
had
first
spoken
.
</p>
<p>
“
Is
there
any
?
”
inquired
Tom
,
trying
to
make
his
voice
sound
eager
.
</p>
<p>
“
Nary
a
bit
,
strangers
,
”
was
the
answer
,
and
the
two
men
laughed
heartily
.
“
Now
,
we
do
n't
want
to
seem
harsh
,
”
went
on
the
man
who
seemed
to
be
the
spokesman
,
“
but
you
'd
better
get
away
from
here
.
This
is
private
ground
,
and
dangerous
too
--
how
'd
you
ever
get
up
the
trail
--
we
heard
it
was
destroyed
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
There
is
still
a
narrow
path
,
”
said
Mr.
Jenks
.
“
We
came
up
that
--
the
lightning
and
landslide
have
n't
left
much
of
it
,
though
.
”
</p>
<p>
Mr.
Parker
looked
quickly
up
from
the
rocks
at
which
he
was
tapping
with
his
small
hammer
.
“
You
have
terrific
lightning
up
here
,
”
he
said
.
“
I
am
much
interested
in
it
,
from
a
scientific
standpoint
.
I
predict
that
some
day
the
entire
mountain
will
be
destroyed
by
a
blast
from
the
sky
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
hope
it
wo
n't
be
right
away
,
”
spoke
one
of
the
men
.
“
Now
I
guess
you
folks
had
better
be
leaving
while
there
's
a
path
left
to
go
down
by
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Might
I
ask
,
”
broke
in
Mr.
Parker
,
as
calmly
as
though
he
was
lecturing
to
a
class
of
students
,
“
might
I
ask
if
you
have
noticed
any
peculiar
effect
of
the
lightning
up
here
on
the
summit
of
the
mountain
?
Does
it
fuse
and
melt
rocks
,
so
to
speak
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
What
's
that
?
”
cried
the
spokesman
,
with
a
sudden
flash
of
anger
.
The
two
men
looked
at
each
other
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
wanted
to
know
,
merely
for
scientific
reasons
,
whether
the
lightning
up
here
ever
melted
rocks
?
”
repeated
Mr.
Jenks
.
</p>
<p>
“
Well
,
whether
it
's
for
scientific
reasons
or
for
any
other
,
I
'm
not
going
to
answer
you
!
”
snapped
the
man
.
“
It
's
none
of
your
affair
what
the
lightning
does
up
here
.
Now
you
'd
all
better
'
vamoose'
--
clear
out
!
”
</p>
<p>
“
All
right
--
we
'll
go
,
”
said
Tom
,
quickly
,
at
the
same
time
motioning
to
Mr.
Jenks
to
agree
with
him
.
The
eyes
of
the
young
inventor
were
roving
about
.
He
saw
what
looked
like
a
second
trail
,
leading
down
the
mountain
,
from
the
far
side
of
the
cave
.
He
was
convinced
now
that
there
was
another
way
to
get
to
it
.
Possibly
they
might
find
it
.
At
any
rate
nothing
more
could
be
done
now
.
They
must
go
back
,
for
the
cavern
was
too
well
guarded
to
attempt
to
enter
it
by
force
--
at
least
just
yet
.
</p>
<p>
“
Yes
,
we
'll
go
back
,
”
assented
Mr.
Jenks
.
</p>
<p>
Mr.
Parker
was
tapping
away
at
the
rocks
.
He
looked
toward
the
black
mouth
of
the
big
cave
.
On
what
corresponded
to
the
roof
of
it
,
some
distance
back
from
the
entrance
,
he
saw
a
slender
metal
rod
sticking
up
into
the
air
.
</p>
<p>
“
May
I
ask
if
that
's
a
lightning
rod
?
”
he
inquired
innocently
.
“
If
it
is
,
I
should
like
to
ask
about
its
action
in
a
mountain
that
is
so
impregnated
with
iron
ore
.
</p>
<p>
“
You
may
ask
until
you
get
tired
!
”
cried
the
spokesman
,
again
showing
unreasoning
anger
,
“
but
you
'll
get
no
answer
from
us
.
Now
get
away
from
here
before
we
do
something
desperate
.
You
're
on
private
ground
and
you
're
not
wanted
.
Clear
out
while
you
have
the
chance
.
”
