<p>
The
notion
of
a
<hi rend="italic">
benchmark
dataset
</hi>
for
planes
detection
task
is
not
well
established
in
the
literature
.
Almost
every
reported
method
used
a
different
dataset
,
including
artificially
generated
ones
.
In
and
,
S3DIS
dataset
was
used
.
However
,
it
contains
points
labelled
with
respect
to
objects
â€™
adherence
(
i.
e.
,
a
chair
,
a
table
,
a
lamp
)
rather
than
the
individual
planes
.
On
the
other
hand
,
Li
et
al.
made
use
of
a
laser
scan
(
Room-1
)
from
Rooms
UZH
Irchel
dataset
,
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
does
not
contain
any
labelled
data
.
The
S3DIS
dataset
shows
much
sparser
point
clouds
density
than
in
the
case
of
rooms
from
UZH
Irchel
dataset
.
These
datasets
differ
significantly
in
terms
of
accuracy
,
noise
,
scan
shadows
,
cardinality
,
and
scene
complexity
.
Therefore
,
it
was
decided
to
use
representatives
from
both
of
them
to
verify
the
proposed
method
on
point
clouds
of
varying
nature
.
</p>
<p>
The
present
study
uses
point
clouds
of
the
S3DIS
dataset
and
the
Room-1
point
set
used
by
Li
et
al.
(
Table
2
)
.
</p>
<p>
Because
for
the
Room-1
dataset
no
ground
truth
segmentation
was
provided
,
it
was
labelled
manually
.
The
ground
truth
segmentation
of
the
S3DIS
dataset
,
in
turn
,
was
manually
modified
to
represent
individual
planes
.
An
example
of
six
point
clouds
from
S3DIS
and
Room-1
datasets
are
presented
in
Table
2
.
</p>
<head>

.
Experiments
</head>
<p>
Experiments
were
conducted
in
two
stages
.
At
first
,
the
space
partition
methods
:
PCP
,
octree
,
kd-tree
,
VCCS
,
and
the
proposed
hd-kd-tree
were
examined
.
Secondly
,
planar
clusters
detection
was
assessed
.
</p>
<p>
For
the
space
partition
juxtaposition
,
four
values
were
presented
:
the
division
tree
spreadness
(
number
of
all
nodes
in
division
tree
)
,
the
final
number
of
groups
,
the
number
of
points
,
which
remains
after
the
partition
process
was
accomplished
,
and
the
partition
time
.
All
space
partition
methods
were
tested
on
the
S3DIS
dataset
with
the
same
setup
(
Table
3
)
.
</p>
<p>
A
decision
to
use
quality
measures
applied
by
Dong
et
al.
and
Li
et
al.
for
planar
cluster
detection
was
made
to
clearly
demonstrate
the
superiority
of
the
proposed
method
.
Hence
,
ordinary
plane
precision
(
Equation
(
12
)
)
,
plane
recall
(
Equation
(
13
)
)
and
over-
as
well
as
under-
segmentation
rates
(
Equations
(
14
)
and
eqrefeq
:
usr
)
were
used
as
the
validity
measures
of
the
entire
procedure
.
(
12
)
(
13
)
where
stands
for
a
number
of
correctly
segmented
planar
clusters
(
with
maximum
overlapping
strategy
,
80
%
)
,
represents
the
total
number
of
planar
clusters
obtained
as
the
algorithm
output
,
and
is
a
number
of
ground
truth
planar
clusters
.
(
14
)
(
15
)
where
is
a
number
of
resulting
planar
clusters
that
overlap
the
multiple
ground
truth
planar
clusters
.
,
in
turn
,
is
a
number
of
ground
truth
planar
clusters
overlapping
more
than
one
resulting
planar
cluster
.
