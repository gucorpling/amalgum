<p>
IT
was
a
scene
of
bitter
disputation
.
A
hawk-nosed
young
man
with
a
pointing
finger
was
prominent
.
His
face
worked
violently
,
his
lips
moved
very
rapidly
,
but
what
he
said
was
inaudible
.
</p>
<p>
Behind
him
the
little
rufous
man
with
the
big
eyes
twitched
at
his
robe
and
offered
suggestions
.
</p>
<p>
And
behind
these
two
clustered
a
great
multitude
of
heated
,
excited
,
swarthy
faces
...
.
</p>
<p>
The
emperor
sat
on
his
golden
throne
in
the
midst
of
the
gathering
,
commanding
silence
by
gestures
,
speaking
inaudibly
to
them
in
a
tongue
the
majority
did
not
use
,
and
then
prevailing
.
They
ceased
their
interruptions
,
and
the
old
man
,
Arius
,
took
up
the
debate
.
For
a
time
all
those
impassioned
faces
were
intent
upon
him
;
they
listened
as
though
they
sought
occasion
,
and
suddenly
as
if
by
a
preconcerted
arrangement
they
were
all
thrusting
their
fingers
into
their
ears
and
knitting
their
brows
in
assumed
horror
;
some
were
crying
aloud
and
making
as
if
to
fly
.
Some
indeed
tucked
up
their
garments
and
fled
.
They
spread
out
into
a
pattern
.
They
were
like
the
little
monks
who
run
from
St.
Jerome
's
lion
in
the
picture
by
Carpaccio
.
Then
one
zealot
rushed
forward
and
smote
the
old
man
heavily
upon
the
mouth
...
.
</p>
<p>
The
hall
seemed
to
grow
vaster
and
vaster
,
the
disputing
,
infuriated
figures
multiplied
to
an
innumerable
assembly
,
they
drove
about
like
snowflakes
in
a
gale
,
they
whirled
in
argumentative
couples
,
they
spun
in
eddies
of
contradiction
,
they
made
extraordinary
patterns
,
and
then
amidst
the
cloudy
darkness
of
the
unfathomable
dome
above
them
there
appeared
and
increased
a
radiant
triangle
in
which
shone
an
eye
.
The
eye
and
the
triangle
filled
the
heavens
,
sent
out
flickering
rays
,
glowed
to
a
blinding
incandescence
,
seemed
to
be
speaking
words
of
thunder
that
were
nevertheless
inaudible
.
It
was
as
if
that
thunder
filled
the
heavens
,
it
was
as
if
it
were
nothing
but
the
beating
artery
in
the
sleeper
's
ear
.
The
attention
strained
to
hear
and
comprehend
,
and
on
the
very
verge
of
comprehension
snapped
like
a
fiddle-string
.
</p>
<p>
“
Nicoea
!
”
</p>
<p>
The
word
remained
like
a
little
ash
after
a
flare
.
</p>
<p>
The
sleeper
had
awakened
and
lay
very
still
,
oppressed
by
a
sense
of
intellectual
effort
that
had
survived
the
dream
in
which
it
had
arisen
.
Was
it
so
that
things
had
happened
?
The
slumber-shadowed
mind
,
moving
obscurely
,
could
not
determine
whether
it
was
so
or
not
.
Had
they
indeed
behaved
in
this
manner
when
the
great
mystery
was
established
?
Who
said
they
stopped
their
ears
with
their
fingers
and
fled
,
shouting
with
horror
?
Shouting
?
Was
it
Eusebius
or
Athanasius
?
Or
Sozomen
...
.
Some
letter
or
apology
by
Athanasius
?
...
And
surely
it
was
impossible
that
the
Trinity
could
have
appeared
visibly
as
a
triangle
and
an
eye
.
Above
such
an
assembly
.
</p>
<p>
That
was
mere
dreaming
,
of
course
.
Was
it
dreaming
after
Raphael
?
After
Raphael
?
The
drowsy
mind
wandered
into
a
side
issue
.
Was
the
picture
that
had
suggested
this
dream
the
one
in
the
Vatican
where
all
the
Fathers
of
the
Church
are
shown
disputing
together
?
But
there
surely
God
and
the
Son
themselves
were
painted
with
a
symbol
--
some
symbol
--
also
?
But
was
that
disputation
about
the
Trinity
at
all
?
Was
n't
it
rather
about
a
chalice
and
a
dove
?
Of
course
it
was
a
chalice
and
a
dove
!
Then
where
did
one
see
the
triangle
and
the
eye
?
And
men
disputing
?
Some
such
picture
there
was
...
.
</p>
<p>
What
a
lot
of
disputing
there
had
been
!
What
endless
disputing
!
Which
had
gone
on
.
Until
last
night
.
When
this
very
disagreeable
young
man
with
the
hawk
nose
and
the
pointing
finger
had
tackled
one
when
one
was
sorely
fagged
,
and
disputed
;
disputed
.
Rebuked
and
disputed
.
“
Answer
me
this
,
”
he
had
said
...
.
And
still
one
's
poor
brains
disputed
and
would
not
rest
...
.
About
the
Trinity
...
.
</p>
<p>
The
brain
upon
the
pillow
was
now
wearily
awake
.
It
was
at
once
hopelessly
awake
and
active
and
hopelessly
unprogressive
.
It
was
like
some
floating
stick
that
had
got
caught
in
an
eddy
in
a
river
,
going
round
and
round
and
round
.
And
round
.
Eternally
--
eternally
--
eternally
begotten
.
</p>
<p>
“
But
what
possible
meaning
do
you
attach
then
to
such
a
phrase
as
eternally
begotten
?
”
</p>
<p>
The
brain
upon
the
pillow
stared
hopelessly
at
this
question
,
without
an
answer
,
without
an
escape
.
The
three
repetitions
spun
round
and
round
,
became
a
swiftly
revolving
triangle
,
like
some
electric
sign
that
had
got
beyond
control
,
in
the
midst
of
which
stared
an
unwinking
and
resentful
eye
.
</p>

</p>
<p>
Every
one
knows
that
expedient
of
the
sleepless
,
the
counting
of
sheep
.
</p>
<p>
You
lie
quite
still
,
you
breathe
regularly
,
you
imagine
sheep
jumping
over
a
gate
,
one
after
another
,
you
count
them
quietly
and
slowly
until
you
count
yourself
off
through
a
fading
string
of
phantom
numbers
to
number
Nod
...
.
</p>
<p>
But
sheep
,
alas
!
suggest
an
episcopal
crook
.
