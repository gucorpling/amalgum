THE
POT
OF
GOLD
</head>
<p>
Mary
had
not
been
in
the
Dolan
home
an
hour
until
Katy
knew
all
she
could
tell
of
her
trouble
.
Mrs.
Dolan
was
practical
.
&quot;
Go
to
see
Father
Michael
,
&quot;
she
said
.
&quot;
What
's
he
for
but
to
hilp
us
.
Go
ask
him
what
Jimmy
told
him
.
Till
him
how
you
feel
and
what
you
know
.
He
can
till
you
what
Dannie
knows
and
thin
you
will
understand
where
you
are
at
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Mary
was
on
the
way
before
Mrs.
Dolan
fully
finished
.
She
went
to
the
priest
's
residence
and
asked
his
housekeeper
to
inquire
if
he
would
see
her
.
He
would
,
and
Mary
entered
his
presence
strangely
calm
and
self-possessed
.
This
was
the
last
fight
she
knew
of
that
she
could
make
for
happiness
,
and
if
she
lost
,
happiness
was
over
for
her
.
She
had
need
of
all
her
wit
and
she
knew
it
.
Father
Michael
began
laughing
as
he
shook
hands
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Now
look
here
,
Mary
,
&quot;
he
said
,
&quot;
I
've
been
expecting
you
.
I
warn
you
before
you
begin
that
I
cannot
sanction
your
marriage
to
a
Protestant
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Oh
,
but
I
'm
going
to
convart
him
!
&quot;
cried
Mary
so
quickly
that
the
priest
laughed
harder
than
ever
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
So
that
's
the
lay
of
the
land
!
&quot;
he
chuckled
.
&quot;
Well
,
if
you
'll
guarantee
that
,
I
'll
give
in
.
When
shall
I
read
the
banns
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Not
until
we
get
Dannie
's
consint
,
&quot;
answered
Mary
,
and
for
the
first
her
voice
wavered
.
</p>
<p>
Father
Michael
looked
his
surprise
.
&quot;
Tut
!
Tut
!
&quot;
he
said
.
&quot;
And
is
Dannie
dilatory
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Dannie
is
the
finest
man
that
will
ever
live
in
this
world
,
&quot;
said
Mary
,
&quot;
but
he
do
n't
want
to
marry
me
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
To
my
certain
knowledge
Dannie
has
loved
you
all
your
life
,
&quot;
said
Father
Michael
.
&quot;
He
wants
nothing
here
or
hereafter
as
he
wants
to
marry
you
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Thin
why
do
n't
he
till
me
so
?
&quot;
sobbed
Mary
,
burying
her
burning
face
in
her
hands
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Has
he
said
nothing
to
you
?
&quot;
gravely
inquired
the
priest
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
No
,
he
has
n't
and
I
do
n't
belave
he
intinds
to
,
&quot;
answered
Mary
,
wiping
her
eyes
and
trying
to
be
composed
.
&quot;
There
is
something
about
Jimmy
that
is
holding
him
back
.
Mrs.
Dolan
thought
you
'd
help
me
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
What
do
you
want
me
to
do
,
Mary
?
&quot;
asked
Father
Michael
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Two
things
,
&quot;
answered
Mary
promptly
.
&quot;
I
want
you
to
tell
me
what
Jimmy
confissed
to
you
before
he
died
,
and
then
I
want
you
to
talk
to
Dannie
and
show
him
that
he
is
free
from
any
promise
that
Jimmy
might
have
got
out
of
him
.
Will
you
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
A
dying
confession
--
&quot;
began
the
priest
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Yes
,
but
I
know
--
&quot;
broke
in
Mary
.
&quot;
I
saw
them
fight
,
and
I
heard
Jimmy
till
Dannie
that
he
'd
lied
to
him
to
separate
us
,
but
he
turned
right
around
and
took
it
back
and
I
knew
Dannie
belaved
him
thin
;
but
he
ca
n't
after
Jimmy
confissed
it
again
to
both
of
you
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
What
do
you
mean
by
'
saw
them
fight
?
'
&quot;
Father
Michael
was
leaning
toward
Mary
anxiously
.
</p>
<p>
Mary
told
him
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Then
that
is
the
explanation
to
the
whole
thing
,
&quot;
said
the
priest
.
&quot;
Dannie
did
believe
Jimmy
when
he
took
it
back
,
and
he
died
before
he
could
repeat
to
Dannie
what
he
had
told
me
.
And
I
have
had
the
feeling
that
Dannie
thought
himself
in
a
way
to
blame
for
Jimmy
's
death
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
He
was
not
!
Oh
,
he
was
not
!
&quot;
cried
Mary
Malone
.
&quot;
Did
n't
I
live
there
with
them
all
those
years
?
Dannie
always
was
good
as
gold
to
Jimmy
.
It
was
shameful
the
way
Jimmy
imposed
on
him
,
and
spint
his
money
,
and
took
me
from
him
.
It
was
shameful
!
Shameful
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Be
calm
!
Be
calm
!
&quot;
cautioned
Father
Michael
.
&quot;
I
agree
with
you
.
I
am
only
trying
to
arrive
at
Dannie
's
point
of
view
.
He
well
might
feel
that
he
was
responsible
,
if
after
humoring
Jimmy
like
a
child
all
his
life
,
he
at
last
lost
his
temper
and
dealt
with
him
as
if
he
were
a
man
.
If
that
is
the
case
,
he
is
of
honor
so
fine
,
that
he
would
hesitate
to
speak
to
you
,
no
matter
what
he
suffered
.
And
then
it
is
clear
to
me
that
he
does
not
understand
how
Jimmy
separated
you
in
the
first
place
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
And
lied
me
into
marrying
him
,
whin
I
told
him
over
and
over
how
I
loved
Dannie
.
Jimmy
Malone
took
iverything
I
had
to
give
,
and
he
left
me
alone
for
fiftane
years
,
with
my
three
little
dead
babies
,
that
died
because
I
'd
no
heart
to
desire
life
for
thim
,
and
he
took
my
youth
,
and
he
took
my
womanhood
,
and
he
took
my
man
--
&quot;
Mary
arose
in
primitive
rage
.
&quot;
You
nade
n't
bother
!
&quot;
she
said
.
&quot;
I
'm
going
straight
to
Dannie
meself
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Do
n't
!
&quot;
said
Father
Michael
softly
.
&quot;
Do
n't
do
that
,
Mary
!
It
is
n't
the
accepted
way
.
There
is
a
better
!
Let
him
come
to
you
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
But
he
wo
n't
come
!
He
do
n't
know
!
He
's
in
Jimmy
's
grip
tighter
in
death
than
he
was
in
life
.
&quot;
Mary
began
to
sob
again
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
He
will
come
,
&quot;
said
Father
Michael
.
&quot;
Be
calm
!
Wait
a
little
,
my
child
.
After
all
these
years
,
do
n't
spoil
a
love
that
has
been
almost
unequaled
in
holiness
and
beauty
,
by
anger
at
the
dead
.
Let
me
go
to
Dannie
.
We
are
good
friends
.
I
can
tell
him
Jimmy
made
a
confession
to
me
,
that
he
was
trying
to
repeat
to
him
,
when
punishment
,
far
more
awful
than
anything
you
have
suffered
,
overtook
him
.
Always
remember
,
Mary
,
he
died
unshriven
!
&quot;
Mary
began
to
shiver
.
&quot;
Your
suffering
is
over
,
&quot;
continued
the
priest
.
&quot;
You
have
many
good
years
yet
that
you
may
spend
with
Dannie
;
God
will
give
you
living
children
,
I
am
sure
.
Think
of
the
years
Jimmy
's
secret
has
hounded
and
driven
him
!
Think
of
the
penalty
he
must
pay
before
he
gets
a
glimpse
of
paradise
,
if
he
be
not
eternally
lost
!
&quot;
