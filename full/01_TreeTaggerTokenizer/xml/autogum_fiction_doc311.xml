She
would
have
put
‘
travelling
carriage
’
,
but
she
made
the
letters
too
big
,
so
there
was
no
room
.
The
bag
was
made
INTO
a
bag
with
old
Nurse
’s
sewing
machine
,
and
the
strings
of
it
were
Anthea
’s
and
Jane
’s
best
red
hair
ribbons
.
At
tea-time
,
when
the
boys
had
come
home
with
a
most
unfavourable
report
of
the
St
james
’s
Park
ducks
,
Anthea
ventured
to
awaken
the
Psammead
,
and
to
show
it
its
new
travelling
bag
.
</p>
<p>
‘
Humph
,
’
it
said
,
sniffing
a
little
contemptuously
,
yet
at
the
same
time
affectionately
,
‘
it
’s
not
so
dusty
.
’
</p>
<p>
The
Psammead
seemed
to
pick
up
very
easily
the
kind
of
things
that
people
said
nowadays
.
For
a
creature
that
had
in
its
time
associated
with
Megatheriums
and
Pterodactyls
,
its
quickness
was
really
wonderful
.
</p>
<p>
‘
It
’s
more
worthy
of
me
,
’
it
said
,
‘
than
the
kind
of
bag
that
’s
given
away
with
a
pound
of
plaice
.
When
do
you
propose
to
take
me
out
in
it
?
’
</p>
<p>
‘
I
should
like
a
rest
from
taking
you
or
us
anywhere
,
’
said
Cyril
.
But
Jane
said
--
</p>
<p>
‘
I
want
to
go
to
Egypt
.
I
did
like
that
Egyptian
Princess
that
came
to
marry
the
King
in
Babylon
.
She
told
me
about
the
larks
they
have
in
Egypt
.
And
the
cats
.
Do
let
’s
go
there
.
And
I
told
her
what
the
bird
things
on
the
Amulet
were
like
.
And
she
said
it
was
Egyptian
writing
.
’
</p>
<p>
The
others
exchanged
looks
of
silent
rejoicing
at
the
thought
of
their
cleverness
in
having
concealed
from
Jane
the
terrors
they
had
suffered
in
the
dungeon
below
the
Euphrates
.
</p>
<p>
‘
Egypt
’s
so
nice
too
,
’
Jane
went
on
,
‘
because
of
Doctor
Brewer
’s
Scripture
History
.
I
would
like
to
go
there
when
Joseph
was
dreaming
those
curious
dreams
,
or
when
Moses
was
doing
wonderful
things
with
snakes
and
sticks
.
’
</p>
<p>
‘
I
do
n’t
care
about
snakes
,
’
said
Anthea
shuddering
.
</p>
<p>
‘
Well
,
we
need
n’t
be
in
at
that
part
,
but
Babylon
was
lovely
!
We
had
cream
and
sweet
,
sticky
stuff
.
And
I
expect
Egypt
’s
the
same
.
’
</p>
<p>
There
was
a
good
deal
of
discussion
,
but
it
all
ended
in
everybody
’s
agreeing
to
Jane
’s
idea
.
And
next
morning
directly
after
breakfast
(
which
was
kippers
and
very
nice
)
the
Psammead
was
invited
to
get
into
his
travelling
carriage
.
</p>
<p>
The
moment
after
it
had
done
so
,
with
stiff
,
furry
reluctance
,
like
that
of
a
cat
when
you
want
to
nurse
it
,
and
its
ideas
are
not
the
same
as
yours
,
old
Nurse
came
in
.
</p>
<p>
‘
Well
,
chickies
,
’
she
said
,
‘
are
you
feeling
very
dull
?
’
</p>
<p>
‘
Oh
,
no
,
Nurse
dear
,
’
said
Anthea
;
‘
we
’re
having
a
lovely
time
.
We
’re
just
going
off
to
see
some
old
ancient
relics
.
’
</p>
<p>
‘
Ah
,
’
said
old
Nurse
,
‘
the
Royal
Academy
,
I
suppose
?
Do
n’t
go
wasting
your
money
too
reckless
,
that
’s
all
.
’
</p>
<p>
She
cleared
away
the
kipper
bones
and
the
tea-things
,
and
when
she
had
swept
up
the
crumbs
and
removed
the
cloth
,
the
Amulet
was
held
up
and
the
order
given
--
just
as
Duchesses
(
and
other
people
)
give
it
to
their
coachmen
.
</p>
<p>
‘
To
Egypt
,
please
!
’
said
Anthea
,
when
Cyril
had
uttered
the
wonderful
Name
of
Power
.
</p>
<p>
‘
When
Moses
was
there
,
’
added
Jane
.
</p>
<p>
And
there
,
in
the
dingy
Fitzroy
Street
dining-room
,
the
Amulet
grew
big
,
and
it
was
an
arch
,
and
through
it
they
saw
a
blue
,
blue
sky
and
a
running
river
.
</p>
<p>
‘
No
,
stop
!
’
said
Cyril
,
and
pulled
down
jane
’s
hand
with
the
Amulet
in
it
.
</p>
<p>
‘
What
silly
cuckoos
we
all
are
,
’
he
said
.
‘
Of
course
we
ca
n’t
go
.
We
dare
n’t
leave
home
for
a
single
minute
now
,
for
fear
that
minute
should
be
THE
minute
.
’
</p>
<p>
‘
What
minute
be
WHAT
minute
?
’
asked
Jane
impatiently
,
trying
to
get
her
hand
away
from
Cyril
.
</p>
<p>
‘
The
minute
when
the
Queen
of
Babylon
comes
,
’
said
Cyril
.
And
then
everyone
saw
it
.
</p>
<p>
For
some
days
life
flowed
in
a
very
slow
,
dusty
,
uneventful
stream
.
</p>
<p>
The
children
could
never
go
out
all
at
once
,
because
they
never
knew
when
the
King
of
Babylon
would
go
out
lion
hunting
and
leave
his
Queen
free
to
pay
them
that
surprise
visit
to
which
she
was
,
without
doubt
,
eagerly
looking
forward
.
</p>
<p>
So
they
took
it
in
turns
,
two
and
two
,
to
go
out
and
to
stay
in
.
</p>
<p>
The
stay-at-homes
would
have
been
much
duller
than
they
were
but
for
the
new
interest
taken
in
them
by
the
learned
gentleman
.
</p>
<p>
He
called
Anthea
in
one
day
to
show
her
a
beautiful
necklace
of
purple
and
gold
beads
.
</p>
<p>
‘
I
saw
one
like
that
,
’
she
said
,
‘
in
--
’
</p>
<p>
‘
In
the
British
Museum
,
perhaps
?
’
</p>
<p>
‘
I
like
to
call
the
place
where
I
saw
it
Babylon
,
’
said
Anthea
cautiously
.
</p>
<p>
‘
A
pretty
fancy
,
’
said
the
learned
gentleman
,
‘
and
quite
correct
too
,
because
,
as
a
matter
of
fact
,
these
beads
did
come
from
Babylon
.
’
The
other
three
were
all
out
that
day
.
The
boys
had
been
going
to
the
Zoo
,
and
Jane
had
said
so
plaintively
,
‘
I
’m
sure
I
am
fonder
of
rhinoceroses
than
either
of
you
are
,
’
that
Anthea
had
told
her
to
run
along
then
.
And
she
had
run
,
catching
the
boys
before
that
part
of
the
road
where
Fitzroy
Street
suddenly
becomes
Fitzroy
Square
.
</p>
<p>
‘
I
think
Babylon
is
most
frightfully
interesting
,
’
said
Anthea
.
‘
I
do
have
such
interesting
dreams
about
it
--
at
least
,
not
dreams
exactly
,
but
quite
as
wonderful
.
’
</p>
<p>
‘
Do
sit
down
and
tell
me
,
’
said
he
.
So
she
sat
down
and
told
.
And
he
asked
her
a
lot
of
questions
,
and
she
answered
them
as
well
as
she
could
.
