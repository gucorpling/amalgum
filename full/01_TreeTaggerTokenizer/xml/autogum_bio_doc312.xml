Life
</head>
<p>
He
was
born
into
a
family
from
which
in
the
17th
and
18th
century
a
number
of
prominent
sculptors
emerged
who
were
mainly
active
in
Antwerp
.
His
father
,
the
sculptor
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieter_Verbrugghen_I">
Pieter
Verbrugghen
I
</ref>
,
was
one
of
the
principal
representatives
of
Flemish
high
baroque
sculpture
.
The
father
had
been
a
pupil
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasmus_Quellinus_I">
Erasmus
Quellinus
I
</ref>
,
who
was
himself
the
founder
of
a
prominent
family
of
artists
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-amuz-1">

The
father
married
the
daughter
of
his
master
Erasmus
Quellinus
.
From
this
marriage
Hendrik

Verbruggen
was
born
.

Nonetheless
,
he
did
not
start
his

sculptor

as
a
draughtsman

with

It
can
not
be
ruled
out
that
like
his
brother
Pieter
,
he
made
a
trip
to
Italy
after
completing
his
training
.
This
trip
has
not

that
his

In

<p>
Hendrik
Frans
Verbruggen
was
active
during
the
Baroque
period
when
the
Catholic
Church
was
the
main
sponsor
of
artists
in
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Netherlands">
Southern
Netherlands
</ref>
.
He
therefore
worked
principally
on
religious
commissions
and
became
one
of
the
leading
sculptors
of
the
late
Baroque
church
furniture
.
This
furniture
has
more
depth
than
the
high
baroque
altars
of
his
father
and
brother
.
The
three-dimensional
altars
are
often
designed
to
allow
the
placing
of
a
sculpture
although
sometimes
they
served
to
hang
a
painting
.
The
latter
is
the
case
in
the
St.
Augustine
Church
in
Antwerp
,
where
a
painting
by
Rubens
has
been
placed
in
the
altar
.
Hendrik
Frans
Verbruggen
was
one
of
the
founders
of
the
so-called
naturalistic
pulpits
.
These
appear
as
a
single
grand
sculpture
in
which
the
constructive
form
disappears
.
Examples
are
the
pulpit
in
St.
Augustine
Church
in
Antwerp
and
the
pulpit
designed
for
the
Church
of
Saint
Michael
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leuven">
Leuven
</ref>
(
now
in
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral_of_St._Michael_and_St._Gudula">
Cathedral
of
Brussels
</ref>
)
.

In
the
pulpit
of
the
St.
Augustine
Church
in
Antwerp
he
used
the
grain
of
the
wood
to
depict
the
wrinkles
of
the
face
of
St.
Augustine
and
the
texture
of
his
clothes
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Ox-4">

</ref>
</p>
<p>
In
1684
he
created
two
limewood
side
altars
for
the
Chapel
of
the
Church
of
Our
Lady
of
Good
Will
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duffel">
Duffel
</ref>
.
Through
this
work
he
introduced
into
the
Southern
Netherlands
a
new
motif
derived
from
the
work
of
Bernini
,
consisting
of
an
oval
painting
supported
by
two
flying
angels
.
His
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altar_rails">
altar
rails
</ref>
for
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Walburga_Church_(Bruges)">
St.
Walburga
Church
</ref>
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruges">
Bruges
</ref>
from
1695
are
a
highlight
of
Flemish
baroque
.
Because
of
the
virtuoso
treatment
of
the
marble
they
appear
to
be
modeled
in
wax
.

<p>
In
the
Baroque
worldview
,
art
was
expected
to
educate
the
faithful
and
encourage
them
in
their
faith
.
The
motifs
of
Hendrik
Frans
Verbruggen
often
reflect
this
didactic
purpose
.
An
example
is
the
late-Baroque
pulpit
in
the
St.
Peter
and
Paul
Church
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechelen">
Mechelen
</ref>
date
1700
.
The
pulpit
allegorically
represents
the
four
continents
sitting
on
a
globe
accompanied
by
their
symbolic
animals
.
They
carry
a
tub
in
which
the
attributes
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Evangelists">
evangelists
</ref>
and
four
medallions
with
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesuit">
Jesuit
</ref>
saints
are
chiseled
.
Two
angels
blowing
trumpets
support
the
sound
board
depicting
the
Holy
Spirit
.
The
didactic
theme
is
obvious
:
faith
is
spreading
across
the
world
thanks
to
the
Jesuits
inspired
by
the
Holy
Spirit
.
