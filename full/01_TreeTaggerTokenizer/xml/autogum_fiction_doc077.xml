THE
ARABIAN
TUNNEL
</head>
<p>
That
same
evening
,
in
21
Â°30
'
N.
lat
.
,
the
Nautilus
floated
on
the
surface
of
the
sea
,
approaching
the
Arabian
coast
.
I
saw
Djeddah
,
the
most
important
counting-house
of
Egypt
,
Syria
,
Turkey
,
and
India
.
I
distinguished
clearly
enough
its
buildings
,
the
vessels
anchored
at
the
quays
,
and
those
whose
draught
of
water
obliged
them
to
anchor
in
the
roads
.
The
sun
,
rather
low
on
the
horizon
,
struck
full
on
the
houses
of
the
town
,
bringing
out
their
whiteness
.
Outside
,
some
wooden
cabins
,
and
some
made
of
reeds
,
showed
the
quarter
inhabited
by
the
Bedouins
.
Soon
Djeddah
was
shut
out
from
view
by
the
shadows
of
night
,
and
the
Nautilus
found
herself
under
water
slightly
phosphorescent
.
</p>
<p>
The
next
day
,
the
10th
of
February
,
we
sighted
several
ships
running
to
windward
.
The
Nautilus
returned
to
its
submarine
navigation
;
but
at
noon
,
when
her
bearings
were
taken
,
the
sea
being
deserted
,
she
rose
again
to
her
waterline
.
</p>
<p>
Accompanied
by
Ned
and
Conseil
,
I
seated
myself
on
the
platform
.
The
coast
on
the
eastern
side
looked
like
a
mass
faintly
printed
upon
a
damp
fog
.
</p>
<p>
We
were
leaning
on
the
sides
of
the
pinnace
,
talking
of
one
thing
and
another
,
when
Ned
Land
,
stretching
out
his
hand
towards
a
spot
on
the
sea
,
said
:
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Do
you
see
anything
there
,
sir
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
No
,
Ned
,
&quot;
I
replied
;
&quot;
but
I
have
not
your
eyes
,
you
know
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Look
well
,
&quot;
said
Ned
,
&quot;
there
,
on
the
starboard
beam
,
about
the
height
of
the
lantern
!
Do
you
not
see
a
mass
which
seems
to
move
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Certainly
,
&quot;
said
I
,
after
close
attention
;
&quot;
I
see
something
like
a
long
black
body
on
the
top
of
the
water
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
And
certainly
before
long
the
black
object
was
not
more
than
a
mile
from
us
.
It
looked
like
a
great
sandbank
deposited
in
the
open
sea
.
It
was
a
gigantic
dugong
!
</p>
<p>
Ned
Land
looked
eagerly
.
His
eyes
shone
with
covetousness
at
the
sight
of
the
animal
.
His
hand
seemed
ready
to
harpoon
it
.
One
would
have
thought
he
was
awaiting
the
moment
to
throw
himself
into
the
sea
and
attack
it
in
its
element
.
</p>
<p>
At
this
instant
Captain
Nemo
appeared
on
the
platform
.
He
saw
the
dugong
,
understood
the
Canadian
's
attitude
,
and
,
addressing
him
,
said
:
</p>
<p>
&quot;
If
you
held
a
harpoon
just
now
,
Master
Land
,
would
it
not
burn
your
hand
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Just
so
,
sir
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
And
you
would
not
be
sorry
to
go
back
,
for
one
day
,
to
your
trade
of
a
fisherman
and
to
add
this
cetacean
to
the
list
of
those
you
have
already
killed
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
should
not
,
sir
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Well
,
you
can
try
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Thank
you
,
sir
,
&quot;
said
Ned
Land
,
his
eyes
flaming
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Only
,
&quot;
continued
the
Captain
,
&quot;
I
advise
you
for
your
own
sake
not
to
miss
the
creature
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Is
the
dugong
dangerous
to
attack
?
&quot;
I
asked
,
in
spite
of
the
Canadian
's
shrug
of
the
shoulders
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Yes
,
&quot;
replied
the
Captain
;
&quot;
sometimes
the
animal
turns
upon
its
assailants
and
overturns
their
boat
.
But
for
Master
Land
this
danger
is
not
to
be
feared
.
His
eye
is
prompt
,
his
arm
sure
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
At
this
moment
seven
men
of
the
crew
,
mute
and
immovable
as
ever
,
mounted
the
platform
.
One
carried
a
harpoon
and
a
line
similar
to
those
employed
in
catching
whales
.
The
pinnace
was
lifted
from
the
bridge
,
pulled
from
its
socket
,
and
let
down
into
the
sea
.
Six
oarsmen
took
their
seats
,
and
the
coxswain
went
to
the
tiller
.
Ned
,
Conseil
,
and
I
went
to
the
back
of
the
boat
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
You
are
not
coming
,
Captain
?
&quot;
I
asked
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
No
,
sir
;
but
I
wish
you
good
sport
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
boat
put
off
,
and
,
lifted
by
the
six
rowers
,
drew
rapidly
towards
the
dugong
,
which
floated
about
two
miles
from
the
Nautilus
.
</p>
<p>
Arrived
some
cables-length
from
the
cetacean
,
the
speed
slackened
,
and
the
oars
dipped
noiselessly
into
the
quiet
waters
.
Ned
Land
,
harpoon
in
hand
,
stood
in
the
fore
part
of
the
boat
.
The
harpoon
used
for
striking
the
whale
is
generally
attached
to
a
very
long
cord
which
runs
out
rapidly
as
the
wounded
creature
draws
it
after
him
.
But
here
the
cord
was
not
more
than
ten
fathoms
long
,
and
the
extremity
was
attached
to
a
small
barrel
which
,
by
floating
,
was
to
show
the
course
the
dugong
took
under
the
water
.
</p>
<p>
I
stood
and
carefully
watched
the
Canadian
's
adversary
.
This
dugong
,
which
also
bears
the
name
of
the
halicore
,
closely
resembles
the
manatee
;
its
oblong
body
terminated
in
a
lengthened
tail
,
and
its
lateral
fins
in
perfect
fingers
.
Its
difference
from
the
manatee
consisted
in
its
upper
jaw
,
which
was
armed
with
two
long
and
pointed
teeth
which
formed
on
each
side
diverging
tusks
.
</p>
<p>
This
dugong
which
Ned
Land
was
preparing
to
attack
was
of
colossal
dimensions
;
it
was
more
than
seven
yards
long
.
It
did
not
move
,
and
seemed
to
be
sleeping
on
the
waves
,
which
circumstance
made
it
easier
to
capture
.
</p>
<p>
The
boat
approached
within
six
yards
of
the
animal
.
The
oars
rested
on
the
rowlocks
.
I
half
rose
.
Ned
Land
,
his
body
thrown
a
little
back
,
brandished
the
harpoon
in
his
experienced
hand
.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly
a
hissing
noise
was
heard
,
and
the
dugong
disappeared
.
The
harpoon
,
although
thrown
with
great
force
;
had
apparently
only
struck
the
water
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Curse
it
!
&quot;
exclaimed
the
Canadian
furiously
;
&quot;
I
have
missed
it
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
No
,
&quot;
said
I
;
&quot;
the
creature
is
wounded
--
look
at
the
blood
;
but
your
weapon
has
not
stuck
in
his
body
.
&quot;
