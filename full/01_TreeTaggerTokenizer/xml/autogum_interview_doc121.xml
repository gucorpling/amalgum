Description
by
researcher
Michael
Mazilu
:
&quot;
The
picture
shows
:
in
the
middle
the
vacuum
chamber
with
the
focussing
and
collecting
microscope
objectives
.
The
microscopic
gyroscope
is
levitated
by
the
laser
beam
coming
from
below
which
at
the
same
time
is
used
to
apply
a
torque
to
the
gyroscope
.
We
detect
the
rotation
and
oscillation
of
the
gyroscope
using
the
light
scattered
by
it
and
collected
by
the
top
microscope
objective
.

The
experiment
was
designed
to
explore
the
boundary
between
conventional
physics
,
which
applies
to
larger
objects
,
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quantum%20physics">
quantum
physics
</ref>
,
which
applies
only
to
extremely
small
objects
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subatomic%20particle">
Subatomic
particles

obey
a
very
different
set
of
rules
than
the
items
we
see
every
day
,
but
the
behaviour
of
particles
at
just
above
quantum
levels
remains
enigmatic
.

<p>
The
team
wanted
to
expand
upon
research
using
single
atoms
or
<ref target="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/molecule">
molecules
</ref>
,
instead
constructing
a
four-

sphere
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/calcium%20carbonate">

,
in
a
crystaline
form
called
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vaterite">

</ref>
,
in
a
bid
to
examine
systems
containing
over
a
million

.
The
ball
was
so
small
it
could
be

;
light
beams
exert
a

</p>
<p>
With
the
ball
held
within
a
<ref target="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vacuum">
vacuum
</ref>
by
a
laser
trap
,
the
scientists
were
able
to
apply
a
twisting
force
through
the
light

as
it
passed
through

The
vacuum
eliminated

so
that
scientists
could
look
for
evidence
of
quantum

a
proposed

that

without
external
assistance
.

The
spinning
sphere
turned
into
a

The

by

Arita
,
Dr.

Mazilu

and
Professor

What
first
got
you
interested
in
researching
quantum
friction
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Michael
Mazilu
</hi>
:
The
fundamental
aspect
that
raised
our
interest
is
the
mechanism
that
stops
an
object
[
rotating
]
infinitely
fast
in
absence
of
friction
.
Quantum
friction
is
one
possible
but
debatable
mechanism
that
will
ultimately
limit
the
rotation
rate
.
One
can
also
imagine
other
interesting
mechanisms
and
we
hope
that
future
experiments
will
be
able
to
conclusively
distinguish
between
them
.
