A
team
of
archaeologists
excavating
an
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient%20Egypt">
Ancient
Egyptian

tomb
have
discovered
golden
jewelry
in
a
recently-discovered
lower
chamber
at
the

Two
golden
rings
and
five
golden
earrings
were
found
in
the
tomb
of
Djehuty
,
an
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighteenth%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">
18th-dynasty
</ref>
official
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatshepsut">
Queen
Hatshepsut
</ref>
,
and
were
probably
the
property
of
Djehuty
or
his
family
.
</p>
<p>
The
discovery
was
announced
by
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farouk%20Hosni">

Djehuty
was
overseer
of
the
treasury
and
overseer
of
works
for
the
Queen
.
Hatshepsut
reigned
approximately
1479
–
1458
BCE
.
Djehuty
was
responsible
for
managing
the
huge
amounts
of
precious
goods
brought
in
from
Egypt
's
military
expedition
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land%20of%20Punt">
Punt
</ref>
in
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn%20of%20Africa">
Horn
of
Africa
</ref>
and
the
vast
building
projects
of
Hatshepsut
which
have
made
the
female
pharaoh
one
of
the
most-remembered
of
any
from
ancient
Egypt
.
</p>
<p>
Djehuty
died
after
Hatshepsut
did
,
sometime
during
the
reign
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thutmosis%20III">
Thutmosis
III
</ref>
.
Both
Hatshepsut
's
and
Thutmosis
's
names
are
recorded
on
the
tomb
.
In
a
fashion
typical
of
ancient
Egyptian
rivalries
,
Hatshepsut
's
name
was
partly
obscured
on
the
monument
over
the
tomb
sometime
after
the
queen
's
death
.

The
team
,
led
by
José
Manuel
Galán
of
the
National
Research
Center
(
Consejo
Superior
de
Investigaciones
Científicas
,
CSIC
)
,
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid">
Madrid
</ref>
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain">

</ref>
,
had
been
excavating
the
tomb
,
designated
TT11
and
located
in
the
necropolis
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dra'%20Abu%20el-Naga'">
Dra
'
Abu
el-Naga
'
</ref>
,
since
2002
.
While
much
of
Djehuty
's
funerary
equipment
was
lost
to
fire
in
antiquity
,
the
lower
chamber
of
his
tomb
was
concealed
at
the
end
of
a
three-meter
shaft
and
discovered
at
the
end
of
2008
.
</p>
<p>
A
superficial
description
of
the
tomb
itself
was
recorded
almost
two
hundred
years
ago
by
19th-century
French
Egyptologist
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-François%20Champollion">

,
rubble
blocking
the
entrance
hindered
excavation
until
the
21st
century
.
In
that
time
,
emphasis
in
Egyptology
has
changed
from
the
cataloging
of
treasures
to
the
investigation
of
ancient
culture
,
life
and
religion
.
</p>
<p>
Since
excavation
began
,
Djehuty
's
tomb
has
yielded
a
number
of
surprises
.
It
was
discovered
that
the
tomb
was
re-used
repeatedly
up
to
and
during
the
Greco-Roman
period
.
There
is
an
unusual
face-on
depiction
of
pharaoh
Thutmosis
III
hunting
ducks
,
and
the
mummy
of
a
young
,
bejewelled
,
as-yet
unidentified
woman
.

<p>
In
2007
,
44
preserved
bunches
of
flowers
thought
to
be
from
Djehuty
's
funeral
were
found
in
the
site
.
In
their
8th
season
of
excavation
,
which
ended
on
February
22
,
2009
,
the
team
also
found
considerable
evidence
that
below
Djehuty
's
tomb
is
a
network
of
burial
sites
from
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleventh%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">
11th
dynasty
</ref>
,
four
thousand
years
old
.
</p>
<p>
The
lower
chamber
also
displays
passages
from
the
Egyptian
funerary
text

<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book%20of%20the%20Dead">

<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nut%20(goddess)">

</ref>
,
an
embodiment
of
the
heavens
,
on
the
ceiling
.
The
names
of
Djehuty
and
his
parents
were
also
intact
in
the
second
chamber
;
the
names
were
defaced
in
the
previously-known
first
chamber
of
the
tomb
,
which
had
also
been
looted
.
</p>
<p>
According
to
a
press
release
from
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zahi%20Hawass">
Dr.
Zahi
Hawass
</ref>
,
Secretary
General
of
Egypt
’s
Supreme
Council
of
Antiquities
,
Djehuty
's
tomb
is
only
the
fifth
known
decorated
burial
chamber
of
the
18th
dynasty
.
An
additional
unusual
feature
of
the
tomb
is
that
its
upper
chamber
is
decorated
in
relief
,
rather
than
simply
paint
.
When
the
excavation
is
completed
,
Dr
Galán
's
team
plans
to
open
the
site
to
the
public
as
the
carved
stoneworks
will
not
be
destroyed
by
tourists
'
activities
as
paint
would
.
</p>
<p>
The
identification
of
Djehuty
is
a
complicated
one
,
as
a
number
of
officials
of
the
18th
dynasty
bore
the
name
,
including
a
general
and
several
governors
.
The
name
itself
is
an
alternate
transliteration
of
the
name
of
the
Egyptian
god
usually
written
in
English
as
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoth">
Thoth
</ref>
.
