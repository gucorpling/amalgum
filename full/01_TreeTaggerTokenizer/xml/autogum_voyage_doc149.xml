The

accessible
through
a
two
paved
and
some
unpaved
roads
climbing
in
the
slopes
of
Dikti
mountain
,
so
you
get'n
by
car
,
bus
,
motocycle
,
bicycle
.
The
most
well-known
paved
road
climbs
up
to
900m
,
and
enters
from
<hi rend="italic">

The

from
the
villages

the
unpaved

There

Andron
</hi>
,
some
facilities
,
and
connecting
it
with
the
rest
of
the
island
's
road
network
.
Because
the
plateau
's
economy
runs
primary
on
agriculture
,
an
agricultural
road
network
developed
for
access
in
the
fields
,
and
transporting

,
recently
some
of

roads
widened

almost
)
every
village

nearly
nothing
else
to
buy
,
however
because
of
first
sector
economy
you

around
200,000
tonnes
of
potatoes
)
,
carrots

Τhirstiness
strikes
hard
in

summer
days

Fortunately

there
are
coffee
shops

cafes
locally
.
The
coffee
shops
are
mostly
gathering
sites
for
elderly
people
and
the
cafes
,
for
younger
ones
,
because
they
have
billiards
tables

betting
and
coin

PC

.
More
English
is
spoken
in
the
cafes
