after

Hi
!
My
wife
and
I
were
visiting
Canada
for
2
weeks
,
Southern
Quebec
and
Southern
Ontario
.
Just
wanted
to
list
a
couple
of
things
that
were
needed
to
get
used
to
during
our
stay
that
are
different
in
Europe
.
Mind
you
,
not
all
apply
as
Europe
too
is
very
diverse
,
so
I
'm
sure
others
have
been
surprised
by
other
things
and
some
were
not
surprised
by
my
points
at
all
,
but
here
goes
:
1
.
Being
&quot;
Sorry
&quot;
.
We
found
Canadians
say
sorry
for
the
smallest
misfortunes
or
mishaps
,
like
not
holding
the
door
long
enough
,
brushing
their
arm
against
yours
,
interrupting
you
or
whatever
.
2
.
Salespersons
being
overly
polite
and
helpful
.
I
guess
this
applies
to
the
States
too
.
Once
you
walk
into
a
store
,
you
have
practically
no
time
for
yourself
,
as
there
is
a
salesperson
trying
to
aid
you
to
the
point
of
it
getting
a
bit
annoying
.
Maybe
it
's
a
trick
to
make
you
buy
something
out
of
pure
guilt
.
3
.
Speeding
.
We
had
a
rented
car
.
The
highway
tipped
limit
is
at
100
km/h
.
I
read
the
fines
are
pretty
high
and
there
are
multiple
radars
everywhere
,
so
I
stuck
to
the
limit
...
I
was
the
only
one
.
Everyone
,
trucks
included
drove
105-115
km/h
,
just
not
100
.
4
.
All
highway
lanes
are
equal
.
Overtaking
on
the
right
is
just
as
fine
as
on
the
left
.
Trucks
on
the
middle
lane
are
common
.
In
most
European
countries
,
overtaking
on
the
&quot;
outer
&quot;
lane
is
penalized
.
5
.
Tipping
.
So
,
I
read
up
and
prepared
myself
to
tip
at
15
%
,
which
seemed
like
going
with
the
norm
.
The
service
I
got
in
restaurants
and
bars
was
top
notch
,
but
so
is
the
service
in
Europe
,
where
tipping
is
less
common
and
usually
lower
than
15
%
.
Also
,
there
was
no
reaction
from
any
of
the
waiters
to
just
let
me
know
whether
the
tip
was
high
enough
or
too
low
...
6
.
Shelf
prices
without
tax
.
So
the
prices
on
products
(
tickets
,
tags
)
are
all
net
,
pre
tax
.
Either
you
calculate
what
you
are
going
to
pay
or
just
find
out
at
the
cashier
.
Very
frustrating
,
especially
if
you
are
on
a
tight
budget
.
This
is
most
annoying
in
restaurants
,
as
there
is
also
a
tip
.
So
,
if
a
meal
is
priced
at
30
CAD
,
the
taxes
(
yes
,
there
are
several
)
are
15
%
and
you
plan
to
tip
15
%
,
you
'll
actually
pay
39
CAD
.
My
(
subjective
)
observations
.
Feel
free
to
add
or
comment
if
this
does
n't
fit
...

Would
you
say
people
in
Québec
said
sorry
as
much
as
people
in
Ontario
?
</p>
<p>
I
noticed
we
might
have
caught
this
too
when
I
heard
my
Québécois
colleague
apologize
after
she
sneezed
.
