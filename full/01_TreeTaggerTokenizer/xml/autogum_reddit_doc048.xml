I
'm
not
prepared
.
Honestly
.
My
FL
scores
have
n't
been
too
hot
and
I
put
too
much
faith
in
my
own
improvement
in
a
short
amount
of
time
so
I
'm
past
the
point
of
no
return
.
</p>
<p>
But
I
'm
proud
of
myself
for
at
least
getting
this
far
.
I
'm
a
non
trad
and
I
chickened
out
of
even
taking
it
when
I
first
finished
undergrad
.
Barring
an
act
of
God
I
'm
probably
going
to
be
retaking
but
I
'm
honestly
glad
I
'm
going
through
with
it
at
least
.
</p>
<p>
I
do
n't
want
to
go
to
my
grave
and
think
I
never
really
tried
to
go
for
my
dream
.
Whatever
happens
tomorrow
I
want
you
all
to
remember
that
.
Even
if
the
absolute
worst
happens
at
least
you
had
the
balls
to
try
.
Lots
of
people
just
settle
and
keep
their
heads
down
.
That
was
me
for
a
long
time
.
No
more
.
I
'm
at
least
gonna
go
down
swinging
.
</p>
<p>
Edit
:
I
got
destroyed
by
C
P.
I
think
I
have
at
least
fighting
chance
in
the
other
sections
,
especially
CARs
which
is
usually
my
jam
.
But
holy
shit
.
I
feel
like
I
got
all
the
Physics
and
Orgo
wrong
.
