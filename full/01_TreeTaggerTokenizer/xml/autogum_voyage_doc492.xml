History
</head>
<p>
The
mountain
has
been
a
place
of
Taoist
worship
for
over
1500
years
,
and
its
remoteness
protected
it
from
the
turmoil
of
the
20th
century
.
The
first
ropeway
was
built
in
the
1990s
,
and
the
second
about
a
decade
later
.
It
became
a
National
Geopark
in
2005
,
a
UNESCO
World
Heritage
Site
in
2008
,
and
a
UNESCO
Global
Geopark
in
2015
.

Sanqingshan
has
a
large
number
of
strangely-shaped
rocks
and
twisted
trees
.
Many
of
the
trees
are
ancient
rhododendrons
,
so
the
mountain
is
covered
in
flowers
in
May
.
</p>
<p>
The
spectacular
rock
features
are
clustered
mainly
in
the
southern
half
of
the
mountaintop
area
.
It

around
a
number

an

of
sights
arranged

up
the
mountain
to

entrance
.
This
has
been
a
place
of
Taoist

The

,
but
appears

and
can
be
climbed
in

an
hour
.
There
is
a
small
shrine
at
the
top

Eat
</head>
<p>
Food
is
available
in
various
places

There
