Introduction
</head>
<p>
Echinochrome
A
(
Ech
A
)
is
a
dark
red
pigment
separated
from
sea
urchin
shell
and
spine
and
has
a
chemical
structure
of
6-ethyl-2,3,5,7,8-pentahydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone
.
As
a
main
active
component
of
a
commercial
therapeutic
agent
called
‘
histochrome
’
,
Ech
A
has
been
used
for
the
treatment
of
cardiovascular
disorders
and
ophthalmopathic
complications
in
Russia
.
Among
the
several
biological
benefits
of
Ech
A
,
anti-oxidant
and
anti-inflammatory
capacity
is
proposed
as
a
major
underlying
therapeutic
mechanism
.
Indeed
,
Ech
A
has
been
shown
to
attenuate
the
oxidative
stress
caused
by
reactive
oxygen
species
(
ROS
)
and
cardiac
toxic
drugs
,
providing
mitochondrial
protection
of
cardiomyocyte
.
Park
et
al.
have
reported
similar
observations
showing
that
Ech
A
reduced
both
cellular
and
mitochondrial
ROS
levels
of
patient-derived
cardiac
progenitors
during
the
oxidative
stress
situation
.
The
anti-oxidative
and
anti-viral
activity
of
Ech
A
has
also
been
proved
in
vitro
using
a
tick-borne
encephalitis
virus
and
herpes
simplex
virus
type
1-infected
cell
models
.
The
therapeutic
potential
of
Ech
A
was
also
evaluated
in
an
experimental
gastric
ulcer
model
where
Ech
A
provided
anti-ulcerogenic
effects
by
increasing
endogenous
enzymatic
and
non-enzymatic
antioxidant
levels
in
vivo
.
In
another
study
,
Ech
A
treatment
could
reduce
ROS
production
and
pro-inflammatory
tumor
necrosis
factor-α
(
TNF-α
)
secretion
in
a
rat
model
of
acute
uveitis
induced
by
lipopolysaccharide
injection
.
These
previous
findings
imply
that
Ech
A
could
exert
a
wide
range
of
therapeutic
impacts
on
other
oxidative
stress-related
and
inflammatory
pathologic
conditions
;
however
,
the
cell-type
specific
regulation
of
Ech
A
on
the
immune
system
,
which
consists
of
various
innate
and
adaptive
immune
cells
,
has
not
been
elucidated
yet
.
</p>
<p>
Inflammatory
bowel
disease
(
IBD
)
is
an
intractable
,
chronic
inflammatory
disease
of
the
digestive
tract
and
Crohn
's
disease
(
CD
)
and
ulcerative
colitis
(
UC
)
are
the
major
types
of
IBD
.
The
etiology
and
pathogenic
mechanisms
of
IBD
remain
largely
unknown
and
both
environmental
factors
and
genetic
factors
combined
with
immunological
dysfunction
seem
to
drive
IBD
development
.
To
attenuate
the
excessive
immune
response
,
advanced
immunotherapy
using
immune-modulators
such
as
inflammatory
cytokine
blockers
has
been
used
recently
;
however
,
the
presence
of
non-responder
and
uncontrolled
side
effects
are
the
common
challenging
issues
when
using
immunotherapy
.
Therefore
,
there
has
been
an
unmet
need
to
develop
novel
therapeutics
for
the
effective
management
of
IBD
.
</p>
<p>
In
this
study
,
we
investigated
whether
Ech
A
could
exhibit
a
protective
role
in
IBD
progression
using
a
chemical
colitogen
dextran
sodium
sulfate
(
DSS)-induced
colitis
mice
model
.
To
explore
the
therapeutic
mechanism
of
Ech
A
,
we
also
performed
in
vitro
proliferation
and
polarization
experiments
with
two
major
innate
and
adaptive
immune
cells
,
macrophage
and
CD4+
helper
T
cells
(
Th
cells
)
,
respectively
.
Our
in
vivo
findings
suggest
that
Ech
A
could
attenuate
the
clinical
signs
,
as
well
as
histological
improvement
,
for
the
first
time
in
a
colitis
model
which
represents
IBD
.
More
importantly
,
in
vitro
results
demonstrate
that
the
anti-inflammatory
function
of
Ech
A
is
manifested
by
,
in
part
,
inducing
immunomodulatory
effector
cells
,
such
as
M2
macrophages
and
Treg
cells
.
