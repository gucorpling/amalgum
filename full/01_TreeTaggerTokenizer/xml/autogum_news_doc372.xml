Police
chief
Hidayat
Rote
Island
,
speaking
to
Fairfax
Media
,
said
the
second
boat
was
adrift
:
&quot;
They
were
rescued
by
the
locals
,
because
the
boat
engines
were
dead
.
The
boat
now
is
wreckage
,
near
some
reefs
.

<p>
The
Australian
government
had
also
planned
to
purchase
additional
lifeboats
for
refugee
expulsion
from
Australian
waters
,

reported
.

Tony
Abbott
commented
.
Last
Thursday
,
he
supported
lack
of
transparency
on
the
issue
by
saying
&quot;
I
'd
rather
be
criticised
a
bit
for
being
a
bit
of
a
closed
book
on
the
issue
,
and
actually
stop
the
boats
.
I
'm
pleased
to
say
that
it
's
now
several
weeks
since
we
've
had
a
boat
,
and
the
less
we
talk
about
operational
details
on
the
water
,
the
better
when
it
comes
to
stopping
the
boats
.

seeking
explanation
from
the
Australian

it
reported
in

briefing
this
Saturday
.
The
UNRA
spokesperson
,
Babar
Baloch
,
raised
legal
concerns
by
saying
that
&quot;
Any
such
approach
would
raise
significant
issues
and
potentially
could
place
Australia
in
breach
of
its
obligations
under
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention%20relating%20to%20the%20Status%20of%20Refugees">

Convention

and
international
law
.
If
people
who
are
in
need
for
international
protection
seek
a
country
's
safety
,
then
they
must
be
allowed
to
go
through
a
process
which
helps
to
determine
if
these
people
are
in
need
.
