Implications

<p>
To
mitigate
environmental
inequality
,
the
most
fundamental
method
is
to
thoroughly
solve
the
problem
of
environmental
destruction
and
pollution
.
However
,
due
to
the
still
prominent
contradiction
between
socioeconomic
development
and
the
environment
at
the
current
stage
in
China
,
a
more
realistic
approach
is
to
promote
more
even
distribution
of
environmental
benefits
to
the
vulnerable
groups
while
gradually
governing
environmental
problems
and
reducing
the
environmental
burden
on
vulnerable
groups
.
Specifically
,
some
clues
for
policies
related
to
more
efficient
ecological
management
and
environmental
regulations
have
been
provided
here
.
</p>
<p>
First
,
environmental
resources
should
be
developed
and
utilized
according
to
the
concepts
of
an
ecological
civilization
and
tertiarization
.
The
counties
where
a
large
part
of
the
environmentally
vulnerable
groups
live
,
such
as
rural
areas
and
peripheral
areas
of
the
economic
zones
,
often
have
unique
ecological
advantages
,
including
beautiful
natural
landscapes
,
unique
folk
customs
,
and
pluralism
of
traditional
culture
.
However
,
disadvantageous
conditions
that
are
present
during
the
current
stage
of
industrialization
of
civilization
can
be
changed
into
advantages
under
the
perspective
of
an
ecological
civilization
,
where
new
values
can
be
formed
and
environmental
resources
are
reassessed
.
With
the
emergence
and
rise
of
the
middle
class
in
China
,
which
prefers
that
consumption
patterns
exhibit
ecological
considerations
,
the
development
and
utilization
of
environmental
resources
should
follow
the
pattern
of
creative
industries
,
such
as
providing
leisure
travel
with
ecological
experiences
.
This
type
of
industry
is
likely
to
obtain
higher
rates
of
value-added
benefits
from
environmental
resources
,
thus
making
correction
of
environmental
inequality
possible
via
increasing
compensation
to
environmentally
vulnerable
groups
.
</p>
<p>
Second
,
the
benefits
of
sharing
should
be
realized
by
localized
development
of
environmental
resources
.
A
large
number
of
cases
in
practice
show
that
the
development
of
local
environmental
resources
is
dominated
by
external
capital
,
which
makes
the
incremental
benefits
difficult
to
distribute
to
the
residents
in
the
region
,
while
the
costs
and
risks
are
borne
by
the
local
residents
.
To
change
this
dilemma
,
local
governments
should
be
allowed
to
participate
in
the
exploitation
of
environmental
and
ecological
resources
in
an
equitable
manner
.
This
can
not
only
provide
a
good
environment
for
the
benefit
of
the
public
at
a
low
cost
,
but
also
contribute
to
the
localization
(
Localization
,
as
another
trend
compared
to
globalization
,
refers
to
any
economic
activities
in
a
region
or
country
that
must
be
adapted
to
local
needs
for
development
to
occur
.
)
of
the
resource
capitalization
process
.
For
example
,
an
appropriate
method
of
sustainable
development
is
to
value
the
elements
of
the
local
ecological
environment
and
to
form
a
community
with
shared
interests
consisting
of
local
residents
who
can
negotiate
with
external
profit-making
developers
.
This
type
of
collective
negotiation
can
guarantee
that
the
vulnerable
groups
and
those
investing
capital
can
equally
enjoy
the
benefits
of
development
of
localized
resources
.
This
can
help
to
break
the
attachment
of
the
vulnerable
groups
,
including
the
peripheral
counties
within
the
economic
zones
,
to
other
agents
,
especially
external
capital
,
and
completely
change
their
environmentally
vulnerable
status
.
</p>
<p>
Finally
,
the
degree
of
organization
of
vulnerable
groups
should
be
improved
,
and
they
should
be
encouraged
to
form
various
types
of
cooperative
organizations
that
can
effectively
alleviate
the
problem
of
environmental
inequality
.
As
mentioned
,
organizations
of
environmentally
disadvantaged
groups
can
integrate
their
internal
resources
and
participate
equally
in
market
economy
negotiations
.
In
addition
,
organized
environmentally
disadvantaged
groups
can
form
social
capital
to
reduce
the
transaction
cost
of
environmental
governance
by
connecting
with
the
country
’s
hierarchical
environmental
protection
system
.

Conclusions
</head>
<p>
This
study
focuses
on
Chinese
environmental
justice
issues
,
which
have
realistic
urgency
but
lack
theoretical
foundation
and
empirical
experience
.
On
the
basis
of
learning
and
revising
the
US
environmental
justice
principle
,
this
study
has
two
main
research
contributions
:
construction
of
a
general
equilibrium
theory
model
of
environmental
justice
and
a
comparative
study
on
environmental
inequality
in
four
major
economic
zones
in
China
.
</p>
<p>
First
,
by
introducing
environmental
justice
into
the
general
equilibrium
model
of
the
competitive
market
for
environmental
pollution
,
we
find
that
only
when
the
distribution
of
economic
income
and
environmental
pollution
exactly
realizes
the
allocation
at
the
intersection
of
the
Pareto
set
and
the
environmental
justice
line
can
we
achieve
the
Pareto-efficient
market
equilibrium
and
environmental
justice
at
the
same
time
.
The
theoretical
model
proves
that
under
the
premise
of
ensuring
Pareto
efficiency
,
it
is
difficult
to
realize
environmental
justice
in
the
competitive
market
;
environmental
injustice
is
the
normal
state
.
