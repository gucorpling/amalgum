The
first
game
,
held
immediately
after
the
Opening
Ceremony
,
was
between
the
United
States
and
Australia
.
The
United
States
proved
the
better
team
,
forcing
errors
and
turnovers
.
Three
turnovers
in
the
first
quarter
were
especially
costly
for
the
Steelers
,
who
lost
56
–
43
.
</p>
<p>
The
second
game
was
held
at
17:30
under
lights

The
crowd
was
small
,
but
there
were
a
number
of
New
Zealand
fans
in
the
crowd
,
including
a
few

.
Two
of
the
New
Zealand
players
are
also
Maori
.
The
well-disciplined
United
States
team
proved
too
good
for
the
Wheel
Blacks
as
well
,
who
lost
58
–
40
in
an
entertaining
contest
.
</p>
<p>
The
third
game
was
at
19:30
,
between
Australia
and
New
Zealand
.
The
Australians
led
the
whole
game
,
which
was
nonetheless
entertaining
to
the
last
.
In
the
dying
seconds
of
the
game
,
Australia
's
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryley%20Batt">

shunted
a
stalling
New

player
across
the
line
to
force
him
to
score
,
then
threw
the
ball
to
team
mate
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris%20Bond%20(wheelchair%20rugby)">

,
who
raced
for
the
line
at
high
speed
but
was
beaten
by
the
buzzer
.
Australia
won
61
–
48
.
