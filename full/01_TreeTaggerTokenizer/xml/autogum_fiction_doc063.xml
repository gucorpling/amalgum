CHAPTER
XXXV
</head>
<p>
Edmund
had
determined
that
it
belonged
entirely
to
Fanny
to
chuse
whether
her
situation
with
regard
to
Crawford
should
be
mentioned
between
them
or
not
;
and
that
if
she
did
not
lead
the
way
,
it
should
never
be
touched
on
by
him
;
but
after
a
day
or
two
of
mutual
reserve
,
he
was
induced
by
his
father
to
change
his
mind
,
and
try
what
his
influence
might
do
for
his
friend
.
</p>
<p>
A
day
,
and
a
very
early
day
,
was
actually
fixed
for
the
Crawfords
'
departure
;
and
Sir
Thomas
thought
it
might
be
as
well
to
make
one
more
effort
for
the
young
man
before
he
left
Mansfield
,
that
all
his
professions
and
vows
of
unshaken
attachment
might
have
as
much
hope
to
sustain
them
as
possible
.
</p>
<p>
Sir
Thomas
was
most
cordially
anxious
for
the
perfection
of
Mr.
Crawford
's
character
in
that
point
.
He
wished
him
to
be
a
model
of
constancy
;
and
fancied
the
best
means
of
effecting
it
would
be
by
not
trying
him
too
long
.
</p>
<p>
Edmund
was
not
unwilling
to
be
persuaded
to
engage
in
the
business
;
he
wanted
to
know
Fanny
's
feelings
.
She
had
been
used
to
consult
him
in
every
difficulty
,
and
he
loved
her
too
well
to
bear
to
be
denied
her
confidence
now
;
he
hoped
to
be
of
service
to
her
,
he
thought
he
must
be
of
service
to
her
;
whom
else
had
she
to
open
her
heart
to
?
If
she
did
not
need
counsel
,
she
must
need
the
comfort
of
communication
.
Fanny
estranged
from
him
,
silent
and
reserved
,
was
an
unnatural
state
of
things
;
a
state
which
he
must
break
through
,
and
which
he
could
easily
learn
to
think
she
was
wanting
him
to
break
through
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
will
speak
to
her
,
sir
:
I
will
take
the
first
opportunity
of
speaking
to
her
alone
,
”
was
the
result
of
such
thoughts
as
these
;
and
upon
Sir
Thomas
's
information
of
her
being
at
that
very
time
walking
alone
in
the
shrubbery
,
he
instantly
joined
her
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
am
come
to
walk
with
you
,
Fanny
,
”
said
he
.
“
Shall
I
?
”
Drawing
her
arm
within
his
.
“
It
is
a
long
while
since
we
have
had
a
comfortable
walk
together
.
”
</p>
<p>
She
assented
to
it
all
rather
by
look
than
word
.
Her
spirits
were
low
.
</p>
<p>
“
But
,
Fanny
,
”
he
presently
added
,
“
in
order
to
have
a
comfortable
walk
,
something
more
is
necessary
than
merely
pacing
this
gravel
together
.
You
must
talk
to
me
.
I
know
you
have
something
on
your
mind
.
I
know
what
you
are
thinking
of
.
You
cannot
suppose
me
uninformed
.
Am
I
to
hear
of
it
from
everybody
but
Fanny
herself
?
”
</p>
<p>
Fanny
,
at
once
agitated
and
dejected
,
replied
,
“
If
you
hear
of
it
from
everybody
,
cousin
,
there
can
be
nothing
for
me
to
tell
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Not
of
facts
,
perhaps
;
but
of
feelings
,
Fanny
.
No
one
but
you
can
tell
me
them
.
I
do
not
mean
to
press
you
,
however
.
If
it
is
not
what
you
wish
yourself
,
I
have
done
.
I
had
thought
it
might
be
a
relief
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
am
afraid
we
think
too
differently
for
me
to
find
any
relief
in
talking
of
what
I
feel
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Do
you
suppose
that
we
think
differently
?
I
have
no
idea
of
it
.
I
dare
say
that
,
on
a
comparison
of
our
opinions
,
they
would
be
found
as
much
alike
as
they
have
been
used
to
be
:
to
the
point
--
I
consider
Crawford
's
proposals
as
most
advantageous
and
desirable
,
if
you
could
return
his
affection
.
I
consider
it
as
most
natural
that
all
your
family
should
wish
you
could
return
it
;
but
that
,
as
you
cannot
,
you
have
done
exactly
as
you
ought
in
refusing
him
.
Can
there
be
any
disagreement
between
us
here
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Oh
no
!
But
I
thought
you
blamed
me
.
I
thought
you
were
against
me
.
This
is
such
a
comfort
!
”
</p>
<p>
“
This
comfort
you
might
have
had
sooner
,
Fanny
,
had
you
sought
it
.
But
how
could
you
possibly
suppose
me
against
you
?
How
could
you
imagine
me
an
advocate
for
marriage
without
love
?
Were
I
even
careless
in
general
on
such
matters
,
how
could
you
imagine
me
so
where
your
happiness
was
at
stake
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
My
uncle
thought
me
wrong
,
and
I
knew
he
had
been
talking
to
you
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
As
far
as
you
have
gone
,
Fanny
,
I
think
you
perfectly
right
.
I
may
be
sorry
,
I
may
be
surprised
--
though
hardly
<hi rend="italic">
that
</hi>
,
for
you
had
not
had
time
to
attach
yourself
--
but
I
think
you
perfectly
right
.
Can
it
admit
of
a
question
?
It
is
disgraceful
to
us
if
it
does
.
You
did
not
love
him
;
nothing
could
have
justified
your
accepting
him
.
”
</p>
<p>
Fanny
had
not
felt
so
comfortable
for
days
and
days
.
</p>
<p>
“
So
far
your
conduct
has
been
faultless
,
and
they
were
quite
mistaken
who
wished
you
to
do
otherwise
.
But
the
matter
does
not
end
here
.
Crawford
's
is
no
common
attachment
;
he
perseveres
,
with
the
hope
of
creating
that
regard
which
had
not
been
created
before
.
This
,
we
know
,
must
be
a
work
of
time
.
But
”
(
with
an
affectionate
smile
)
“
let
him
succeed
at
last
,
Fanny
,
let
him
succeed
at
last
.
You
have
proved
yourself
upright
and
disinterested
,
prove
yourself
grateful
and
tender-hearted
;
and
then
you
will
be
the
perfect
model
of
a
woman
which
I
have
always
believed
you
born
for
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Oh
!
never
,
never
,
never
!
he
never
will
succeed
with
me
.
”
And
she
spoke
with
a
warmth
which
quite
astonished
Edmund
,
and
which
she
blushed
at
the
recollection
of
herself
,
when
she
saw
his
look
,
and
heard
him
reply
,
“
Never
!
Fanny
!
--
so
very
determined
and
positive
!
This
is
not
like
yourself
,
your
rational
self
.
