What
is
the
nature
of
your
disability
?
Do
you
use
a
wheelchair
for
most
daily
activities
?

to
a

Yes
I
am
dependent
on
my
wheelchair
for
mobility

How
does
being
a
parent
impact
your
ability
to
compete
at
elite
levels
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DP
</hi>
:
I
am
married
and
have
three
children
.
Having
a
family
does
make
it
a
harder
to
compete
at
elite
levels
,
not
only
being
away
traveling
,
when
I
am
home
I
am
on
the
ice
training
a
lot
.
But
thanks
to
the
support
from
my
family
I
have
been
able
to
do
so
.
Hopefully
it
has
a
positive
impact
on
my
children
,
showing
them
you
can
achieve
anything
you
put
your
mind
to
.

Does
participating
in
wheelchair
curling
cost
a
lot
money
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DP
</hi>
:
Well
that
depends
!
At
a
recreational
level
,
if
you
have
a
wheelchair
already
all
you
need
is
a
delivery
stick
which
is
about
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/US_dollar">
$
</ref>
60.00
and
to
join
a
club
which
has
dues
usually
300.00
to
500.00
per
year
.
To
compete
at
the
highest
level
,
there
is
travel
and
lodging
involved
which
can
get
quite
expensive
.

How
do
you
afford
to
compete
at
the
highest
level
?
Do
you
have
any
sponsorship
deals
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">

:
Getting
started
was
tough
,
I
got
help
through
the
members
of
cape
cod
curling
club
and
a
grant
from
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenged%20Athletes%20Foundation">
Challenged
Athletes
Foundation
</ref>
(
CAF
)
and
some
out
of
my
pocket
.
But
once
I
made
the
National
team
there
is
funding
to
help
with
expenses
.
I
have
no
sponsorship
deals
at
the
moment
,
but
I
am
open
to
negotiation
!

Do
you
think
USA
Paralympic
competitors
get
enough
financial
support
to
enable
the
country
to
compete
at
the
highest
level
?
Is
funding
equitable
in
the
United
States
across
sports
and
competitor
visibility
?
</p>
<p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DP
</hi>
:
No
,
there
is
funding
,
but
not
nearly
enough
for
an
athlete
to
compete
at
the
highest
level
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DP
</hi>
:
Not
from
what
I
hear
.
I
believe
the
higher
viewed
sports
get
a
lot
more
funding
.
I
have
been
told
curling
is
at
bottom
for
funding
.

What
are
your
thoughts
on
the
classification
system
and
processes
for
your
sport
?
Do
you
know
of
anyone
who
has
been
impacted
as
a
result
of
it
?
</p>
<p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DP
</hi>
:
I
am
not
really
clear
on
how
the
classification
system
works
.
I
feel
that
they
should
make
it
as
equal
as
possible
for
everyone
who
competes
in
wheelchair
curling
.
Everyone
one
has
different
disabilities
and
different
situations
,
but
as
long
as
they
are
delivering
the
stone
from
a
stationary
wheelchair
with
a
delivery
stick
from
the
same
position
it
should
be
equal
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DP
</hi>
:
I
know
of
a
young
man
from
state
of
Washington
who
uses
a
wheelchair
most
of
the
time
but
is
able
to
walk
and
has
mobility
,
that
he
probably
would
not
qualify
for
the
national
team.
.
Yet
I
know
of
a
man
in
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Canada">
Canada
</ref>
that
uses
a
wheelchair
only
for
curling
and
competes
on
the
National
team
.
