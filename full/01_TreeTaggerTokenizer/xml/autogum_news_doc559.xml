Calls
for
the
ouster
of
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/UK">
British
</ref>
government
minister
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Maria_Miller">
Maria
Miller
</ref>
have
been
increasing
following
a
claim
by
the
<hi rend="italic">
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Daily_Telegraph">
Daily
Telegraph
</ref>
</hi>
newspaper
that
Miller
's
special
adviser
used
the
threat
of
press
regulation
to
try
and
prevent
publication
of
a
story
about
Miller
's
expenses
.
A
poll
published
today
by
a
number
of
newspapers
shows
a
majority
of
the
public
unhappy
with
Miller
's
behaviour
and
saying
she
should
be
removed
.
</p>
<p>
The
issue
stems
initially
from
a
report
in
the
<hi rend="italic">
Daily
Telegraph
</hi>
regarding
Miller
's
expenses
claims
to
help
pay
a
mortgage
on
a
house
in
south
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/London">
London
</ref>
that
Miller
shares
with
her
parents
.
The
newspaper
claimed
that
she
had
claimed
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pound%20sterling">
£
</ref>
90,000
to
pay
the
mortgage
on
the
house
.
Miller
's
expenses
have
been
the
subject
of
investigation
by
a
parliamentary
commissioner
and
then
by
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/UK_House_of_Commons">
House
of
Commons
</ref>
Committee
on
Standards
.
The
commissioner
determined
she
should
repay
£45,000
of
this
expense
,
but
the
Committee
determined
she
ought
to
only
repay
£5,800
.
Following
the
decision
of
the
Committee
,
the
<hi rend="italic">
Daily
Telegraph
</hi>
reported
Miller
's
special
adviser
Joanna
Hindley
had
said
in
a
telephone
call
with
the
newspaper
,
&quot;
I
should
just
flag
up
as
well
,
while
you
're
on
it
that
when
she
doorstepped
him
,
she
got
Maria
's
father
,
who
’s
just
had
a
[
removed
]
and
come
out
of
[
removed
]
.
And
Maria
[
has
]
obviously
been
having
quite
a
lot
of
editors
'
meetings
around
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Leveson_Inquiry">
Leveson
</ref>
at
the
moment
.
So
I
am
just
going
to
kind
of
flag
up
that
connection
for
you
to
think
about
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
<hi rend="italic">
Telegraph
</hi>
alleges
that
this
was
intended
as
a
form
of
intimidation
:
that
Hindley
dropped
in
mention
of
press
regulation
and
the
Leveson
Report
as
a
way
to
attempt
to
get
the
newspaper
to
drop
the
story
.
A
leader
column
in
the
<hi rend="italic">
Telegraph
</hi>
stated
Hindley
's
remarks
were
&quot;
an
indictment
of
the
influence
that
press
regulation
by
statute
could
have
over
free
speech
&quot;
.

(

,
has
defended
Hindley
's
statements
to
the
<hi rend="italic">

</hi>
,
as
specifically
referring
to
the
&quot;
doorstepping
&quot;
of
Maria

elderly

,
specifically
her
father
who
had
been

Coffey
said
of
the
audio
published
by
the
<hi rend="italic">

</hi>
:
&quot;
I
heard
an
adviser
to
the
culture
secretary
suggesting
that
it
's
inappropriate
to
be
doorstepping
elderly
parents
of
somebody
who
has
just
come
out

When

making
a
similar
phone
call
to
you
a
couple
of
days
later
,
you
add
all

up

you

only
conclude
that
they

trying

harass
you

stop
you
from
publishing

&quot;
</p>
<p>
Oliver

denied
the

&quot;
It
is
utterly
false
to
suggest
that
I
threatened
Tony

over
Leveson

any

The
conversation
I
had
with

was
about
the
inappropriate
doorstepping

he
told

suggested

be

witch-hunt
&quot;
due
to
her
role
in

following
the

:
&quot;
I
am
enormously
fond
of
her
.
She
has
done
a
very
good
job
in
a
very
difficult
set
of
circumstances
with
the
Leveson
inquiry
that
has
stirred
up
a
lot
of

antipathy
to
her

And
also
the
gay
marriage
stuff
—
there
are
a
lot
of
Conservatives
out
there
who
,
perhaps
,
were
not
necessarily
in
support
of
it
all
and
so
feel
rather
bitter
about
that
.
I
have
known
her
to
be
a
