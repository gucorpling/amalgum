Cons

Hey
everyone
,
I
started
playing
RPG
’s
(
after
being
interested
for
over
20
years
)
about
5
years
ago
.
I
’ve
played
under
quite
a
few
different
systems
,
and
I
’ve
DM
’d
under
DnD
5e
and
Fate
Core
.
Now
here
’s
the
thing
.
I
LOVE
FATE
.
I
love
aspects
,
I
love
fudge
dice
,
I
love
fats
points
,
I
love
creating
an
advantage
,
I
love
pretty
much
everything
about
it
.
Some
of
the
friends
I
’ve
played
with
also
love
Fate
.
I
do
however
have
one
friend
that
has
only
played
two
campaigns
DM
’d
by
me
under
5e
(
that
he
loved
)
and
I
’ve
been
trying
to
convince
him
to
play
Fate
with
the
me
and
some
others
.
After
looking
at
the
rule
book
he
is
not
very
interested
in
trying
it
out
,
saying
it
’s
not
his
style
and
wants
to
play
5e
.
I
do
n’t
want
to
force
him
to
play
something
he
does
n’t
want
to
play
,
but
I
do
want
to
see
if
I
can
tweak
Fate
to
something
he
’d
like
a
bit
more
before
giving
up
on
getting
him
to
play
.
The
problem
is
,
I
love
Fate
so
much
,
I
fail
to
see
what
it
does
n’t
do
better
than
any
other
system
.
So
that
’s
why
I
’m
here
.
I
’m
hoping
to
probe
the
minds
of
all
you
out
there
with
great
experience
,
because
I
know
you
’ll
be
able
to
point
out
the
weak
points
of
Fate
that
my
Fanboy
eyes
ca
n’t
make
out
alone
.
Thanks
for
your
time
:
)
Edit
:
Wow
I
got
a
lot
more
responses
than
I
expected
.
Thank
you
guys
so
much
for
all
the
good
points
.
A
lot
of
these
comments
showed
me
reasons
that
my
friends
TTRPGing
style
do
n’t
match
up
well
with
Fate
.
I
was
hoping
to
tweak
Fate
to
fit
his
playstyle
more
,
but
instead
I
’ll
try
and
find
a
system
that
all
the
players
are
interested
in
.
If
possible
🙏🏼
.
Thanks
again
for
your
time
and
well
thought
out
responses
.

I
love
narratives
in
tabletop
rpg
.
I
love
narrative
tension
over
mechanical
challenge
,
and
adore
freedom
to
create
.
Yet
I
still
ended
up
hating
FATE
.
</p>
<p>
This
is
because
FATE
needs
to
stick
to
a
certain
type
of
play
.
It
needs
to
decide
if
it
’s
an
action-oriented
or
social-oriented
game
.
The
mechanics
are
too
barebones
,
and
too
easily
exploitable
or
imbalancable
.
I
consider
crippling
depression
a
major
character
flaw
,
and
something
like
selfishness
to
be
a
minor
character
flaw
,
while
someone
else
might
consider
selfishness
a
major
character
flaw
and
a
character
with
crippling
depression
unplayable
.
</p>
<p>
The
mechanics
leave
a
basic
,
generic
nothing
where
players
never
have
to
think
to
solve
problems
.
The
only
concrete
mechanic
are
Skills
,
which
leaves
practically
nothing
for
character
customization
.
</p>
<p>
A
system
that
works
way
better
is
Open
Legend
.
It
can
be
narrative
oriented
,
but
has
just
enough
customization
options
that
every
character
really
feels
unique
and
conflict
has
actual
tension
behind
it
.
</p>
<p>
Another
bad
thing
about
FATE
is
that
they
take
a
DND-amount
of
pages
to
describe
their
barebones
rules
system
.
Learn
to
be
concise
.
