Email
the
IAU
to
officially
name
unnamed
comets
or
meteors
.
Though
most
stars
,
constellations
,
and
planets
have
already
been
named
,
new
comets
or
meteors
typically
receive
a
name
based
on
the
person
who
discovered
them
.
If
you
have
a
telescope
and
see
a
comet
or
meteor
that
you
do
n’t
think
was
named
yet
,
email
cbatiau@eps.harvard.edu.
As
you
track
the
comet
or
meteor
,
make
sure
to
keep
meticulous
records
and
contact
the
IAU
as
soon
as
possible
.
In
the
email
,
include
your
name
,
address
,
contact
details
,
date
and
time
of
the
observation
,
the
observation
method
,
and
the
observation
site
.

When
a
comet
can
be
seen
by
the
naked
eye
,
you
typically
can
not
name
it
since
many
other
people
“
discovered
”
it
at
the
same
time
.
</item>
<item>
The
observation
method
could
include
a
telescope

naked

,
or
photograph

</item>
<item>
The
observation
site
should
include
the
town
or
city
name
and
longitude
and
latitude
of
your
location
when
you
made
the
discovery
.

Usually
astronomers
and
teams

astronomers
with
telescopes
are
the

Think
of
a
name
from
ancient
mythology
for
a
historical
approach
.
Most
stars
and
constellations
have
been
historically
named
based
on
characters
from
ancient
mythology
.
Some
stars
and
constellations
may
have
more
than
1
name
depending
on
the
culture
or
society
that
originally
coined
their
names
.
For
example
,
Taurus
was
originally
named
Ain
in
the
original
Arabic
text
.

Name
a
star
by
its
size
and
constellation
for
an
official
name
.
Officially
,
most
stars
are
named
by
their
constellation
so
astronomers
can
keep
track
of
them
.
Usually
,
the
stars
will
have
a
designation
after
the
constellation
name
like
alpha
or
beta
to
describe
their
size
.
For
example
,
the
largest
star
in
the
Orion
constellation
is
named
Alpha
Orionis
and
the
second
largest
star
is
called
Beta
Orionis
.
<figure rend="Name a Star Step 7 Version 2.jpg">

Alpha
,
beta
,
and
gamma
come

method
of

is
called
the

Discover
a
new
star
and
name
it
after
yourself
.
When
new
stars
are
discovered
they
are
named
after
the
person
or
team
who
discovered
them
along
with
coordinates
of
the
star
.
Astronomers
or
teams
of
astronomers
with
high-powered
telescopes
are
typically
the
ones
who
discover
new
stars
.
These
official
names
are
cataloged
by
the
International
Astronomical
Union
and
have
names
like
Luyten
726-8A
,
BD
+5deg
1668
,
and
Kruger
60
A.
It
is
highly
unlikely
that
the
star
you
find
has
n't
been
cataloged
but
if
you
believe
that
you
've
found
a
new
star
,
email
cbatiau@eps.harvard.edu
and
include
details
like
the
time
you
discovered
the
star
,
your
name
,
address
,
and
contact
information
.

There
's
a
good
chance
the
star
that
you
found
has
already
been
discovered
.
You
can
cross-reference
the
IAU
constellation
and
star
catalogs
to
see
whether
the
coordinates
of
your
star
match
an
already
existing
star
.
</item>
<item>
The
coordinates
are
calculated
by
determining
the
star
's
ascension
and
declination
in
space
,
which
is
the
equivalent
to
longitude
and
latitude
on
earth
.
</item>
<item>
There
are
millions
of
stars
that
have
already
been

Do
n't

a
name

If

put
them
together
