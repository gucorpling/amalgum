Early
career
</head>
<p>
Gunning
was
born
at
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swainswick">
Swainswick
</ref>
and
educated
at
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winchester">
Winchester
</ref>
.
He
was
the
assistant
surgeon
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_George's_Hospital">
St.
George
's
Hospital
,
London
</ref>
,
from
21
January
1760
to
4
January
1765
,
and
full
surgeon
from
that
date
till
his
death
.
In
1773
he
was
elected
Steward
of
Anatomy
by
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_College_of_Surgeons_of_England">
Surgeons
'
Company
</ref>
,
but
paid
a
fine
rather
than
serve
.
In
1789
he
was
elected
Examiner
on
the
death
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percivall_Pott">
Percivall
Pott
</ref>
,
and
in
the
same
year
he
was
chosen
Master
of
the
Company
,
and
signalised
his
year
of
office
by
a
firm
effort
to
reform
its
administration
and
reorganise
its
work
.

<p>
His
attack
upon
the
expensive
system
of
dinners
of
the
courts
of
assistants
and
of
examiners
,
and
his
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippic">
philippic
</ref>
on
retiring
from
office
on
1
July
1790
,
as
recorded
by
South
,
show
that
he
could
be
fearlessly
outspoken
.
</p>
&quot;
Your
theatre
&quot;
,
he
says
,
in
his
last
address
,
&quot;
is
without
lectures
,
your
library-room
without
books
is
converted
into
an
office
for
your
clerk
,
and
your
committee-room
is
become
his
eating-parlour
…
If
,
gentlemen
,
you
make
no
better
use
of
the
hall
than
what
you
have
already
done
,
you
had
better
sell
it
,
and
apply
the
money
for
the
good
of
the
company
in
some
other
way
&quot;
.
<p>
The
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_Assistants">
Court
of
Assistants
</ref>
appointed
a
committee
to
consider
the
question
,
and
numerous
reforms
were
effected
.
In
1790
Gunning
was
appointed
the
first
professor
of
surgery
;
but
he
soon
resigned
on
the
plea
that
it
occupied
too
much
of
his
time
,
and
no
new
appointment
was
made
.
Gunning
had
been
appointed
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon-General_(United_Kingdom)">
Surgeon-General
</ref>
of
the
army
in
1793
,
on
the
death
of
John
Hunter
;
he
was
also

Surgeon
Extraordinary
to
the

Conflict
with
John
Hunter
</head>
<p>
Gunning
was
in
general
opposed
to
his
colleague
at
St.
George
's
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hunter_(surgeon)">
John
Hunter
</ref>
,
who
was
frequently
overbearing
to
his
professional
brethren
,
and
appeared
to
them
to
neglect
the
proper
business
of
a
surgeon
for
unpractical
pursuits
.
The
quarrel
rose
to
a
great
pitch
when
a
surgeon
was
elected
in
succession
to
Charles
Hawkins
(
1750-1816
)
,
who
had
resigned
.
Thomas
Keate
(
1745-1821
)
was
supported
by
Gunning
,
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everard_Home">
Everard
Home
</ref>
by
Hunter
,
and
after
a
sharp
contest
Keate
was
elected
.
A
dispute
ensued
about
fees
for
surgical
lectures
,
which
led
to
a
controversy
between
Gunning
,
senior
surgeon
,
supported
by
two
of
his
colleagues
,
and
Hunter
(

the
account
in
Drewry
Ottley
,
<hi rend="italic">
Life
of
John
Hunter

,
pp.
126-132
)
.
It
ended
in
John
Hunter
's
dramatically
sudden
death
on
16
Oct.
1793
,
immediately
after
being
flatly
contradicted
by
one
of
his
colleagues
,
apparently
Gunning
.

<head>
The
sale
of
Surgeon
's
Hall
</head>
<p>
In
1796
it
was
determined
to
sell
the
Surgeons
'
Hall
on
account
of
the
expense
attending
its
repair
;
but
on
7
July
Gunning
,
on
behalf
of
the
committee
,
reported
that
as
no
one
had
bid
within
£200
of
the
price
set
upon
it
,
it
had
been
bought
in
.
At
the
same
court
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cline">
Henry
Cline
</ref>
was
elected
a
member
of
the
Court
of
Assistants
,
in
the
absence
of
a
governor
(
one
having
just
died
,
and
the
other
being
blind
and
paralysed
in
Warwickshire
)
.
This
voided
the
charter
.
A
bill
brought
into
parliament
in
1797
to
indemnify
the
company
,
and
to
give
it
greater
power
over
the
profession
,
after
passing
the
commons
,
was
lost
in
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords">
House
of
Lords
</ref>
by
the
influence
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Thurlow,_1st_Baron_Thurlow">
Thurlow
</ref>
,
owing
,
it
is
said
,
to
a
grudge
against
Gunning
.
Thurlow
having
said
,
&quot;
There
's
no
more
science
in
surgery
than
in
butchery
&quot;
(
a
remark
apparently
prompted
by
his
brother
's
death
while
undergoing
treatment
by
Hunter
)
.
Gunning
had
retorted
:
&quot;
Then
,
my
lord
,
I
heartily
pray
that
your
lordship
may
break
your
leg
,
and
have
only
a
butcher
to
set
it
&quot;
.
</p>
<p>
Gunning
died
at
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bath,_England">
Bath
</ref>
on
14
Feb.
1798
,
leaving
five
children
.
