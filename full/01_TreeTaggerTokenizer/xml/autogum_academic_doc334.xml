FaaS-FR
Model
for
Cognitive
Robots
</head>
<p>
In
the
cloud
robot
paradigm
,
there
are
various
deployment
models
,
including
private
,
community
,
public
,
and
hybrid
clouds
.
Wang
et
al.
introduced
these
models
into
the
robot
clouds
.
This
study
proposes
and
evaluates
various
connection
methods
that
occur
in
the
implementation
of
cloud
robots
.
Public
cloud
models
exchange
large
amounts
of
data
and
information
across
networks
and
clouds
.
The
cloud
can
be
used
to
share
data
in
a
computing
environment
that
everyone
can
share
.
However
,
the
exclusive
materials
of
an
individual
should
be
served
in
a
proper
separate
manner
.
In
a
personal
robot
cloud
,
a
server
or
cloud
is
privately
connected
to
a
home
or
company
.
Personal
robot
clouds
can
form
an
external
and
independent
cloud
and
distribute
the
robot
’s
computing
power
through
the
servers
.
</p>
<p>
In
the
view
of
fog
robotics
,
the
function
of
personal
cloud
servers
can
be
matched
with
fog
robot
servers
which
personally
support
edges
(
local
robot
system
)
.
Therefore
,
we
adopt
the
term
“
fog
robotic
server
”
instead
of
“
cloud
robotic
server
”
because
the
server
works
not
for
other
’s
robots
but
for
specific
robots
privately
.
</p>
<p>
However
,
fog
robotics
models
generally
have
a
hierarchical
model
consisting
of
clouds
,
fog
servers
,
and
edges
.
With
these
models
,
it
is
difficult
for
edges
directly
to
access
to
a
cloud
and
get
the
result
of
services
which
have
specific
functionality
with
enough
computing
power
.
</p>
<p>
In
this
paper
,
to
overcome
these
matters
,
an
advanced
model
,
FaaS-FR
model
,
is
proposed
as
shown
in
<figure>
Figure
2
</figure>
.
In
the
model
,
all
the
functional
modules
of
the
cognitive
robot
are
classified
according
to
privacy
,
security
,
and
computing
power
,
and
have
their
own
networking
with
concept
of
fog
robotics
.
The
functions
of
the
robot
are
suitably
divided
for
being
worked
on
edges
,
fog
robot
servers
,
and
public
robot
clouds
,
respectively
.
In
the
case
of
information
possibly
being
a
violation
of
privacy
,
it
is
computed
and
stored
in
an
edge
or
a
fog
robot
server
.
If
the
edge
needs
to
use
the
public
robot
cloud
to
utilize
an
advanced
computing
service
,
it
can
access
the
cloud
directly
to
reduce
latency
or
go
through
a
fog
robot
server
to
the
cloud
.
The
reason
that
a
new
term
is
coined
,
FaaS
,
is
that
the
classified
functions
of
the
robot
can
be
offloaded
on
the
cloud
or
fog
servers
according
to
the
security
,
latency
,
privacy
,
and
computing
power
.
</p>
<p>
<figure>
Figure
3
</figure>
shows
a
schema
of
modular
cognitive
functions
of
a
general
structure
of
cognitive
robots
.
It
has
perception
modules
comprising
sensing
,
object
recognition
,
and
speech
recognition
.
Therefore
,
the
robot
can
talk
with
humans
regarding
the
visual
situation
that
the
robot
recognizes
.
The
robot
also
has
behavior
modules
such
as
utterance
and
motion
.
In
the
higher
part
,
there
are
interpretation
and
generation
modules
which
can
produce
descriptive
cognitive
information
from
the
perceptional
.
Memory
modules
are
used
to
store
the
descripted
cognitive
information
and
can
be
retrieved
for
the
future
by
a
reasoning
procedure
with
a
virtual
imager
and
cognitive
grammar
.
In
the
view
of
functionality
including
privacy
,
security
,
safety
,
latency
,
and
computing
power
,
the
functions
can
be
divided
with
three
parts
:
sensing
and
actuation
part
(
SAP
)
,
privacy
and
security
part
(
PSP
)
,
and
high
performance
part
(
HPP
)
.
</p>
<p>
The
SAP
which
is
covered
by
a
solid
line
and
marked
with
a
circle
,
is
the
essential
part
including
operating
system
(
OS
)
,
sensing
,
and
actuation
which
are
indispensable
for
the
robot
.
This
part
should
have
OS
,
perception
functions
including
sensors
,
cameras
and
microphones
,
and
behavior
functions
including
speakers
and
actuators
.
These
functions
are
dependent
on
the
hardware
of
the
robot
and
cannot
be
taken
over
by
others
.
</p>
<p>
The
PSP
is
covered
with
a
dashed
single-dotted
line
and
marked
with
a
rectangle
;
it
should
be
installed
on
edges
or
fog
servers
.
For
low-cost
robot
services
with
minimum
computing
power
and
network
infrastructure
,
this
part
needs
to
be
offloaded
to
clouds
;
however
,
these
functions
can
be
related
to
private
and
security
information
.
Therefore
,
it
is
reasonable
that
this
part
is
working
on
the
edges
or
fog
servers
.
In
the
case
that
the
private
information
is
not
serious
and
well
secured
,
it
could
be
offloaded
to
a
public
cloud
.
</p>
<p>
The
HPP
has
a
dashed
line
with
a
triangle
;
it
is
dependent
on
public
robot
cloud
tools
that
can
supply
high-quality
performance
such
as
speech
recognition
,
natural
language
processing
(
NLP
)
,
2D
and
3D
object
recognition
,
and
text-to-speech
(
TTS
)
.
The
Google
Cloud
application
programming
interface
(
API
)
supports
multiple
modules
of
deep
learning
in
its
public
cloud
.
</p>
<p>
<figure>
Figure
4
</figure>
shows
various
distribution
of
functions
and
offloading
levels
.
As
shown
in
the
top
,
from
left
to
right
,
the
functions
of
the
robot
are
dependent
of
the
servers
and
clouds
.
On
the
contrary
,
the
security
and
privacy
could
weaken
with
the
direction
.
