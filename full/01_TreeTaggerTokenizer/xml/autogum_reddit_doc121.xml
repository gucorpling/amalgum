I
’m
sorry
,
you
can
skim
(
milk
)
but
this
is
longer
.
What
do
you
guys
do
to
combat
exhaustion
?
I
’m
not
just
talking
about
lack
of
energy
.
This
job
has
helped
me
grow
and
develop
.
Starting
out
as
a
barista
and
now
a
shift
supervisor
,
I
know
what
goes
on
behind
the
scenes
in
order
to
make
the
customer
experience
.
Sometimes
we
fuck
up
.
I
get
it
.
But
why
is
there
no
set
of
rules
to
follow
or
solution
to
how
to
fix
a
rough
day
where
nothing
goes
right
?
Let
’s
take
today
for
example
.
I
’m
a
closing
Sunday
SSV
.
I
get
to
work
and
many
AM
AND
MID
tasks
have
been
left
undone
for
me
to
figure
out
.
No
prep
work
for
my
shift
had
been
done
.
Just
a
grimy
store
and
stressed
out
floor
.
The
first
thing
I
did
after
clocking
in
was
clean
up
a
coffee
tasting
that
I
was
n’t
included
in
.
:(
I
left
trash
out
,
I
left
so
many
things
just
undone
.
I
did
n’t
do
delivery
temps
,
I
did
n’t
rotate
RTDE
,
I
did
n’t
do
floors
in
the
cafe
or
the
restrooms
.
I
was
just
sad
that
I
left
such
a
mess
for
the
openers
.
:(
honestly
at
the
end
of
my
shift
I
just
did
n’t
care
anymore
.
What
do
you
guys
do
when
things
like
this
happen
.
Is
it
my
fault
for
bad
time
management
?
I
had
breaks
to
run
and
only
2
baristas
after
5PM
.
I
just
do
n’t
know
what
to
do
.
There
’s
no
support
from
my
SM
,
she
tells
me
to
hold
other
SSVs
accountable
for
things
they
do
wrong
but
I
do
n’t
want
ANY
drama
.
I
did
n’t
sign
up
for
this
.
Is
anyone
feeling
like
labor
is
a
HUGE
issue
more
than
it
ever
was
?
We
have
n’t
passed
a
QASA
walk
in
6
whole
years
.
Also
there
’s
been
3
store
managers
at
my
location
since
I
started
not
even
a
year
ago.
.
after
transferring
.
I
feel
like
even
my
SSV
training
was
bad
.
:(
I
want
to
redo
it
.
I
’m
a
1
year
2
month
partner
.
(
234xxxx
)
how
do
I
remind
myself
that
it
’s
not
my
fault
and
I
literally
just
work
in
a
coffee
shop
?
</p>

<p>
So
,
I
've
been
with
the
bux
for
less
than
6
months
and
I
'm
currently
training
to
be
a
shift
.
I
basically
watch
all
my
current
shifts
like
a
hawk
so
I
can
get
a
good
feel
of
how
they
work
everything
out
.
</p>
<p>
First
and
foremost
,
my
shifts
have
a
mini
powwow
when
handing
off
.
Mid
comes
in
10
minutes
early
,
Am
stays
10
minutes
late
.
So
they
have
20
minutes
together
to
talk
about
how
the
day
went
,
what
did
get
done
and
what
still
has
to
get
done
.
That
way
,
mid
can
figure
out
breaks
and
whatnot
accordingly
.
</p>
<p>
Second
,
use
the
DCR
to
plan
!
Know
who
you
have
and
keep
in
mind
all
your
partners
strong
and
weak
suites
.
If
it
's
been
a
busy
day
,
keep
aces
in
places
(
by
remember
that
you
should
move
everyone
around
so
they
do
n't
get
burnt
out
in
one
role
for
a
full
shift
)
.
That
way
everything
will
get
done
within
a
reasonable
amount
of
time
.
If
you
have
a
strong
bar
and
POS
,
they
can
multitask
little
things
to
help
the
close
go
smoothly
.
</p>
<p>
Third
,
if
it
's
been
really
busy
and
you
notice
you
and
your
partners
are
having
a
really
rough
go
of
it
,
give
everyone
an
extra
10
.
Seriously
.
As
long
as
you
do
n't
make
it
a
bad
habit
.
Once
in
awhile
,
frap
roast
hits
the
fan
and
everyone
needs
a
break
to
compose
themselves
.
</p>
<p>
Lastly
,
it
's
okay
to
have
a
bad
close
.
It
's
okay
to
struggle
sometimes
.
Keep
you
head
up
,
put
pride
in
your
work
,
and
remember
that
it
's
really
-
honestly
-
just
coffee
.
You
're
doing
great
!
</p>
