empty
cardboard
tubes
from
paper
towels
,
toilet
paper
,
food
wrap
and
foil
to
attach
(
i.
e.

See
whether
your
parents
or
a
neighbor
has
an
old
3/4
inch
diameter
(
19mm
)
water
hose
to
make
tunnels
--
but
hoses
that
are
1/2
inch
(
13mm
)
or
5/8
inch
(
16mm
)
are
not
large
enough
.

Use
pieces
of
PVC
pipe
or
tubing
for
tunnels
.
<figure rend="Make a Marble Rollercoaster Step 3.jpg">

<item>
Make
troughs
(
open
channels
)
of
cardboard
or
such
to
connect
tubing
at
places
to
be
able
to
see
the
progress
of
the
marble
passing
through
there
.

Try
splitting
open
foam
pipe
which
is
malleable
and
should
enable
you
to
make
troughs
and
bend
it
to
make
arches
,
curves
,
and
up
and
down
areas
.

guide
it

Possibly
you
can
put
