Model
</head>
<p>
The
MATLAB
is
adopted
for
system
modeling
and
simulation
,
and
ode45
algorithm
is
employed
.
Considering
that
the
pressure
pulsation
caused
by
the
oil
pump
is
12
%
,
the
speed
of
plunger
pump
is
990
rpm
,
the
number
of
plungers
is
seven
,
so
the
pulsation
frequency
is
116
Hz
.
The
nominal
parameters
of
the
hydraulic
screw
down
system
of
the
rolling
mill
used
in
the

Influence
of
Different
Equivalent
Damping
Coefficients
on
Nonlinear
Dynamic
Behavior
</head>
<p>
It
is
found
that
different
equivalent
damping
coefficients
have
a
great
influence
on
the
nonlinear
system
.
At
the
initial
value
,
the
system
damping
coefficients
are
respectively
defined
as
,
,
and
.
The
time
–
domain
diagrams
of
the
vibration
displacement
of
the
cylinder
are
displayed

An
improved
frequency
–
domain
integral
method
based
on
low-frequency
filtering
of
vibration
intensity
is
adopted
to
obtain
the
vibration
intensity
of
the
system
under
different
damping
coefficients
.
The
curve
is
shown
in
<figure>
Figure

</figure>
.
</p>
<p>
<figure>
Figure

</figure>
shows
the
vibration
simulations
that
result
from
the
hydraulic
cylinder
of
the
rolling
mill
with
different
equivalent
damping
coefficients
under
the
same
conditions
.
Through
the
vibration
displacement
curve
,
it
can
be
clearly
found
that
the
vibration
amplitude
of
vibration
displacement
significantly
increases
with
the
damping
coefficient
decreasing
.
Through
the
phase
diagram
,
it
can
be
found
that
the
system
moves
from
a
stable
state
to
a
periodic
vibration
state
and
becomes
unstable
with
the
damping
coefficient
decreasing
.
From
the
perspective
of
vibration
intensity
,
as
shown
in
<figure>
Figure
5
</figure>
,
it
can
clearly
be
found
that
the
vibration
intensity
of
the
system
can
be
effectively
suppressed
by
increasing
the
damping
.

Influence
of
Different
Leakage
Coefficients
on
Nonlinear
Dynamic
Behavior
</head>
<p>
The
hydraulic
system
is
sealed
with
a
rubber
ring
.
Due
to
the
influence
of
oil
temperature
and
oil
cleanliness
,
the
seal
of
the
hydraulic
cylinder
will
deteriorate
with
time
,
resulting
in
different
levels
of
oil
leakage
.
By
studying
the
influence
of
different
internal
leakage
coefficients
on
the
system
,
the
vibration
mechanism
of
the
hydraulic
cylinder
caused
by
the
leakage
can
be
analyzed
.
</p>
<p>
The
leak
coefficients
of
the
hydraulic
cylinder
are
defined
as
,
,
and
.
If
you
take
the
initial
value
,
the
time
–
domain
diagram
of
the
vibration
displacement
of
the
cylinder
and
the
phase
diagram
of
the
vibration
displacement
–
speed
are
shown
in
<figure>
Figure
6
</figure>
.
The
vibration
intensities
of
the
system
under
different
leakage
coefficients
are
displayed
in
<figure>
Figure
7
</figure>
.
</p>
<p>
<figure>
Figure
6
</figure>
shows
the
simulation
results
of
the
different
leakage
coefficients
of
the
hydraulic
cylinder
under
the
same
other
conditions
.
It
can
be
seen
from
<figure>
Figure
6
</figure>
that
the
vibration
displacement
of
the
hydraulic
cylinder
is
small
when
the
leakage
coefficient
is
small
.
And
from
the
phase
diagram
,
it
can
be
observed
that
the
system
is
convergence
.
By
increasing
the
leakage
coefficient
of
the
hydraulic
cylinder
,
the
amplitude
of
the
vibration
displacement
increases
.
From
the
phase
diagram
,
it
is
difficult
to
stabilize
from
the
convergence
to
the
stage
of
multi-period
vibration
.
From
the
variation
of
vibration
intensity
in
<figure>
Figure
7
</figure>
,
it
can
be
found
that
the
vibration
intensity
increases
with
the
increase
of
the
leakage
coefficient
.
Therefore
,
the
increase
of
system
leakage
will
increase
the
intensity
of
vertical
vibration
.

The
Influences
of
Proportional
Parameter
of
Vibration
Controller
on
Nonlinear
Dynamic
Behavior
</head>
<p>
The
proportional
parameters
of
the
controller
affect
the
control
effect
of
vibration
suppression
.
As
certain
process
parameters
or
structural
parameters
of
the
system
are
changed
,
fixed
parameters
are
bound
to
have
adverse
effects
.
When
other
parameters
are
the
same
,
the
proportional
coefficients
of
the
controller
are
set
as
,
,
and
.
Integral
coefficient
,
and
differential
coefficient
.
The
initial
value
is
set
as
.
The
time
–
domain
diagram
and
the
vibration
displacement
–
speed
phase
diagram
of
the
cylinder
are
shown
in
<figure>
Figure

</figure>
.
With
the
proportional
coefficient
increasing
,
the
vibration
intensity
of
the
cylinder
is
reveled
in
<figure>
Figure

<p>
The
PID
control
algorithm
,
with
the
characteristics
of
simple
structure
and
convenient
implementation
,
can
be
well
applied
to
practical
engineering
.
In
the
PID
control
algorithm
,
the
proportion
coefficient
determines
the
speed
of
system
response
,
and
the
appropriate
integral
coefficient
can
effectively
eliminate
the
system
error
.
Therefore
,
increasing
the
proportional
coefficient
can
improve
the
response
speed
of
the
system
,
but
a
big
proportional
coefficient
may
cause
the
system
instability
.
