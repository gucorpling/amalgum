Student
Loans
of
$18.4k
.
Currently
making
around
25k
.
I
have
enough
savings
to
cover
the
loan
.
Working
on
CCNA
certificate

Currently
working
making
around
25k
per
year
after
taxes
.
I
have
been
juggling
retirement
savings
,
401k
,
and
emergency
funds
.
I
am
in
a
very
lucky
position
of
being
able
to
rent
my
parent
's
home
.
They
live
in
another
state
,
so
this
allows
me
to
save
money
.
I
currently
have
a
student
loan
of
$18.3k
,
my
savings
are
looking
around
$17k
,
and
my
emergency
funds
,
are
at
$5k
.
My
bills
are
looking
at
around
$1.2k
per
month
.
I
am
very
lucky
my
parents
are
still
helping
me
out
,
but
I
need
to
get
out
of
under
their
wing
.
I
am
currently
in
the
slow
season
of
the
company
I
work
for
,
and
my
hours
will
be
near
non
for
the
months
of
June/July
.
I
have
decided
to
work
on
my
CCNA
certificate
during
these
two
months
.
If
I
dedicate
myself
these
2
months
I
believe
I
can
take
the
CCNA
and
start
my
networking
career
.
My
plan
is
to
start
a
family
with
my
wife
in
the
next
2
years
,
and
possible
have
a
home
before
our
baby
is
born
.
My
question
is
,
should
I
bite
the
bullet
now
,
and
use
our
savings
and
pay
my
student
loan
,
which
has
an
Interest
rate
of
6.8
%
,
or
keep
paying
the
minimum
plus
some
over
payment
towards
the
principal
each
month
?
The
bills
are
not
the
issue
,
I
live
pretty
comfortably
at
the
moment
,
but
that
can
change
any
day
as
my
current
job
is
very
back
breaking
at
times
,
and
the
hours
fluctuate
with
each
month
.
The
looming
debt
discourages
me
quite
a
bit
every
time
I
think
of
planning
towards
the
future
.
I
want
a
small
home
,
a
kid
,
and
a
relatively
better
paying
job
with
regular
hours
.
Thanks
for
giving
me
a
bit
of
your
time
fellas
.

Refinance
with
a
paydown
to
a
reasonable
percentage
would
definitely
help
,
I
know
some
of
those
companies
even
give
you
a
gift
card
or
some
money
when
you
refi
.
</p>
<p>
As
for
CCNA
,
you
can
probably
get
55k
year
as
long
as
you
have
tech
experience
,
and
if
you
do
n't
,
getting
a
helpdesk
level
job
should
get
you
up
to
35k
year
at
least
to
get
you
started
.
</p>
<p>
I
noticed
you
said
you
have
a
wife
,
does
she
have
income
currently
?
</p>
<p>
Last
note
,
in
a
lot
of
states
25k
for
two
people
qualifies
for
subsidized
Healthcare
,
so
you
could
pad
some
savings
there
.
