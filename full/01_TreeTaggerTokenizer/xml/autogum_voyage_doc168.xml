between
the
Golden
State
Freeway
(
<ref target="Interstate%205">
Interstate

the
Antelope
Valley
Freeway
(
State
Hwy

,
with
new
growth
swelling
beyond
these
borders
.
The
valley
is
home
to
a
lot
of
recent
suburban
development
amidst
some
fairly
rural
landscape
,
enough
so
that
the
valley
's
farmland
and
surrounding
hills
have
frequently
stood
in
for
rural
and
Old
West
locations
in
Hollywood
films
.
The
hills
above
the
valley
are
wild
enough
to
be
home
to
bears
,
mountain
lions
,
coyotes
and
other
wild
animals
