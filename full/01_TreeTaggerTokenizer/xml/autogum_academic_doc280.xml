Conclusions
and
Limitations
</head>
<p>
The
current
study
uses
the
mathematical
principle
of
DP
combined
with
empirical
data
to
determine
the
demand
functions
for
university
football
game
tickets
.
These
estimated
demand
functions
are
fundamental
for
specifying
a
DP
model
.
Based
on
the
calculated
demand
functions
,
it
is
established
that
the
application
of
DP
strategies
would
generate
more
revenues
than
the
optimal
fixed
price
.
Therefore
,
the
study
contributes
to
the
existing
literature
by
analyzing
a
pricing
approach
that
is
applicable
in
the
field
of
online
ticket
sales
.
</p>
<p>
The
other
important
result
of
our
study
is
the
capacity
distribution
according
to
the
game
intensity
.
It
has
been
shown
that
it
is
not
always
optimal
for
a
club
to
sell
the
entire
capacity
of
tickets
by
itself
.
Getting
involved
with
a
retailer
can
be
beneficial
if
the
club
can
earn
a
commission
based
on
the
sales
from
the
retailer
.
The
results
depict
that
for
a
high
intensity
game
,
the
demand
is
generally
high
and
thus
the
club
should
sell
all
the
tickets
by
itself
.
On
the
other
hand
,
as
the
demand
fluctuates
the
capacity
allocation
is
an
important
factor
and
a
hard
mathematical
problem
for
the
club
to
maximize
its
revenues
from
ticket
sales
.
As
shown
in

Figure

.
when
the
demand
for
tickets
is
relatively
low
,
it
is
optimal
for
the
club
to
retain
20
–
40
%
of
the
tickets
and
the
rest
of
the
capacity
should
be
sold
to
online
retailers
.
In
the
real
world
,
this
pricing
technique
has
been
used
by
football
clubs
and
thus
the
secondary
market
online
retailers
like
Ticketmaster
and
Vivid
Seats
have
become
popular
in
the
last
decade
.
</p>
<p>
There
are
at
some
limitations
to
the
present
study
.
First
,
only
the
ticket
prices
of
games
played
by
the
university
football
team
have
been
studied
.
An
evaluation
of
other
sports
clubs
for
different
games
in
other
leagues
might
reveal
different
demand
functions
,
which
are
the
core
element
of
a
DP
model
.
Thus
,
it
seems
advisable
to
repeat
this
study
in
a
different
context
.
As
mentioned
in
the
introduction
,
several
previous
researches
have
pointed
out
to
the
fact
that
loyal
fans
are
not
always
deterred
by
high
ticket
prices
.
Due
to
this
fact
,
several
researchers
have
reported
a
positive
correlation
of
game
attendance
with
ticket
prices
.
Thus
,
a
more
robust
data
centric
study
considering
all
factors
is
required
for
further
analysis
.
The
present
dataset
does
not
contain
transactions
on
season
tickets
;
thus
,
the
present
study
is
limited
to
only
individual
transactions
.
As
is
evident
,
teams
tend
to
hold
on
to
their
season
ticket
holders
by
offering
a
lower
price
;
a
future
study
involving
season
ticket
transactions
and
DP
is
required
to
find
the
optimal
fixed
price
for
season
tickets
.
Furthermore
,
the
estimated
demand
functions
for
five
games
rely
on
a
small
sample
data
set
.
Hence
,
future
research
could
extend
the
findings
from
the
current
study
by
analyzing
a
larger
data
set
involving
multiple
teams
and
multiple
games
.
Second
,
the
designed
DP
model
is
based
on
only
five
demand
functions
,
one
for
each
home
game
played
by
the
university
.
This
study
considers
the
home
game
as
high
ranked
based
on
its
previous
performances
.
However
,
if
the
home
game
is
either
medium
or
low
ranked
then
at
least
nine
different
demand
functions
need
to
be
considered
for
all
game
types
.
This
would
provide
a
more
detailed
analysis
of
how
the
capacity
distribution
of
tickets
should
be
allocated
by
the
club
to
maximize
its
revenues
.
However
,
one
reason
the
DP
strategy
for
pricing
sports
tickets
has
been
studied
extensively
is
due
to
interest
in
different
kinds
of
factors
,
such
as
current
position
in
the
league
standings
or
weather
conditions
,
in
order
to
price
the
tickets
.
These
factors
have
not
been
considered
in
the
present
study
.
Finally
,
the
present
study
considers
only
one
type
of
seats
for
simplicity
for
pricing
the
tickets
.
Prices
for
different
zones
and
seat
types
may
yield
different
result
in
terms
of
distribution
of
the
capacity
.
However
,
the
main
result
of
DP
for
generating
maximum
revenues
should
not
change
when
different
seat
types
are
considered
.
Finally
,
the
study
has
been
done
from
the
perspective
of
the
home
team
club
.
The
main
objective
is
to
maximize
the
revenue
of
the
club
from
online
ticket
sales
through
third-party
retailers
.
A
further
scope
of
research
would
be
to
consider
sales
from
both
the
club
and
the
retailer
’s
perspective
and
maximize
the
revenue
of
the
supply
chain
.
The
online
retailer
might
not
be
able
to
sell
all
the
tickets
,
in
which
case
a
salvage
value
can
be
considered
if
the
ticket
is
unsold
.
Thus
,
the
retailer
will
have
a
differentiated
strategy
and
the
overall
supply
chain
needs
to
be
considered
for
the
benefit
of
the
club
and
the
online
retailer
.
