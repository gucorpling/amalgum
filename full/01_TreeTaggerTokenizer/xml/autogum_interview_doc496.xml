2001
affidavit

Woodcraft
went
on
to
state
:
&quot;
I
would
also
comment
that
if

have
removed

I
just
do
n't

just
a
maze
of
stuff
.
Also
panelling
as
well
,
basically
strip
the
ship
back
to
a
steel
hull
.
Also
blue
asbestos
is
sprayed
onto
the
outer
walls
and
then
covered
in
paint
.
It
's
in
every
nook
and
cranny
