Polychrome
's
Magic
</head>
<p>
On
this
morning
,
which
ought
to
be
the
last
of
this
important
journey
,
our
friends
started
away
as
bright
and
cheery
as
could
be
,
and
Woot
whistled
a
merry
tune
so
that
Polychrome
could
dance
to
the
music
.
</p>
<p>
On
reaching
the
top
of
the
hill
,
the
plain
spread
out
before
them
in
all
its
beauty
of
blue
grasses
and
wildflowers
,
and
Mount
Munch
seemed
much
nearer
than
it
had
the
previous
evening
.
They
trudged
on
at
a
brisk
pace
,
and
by
noon
the
mountain
was
so
close
that
they
could
admire
its
appearance
.
Its
slopes
were
partly
clothed
with
pretty
evergreens
,
and
its
foot-hills
were
tufted
with
a
slender
waving
bluegrass
that
had
a
tassel
on
the
end
of
every
blade
.
And
,
for
the
first
time
,
they
perceived
,
near
the
foot
of
the
mountain
,
a
charming
house
,
not
of
great
size
but
neatly
painted
and
with
many
flowers
surrounding
it
and
vines
climbing
over
the
doors
and
windows
.
</p>
<p>
It
was
toward
this
solitary
house
that
our
travelers
now
directed
their
steps
,
thinking
to
inquire
of
the
people
who
lived
there
where
Nimmie
Amee
might
be
found
.
</p>
<p>
There
were
no
paths
,
but
the
way
was
quite
open
and
clear
,
and
they
were
drawing
near
to
the
dwelling
when
Woot
the
Wanderer
,
who
was
then
in
the
lead
of
the
little
party
,
halted
with
such
an
abrupt
jerk
that
he
stumbled
over
backward
and
lay
flat
on
his
back
in
the
meadow
.
The
Scarecrow
stopped
to
look
at
the
boy
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Why
did
you
do
that
?
&quot;
he
asked
in
surprise
.
</p>
<p>
Woot
sat
up
and
gazed
around
him
in
amazement
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
--
I
do
n't
know
!
&quot;
he
replied
.
</p>
<p>
The
two
tin
men
,
arm
in
arm
,
started
to
pass
them
when
both
halted
and
tumbled
,
with
a
great
clatter
,
into
a
heap
beside
Woot
.
Polychrome
,
laughing
at
the
absurd
sight
,
came
dancing
up
and
she
,
also
,
came
to
a
sudden
stop
,
but
managed
to
save
herself
from
falling
.
</p>
<p>
Everyone
of
them
was
much
astonished
,
and
the
Scarecrow
said
with
a
puzzled
look
:
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
do
n't
see
anything
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Nor
I
,
&quot;
said
Woot
;
&quot;
but
something
hit
me
,
just
the
same
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Some
invisible
person
struck
me
a
heavy
blow
,
&quot;
declared
the
Tin
Woodman
,
struggling
to
separate
himself
from
the
Tin
Soldier
,
whose
legs
and
arms
were
mixed
with
his
own
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
'm
not
sure
it
was
a
person
,
&quot;
said
Polychrome
,
looking
more
grave
than
usual
.
&quot;
It
seems
to
me
that
I
merely
ran
into
some
hard
substance
which
barred
my
way
.
In
order
to
make
sure
of
this
,
let
me
try
another
place
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
She
ran
back
a
way
and
then
with
much
caution
advanced
in
a
different
place
,
but
when
she
reached
a
position
on
a
line
with
the
others
she
halted
,
her
arms
outstretched
before
her
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
can
feel
something
hard
--
something
smooth
as
glass
,
&quot;
she
said
,
&quot;
but
I
'm
sure
it
is
not
glass
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Let
me
try
,
&quot;
suggested
Woot
,
getting
up
;
but
when
he
tried
to
go
forward
,
he
discovered
the
same
barrier
that
Polychrome
had
encountered
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
No
,
&quot;
he
said
,
&quot;
it
is
n't
glass
.
But
what
is
it
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Air
,
&quot;
replied
a
small
voice
beside
him
.
&quot;
Solid
air
;
that
's
all
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
They
all
looked
downward
and
found
a
sky-blue
rabbit
had
stuck
his
head
out
of
a
burrow
in
the
ground
.
The
rabbit
's
eyes
were
a
deeper
blue
than
his
fur
,
and
the
pretty
creature
seemed
friendly
and
unafraid
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Air
!
&quot;
exclaimed
Woot
,
staring
in
astonishment
into
the
rabbit
's
blue
eyes
;
&quot;
whoever
heard
of
air
so
solid
that
one
cannot
push
it
aside
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
You
ca
n't
push
this
air
aside
,
&quot;
declared
the
rabbit
,
&quot;
for
it
was
made
hard
by
powerful
sorcery
,
and
it
forms
a
wall
that
is
intended
to
keep
people
from
getting
to
that
house
yonder
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Oh
;
it
's
a
wall
,
is
it
?
&quot;
said
the
Tin
Woodman
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Yes
,
it
is
really
a
wall
,
&quot;
answered
the
rabbit
,
&quot;
and
it
is
fully
six
feet
thick
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
How
high
is
it
?
&quot;
inquired
Captain
Fyter
,
the
Tin
Soldier
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Oh
,
ever
so
high
;
perhaps
a
mile
,
&quot;
said
the
rabbit
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Could
n't
we
go
around
it
?
&quot;
asked
Woot
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Of
course
,
for
the
wall
is
a
circle
,
&quot;
explained
the
rabbit
.
&quot;
In
the
center
of
the
circle
stands
the
house
,
so
you
may
walk
around
the
Wall
of
Solid
Air
,
but
you
ca
n't
get
to
the
house
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Who
put
the
air
wall
around
the
house
?
&quot;
was
the
Scarecrow
's
question
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Nimmie
Amee
did
that
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Nimmie
Amee
!
&quot;
they
all
exclaimed
in
surprise
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Yes
,
&quot;
answered
the
rabbit
.
&quot;
She
used
to
live
with
an
old
Witch
,
who
was
suddenly
destroyed
,
and
when
Nimmie
Amee
ran
away
from
the
Witch
's
house
,
she
took
with
her
just
one
magic
formula
--
pure
sorcery
it
was
--
which
enabled
her
to
build
this
air
wall
around
her
house
--
the
house
yonder
.
It
was
quite
a
clever
idea
,
I
think
,
for
it
does
n't
mar
the
beauty
of
the
landscape
,
solid
air
being
invisible
,
and
yet
it
keeps
all
strangers
away
from
the
house
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Does
Nimmie
Amee
live
there
now
?
&quot;
asked
the
Tin
Woodman
anxiously
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Yes
,
indeed
,
&quot;
said
the
rabbit
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
And
does
she
weep
and
wail
from
morning
till
night
?
&quot;
continued
the
Emperor
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
No
;
she
seems
quite
happy
,
&quot;
asserted
the
rabbit
.
</p>
<p>
The
Tin
Woodman
seemed
quite
disappointed
to
hear
this
report
of
his
old
sweetheart
,
but
the
Scarecrow
reassured
his
friend
,
saying
:
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Never
mind
,
your
Majesty
;
however
happy
Nimmie
Amee
is
now
,
I
'm
sure
she
will
be
much
happier
as
Empress
of
the
Winkies
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Perhaps
,
&quot;
said
Captain
Fyter
,
somewhat
stiffly
,
&quot;
she
will
be
still
more
happy
to
become
the
bride
of
a
Tin
Soldier
.
