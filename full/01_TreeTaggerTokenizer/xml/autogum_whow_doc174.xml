Think
in
Another
Language
</head>
<p>
Thinking
in
another
language
can
be
more
useful
than
you
think
!
It
can
be
a
great
way
to
perfect
your
second
language
,
to
learn
a
new
language
quicker
or
to
raise
your
grades
in
a
certain
language
in
school
.
Of
course
,
you
have
to
know
the
basics
of
the
language
before
you
can
start
thinking
in
it
.

Immerse
yourself
in
the
language
.
Learning
by
immersion
is
one
of
the
best
ways
to
pick
up
a
language
.
The
more
you
're
exposed
to
the
language
,
the
more
likely
you
are
to
begin
thinking
in
that
language
.
Try
going
to
places
you
're
likely
to
find
people
speaking
the
language
,
or
surrounding
yourself
with
the
language
by
changing
the
language
on
your
electronics
,
subscribing
to
newspapers
written
in
the
language
,
reading
books
and
watching
movies
in
another
language
,
and
so
on
.

Resist
the
urge
to
use
your
first
language
.
Immersing
yourself
in
a
new
language
can
be
quite
challenging
at
first
,
but
avoid
using
your
first
language
as
a
crutch
.
Try
saving
it
for
when
you
really
need
it
,
because
every
time
you
use
your
first
language
,
you
're
further
off
from
thinking
in
another
language
.
For
instance
,
turn
off
subtitles
while
watching
movies
in
another
language
,
and
try
to
understand
it
naturally
.

<item>
Befriend
someone
who
speaks
another
language
.
Find
someone
who
speaks
your
new
language
as
a
first
language
and
get
in
touch
with
them
.
As
you
interact
with
them
over
time
,
you
'll
find
yourself
thinking
in
their
language
.
If
you
ca
n't
find
anyone
where
you
live
,
try
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Find_a_Penpal">
getting
a
penpal
</ref>
.
There
are
several
avenues
to
find
one
online
,
so
search
websites
to
find
someone
else
looking
for
a
penpal
,
and
write
to
them
.
</item>
<item>
Force
yourself
to
think
in
the
language
.
If
it
's
been
a
while
and
you
still
ca
n't
get
yourself
to
think
in
another
language
,
try
forcing
yourself
to
let
go
of
your
old
language
.
If
you
notice
yourself
thinking
in
your
first
language
,
scrap
the
thought
or
continue
with
the
language
you
're
trying
to
learn.
.
If
you
've
tried
this
and
are
still
failing
,
it
is
likely
that
you
just
do
n't
know
the
language
well
enough
,
and
need
more
practice
.

If

the
day
before
and

in
it
as
often
as
possible
.

're
trying
to
learn
.
