How
is
the
tour
going
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Caribou
:
</hi>
It
’s
been
really
good
so
far
.
We
started
with
a
few
festivals
in
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Europe">
Europe
</ref>
and
then
did
a
month
around
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_Kingdom">
UK
</ref>
,
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Germany">
Germany
</ref>
and
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/France">
France
</ref>
.
Over
here
we
just
did
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Canada">
Canada
</ref>
and
this
is
the
start
of
a
big
tour
for
us
around
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_States">
States
</ref>
.
Then
Europe
for
another
month
.
It
’s
pretty
full
on
,
but
I
love
playing
shows
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
How
do
European
and
American
audiences
compare
to
each
other
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Caribou
:
</hi>
I
get
asked
that
all
the
time
and
I
feel
people
are
expecting
some
kind
of
an
answer
like
we
are
better
received
in
Europe
,
and
I
do
n’t
know
if
people
expect
that
of
an
electronic
musician
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
But
they
are
more
electronic
in
Europe
than
they
are
here
,
right
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Caribou
:
</hi>
Maybe
,
but
my
experience
is
that
people
are
more
similar
than
different
in
all
the
shows
,
and
the
reaction
is
more
similar
than
different
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
You
reach
the
same
fans
in
each
place
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Caribou
:
</hi>
Yeah
people
are
so
connected
to
the
interests
that
they
share
with
other
people
around
the
world
.
It
’s
not
like
one
place
is
completely
different
from
another
anymore
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
Do
you
play
to
larger
audiences
over
there
or
here
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Caribou
:
</hi>
It
’s
about
the
same
,
again
.
When
we
play
in
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/London">
London
</ref>
we
play
about
same
size
venue
and
size
crowd
as
we
do
here
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
Do
you
have
a
favorite
venue
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Caribou
:
</hi>
A
few
,
actually
.
Bowery
Ballroom
is
one
of
my
favorites
.
It
's
always
awesome
.
The
sound
is
so
good
here
,
which
is
really
important
.
It
sounds
good
on
stage
,
which
is
important
for
getting
into
the
show
.
We
always
have
really
amazing
crowds
in
this
place
called
Richards
on
Richards
in
Vancouver
.
This
venue
in
Slovenia
we
played
that
is
this
old
commune
squat
that
has
lots
of
gigs
and
art
going
over
there
called
the
Metalkova
.
The
best
ones
are
the
surprises
we
'll
play
in
a
tiny
little
town
in
some
venue
that
is
like
whatever
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
What
would
be
a
dream
venue
to
play
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Caribou
:
</hi>
Something
along
the
lines
of
this
place
we
played
in
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South%20of%20France">
south
of
France
</ref>
that
was
this
1920s
arts
patron
villa
where
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean%20Cocteau">
Cocteau
</ref>
and
all
these
people
lived
and
worked
,
and
we
played
just
outside
there
overlooking
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French%20Riviera">
French
Riviera
</ref>
during
this
tiny
little
festival
,
so
those
ones
are
always
fun
when
you
just
end
up
at
some
idyllic
spot
where
they
have
put
together
a
little
festival
with
great
bands
.
Those
tend
to
be
in
Europe
,
to
be
honest
.
The
surprise
is
part
of
the
enjoyment
when
you
arrive
and
it
's
like
,
this
is
an
insane
place
to
play
.
