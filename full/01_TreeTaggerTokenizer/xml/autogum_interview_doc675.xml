Would
you
agree
with
the
idea
that
children
do
n't
grow
up
reading
much
anymore
,
outside
of
what
's
required
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>

I
think
they
do
.
There
's
always
been
a
number
of
young
people
who
are
in
the
category
of
being
readers
and
the
majority
are
not
.
And
that
was
true
when
I
was
a
child
and
when
my
wife
was
a
child
.
My
wife
has
now
been
a
professional
reader
and
editor
for
fifty
years
.
But
there
were
those
who
were
drawn
to
reading
and
those
who
were
not
,
found
it
boring
or
were
more
outward
than
internalized
in
their
nature
.
Many
of
the
people
I
know
,
who
are
very
successful
and
read
a
lot
,
are
people
who
experienced
illness
or
injury
when
they
were
young
.
They
grew
up
with
books
because
they
could
not
interact
at
a
young
age
with
their
contemporaries
.
Off
the
top
of
my
head
,
Frances
Ford
Coppollo
,
people
I
know
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin%20Scorsese">
Scorsese
</ref>
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee%20Iacocca">
Lee
Iacocca
</ref>
...
Or
many
people
who
have
had
to
sit
when
they
were
eleven
or
six
or
five
.
They
had
to
stay
in
bed
,
they
were
drawn
to
books
and
the
books
became
their
action
.
The
books
became
their
activity
.
They
vicariously
lived
through
the
work
of
writers
or
maybe
they
lived
through
music
,
maybe
they
lived
through
something
else
.
But
that
idea
of
being
kept
apart
from
the
drive
to
be
popular
,
the
drive
to
be
part
of
a
clique
that
seemed
to
be
in
favor
,
when
you
are
isolated
,
then
maybe
you
are
drawn
out
of
your
isolation
by
what
you
read
and
get
a
larger
sense
of
the
world
.

You
're
saying
that
there
never
was
really
a
time
when
people
read
more
unless
they
had
cause
to
read
a
lot
based
upon
their
circumstances
?

Well
I
'll
talk
about
what
I
really
know
,
which
is
what
I
have
personally
experienced
.
I
grew
up
in
a
home
with
very
few
books
.
There
was
one
book
,
and
I
had
no
idea
how
my
father
got
it
.
Maybe
someone
gave
it
to
him
.
Short
stories
by
the
French
writer
Guy
de
Maupassant
.
I
read
those
stories
,
all
of
them
,
twice
probably
,
when
I
was
ten
.
Later
on
,
when
I
was
in
high
school
,
12
,
13
,
14
,
15
,
I
was
reading
fiction
.
The
fiction
I
was
reading
,
and
I
wrote
about
this
in
my
last
book
,
was
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank%20Yerby">
Frank
Yerby
</ref>
.
People
have
never
heard
of
him
;
he
's
not
in
any
canon
.
Frank
Yerby
was
a
black
man
,
who
lived
in
Spain
and
wrote
these
romance
novels
.
And
there
must
have
been
seven
or
eight
or
nine
of
them
.
They
sold
very
well
.
A
few
of
them
were
made
into
movies
I
never
saw
.
I
loved
those
stories
because
they
were
richly
described
.
The
characters
were
very
very
detailed
.
Very
precise
detail
.
And
that
shaped
my
life
.
I
was
a
writer
who
does
very
much
insist
on
and
has
affection
for
detail
.
