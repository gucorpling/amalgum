Around
2:30PM
a
young
man
arrived
in
front
of
the
Church
to
counter
the
Anonymous
group
with
a
yellow
sign
reading
&quot;
Freedom
of
[
Religion
]
&quot;
on
one
side
,
and
&quot;
It
's
Their
Choice
&quot;
on
the
other
.
He
began
by
calling
out
&quot;
It
's
their
Choice
&quot;
to
which
the
protesters
across
the
street
replied
&quot;
We
Agree
&quot;
and
then
&quot;
Right
to
join
,
Right
to
leave
!
&quot;
Some
Anonymous
members
swarmed
over
to
confront
the
man
,
but
were
restrained
to
one-on-one
talks
with
him
by
another
Anonymous
member
.
He
later
left
the
area
after
talks
with
the
protesters
.
</p>
<p>
BBC
News
drove
by
taking
video
of
the
protesters
,
but
did
not
stop
for
interviews
.

Over
250
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Anonymous_(group)">
Anonymous
</ref>
protesters
were
out
in
force
once
more
on
the
corners
,
at

'
s

church
at
the
corners
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beacon%20Street">
Beacon
</ref>
and
Hereford
Streets
.
Protesters
only
took
up
three
corners
,
instead
all
four
like
they
did
on
February
10th
as
police
asked
them
politely
to
leave
the
street
in
front
of
Church
vacant
.
Even
though
the
protesters
had
a
permit
for
all
streets
,
they
complied
.
</p>
<p>
Wikinews
talked
to
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston%20Police">
Boston
Police
</ref>
and
was
denied
a
video
statement
by
one
officer
telling
the
reporter
,
&quot;
Get
out
of
here
,
&quot;
and
brushing
him
off
.
However
,
the
reporter
asked
another
officer
if
there
had
been
any
trouble
.
The
officer
responded
that
there
had
been
&quot;
no
trouble
,
just
people
walking
back
and
forth
.
&quot;
Most
the
protest
consisted
of
protesters
handing
out
information
pamphlets
,
DVDs
,
viral
marketing
cards
for
their
campaign
,
talking
to
pedestrians
who
were
passing
by
,
shouting
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet%20meme">
Internet
memes
</ref>
to
one
another
and
shouting
various
chants
.
</p>
<p>
Some
Anonymous
put
forward
concerns
about
Scientology
plants
in
the
crowd
trying
to
incite
disruption
,
however
,
none
was
noted
.
Other
protesters
mentioned
there
were
rumors
that
the
Scientologists
were
going
to
bus
in
Scientology
students
to
disrupt
the
protester
,
however
,
that
did
not
occur
.
</p>
<p>
Scientologists
were
outside
taking
photos
of
the
protesters
,
unlike
February
10th
,
where
they
remained
inside
and
photographing
from
the
building
.
The
Wikinews
reporter
asked
a
Scientologist
why
he
taking
pictures
,
he
took
the
reporter
's
photograph
and
noted
that
he
&quot;
was
just
taking
pictures
.
&quot;
Wikinews
asked
a
church
member
if
he
would
like
to
give
a
statement
to
Wikinews
on
camera
,
they
denied
the
request
and
told
the
reporter
they
would
send
a
statement
via
email
to
him
.
However
,
Wikinews
has
not
yet
received
a
statement
from
the
Boston
church
.
