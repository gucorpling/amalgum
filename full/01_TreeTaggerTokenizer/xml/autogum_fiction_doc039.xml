VIII
.
Monseigneur
in
the
Country
</head>
<p>
A
beautiful
landscape
,
with
the
corn
bright
in
it
,
but
not
abundant
.
Patches
of
poor
rye
where
corn
should
have
been
,
patches
of
poor
peas
and
beans
,
patches
of
most
coarse
vegetable
substitutes
for
wheat
.
On
inanimate
nature
,
as
on
the
men
and
women
who
cultivated
it
,
a
prevalent
tendency
towards
an
appearance
of
vegetating
unwillingly
--
a
dejected
disposition
to
give
up
,
and
wither
away
.
</p>
<p>
Monsieur
the
Marquis
in
his
travelling
carriage
(
which
might
have
been
lighter
)
,
conducted
by
four
post-horses
and
two
postilions
,
fagged
up
a
steep
hill
.
A
blush
on
the
countenance
of
Monsieur
the
Marquis
was
no
impeachment
of
his
high
breeding
;
it
was
not
from
within
;
it
was
occasioned
by
an
external
circumstance
beyond
his
control
--
the
setting
sun
.
</p>
<p>
The
sunset
struck
so
brilliantly
into
the
travelling
carriage
when
it
gained
the
hill-top
,
that
its
occupant
was
steeped
in
crimson
.
“
It
will
die
out
,
”
said
Monsieur
the
Marquis
,
glancing
at
his
hands
,
“
directly
.
”
</p>
<p>
In
effect
,
the
sun
was
so
low
that
it
dipped
at
the
moment
.
When
the
heavy
drag
had
been
adjusted
to
the
wheel
,
and
the
carriage
slid
down
hill
,
with
a
cinderous
smell
,
in
a
cloud
of
dust
,
the
red
glow
departed
quickly
;
the
sun
and
the
Marquis
going
down
together
,
there
was
no
glow
left
when
the
drag
was
taken
off
.
</p>
<p>
But
,
there
remained
a
broken
country
,
bold
and
open
,
a
little
village
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
,
a
broad
sweep
and
rise
beyond
it
,
a
church-tower
,
a
windmill
,
a
forest
for
the
chase
,
and
a
crag
with
a
fortress
on
it
used
as
a
prison
.
Round
upon
all
these
darkening
objects
as
the
night
drew
on
,
the
Marquis
looked
,
with
the
air
of
one
who
was
coming
near
home
.
</p>
<p>
The
village
had
its
one
poor
street
,
with
its
poor
brewery
,
poor
tannery
,
poor
tavern
,
poor
stable-yard
for
relays
of
post-horses
,
poor
fountain
,
all
usual
poor
appointments
.
It
had
its
poor
people
too
.
All
its
people
were
poor
,
and
many
of
them
were
sitting
at
their
doors
,
shredding
spare
onions
and
the
like
for
supper
,
while
many
were
at
the
fountain
,
washing
leaves
,
and
grasses
,
and
any
such
small
yieldings
of
the
earth
that
could
be
eaten
.
Expressive
signs
of
what
made
them
poor
,
were
not
wanting
;
the
tax
for
the
state
,
the
tax
for
the
church
,
the
tax
for
the
lord
,
tax
local
and
tax
general
,
were
to
be
paid
here
and
to
be
paid
there
,
according
to
solemn
inscription
in
the
little
village
,
until
the
wonder
was
,
that
there
was
any
village
left
unswallowed
.
</p>
<p>
Few
children
were
to
be
seen
,
and
no
dogs
.
As
to
the
men
and
women
,
their
choice
on
earth
was
stated
in
the
prospect
--
Life
on
the
lowest
terms
that
could
sustain
it
,
down
in
the
little
village
under
the
mill
;
or
captivity
and
Death
in
the
dominant
prison
on
the
crag
.
</p>
<p>
Heralded
by
a
courier
in
advance
,
and
by
the
cracking
of
his
postilions
'
whips
,
which
twined
snake-like
about
their
heads
in
the
evening
air
,
as
if
he
came
attended
by
the
Furies
,
Monsieur
the
Marquis
drew
up
in
his
travelling
carriage
at
the
posting-house
gate
.
It
was
hard
by
the
fountain
,
and
the
peasants
suspended
their
operations
to
look
at
him
.
He
looked
at
them
,
and
saw
in
them
,
without
knowing
it
,
the
slow
sure
filing
down
of
misery-worn
face
and
figure
,
that
was
to
make
the
meagreness
of
Frenchmen
an
English
superstition
which
should
survive
the
truth
through
the
best
part
of
a
hundred
years
.
</p>
<p>
Monsieur
the
Marquis
cast
his
eyes
over
the
submissive
faces
that
drooped
before
him
,
as
the
like
of
himself
had
drooped
before
Monseigneur
of
the
Court
--
only
the
difference
was
,
that
these
faces
drooped
merely
to
suffer
and
not
to
propitiate
--
when
a
grizzled
mender
of
the
roads
joined
the
group
.
</p>
<p>
“
Bring
me
hither
that
fellow
!
”
said
the
Marquis
to
the
courier
.
</p>
<p>
The
fellow
was
brought
,
cap
in
hand
,
and
the
other
fellows
closed
round
to
look
and
listen
,
in
the
manner
of
the
people
at
the
Paris
fountain
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
passed
you
on
the
road
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Monseigneur
,
it
is
true
.
I
had
the
honour
of
being
passed
on
the
road
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Coming
up
the
hill
,
and
at
the
top
of
the
hill
,
both
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Monseigneur
,
it
is
true
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
What
did
you
look
at
,
so
fixedly
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Monseigneur
,
I
looked
at
the
man
.
”
</p>
<p>
He
stooped
a
little
,
and
with
his
tattered
blue
cap
pointed
under
the
carriage
.
All
his
fellows
stooped
to
look
under
the
carriage
.
</p>
<p>
“
What
man
,
pig
?
And
why
look
there
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Pardon
,
Monseigneur
;
he
swung
by
the
chain
of
the
shoe
--
the
drag
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Who
?
”
demanded
the
traveller
.
</p>
<p>
“
Monseigneur
,
the
man
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
May
the
Devil
carry
away
these
idiots
!
How
do
you
call
the
man
?
You
know
all
the
men
of
this
part
of
the
country
.
Who
was
he
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Your
clemency
,
Monseigneur
!
He
was
not
of
this
part
of
the
country
.
Of
all
the
days
of
my
life
,
I
never
saw
him
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Swinging
by
the
chain
?
To
be
suffocated
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
With
your
gracious
permission
,
that
was
the
wonder
of
it
,
Monseigneur
.
His
head
hanging
over
--
like
this
!
”
</p>
<p>
He
turned
himself
sideways
to
the
carriage
,
and
leaned
back
,
with
his
face
thrown
up
to
the
sky
,
and
his
head
hanging
down
;
then
recovered
himself
,
fumbled
with
his
cap
,
and
made
a
bow
.
</p>
<p>
“
What
was
he
like
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Monseigneur
,
he
was
whiter
than
the
miller
.
All
covered
with
dust
,
white
as
a
spectre
,
tall
as
a
spectre
!
