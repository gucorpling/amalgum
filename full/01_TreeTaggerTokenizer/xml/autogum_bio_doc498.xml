<p>
Giambelli
was
born
at
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantua">
Mantua
</ref>
about
the
middle
of
the
16th
century
.
Having
had
some
experience
as
a
military
engineer
in
Italy
,
he
went
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain">
Spain
</ref>
to
offer
his
services
to

However
,
his
proposals
were
given
a
lukewarm
reception
,
and
as
he
could
obtain
no
immediate
employment
from
the
king
,
he
moved
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antwerp">
Antwerp

,
where
he
soon
gained
considerable
reputation
for
his
knowledge
in
various
departments
of
science
.
He
is
said
to
have
married
while
living
there

Giambelli
is

vowed
to

for
his
rebuff

,
who
,
having
satisfied
herself
of

engaged
him
to
advise
in

defence
.
His
plans
for
provisioning
the
town
were
rejected
by
the
senate
,
but
they
agreed
to
a
modification
of
his
scheme
for
destroying
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontoon_bridge">

bridge
</ref>
which
closed
the
entrance
to
the
town
from
the

,
by
the
conversion
of
two
ships

&quot;
or
&quot;
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellburners">

Each

heaped

with

stacks

to

it

One
of
these
ships
exploded
against
the
bridge
,
and
besides
allegedly
killing
more
than
1000
Spanish
soldiers
,
effected
a
breach
in
the
structure
of
more
than
200feet

61

This
might
have
led
to
the
relief
of
the

hesitation

Giambelli
went

where
he
was

He
was

in
fortifying
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Estuary">

which
was
considered

site
for

The
exact
contribution
of
Giambelli
to
these

is
unknown
,
because
he

,
the
panic
which
ensued
was
largely
due
to
the
conviction
among
the
Spaniards
that
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireship">

were
&quot;
infernal
machines
&quot;
constructed
by
Giambelli
;
however
they
were
unaware
that
he
was
fully
occupied
by
the
defensive
works
in
the
Thames
and
that
a
national
shortage
of
gunpowder
prevented
its
use
in
the
English
fireships
.

In

presented
a
plan

another
(

which
would
