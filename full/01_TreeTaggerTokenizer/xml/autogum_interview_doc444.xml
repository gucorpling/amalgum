While
nearly
all
cover
of
the
2008
Presidential
election
has
focused
on
the
Democratic
and
Republican
candidates
,
the
race
for
the
White
House
also
includes
independents
and
third
party
candidates
.
These
parties
represent
a
variety
of
views
that
may
not
be
acknowledged
by
the
major
party
platforms
.
</p>
<p>
As
a
non-partisan
news
source
,
Wikinews
has
impartially
reached
out
to
these
candidates
,
throughout
the
campaign
.
The
most
recent
of
our
interviews
is
Gaithersburg

<hi rend="bold">
Why
do
you
want
to
be
President
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
It
's
not
a
matter
of
wanting
to
be
.
I
do
n't
want
to
.
There
is
a
need
.
The
corruption
in
the
administration
has
become
astronomical
.
The
government
must
be
brought
back
to
the
people
.
I
can
do
that
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Have
you
ever
run
for
political
office
before
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
No
,
I
have
not
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Have
you
ever
been
a
member
of
a
political
party
,
other
than
the
one
you
're
currently
in
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
No
,
I
have
not
.
I
have
always
been
a
registered
Independent
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Have
you
ever
campaigned
for
another
political
candidate
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
No
,
I
have
not
.
But
I
've
become
fond
of
the
involvement
now
.
I
will
campaign
for
candidates
in
the
future
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
What
is
your
current
job
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
I
'm
a
Technical
Team
Lead
at
a
small
software
company
.
We
do
real-time
embedded
Linux
work
,
re-assembling
protocols
for
data
analysis
and
critical
information
leakage
.
We
are
the
undisputed
leaders
in
our
field
,
in
no
small
part
due
to
my
contributions
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
What
skills
or
ideas
do
you
bring
from
this
position
,
or
previous
positions
,
that
will
benefit
the
Oval
Office
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
I
have
an
open
mind
.
I
do
not
suffer
from
NIH
(
Not-Invented-Here
)
.
What
I
bring
is
the
ability
to
unify
and
use
the
best
that
everyone
on
my
team
has
to
offer
.
I
am
a
problem
solver
who
knows
that
the
best
way
to
solve
problems
is
to
work
with
and
listen
to
everyone
involved
.
Being
a
member
of
MENSA
helps
as
well
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Obviously
,
the
next
American
President
and
his
or
her
administration
will
face
many
diverse
issues
.
But
if
you
were
to
narrow
identify
the
three
most
important
issues
,
what
would
they
be
?
How
will
you
address
these
issues
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
Only
three
?
1000
words
?
That
's
difficult
...
</p>
<p>
Priority
#1
-
Free
Trade
.
This
is
the
primary
cause
of
our
loss
of
jobs
,
our
dwindling
paychecks
,
our
loss
of
health
care
,
and
so
many
other
problems
.
We
simply
cannot
compete
directly
with
third
world
labor
at
a
dollar
a
day
.
Our
losses
in
the
manufacturing
sector
will
eventually
bring
down
the
economy
.
The
loss
of
generated
revenue
causes
problems
everywhere
,
for
everyone
.
</p>
<p>
Priority
#2
-
Corruption
.
Almost
none
of
our
elected
representatives
actually
works
for
us
any
more
.
Lobbyists
and
special
interests
run
the
country
.
Short-term
greed
rules
the
day
.
This
is
no
way
to
run
a
country
.
I
will
clamp
down
hard
on
lobbyists
and
special
interests
.
I
will
change
the
election
laws
to
affect
permanent
solutions
to
the
underlying
causes
of
corruption
.
</p>
<p>
Priority
#3
-
Illegal
Immigration
and
Foreign
Policy
.
First
order
of
business
is
to
remove
our
troops
from
the
Middle
East
,
and
place
them
along
our
southern
border
to
shut
down
Illegal
Immigration
.
Second
order
is
to
establish
non-oil
economic
ties
with
the
Middle
East
to
help
build
their
economies
.
This
puts
a
damper
on
Terrorism
,
in
that
people
who
are
not
starving
to
death
,
who
are
educated
,
do
not
feed
terrorism
.
</p>
<p>
There
are
so
many
issues
.
They
will
all
be
addressed
.
One
thing
to
remember
,
is
that
it
is
not
just
me
.
My
staff
will
be
addressing
numerous
issues
simultaneously
.
Having
intelligent
,
dedicated
staff
is
crucial
to
a
good
presidency
.
This
,
the
staff-building
,
is
being
done
as
I
write
.
I
have
contact
with
many
great
,
highly-qualifed
people
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Campaigning
for
the
American
presidency
is
one
of
the
most
expensive
exercises
in
the
world
.
How
do
you
deal
with
the
cost
and
fundraising
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
Internet
.
Networking
with
other
candidates
.
Organizing
special
events
.
Relationship
building
.
There
is
no
way
I
can
win
this
election
alone
.
None
of
us
can
.
We
all
know
that
.
I
have
been
in
contact
with
numerous
other
candidates
,
and
we
are
working
to
get
the
attention
of
the
press
.
Once
we
have
their
attention
,
it
is
my
belief
that
Americans
are
starving
for
a
viable
alternative
to
the
GOP/DEM
parties
.
The
momentum
should
build
on
its
own
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Do
you
have
a
running
mate
yet
?
Who
are
they
?
What
are
you
looking
for
in
a
running
mate
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
No
running
mate
as
yet
.
What
I
'm
looking
for
is
intelligence
,
honesty
dedication
,
and
the
kahoonas
to
kick
me
in
the
butt
if
I
start
to
stray
.
</p>
<p>
And
,
quite
frankly
,
after
talking
to
quite
a
number
of
Third
Party
and
Independent
candidates
,
there
is
a
lot
of
that
out
there
!
The
choice
will
actually
be
rather
difficult
.
There
are
a
lot
of
great
VPs
out
there
.
That
's
part
of
the
problem
.
There
are
too
many
good
candidates
,
and
we
need
to
narrow
the
field
down
a
little
and
all
get
behind
just
a
few
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Can
you
win
the
2008
Presidential
election
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
Me
win
?
Perhaps
.
Although
not
for
not
being
perfect
for
the
job
and
a
great
representative
of
the
people
.
Rather
,
my
social
and
presentation
skills
are
a
littly
&quot;
iffy
&quot;
.
I
'm
working
on
it
though
,
and
am
not
ready
to
give
up
just
yet
.
I
'm
persistent
if
anything
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Can
any
third
party
or
independent
candidate
ever
win
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
I
'm
working
on
it
,
doing
the
best
I
can
to
make
sure
that
happens
.
So
,
yes
.
I
believe
so
.
I
hope
so
.
America
is
doomed
to
become
a
second-rate
has-been
of
a
country
if
we
do
n't
topple
the
GOP/DEM
corruption
machine
very
soon
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
If
you
ca
n't
make
it
into
the
Oval
Office
,
who
would
you
prefer
seeing
taking
the
presidency
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
Any
of
the
Independent
or
Third
Party
candidates
.
Anyone
not
associated
with
the
GOP/DEM
power
structure
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
What
should
the
American
people
keep
in
mind
,
when
heading
to
the
polls
this
November
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
Do
n't
waste
your
vote
on
the
GOP/DEM
parties
.
Do
your
homework
and
find
an
Independent
or
Third
Party
candidate
that
you
can
support
.
Voting
GOP
or
DEM
is
simply
a
green
light
for
them
,
to
continue
screwing
the
country
for
every
penny
they
can
squeeze
out
of
us
.
Please
,
vote
Independent
or
Third
Party
.
