Description
of
the
Thermo-Hydraulic
Desalination
Process
</head>
<p>
The
thermo-hydraulic
desalination
process
is
described
<figure>
Figure
1
</figure>
.
It
results
from
a
direct
coupling
of
a
solar-powered
,
Rankine-like
engine
cycle
with
a
RO
module
.
</p>
<p>
The
engine
cycle
is
composed
of
an
evaporator
heated
by
solar
flat-plate
collectors
,
and
a
condenser
cooled
by
the
saltwater
to
be
desalinated
.
The
high-pressure
vapor
of
the
working
fluid
that
is
generated
by
the
evaporator
flows
into
a
first
transfer
tank
filled
with
feed
water
and
pressurizes
it
above
its
osmotic
pressure
.
The
condenser
enables
the
condensation
of
the
working
fluid
previously
accumulated
in
a
second
low-pressure
tank
.
</p>
<p>
The
pressurization
of
the
water
in
the
tank
is
realized
thanks
to
an
elastically
deformable
membrane
which
transfers
the
mechanical
energy
from
the
high-pressure
working
fluid
to
the
feed
water
.
The
working
fluid
vapor
is
produced
by
the
evaporator
at
a
pressure
ranging
from
10
to
20
bars
,
thanks
to
the
heat
delivered
at
about
50
to
80
°C
by
the
solar
collectors
.
The
suitable
working
fluid
for
these
required
operating
conditions
and
for
the
inflammability
criterion
has
been
found
to
be
the
sulfur
dioxide
(
SO2
)
.
</p>
<p>
The
hydraulic
energy
of
the
pressurized
concentrated
water
(
brine
)
flowing
out
of
the
RO
module
is
recovered
by
a
specific
hydraulic
cylinder
(
main
actuator
in
<figure>
Figure
1
</figure>
)
,
which
enables
it
to
pump
and
fill
the
low-pressure
reservoir
with
saltwater
.
A
second
hydraulic
actuator
(
refiling
actuator
in
<figure>
Figure
1
</figure>
)
is
used
to
transfer
the
working
fluid
from
the
low-pressure
condenser
to
the
high-pressure
evaporator
.
The
main
actuator
is
composed
of
three
chambers
in
order
to
make
it
behave
in
a
symmetric
way
in
both
directions
of
movement
,
that
is
to
say
,
in
order
to
ensure
that
the
pumped
and
the
pushed-back
volumes
of
water
inside
the
chambers
are
equal
.
The
pressurization
is
done
in
the
middle
chamber
that
contains
the
driving
piston
,
which
transmits
the
mechanical
energy
and
sets
the
piston
in
movement
in
the
two
lateral
chambers
in
order
to
realize
the
pumping
of
the
saltwater
and
the
filling
of
the
transfer
tank
.
Thanks
to
this
main
hydraulic
cylinder
,
the
feed
water
to
be
desalinated
is
firstly
pumped
,
then
goes
through
the
condenser
,
thus
acting
as
a
cold
source
for
the
thermodynamic
cycle
,
and
is
temporarily
accumulated
in
one
of
the
lateral
chambers
of
the
hydraulic
cylinder
.
Simultaneously
,
as
the
piston
moves
,
the
water
to
be
desalinated
,
which
was
previously
accumulated
in
the
second
lateral
chamber
of
the
hydraulic
cylinder
,
is
pushed
out
and
pressurized
in
order
to
fill
the
low-pressure
water
tank
connected
to
the
condenser
.
At
the
same
time
,
the
feed
water
that
is
pressurized
in
the
other
tank
by
the
high-pressure
vapor
of
the
engine
cycle
flows
through
the
RO
membrane
.
Clean
water
(
permeate
)
is
produced
and
the
brine
,
which
is
still
at
high
pressure
,
is
used
to
drive
the
above-mentioned
hydraulic
cylinder
.
</p>
<p>
Several
distributors
and
valves
allow
for
the
role
inversion
of
the
reservoirs
and
the
brine
distribution
in
the
process
,
as
well
as
the
control
and
cycling
of
the
different
operating
steps
of
the
process
.
The
brine
flow
is
controlled
at
the
main
cylinder
outlet
by
a
constant
flow
rate
valve
,
which
thus
regulates
the
moving
velocity
of
the
cylinder
piston
.
</p>
<p>
The
other
independent
actuator
,
which
ensures
the
pressurization
and
the
transfer
of
the
liquid
working
fluid
from
the
low-pressure
condenser
to
the
high-pressure
evaporator
tank
,
is
set
in
motion
by
high-pressure
vapor
from
the
evaporator
.
The
depressurized
vapor
in
this
cylinder
flows
into
the
condenser
.

Description
of
the
Cycle
Phases
</head>
<p>
The
operating
cycle
of
the
process
consists
of
several
steps
described
in
<figure>
Figure
2
</figure>
.
An
initialization
phase
enables
pressurization
at
the
high-pressure
Ph
of
the
transfer
tank
1
,
which
is
already
completely
filled
with
saltwater
,
by
connecting
it
to
evaporator
.
Note
that
the
high
operating
pressure
has
to
be
beyond
the
feed-water
osmotic
pressure
to
overcome
transfer
resistance
throughout
the
RO
membrane
.
</p>
<p>
During
the
first
step
,
or
alpha
phase
(
<figure>
Figure
2
</figure>
a
)
,
the
transfer
tank
1
is
linked
to
the
evaporator
,
and
the
transfer
tank
2
is
connected
with
the
condenser
.
The
high-pressure
feed
water
contained
in
the
transfer
tank
1
goes
through
the
RO
module
and
produces
clean
water
under
ideally
constant
pressure
,
Ph.
The
still-pressurized
output
brine
is
recovered
and
used
by
the
main
actuator
to
pump
the
saline
water
and
fill
the
transfer
tank
2
that
is
at
the
condenser
pressure
,
Pl
.
The
water
filling
the
transfer
tank
2
pushes
out
the
vapors
of
the
working
fluid
from
that
tank
to
the
condenser
,
where
it
condenses
at
low
pressure
.
