History
</head>
<p>
Originally
a
Viking
settlement
,
Crosshaven
eeked
out
an
existence
as
a
fishing
village
until
the
18th
century
when
it
became
a
British
garrison
town
.
Crosshaven
House
,
formerly
the
residence
of
the
local
Squires
,
The
Hayes
Family
was
built
in
the
same
period
.
</p>
<p>
In
the
late
19th
century
a
convent
and
school
were
built
,
along
with
the
Catholic
and
Anglican
churches
,
and
the
Grand
Hotel
.
</p>
<p>
In
the
early
20th
century
,
tourism
became
important
to
the
town
's
economy
with
the
arrival
of
the
train
and
the
new
fashion
for
visiting
beaches
.
Around
this
time
the
Majorca
Ballroom
was
built
.
</p>
<p>
In
1938
the
British
left
Crosshaven
and
control
of
the
forts
passed
to
the
Free
State
Army
.
After
the
war
the
train
service
was
discontinued
and
though
the
spread
of
private
cars
brought
other
destinations
to
within
reach
of
Cork
residents
,
the
town
remained
popular
with
tourists
.
</p>
<p>
In
1966
,
The
Royal
Cork
Yacht
Club
,
which
claims
to
be
the
oldest
in
the
World
,
having
been
established
in
Cobh
in
1720
,
moved
across
the
harbour
to
Crosshaven
.
Around
the
same
time
,
the
&quot;
Slobland
&quot;
,
an
area
of
silt
in
front
of
Crosshaven
house
was
filled
in
to
become
a
car
park
.
</p>
<p>
In
the
1970s
and
2000s
Crosshaven
experienced
two
construction
booms
which
caused
a
massive
increase
in
population
.
The
even
more
explosive
growth
in
the
population
of
<ref target="Carrigaline">
Carrigaline
</ref>
,
8km
closer
to
<ref target="Cork">
Cork
</ref>
City
,
inhibited
its
growth
as
a
commercial
centre
.
</p>
<p>
Crosshaven
has
a
reputation
for
being
bourgeois
,
partly
as
a
result
of
the
presence
of
the
Yacht
Club
,
but
in
reality
has
a
fairly
broad
population
demographic
.

from
which
two

Walk
</head>
<p>
Crosshaven
has
walks
for
every
level
of
fitness
.
</p>
<p>
A
gentle
walk
leads
from
the
village
to
Drake
's
Pool
,
where
according
to
a
local
apocryphal
tale
,
Francis
Drake
hid
while
fleeing
from
the
Spanish
Armada
.
</p>
<p>
Another
walk
leads
from
the
village
to
Castlepoint
and
up
a
gentle
slope
known
locally
as
&quot;
The
Grassy
&quot;
to
Fort
Camden
,
from
where
a
spectacular
view
of
the
Harbour
can
be
enjoyed
.
It
's
possible
to
continue
from
here
to
Graball
,
where
there
's
a
modest
beach
,
and
from
there
to
Church
Bay
.
It
's
possible
to
walk
from
here
to
Fennel
's
Bay
along
the
Rcoks
,
though
only
when
the
tide
is
more
than
half-way
out
<ref target="http://www.myforecast.com/bin/tide.m%3Fcity%3D66180%26amp%3Bmetric%3Dfalse%26amp%3BtideLocationID%3DT0532">
</ref>
(
check
for
tide
times
)
and
by
people
with
reasonable
rock
climbing
skills
.
Those
that
brave
this
route
are
rewarded
with
excellent
views
of
the
harbour
and
a
chance
to
visit
the
remains
of
World
War
I
gun
turrets
and
look-out
posts
.
</p>
<p>
An
alternative
is
to
walk
from
Church
Bay
up
a
steep
hill
to
TempleBreedy
,
the
church
that
gives
Church
Bay
its
name
,
and
from
there
to
Fennel
's
Bay
.
The
walk
from
Fennel
's
Bay
to
Myrtleville
is
unchallenging
.
The
entire
walk
from
the
village
to
Myrtleville
takes
around
2
or
3
hours
.
