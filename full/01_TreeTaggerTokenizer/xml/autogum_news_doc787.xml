In
an
address
to
the
UN
General
Assembly
in
New
York
on
September
20
,
2006
Hugo
Chávez
,
President
of
Venezuela
,
sharply
criticized
the
US
government
and
its
policies
.
</p>
<p>
At
the
same
time
he
announced
his
country
's
bid
for
a
non-permanent
seat
on
the
Security
Council
,
saying
that
it
will
speak
for
all
countries
which
&quot;
have
no
power
,
no
power
to
make
any
impact
on
the
terrible
situation
in
the
world
&quot;
for
which
,
he
indicated
,
the
US
is
responsible
.
</p>
<p>
President
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo%20Chávez">
Hugo
Chávez
</ref>
said
that
the
greatest
terrorist
threat
for
the
world
is
the
US
government
and
its
imperialistic
policies
.
When
speaking
to
the
assembly
,
Chávez
displayed
the
book
&quot;
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegemony%20or%20Survival">
Hegemony
or
Survival
</ref>
&quot;
,
written
by
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam%20Chomsky">
Noam
Chomsky
</ref>
,
and
recommended
&quot;
this
excellent
book
&quot;
to
the
audience
.
He
described
this
book
as
being
written
&quot;
clearly
and
in
depth
&quot;
an
that
&quot;
the
American
empire
is
doing
all
it
can
to
consolidate
its
system
of
domination
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
He
said
that
&quot;
the
hegemonic
intentions
of
the
imperialistic
power
are
threatening
the
world
&quot;
,
and
called
on
all
the
peoples
of
the
world
,
including
Americans
,
to
respond
to
that
threat
.
</p>
<p>
He
warned
Americans
that
&quot;
The
devil
is
right
at
home
.
The
devil
--
the
devil
,
himself
,
is
right
in
the
house
.
And
the
devil
came
here
yesterday
.
&quot;
,
apparently
referring
to
the
United
States
President
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George%20W.%20Bush">
w
:
George
W.
Bush
</ref>
.
</p>
<p>
Hugo
Chavez
criticized
Bush
,
saying
the
he
was
&quot;
talking
as
if
he
owned
the
world
&quot;
,
and
called
him
&quot;
the
spokesman
of
imperialism
&quot;
.
</p>
<p>
Talking
about
the
US
efforts
at
nation-building
,
he
said
that
it
is
&quot;
a
very
original
democracy
that
's
imposed
by
weapons
and
bombs
and
firing
weapons
.
&quot;
,
adding
&quot;
What
a
strange
democracy
.
Aristotle
might
not
recognize
it
or
others
who
are
at
the
root
of
democracy
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
When
pushing
his
agenda
of
democracy
and
free
trade
in
Latin
America
,
Chávez
accused
President
Bush
of
being
a
racist
,
saying
that
President
Bush
would
look
&quot;
at
your
color
&quot;
and
he
say
&quot;
oh
,
there
's
an
extremist
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evo%20Morales">
Evo
Morales
</ref>
,
the
worthy
president
of
Bolivia
,
looks
like
an
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/extremist">
extremist
</ref>
to
him
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Chavez
indicated
Bush
discriminates
against
Morales
because
Morales
was
the
country
's
first
Indian
president
.
The
newly
elected
president
of
Bolivia
,
announced
plans
of
socializing
part
of
the
energy
resources
,
particularly
gas
in
Bolivia
in
2005
in
a
move
to
try
to
be
more
independent
from
multinational
coorporations
.
</p>
<p>
As
the
president
of
the
Bolivian
Senate
,
Santos
Ramirez
,
put
it
:
&quot;
Bolivia
and
Latin
America
are
no
longer
the
servile
democracies
that
tolerate
...
poverty
and
the
surrendering
of
sovereignty
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Chavez
is
pushing
his
own
socio-economic
agenda
.
For
example
the
People
's
Trade
Treaty
consisting
of
Bolivia
,
Venezuela
and
Cuba
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercosur">
Mercosur
</ref>
,
an
economic
union
designed
after
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European%20Union">
European
Union
</ref>
for
which
in
turn
Bush
sharply
criticized
him
.
</p>
<p>
Chavez
defended
Morales
in
his
speech
by
saying
&quot;
The
imperialists
see
extremists
everywhere
.
It
's
not
that
we
are
extremists
.
It
's
that
the
world
is
waking
up
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Chavez
referred
to
Bush
's
speech
the
day
before
,
when
Bush
directly
addressed
the
peoples
of
Afghanistan
,
Lebanon
and
Iran
,
telling
the
assembly
&quot;
what
would
those
peoples
of
the
world
tell
him
if
they
were
given
the
floor
?
What
would
they
have
to
say
?
-
They
would
say
,
&quot;
Yankee
imperialist
,
go
home
.
&quot;
&quot;
.
</p>
<p>
To
address
the
current
political
issues
he
mentioned
,
Chavez
complained
that
&quot;
But
we
,
the
assembly
,
have
been
turned
into
a
merely
deliberative
organ
.
We
have
no
power
,
no
power
to
make
any
impact
on
the
terrible
situation
in
the
world
.
And
that
is
why
Venezuela
once
again
proposes
,
here
,
today
,
20
September
,
that
we
re-establish
the
United
Nations
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
In
particular
.
he
criticized
the
&quot;
the
anti-democratic
&quot;
veto
held
by
the
Permanent
Five
members
of
the
Security
Council
,
Citing
the
&quot;
immoral
&quot;
veto
of
the
United
States
which
he
said
,
&quot;
allowed
the
Israelis
,
with
impunity
,
to
destroy
Lebanon
.
&quot;
,
referring
to
the

conflict

</p>
<p>
Chavez
said
that
he
wants
to
provide
an
&quot;
alternative
way
of
thinking
&quot;
and
canvassed
for
the
support
of
the
international
community
for
Venezuela
to
attain
a
seat
on
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United%20Nations%20Security%20Council">
United
Nations
Security
Council
</ref>
to
&quot;
to
save
our
planet
,
to
save
the
planet
from
the
imperialist
threat
.
&quot;
and
&quot;
for
our
children
and
our
grandchildren
a
world
of
peace
based
on
the
fundamental
principles
of
a
renewed
United
Nations
.
&quot;
</p>
<head id="U.S._Response">
U.S.
Response
</head>
<p>
U.N.
Ambassador
John
Bolton
said
the
remarks
do
n't
warrant
a
response
.
The
US
is
currently
lobbying
for
Venezuela
not
to
attain
a
seat
on
the
U.N.
Security
Council
.
</p>
<p>
Rep.
Charles
Rangel
(
Democrats
)
who
represents
a
New
York
City
neighborhood
which
Chavez
recently
visited
said
&quot;
I
just
want
to
make
it
abundantly
clear
to
Hugo
Chavez
or
any
other
president
-
do
n't
come
to
the
United
States
and
think
because
we
have
problems
with
our
president
that
any
foreigner
can
come
to
our
country
and
not
think
that
Americans
do
not
feel
offended
when
you
offend
our
Chief
of
State
.
Any
demeaning
public
attack
against
him
is
viewed
by
Republicans
and
Democrats
,
and
all
Americans
,
as
an
attack
on
all
of
us
.
