What
do
you
feel
are
the
three
most
important
issues
to
voters
in
your
riding
?
Are
these
the
same
top
three
issues
that
are
most
important
to
you
?
What
would
you
do
to
address
these
issues
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
Whichever
issues
are
important
to
the
public
are
important
to
me
.
I
believe
three
of
the
biggest
right
now
are
health
,
education
,
and
climate
change
.
My
stance
on
each
issue
would
be
:
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">
Health
</hi>
-
There
are
two
priorities
here
.
First
,
we
must
ensure
that
no
more
hospitals
are
built
with
private
involvement
.
The
citizens
of
Ontario
want
a
fully
public
health
system
,
not
decades
of
obligation
to
private
companies
.
Second
,
we
must
focus
more
on
prevention
and
healthy
lifestyles
,
to
prevent
diseases
before
they
occur
rather
than
treating
them
after
the
fact
.
Unhealthy
lifestyles
are
placing
a
huge
burden
on
our
health
system
and
are
part
of
the
reason
the
system
is
under
so
much
financial
strain
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">
Education
</hi>
-
Parents
should
not
have
to
fundraise
for
their
children
's
education
--
that
's
not
the
meaning
of
&quot;
publicly
funded
&quot;
.
We
need
to
find
more
money
,
and
we
ca
n't
take
it
from
other
areas
that
need
it
either
.
This
is
why
I
support
a
single
public
school
system
.
Merging
our
school
boards
will
save
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
,
which
can
be
used
to
restore
important
school
services
that
have
been
eroded
through
years
of
cost-cutting
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">
Climate
Change
</hi>
-
We
need
to
take
immediate
action
to
reduce
greenhouse
gas
emissions
.
This
is
not
as
tough
a
problem
as
some
people
make
it
out
to
be
,
because
they
are
so
many
different
things
we
can
do
to
make
a
difference
.
We
need
to
reduce
energy
consumption
and
increase
efficiency
(
Canadians
are
some
of
the
world
's
worst
energy-wasters
)
by
setting
tougher
standards
on
appliances
,
homes
,
and
technology
.
We
need
to
reduce
our
use
of
cars
by
encouraging
carpooling
and
transit
,
as
well
as
making
communities
walkable
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
What
should
be
the
first
order
of
business
in
the
39th
Legislative
Assembly
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
The
issue
that
requires
the
most
immediate
attention
is
climate
change
.
The
road
to
sustainability
is
a
long
one
,
so
we
need
to
begin
immediately
.
We
need
to
set
the
tone
and
show
the
rest
of
Canada
that
Ontario
will
be
leaders
in
halting
and
reversing
climate
change
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Are
the
property
taxes
in
your
riding
at
a
fair
level
for
the
amount
of
services
received
in
the
municipality
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
This
is
a
difficult
question
because
there
are
so
many
variables
.
We
could
be
more
efficient
in
how
we
deliver
some
services
(
such
as
education
,
where
there
is
so
much
duplication
between
the
two
school
boards
)
,
while
other
services
are
being
delivered
extremely
well
.
It
would
n't
be
fair
to
paint
everyone
with
the
same
brush
.
