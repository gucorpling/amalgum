As

aspects

Ruttley
soon
realized
the
importance
of
an
interdisciplinary
approach
to
designing
hardware
for
crew
health
,
so
she
pursued
her
master
's
degree
in
Mechanical
Engineering
.

In

Ruttley
responded
to
criticisms
of
the
cost
of
the
ISS
,
saying
,
&quot;
I
think
those

are
naysayers
have
n't
given

a
chance

have
n't
given

enough
