asking
your
photographer
to
shoot
&quot;
environmental
portraits
&quot;

architect

several

her
arm
.
A
construction
executive

holding
a
hard
hat
or
other
tools

trade

newspapers

n't
have
big
photo
staffs

If
you
're
sponsoring
an
event
that
does
n't
necessarily
warrant
a
story

call
the
photo
desk
at

newspaper

photographers
know
what
's
happening

them

If
a
photographer
from
a
newspaper
or
magazine
takes
photos
at
your
company
,
never
demand
to
see
the
negatives
,
or
dictate
what
photo
they
should
use
with
the
article
,
or
ask
for
free
copies
of
prints
.
The
negatives
are
the
property
of
the
media
outlet
,
and
the
media
maintains
full
control
over
their
use
.
If
you
want
prints
,
expect
to
pay
for
them
.
Try
to
ensure
that
the
photographer
gets
a
photo
of
the
big
check
exchange
.

When
sending
prints
to
the
media
,
be
sure
correct
identification
is
on
a
sticker
on
the
back
of
each
photo
.
When
sending
several
photos
,
slip
a
piece
of
paper
between
each
one
so
the
ink
from
the
back
of
one
photo
does
n't
bleed
onto
the
front
of
the
photo
behind
it
.
