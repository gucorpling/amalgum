Get
a
Religious
Girl
to
See
Past
Agnostic
or
Atheistic
Beliefs
</head>
<p>
Have
you
ever
had
trouble
getting
a
date
with
someone
who
is
religious
because
of
your
views
?
Showing
respect
for
the
person
's
beliefs
,
understanding
your
differences
,
and
figuring
out
what
you
have
in
common
are
key
when
it
comes
to
dating
a
religious
girl
.
In
the
end
,
it
's
up
to
you
decide
whether
your
spiritual
divide
is
a
dealbreaker
or
something
you
can
live
with
.

Find
a
woman
of
faith
you
like
.
</hi>
Remember
people
with
religious
faith
vary
as
much
as
atheists
and
agnostics
.
Find
one
who
has
the
characteristics
you
're
looking
for
in
a
girlfriend
and
would
consider
you
as
a
boyfriend
.
Remember
while
many
such
women
would
consider
dating
a
person
outside
her
faith
,
others
would
not

or
<hi rend="italic">
cannot

Show
respect
for
her
beliefs

This
does
n't
mean
attending
religious
services
or
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Stop_People_From_Trying_to_Convert_You_to_Another_Religion">
converting
</ref>
.
You
just
have
to
make
sure
that
they
know
that
you
are
accepting
of
her
faith
.
Do
<hi rend="italic">
not
</hi>
demand
or
ask
her
to
do
things
outside
of
her
religious
faith
.

Respect
and
understand
cultural
,
family
,
or
community
differences
.
For
some
girls
and
women
,
dating
outside
the
community
can
be
<hi rend="italic">
extremely
difficult
and
threatening
</hi>
to
her
family
,
friends
,
and
house
of
worship
.
If
she
is
an
immigrant
or
first-generation
citizen
,
this
is
especially
true
.
Be
sensitive
to
the
fact
girls
and
women
will
often
encounter
a
lot
of
resistance
.
This
may
even
mean
accepting
a
chaperone
on
a
date
,
meeting
only
at
school
,
or
being
formally
approved
by
the
family
members
.

Serve
the
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Find_a_Community_Service_Program">
community
</ref>
.
Community
service
is
a
key
part
of
nearly
all
religions
.
She
may
be
satisfied
knowing
that
you
follow
the
moral
codes
of
her
religion
,
even
if
you
do
not
believe
exactly
in
what
she
believes
in
.
Anyway
,
it
's
a
good
thing
to
do
anyway
.

Be

kind

to
her
.
Treat
her
with
respect
.
This
is
obviously
a
key
part
of
getting
anyone
to
like
you
,
of
any
belief
.

Be

It
may
take
time
to
convince
a
religious
woman
that
you
are
honest
in
your
intentions
and
sincere
in
your
tolerance
,
so
take
your
time

Know
when
to
decide
if
religion
is
a
deal-breaking
issue
.
If
you
go
beyond
casual
boyfriend
and
girlfriend
relationships
,
realize
that
issues
of
faith
can
become
more
serious
--
or
not
.
When
considering
marriage
or
civil
union
,
the
issue
of
faith
becomes
increasingly
more
important
as
you
may
start
a
family
.
Sometimes
,
this
becomes
truly
a
problem
,
and
marriage
cannot
be
a
viable
option
.
But
not
always
,
as
families
sometimes
blend
beliefs
.
In
either
case
,
it
has
to
be
a
joint
decision
by
the
couple
.
Seek
marital
counseling
if
such
problems
become
too
much
.

Tips
</head>
<list type="unordered">
<item>
If
you
are
atheist
or
agnostic
,
be
respectful
of
those
who
have
faith
in
religion
.
It
might
not
be
your
belief
,
but
be
tolerant
of
others
.
</item>
<item>
If
you
are
interested
in
the
basic
tenets
on
her
faith
,
do
some
quick
Wikipedia
research
on
key
figures
,
deities
,
and
other
various
beliefs
in
her
religion
.
</item>
<item>
Most
people
like
to
have
relationships
with
people
they
have
things
in
common
with
.
There
is
no
point
in
having
a
relationship
with
someone
who
thinks
completely
differently
than
you
.
</item>
<item>
Think
about
it
and
admit
it
.
One
of
you
thinks
that
the
other
is
completely
wrong
.
If
there
is
such
a
gap
in
your
way
of
thinking
,
then
it
's
probably
not
a
good
idea
to
pursue
a
&quot;
relationship
&quot;
that
has
a
huge
chance
of
not
working
out
.
</item>
<item>
Statements
like
,
&quot;
Are
n't
Christians
(
or
whatever
religion
she
is)supposed
to
be
kind
to
all
people
,
even
those
who
do
n't
share
your
beliefs
?
&quot;
can
be
helpful
if
the
girl
is
rude
to
you
about
religion
.
But
realize
it
's
not
going
to
help
you
if
you
're
a
jerk
,
and
then
tell
her
not
to
be
.
</item>

<head>
Warnings
</head>
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Do
n't
lie
to
her
.
You
'll
compromise
your
integrity
in
<hi rend="italic">
your
</hi>
beliefs
,
and
if
she
realizes
you
are
faking
interest
in
her
religion
,
she
'll
probably
dump
you
.
</item>
<item>
Do
n't
convert
unless
you
honestly
feel
this
is
the
choice
for
you
.
</item>
<item>
If
she
is
sincere
in
her
beliefs
,
she
probably
wo
n't
really
be
happy
in
the
long
term
with
anyone
who
does
not
share
them
.
Are
you
more
interested
in
making
her
happy
,
or
in
trying
to
make
yourself
happy
?
