Conclusions
</head>
<p>
We
contribute
a
system
design
for
detecting
tourism
hotspots
and
for
segmenting
tourists
based
on
their
interests
in
these
hotspots
,
in
the
case
of
the
geolocated
social
medium
Qyer.com
.
We
theorize
our
solution
towards
a
generalized
formal
methodology
that
can
be
applied
to
other
geolocated
travel
blogs
.
We
demonstrate
the
potential
of
our
system
and
method
through
pilot
application
,
analysing
Chinese
tourism
in
Switzerland
.
The
following
methodological
and
practical
knowledge
can
be
concluded
from
our
research
.
From
an
information
systems
perspective
,
firstly
,
our
system
design
and
formal
methodology
for
hotspot
detection
from
geolocated
social
media
resulted
in
plausible
geographical
distributions
of
tourism
hotspots
,
as
validated
by
cross-references
.
This
study
confirmed
the
known
geographical
long-tail
distribution
of
interest
,
including
the
hotspot
areas
of
Lucerne
,
Zurich
,
Interlaken
and
Geneva
,
validating
the
plausibility
of
the
data
and
its
analysis
.
Secondly
,
in
the
case
study
,
by
application
of
our
proposed
method
we
discovered
a
highly
significant
stochastic
dependence
,
thus
providing
evidence
for
the
value
or
our
proposed
methodology
for
segmentation
.
From
a
tourism
management
perspective
,
thirdly
,
we
can
conclude
that
Chinese
independent
travellers
,
which
are
the
main
target
group
of
Qyer
,
are
mainly
interested
in
discovering
travel
hotspots
in
the
same
way
as
packaged
tourists
are
;
in
addition
,
they
show
interest
in
other
,
less
popular
places
.
Fourthly
,
we
found
that
social
media
activity
,
as
measured
by
the
number
of
followers
and
the
number
of
distinct
commented
locations
,
is
a
very
selective
criteria
to
segment
the
observed
users
regarding
their
interest
in
travel
hotspots
versus
alternative
destinations
.
Users
who
are
more
active
,
who
comment
on
different
places
and
who
have
followers
are
a
minority
.
However
,
these
more
active
users
are
significantly
more
interested
in
alternative
destinations
outside
the
hotspot
axis
.
This
information
can
be
applied
to
define
a
target
group
for
online
marketing
to
promote
alternative
travel
destinations
with
the
goal
to
reduce
overtourism
in
travel
hotspots
.

<p>
Nevertheless
,
this
study
is
not
without
its
limitations
.
First
,
there
are
uncertainties
in
terms
of
the
user
base
of
Qyer
and
its
representativeness
.
Even
though
Qyer
is
known
to
be
a
platform
where
independent
Chinese
travellers
share
their
experiences
,
the
possibility
that
packaged
travellers
are
also
active
on
Qyer
cannot
be
eliminated
.
Furthermore
,
it
is
unknown
whether
the
sample
is
biased
towards
other
subgroups
of
Chinese
outbound
travellers
,
such
as
budget
travellers
.
In
fact
,
research
has
shown
that
different
social
media
platforms
target
different
user
groups
.
Overall
,
there
are
various
uncertainties
in
terms
of
the
representativeness
of
the
entire
visitor
population
as
there
is
a
lack
of
data
covering
the
behaviour
and
characteristics
of
the
visiting
population
,
which
would
be
necessary
to
validate
the
sample
.
Second
,
the
fact
that
a
user
has
commented
on
a
place
or
POI
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
this
user
has
visited
the
place
or
POI
to
which
the
comment
refers
,
even
if
this
indicates
interest
.
Third
,
even
though
Qyer
does
provide
a
timestamp
for
every
comment
,
we
found
that
users
tend
to
upload
their
comments
on
various
places
and
POIs
at
the
same
time
.
It
is
likely
that
they
upload
their
posts
upon
return
to
their
accommodations
,
where
Internet
access
is
available
to
them
.
As
a
result
,
it
is
impossible
to
retrace
visitor
flows
and
evaluate
the
length
of
stay
.
Finally
,
it
was
not
possible
to
separate
Chinese
residents
of
Switzerland
from
the
Chinese
tourists
in
Switzerland
.
Residents
could
be
those
visiting
less
popular
areas
.
</p>
<p>
Regarding
future
research
directions
,
the
hotspots
detected
in
this
paper
do
not
necessarily
imply
that
the
respective
destinations
experience
effects
of
overtourism
.
There
are
various
factors
,
e.
,g
.
population
size
,
history
of
a
tourism
destination
,
distribution
of
the
value
added
,
that
leverage
the
symptoms
of
overtourism
.
Thus
,
the
detected
hotspots
in
this
paper
should
be
critically
evaluated
based
on
additional
criteria
.
In
fact
,
there
are
major
issues
associated
with
social
media
and
blog
data
.
The
information
gained
from
these
sources
may
be
always
biased
,
which
is
an
issue
often
associated
with
generalizations
.
So
,
in
future
studies
,
we
plan
to
put
even
more
efforts
on
validating/evaluating
the
data
we
used
.
