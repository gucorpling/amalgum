Toms
do
not
look
great

Pair
your
Toms
with
shorts

a
casual
summer
look

Toms
are
great
shoes
to
wear
with
shorts
because
they
do
n’t
make
your
feet
look
big

Wear
dark
wash
jean
shorts

a
solid

Wear
no-show
socks
with
your
Toms
for
extra
warmth

very
warm

cold
outside

wear
no-show
socks

do
n’t
go
up
to
your
ankle

cover
the

Keep
your
Toms
dry
by
wearing
them
when
the
weather
is
nice
.
Toms
are
made
of
canvas
,
which
means
they
are
super
comfortable

this
also
means
they
are
not
waterproof

If

wear
your
Toms
in
the
rain
or
snow

your
feet

shoes
at

If
you
are
going

be
traveling
by
plane
or
car
for
a
long
period
of
time
,
pair
your
Toms
with
your
comfortable
traveling
outfit

Toms
do
n’t
make
great
walking
shoes
since
they
do
n’t
have
much
arch
support

If
you
will
be
traveling
on
foot
,
bring
another
pair
of
shoes
to
change
into
