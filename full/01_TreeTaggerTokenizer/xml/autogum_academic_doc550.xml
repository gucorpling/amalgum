This
section
contains
the
results
of
the
experimental
study
for
each
of
the
aforementioned
independent
variables
.
<figure>
Figure

</figure>
displays
the
mean
time
(
in
seconds
)
taken
to
perform
tasks
,
displaying
findings
for
both
methodologies
.
<figure>
Figure

</figure>
shows
the
success
rate
for
each
task
by
learning
methodology
.
All
participants
successfully
performed
the
tasks
of
playing
C
major
,
D
major
,
E
major
,
and
F
major
(
all
32
in
each
group
)
.
However
,
participants
in
both
groups
encountered
greater
difficulty
performing
the
tasks
G
major
,
A
major
,
and
B
major
,
as
finger
placement
was
more
complex
.
In
particular
,
the
B
chord
proved
the
most
difficult
as
it
is
a
bar
chord
.
This
means
participants
had
to
press
five
strings
simultaneously
across
the
fret
with
their
index
finger
.
It
should
be
remembered
that
participants
were
complete
beginners
and
this
was
their
first
contact
with
the
instrument
;
as
such
,
a
chord
was
recorded
as
successful
if
it
was
performed
correctly
in
under
two
minutes
.

Analysis
of
Results
</head>
<p>
Although
the
number
of
successful
tasks
was
not
an
explicit
variable
in
this
study
,
it
has
been
included
to
support
the
acceptance
or
rejection
of
the
null
hypotheses
.
Fisher
’s
F
test
was
used
to
compare
variables
.
The
results
obtained
had
a
<hi rend="italic">
p
</hi>
-value
of
0.88
.
As
this
was
greater
than
0.05
,
it
indicated
that
there
was
no
significant
difference
in
the
success
rates
for
either
methodology
.
</p>
<p>
A
two-way
analysis
of
variance
(
ANOVA
)
was
performed
to
analyze
effects
on
task
completion
times
.
The
two
independent
variables
were
training
methodology
and
gender
.
The
combination
of
both
factors
was
also
analyzed
to
observe
whether
interference
between
them
produced
any
effects
on
the
time
taken
to
perform
tasks
.
</p>
<p>
As
seen
in
Table
2
,
the
<hi rend="italic">
p
</hi>
-values
obtained
for
each
factor
were
&gt;0.05
;
thus
,
the
two
null
hypotheses
proposed
in
Section
3
could
not
be
rejected
:
<list>
<item>
The
time
taken
to
learn
the
basic
musical
chords
on
the
guitar
did
not
depend
on
the
methodology
used
.
</item>
<item>
The
gender
of
participants
did
not
affect
the
time
taken
.
</item>
</list>
</p>
<p>
Based
on
these
findings
,
it
is
possible
to
state
that
there
was
no
significant
difference
between
the
two
methodologies
with
regard
to
learning
times
.
It
can
also
be
stated
that
there
were
no
differences
in
learning
by
gender
within
the
group
itself
or
between
different
methodologies
.
</p>
<p>
Observational
findings
indicated
that
each
methodology
had
its
own
set
of
advantages
and
disadvantages
.
</p>
<p>
Table
3
shows
a
t-student
analysis
(
paired
series
)
of
the
variable
“
time
”
for
each
task
,
in
order
to
identify
whether
there
was
a
significant
difference
in
the
execution
time
of
each
chord
by
learning
method
.
</p>
<p>
These
results
show
in
detail
the
result
of
Table
2
.
In
this
case
,
we
can
see
that
all
tasks
(
except
Task
7
“
Play
B
major
chord
”
)
showed
no
difference
in
the
time
of
execution
(
one
method
or
another
of
learning
)
.
Task
7
required
more
time
from
the
participants
of
the
AR
methodology
group
.

User
Feedback
</head>
<p>
Once
the
experimental
study
was
completed
,
participants
filled
out
the
usability
scale
(
SUS
)
questionnaire
to
establish
the
usability
of
the
ad-hoc
app
that
had
been
developed
to
teach
guitar
chords
using
AR
technology
.
The
questionnaire
consisted
of
10
questions
evaluated
on
a
“
ikert
scale
(
“
strongly
disagree
”
–
“
strongly
agree
”
)
.
The
score
obtained
for
this
usability
questionnaire
was
82.5
.
This
indicator
was
higher
than
the
average
of
68
.
Scores
higher
than
68
indicate
a
good
usability
for
software
.

Observational
Findings
</head>
<p>
Group
1
participants
were
surprised
by
how
easy
it
was
to
follow
the
instructions
provided
by
the
ad-hoc
AR
app
.
In-app
feedback
messages
(
red
cross
—
“
try
again
”
,
green
tick
—
“
well
done
!
”
)
proved
motivation
and
encouraged
participants
to
follow
the
instructions
explaining
how
to
play
chords
.
They
did
not
experience
the
stress
associated
with
waiting
for
instructions
or
feedback
from
a
human
instructor
.
However
,
some
did
state
they
would
have
preferred
to
receive
feedback
and
reassurances
from
a
human
instructor
to
confirm
whether
they
had
played
a
chord
correctly
or
not
.
Participants
appeared
relaxed
as
a
result
of
studying
autonomously
.
Upon
completing
a
task
they
were
often
heard
to
exclaim
,
“
How
easy
”
,
“
Excellent
”
,
“
Awesome
”
,
or
“
Bring
it
on
!
”
(
next
task
)
.
These
comments
served
as
self-motivation
.
The
last
task
,
which
involved
playing
the
B
major
chord
,
created
confusion
.
Users
did
not
understand
that
the
same
color
superimposed
across
multiple
strings
on
the
same
fret
was
an
instruction
to
bar
the
fret
with
a
single
finger
.
The
majority
of
participants
took
a
while
to
understand
that
they
needed
to
use
the
entire
length
of
the
index
finger
to
bar
the
fret
.
Having
completed
all
tasks
,
the
participants
declared
their
interest
in
learning
to
play
guitar
using
AR
assistance
and
that
they
wished
to
continue
using
this
methodology
.
Some
stated
that
this
type
of
learning
could
be
enhanced
by
contact
with
a
music
teacher
to
ensure
their
technique
was
correct
.
