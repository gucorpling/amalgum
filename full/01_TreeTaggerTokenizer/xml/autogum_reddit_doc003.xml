Vanessa
vs
Paul
</head>
<sp who="#Zamoqaq">
<p>
I
understand
most
people
on
this
sub
feel
Vanessa
is
a
better
player
and/or
just
have
a
strong
disliking
for
Paul
,
but
in
my
opinion
I
believe
Paul
is
the
better
player
.
Of
course
,
he
did
lose
twice
in
back
to
back
seasons
,
but
it
's
important
to
remember
he
got
there
in
two
seasons
.
(
however
although
one
of
them
was
with
vets
,
the
other
featured
a
weaker
cast
.
)
His
weak
point
is
unarguably
his
jury
management
.
However
even
in
this
department
,
he
was
n't
that
bad
proven
by
the
fact
that
he
got
4
jury
votes
in
both
seasons
.
Good
players
can
get
to
the
end
,
which
Vanessa
was
n't
able
to
do
whilst
Paul
got
to
the
end
by
winning
final
HOH
and
making
sure
Josh
took
him
.
Additionally
,
even
if
Vanessa
was
to
get
to
the
end
with
Steve
,
there
is
no
guarantee
she
would
have
won
.
Steve
already
had
4
votes
locked
up
(
Austwins
due
to
bitterness
plus
JMac
.
)
It
just
took
one
more
vote
for
Steve
to
win
.
However
,
even
though
BB19
had
a
weaker
cast
,
the
way
Paul
absolutely
dominated
the
game
and
dictated
everything
from
start
to
finish
was
masterful
,
and
the
fact
that
he
did
it
in
two
seasons(although
not
to
the
same
degree
)
just
solidifies
himself
as
a
better
player
in
my
opinion
.
He
also
played
to
different
games
in
both
seasons
,
(
one
from
the
bottom
and
one
from
the
top
)
which
increases
my
opinion
of
him
as
a
player
.
Feel
free
to
disagree
:
)
My
viewpoint
might
be
slightly
extreme
in
believing
he
is
a
top
5
player
but
I
also
believe
that
Paul
is
extremely
underrated
on
this
sub
due
to
the
overwhelming
dislike
towards
him
.
I
understand
the
dislike
(
although
I
do
nt
share
it
)
but
I
do
nt
think
it
should
affect
our
judgement
of
him
as
a
player
.

I
think
you
make
valid
points
,
however
I
do
disagree
.

.
the
jury
management
was
blatantly
bad
.
He
was
shit
talking
Natalie
for
no
reason
after
she
promised
him
her
vote
,
then
he
played
a
2nd
time
and
he
did
absolutely
no
better
,
constantly
shit
talking
everyone
.
Yes
he
got
4
9
votes
each
time
,
but
the
mistakes
were
so
glaringly
obvious
and
,
especially
after
losing
BB18
he
should
've
corrected
them
.

.
Vanessa
was
one
comp
away
from
winning
bb17
,
a
season
which
she
dominated
far
more
on
her
rookie
season
than
Paul
dominated
bb18
during
his
rookie
season
.
</p>

.
Paul
played
the
most
dominant
game
ever
on
BB19
,
but
it
was
against
the
worst
cast
ever
.
Against
that
cast
,
I
think
there
are
a
ton
of
players
including
Vanessa
who
could
've
crushed
it
and
won
,
which
Paul
was
unable
to
do
.
