In
second
grade
I
had
a
teacher
that
was
pretty
bad
.
Among
a
bunch
of
problems
she
had
this
rule
that
if
you
wanted
to
use
the
bathroom
outside
of
recess
or
lunch
break
you
’d
be
given
a
sheet
of
math
problems
as
homework
.
I
get
why
she
did
it
but
7yr
olds
are
not
great
at
timing
pee
breaks
.
Being
the
super
quiet
new
kid
with
English
as
a
second
language
I
never
wanted
to
interrupt
the
teacher
.
And
being
given
homework
because
of
using
the
bathroom
seemed
like
punishment
.
So
of
course
I
went
home
with
stomach
cramps
from
holding
it
in
too
long
.
When
my
mom
found
out
about
this
,
she
flipped
out
,
and
this
is
where
the
malicious
compliance
came
in
.
I
was
told
to
ask
for
the
homework
every
morning
,
that
way
I
could
use
the
bathroom
all
I
liked
.
So
I
started
asking
for
the
work
in
the
morning
,
doing
it
during
recess
,
and
turning
it
in
by
the
end
of
the
day
.
Problem
solved
.
Except
all
the
kids
figured
it
out
,
and
soon
were
doing
the
same
thing
,
we
even
helped
each
other
with
the
problems
during
recess
.
By
2
weeks
the
system
was
useless
and
she
stopped
using
it
all
together
.
My
mother
and
her
had
a
huge
fight
because
I
broke
her
system
.
A
month
or
two
later
I
was
moved
to
a
private
school
,
where
I
did
really
well
in
math
thanks
to
those
sheets
.
TL
;
DR
You
wanna
give
me
homework
for
using
the
bathroom
?
Fine
I
’ll
ask
for
the
homework
,
and
do
it
in
class
just
in
case
I
want
to
use
the
bathroom
later
.
Edit
:
Wow
!
I
did
n’t
know
withholding
bathroom
breaks
was
so
common
.
I
really
hope
this
is
n’t
done
anymore
.

Why
does
this
happen
LOL
.
I
once
had
a
librarian
who
only
allowed
kindergarten
’s
use
the
restroom
,
if
you
did
n’t
have
proof
of
an
emergency
you
were
n’t
allowed
to
go
.
</p>
<p>
I
was
like
10
when
this
happened
,
but
I
could
n’t
hold
it
long
enough
to
wait
for
a
class
bathroom
break
,
which
was
like
once
a
day
.
I
was
literally
crossing
my
legs
trying
not
to
pee
myself
when
I
asked
the
librarian
if
I
could
go
,
she
said
no
,
told
me
the
rule
and
said
if
asked
again
I
would
get
in
trouble
,
so
I
pissed
in
front
of
her
and
said
“
oh
well
,
I
just
went
anyways
.
