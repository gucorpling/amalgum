Introduction

<p>
Navigation
is
a
process
by
which
a
moving
platform
determines
its
state
of
motion
through
what
is
termed
as
the
navigation
states
.
The
navigation
states
for
any
given
platform
are
the
position
,
velocity
,
and
attitude
of
such
a
platform
.
The
navigation
states
should
be
able
to
characterize
the
motion
of
any
given
body
in
either
a
two-dimensional
(
2D
)
or
three-dimensional
(
3D
)
space
.
</p>
<p>
Navigation
is
performed
through
various
methods
;
such
methods
are
characterized
mainly
into
two
clusters
:
position
fixing
and
dead
reckoning
.
Position
fixing
is
the
process
by
which
the
navigation
states
are
driven
through
the
knowledge
and
use
of
a
set
of
fixated
well-defined
positions
.
An
example
of
position
fixing
navigation
is
the
global
navigation
satellite
system
(
GNSS
)
.
Whereas
,
dead
reckoning
is
a
process
by
which
the
navigation
states
are
determined
through
a
recursive
process
of
relative
positioning
with
respect
to
the
initial
states
.
An
example
of
dead
reckoning
navigation
is
the
inertial
navigation
system
(
INS
)
.
</p>
<p>
Inertial
navigation
is
performed
by
processing
the
data
of
inertial
measurement
units
(
IMUs
)
.
IMUs
are
an
assembly
of
sensors
that
are
mounted
in
a
geometric
form
that
guarantees
capturing
the
motion
of
any
given
platform
.
Such
sensors
measure
what
is
referred
to
as
inertial
measurements
and
they
include
accelerometers
,
which
measure
specific
forces
(
i.
e.
,
linear
accelerations
)
,
and
gyroscopes
,
which
measure
angular
rates
.
The
inertial
measurements
undergo
a
mathematical
process
,
known
as
INS
mechanization
,
that
mainly
includes
integrations
and
geometric
transformations
to
determine
the
navigation
states
of
the
moving
platform
with
respect
to
a
pre-defined
reference
frame
.
A
typical
IMU
constitutes
a
triad
of
accelerometers
and
a
triad
of
gyroscopes
,
placed
along
three
mutually
orthogonal
axes
.
</p>
<p>
Inertial
sensors
endure
systematic
errors
which
can
be
calibrated
in
the
laboratory
and
eliminated
from
the
raw
inertial
measurements
.
Such
systematic
errors
include
biases
,
scale
factor
,
scale
factor
non-linearity
,
and
cross-coupling
.
The
bias
is
a
constant
error
,
whereby
the
inertial
sensor
reads
out
a
measurement
that
is
at
a
constant
offset
from
the
actual
value
.
The
scale
factor
is
an
error
that
is
demonstrated
by
the
existence
of
a
gradient
for
the
input
â€“
output
relation
of
the
inertial
sensor
which
is
not
unity
.
However
,
if
such
a
gradient
is
non-linear
,
then
it
is
said
that
the
inertial
sensor
suffers
from
scale
factor
non-linearity
.
Cross-coupling
error
indicates
that
a
given
inertial
sensor
(
i.
e.
,
accelerometer
or
gyroscope
)
measures
residual
inertial
measurements
from
an
axis
that
is
orthogonal
to
its
sensitive
axes
.
Typically
,
cross-coupling
occurs
due
to
the
non-orthogonality
of
the
sensitive
axis
of
the
inertial
sensors
.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore
,
inertial
sensors
suffer
from
random
errors
that
appear
as
noises
within
the
inertial
measurements
from
electrical
and
mechanical
sources
.
The
noises
are
assumed
to
be
white
for
frequencies
below
1
Hz
.
The
order
of
magnitude
of
such
noises
depends
on
the
technology
behind
the
manufacturing
of
the
inertial
sensor
.
</p>
<p>
Nonetheless
,
the
performance
of
any
given
IMU
is
defined
by
the
order
of
magnitude
of
the
systematic
and
random
errors
.
Whereby
,
IMUs
are
classified
according
their
performance
and
accuracy
into
various
categories
.
</p>
<p>
Consequently
,
IMUs
are
classified
into
strategic
grade
,
navigation
grade
,
tactical
grade
,
automotive
grade
,
and
low-cost
consumer
grade
IMUs
.
Strategic
grade
,
also
referred
to
as
marine
grade
,
is
the
highest
quality
IMUs
.
Strategic
grade
IMUs
can
be
used
in
military
ships
,
submarines
,
some
intercontinental
ballistic
missiles
,
and
some
spacecraft
.
A
strategic
grade
IMU
might
cost
more
than
$
1
million
.
Navigation
grade
IMUs
are
used
in
military
aircrafts
and
commercial
aviation
.
Navigation
grade
IMUs
cost
around
$
100,000
.
Tactical
grade
IMUs
can
only
be
used
for
stand-alone
inertial
navigation
for
a
few
minutes
.
However
,
an
accurate
navigation
solution
can
be
obtained
by
integration
of
the
tactical
grade
IMU
with
an
aiding
positioning
system
.
Typically
,
tactical
grade
IMUs
are
used
in
guided
weapons
and
unmanned
air
vehicles
(
UAVs
)
.
Tactical
grade
IMUs
cost
around
$
2000
to
$
50,000
.
The
automotive
and
consumer
grade
IMUs
are
the
lowest
grade
of
inertial
sensors
.
They
are
typically
used
in
pedometers
,
antilock
braking
,
active
suspension
,
and
airbags
.
Consumer
grade
accelerometers
costs
start
around
$
1
,
and
the
gyroscopes
costs
start
around
$
10
.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless
,
IMU
grades
are
analogous
to
the
technologies
adopted
to
manufacture
their
inertial
sensors
(
i.
e.
,
accelerometers
and
gyroscopes
)
.
Typical
commercialized
gyroscopes
are
classified
into
optical
gyroscopes
or
vibratory
gyroscopes
.
Optical
gyroscopes
utilize
the
phase
of
light
waves
to
determine
angular
rates
.
The
optical
gyroscopes
are
realized
by
either
ring
laser
gyroscope
(
RLG
)
technology
or
interferometric
fiber-optic
gyro
(
IFOG
)
technology
.
Vibratory
gyroscopes
are
low-cost
,
and
often
depend
on
Micro-electro-mechanical
system
(
MEMS
)
technology
,
in
which
quartz-based
gyros
provide
better
performance
than
silicon-based
gyros
.
There
are
other
types
of
gyroscopes
,
which
include
nuclear
magnetic
resonance
gyroscope
technology
,
and
cold-atom
interferometry
.
Both
technologies
provide
relatively
higher
performance
at
a
higher
cost
.
