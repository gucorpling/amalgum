question
comes
across
as
very
powerful
.
As
human
beings
,
we
often
wonder
if
anyone
is
interested
in
knowing
who
we
truly
are
.
With
the
stereotypes
we
have
,
so
many
get
lost
in
this
image
.
Those
4
words
are
the
most
amazing
words
you
can
say
to
someone
.
It
shows
how
much
you
care
.
These
“
life
stories
”
are
extremely
powerful
gifts
and
tools
.
They
show
how
everything
fits
together
in
life
to
create
this
bigger
picture
.
They
reveal
what
truly
matters
.
They
can
give
comfort
and
support
.
Looking
back
on
the
lives
we
have
,
with
every
detail
of
our
life
,
feelings
,
and
beliefs
,
and
everything
that
ever
happened
to
us
,
it
’s
all
so
beautiful
.
Just
combining
those
things
together
to
make
a
person
shows
us
how
empowered
we
can
become
.
We
can
learn
so
much
from
each
other
.
We
can
learn
love
,
acceptance
,
and
peace
when
we
are
at
peace
with
ourselves
and
everyone
around
us
.

your
part
