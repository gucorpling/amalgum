Known
as
&quot;
American
's
Hometown
,
&quot;
Plymouth
is
most
famous
for
being
the
final
landing
place
of
the
Pilgrims
who
arrived
on
board
the
Mayflower
in
1620
.
The
settlement
they
established
,
Plimouth
Colony
,
was
one
of
the
earliest
successful
settlements
of
Europeans
in
North
America
.
In
addition
to
its
obvious
historical
draws
,
modern-day
Plymouth
is
a
picturesque
seaside
town
with
a
bustling
summer
resident
population
who
come
back
year
after
year
to
enjoy
its
beaches
,
ponds
,
and
forests
.
Although
summer
is
Plymouth
's
peak
tourist
season
,
spring
(
before
Memorial
Day
)
and
fall
(
after
Labor
Day
)
can
be
excellent
times
to
visit
.
These
bumper
seasons
are
less
crowded
and
certainly
more
comfortable
temperature-wise
.
Spring
has
mild
temperatures
and
flowers
in
bloom
,
and
fall
has
beautiful
New
England
foliage
,
warm
days
with
cool
nights
,
and
different
events
to
explore
,
such
as
observing
a
cranberry
harvest
.

In
area
,
Plymouth
is
the
largest
town
in
the
state
of
Massachusetts
,
covering
about
100
square
miles
(
259
km
Â²
)
.
Although
the
center
of
tourist
activity
is
in
Plymouth
's
historic
downtown
and
waterfront
areas
,
the
rest
of
the
town
is
divided
into
many
smaller
villages
such
as
Chiltonville
,
Manomet
,
Cedarville
,
North
Plymouth
,
and
West
Plymouth
.
Although
somewhat
homogeneous
on
the
surface
,
each
village
has
its
own
unique
characteristics
which
makes
it
worth
venturing
outside
the
harbor-side
to
visit
.
North
Plymouth
,
for
example
,
was
once
home
to
the
Cordage
Company
,
the
largest
rope-maker
in
the
world
.
Cordage
employed
many
Italian
and
Portuguese
immigrants
who
settled
in
company
housing
in
this
part
of
town
,
which
many
of
their
descendants
still
proudly
call
home
.
The
Holy
Ghost
Festa
,
a
major
holiday
for
Portuguese
of
Azorean
descent
,
is
still
widely
celebrated
in
North
Plymouth
each
summer
.
</p>
<p>
Plymouth
still
has
many
residents
who
can
trace
their
ancestry
to
the
original
Mayflower
passengers
and/or
Native
American
tribes
.
Plymouth
receives
many
visitors
who
are
interested
in
researching
their
own
colonial
ancestry
,
and
provides
several
key
resources
for
doing
so
.
The
<ref target="https://www.themayflowersociety.org/visit/gsmd-library">
<hi rend="bold">
General
Society
of
Mayflower
Descendants
Library
</hi>
</ref>
is
the
recognized
authority
on
Pilgrim
ancestry
and
has
plenty
of
resources
to
assist
you
.
<ref target="http://www.plymouthpubliclibrary.org/historygenealogy/">
<hi rend="bold">
Plymouth
Public
Library
</hi>
</ref>
also
maintains
a
large
room
dedicated
to
genealogy
.
</p>
<p>
It
should
go
without
saying
that
Plymouth
residents
feel
<hi rend="bold">
Thanksgiving
Day
</hi>
belongs
to
them
;
after
all
,
the
holiday
commemorates
a
feast
shared
by
the
surviving
Mayflower
passengers
and
local
Native
Americans
following
the
Pilgrims
'
first
harvest
in
1621
.
That
said
,
Thanksgiving
in
Plymouth
is
n't
celebrated
that
much
differently
than
in
most
places
;
local
activities
include
a
morning
parade
through
town
and
a
local
high
school
football
game
between
cross-town
rivals
Plymouth
North
and
Plymouth
South
.
For
tourists
,
Plimouth
Plantation
offers
a
Thanksgiving
Dinner
on
location
at
their
site
with
the
opportunity
to
learn
more
about
the
facts
and
fictions
surrounding
the
historical
event
.
Since
1970
,
the
United
American
Indians
of
New
England
(
UAINE
)
have
observed
the
<ref target="http://www.uaine.org/">
<hi rend="bold">
National
Day
of
Mourning
</hi>
</ref>
on
Thanksgiving
Day
.
Observance
takes
place
annually
at
noon
on
Cole
's
Hill
,
acknowledging
European
settlement
as
the
beginning
of
the
genocide
and
forcible
relocation
of
millions
of
Native
Americans
.
</p>
<p>
As
a
final
note
,
&quot;
Plimoth
&quot;
,
the
old
English
spelling
,
is
sometimes
used
to
denote
a
historic
site
(
e.
g.
Plimoth
Plantation
)
,
while
town
sites
will
be
spelled
with
the
modern
spelling
,
&quot;
Plymouth
&quot;
(
e.
g.
Plymouth
Town
Hall
)
.
Keep
this
in
mind
to
avoid
confusion
if
you
notice
signage
such
as
the
exit
maker
on
Route
3
that
helpfully
reads
,
&quot;
Plymouth
/
Plimoth
Plantation

The
historic
section
of
Downtown
Plymouth
is
accessed
via
Exit

.
Metered
parking
is
available
downtown
at
both
public
lots
and
on
street
.
The
lots
often
have
ticketing
machines
while
street

have

All
parking
fills
up
quickly
during

tourist

during

such

From
Boston
and
points
north
</hi>
:
Plymouth
is
about
an
hour
south
of
Boston
,
Massachusetts
via
Interstate
93
South
to
Route
3
South
.
Traffic
is
notorious
during
weekday
rush
hours
,
especially
in
the
summer
months
where
Route
3
is
congested
with
vacationers
heading
south
past
Plymouth
towards
Cape
Cod
.
Travel
in
off-peak
hours
is
strongly
advised
for
an
enjoyable
and
timely
trip
.
Route
3A
,
a
two-lane
back
road
which
runs
parallel
to
Route
3
from
Boston
down
through
the
<ref target="South_Shore_%28Massachusetts%29">
South
Shore
</ref>
and
directly
through
Plymouth
,
was
the
original
road
from
Plymouth
to
Boston
prior
to
the
national
highway
system
being
built
in
the
1950s
.
Although
quite
scenic
,
it
is
a
lengthy
drive
and
not
typically
worth
traveling
the
entire
route
