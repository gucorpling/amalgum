PROLOGUE
</head>
<p>
On
June
16
,
1716
,
Alexander
Spotswood
,
Governor
of
the
Colony
of
Virginia
,
and
a
gallant
soldier
who
had
served
under
Marlborough
in
the
English
wars
,
rode
,
at
the
head
of
a
dauntless
band
of
cavaliers
,
down
the
quiet
street
of
quaint
old
Williamsburg
.
</p>
<p>
The
adventurous
spirits
of
this
party
of
men
urged
them
toward
the
land
of
the
setting
sun
,
that
unknown
west
far
beyond
the
blue
crested
mountains
rising
so
grandly
before
them
.
</p>
<p>
Months
afterward
they
stood
on
the
western
range
of
the
Great
North
mountains
towering
above
the
picturesque
Shenandoah
Valley
,
and
from
the
summit
of
one
of
the
loftiest
peaks
,
where
,
until
then
,
the
foot
of
a
white
man
had
never
trod
,
they
viewed
the
vast
expanse
of
plain
and
forest
with
glistening
eyes
.
Returning
to
Williamsburg
they
told
of
the
wonderful
richness
of
the
newly
discovered
country
and
thus
opened
the
way
for
the
venturesome
pioneer
who
was
destined
to
overcome
all
difficulties
and
make
a
home
in
the
western
world
.
</p>
<p>
But
fifty
years
and
more
passed
before
a
white
man
penetrated
far
beyond
the
purple
spires
of
those
majestic
mountains
.
</p>
<p>
One
bright
morning
in
June
,
1769
,
the
figure
of
a
stalwart
,
broad
shouldered
man
could
have
been
seen
standing
on
the
wild
and
rugged
promontory
which
rears
its
rocky
bluff
high
above
the
Ohio
river
,
at
a
point
near
the
mouth
of
Wheeling
Creek
.
He
was
alone
save
for
the
companionship
of
a
deerhound
that
crouched
at
his
feet
.
As
he
leaned
on
a
long
rifle
,
contemplating
the
glorious
scene
that
stretched
before
him
,
a
smile
flashed
across
his
bronzed
cheek
,
and
his
heart
bounded
as
he
forecast
the
future
of
that
spot
.
In
the
river
below
him
lay
an
island
so
round
and
green
that
it
resembled
a
huge
lily
pad
floating
placidly
on
the
water
.
The
fresh
green
foliage
of
the
trees
sparkled
with
glittering
dewdrops
.
Back
of
him
rose
the
high
ridges
,
and
,
in
front
,
as
far
as
eye
could
reach
,
extended
an
unbroken
forest
.
</p>
<p>
Beneath
him
to
the
left
and
across
a
deep
ravine
he
saw
a
wide
level
clearing
.
The
few
scattered
and
blackened
tree
stumps
showed
the
ravages
made
by
a
forest
fire
in
the
years
gone
by
.
The
field
was
now
overgrown
with
hazel
and
laurel
bushes
,
and
intermingling
with
them
were
the
trailing
arbutus
,
the
honeysuckle
,
and
the
wild
rose
.
A
fragrant
perfume
was
wafted
upward
to
him
.
A
rushing
creek
bordered
one
edge
of
the
clearing
.
After
a
long
quiet
reach
of
water
,
which
could
be
seen
winding
back
in
the
hills
,
the
stream
tumbled
madly
over
a
rocky
ledge
,
and
white
with
foam
,
it
hurried
onward
as
if
impatient
of
long
restraint
,
and
lost
its
individuality
in
the
broad
Ohio
.
</p>
<p>
This
solitary
hunter
was
Colonel
Ebenezer
Zane
.
He
was
one
of
those
daring
men
,
who
,
as
the
tide
of
emigration
started
westward
,
had
left
his
friends
and
family
and
had
struck
out
alone
into
the
wilderness
.
Departing
from
his
home
in
Eastern
Virginia
he
had
plunged
into
the
woods
,
and
after
many
days
of
hunting
and
exploring
,
he
reached
the
then
far
Western
Ohio
valley
.
</p>
<p>
The
scene
so
impressed
Colonel
Zane
that
he
concluded
to
found
a
settlement
there
.
Taking
&quot;
tomahawk
possession
&quot;
of
the
locality
(
which
consisted
of
blazing
a
few
trees
with
his
tomahawk
)
,
he
built
himself
a
rude
shack
and
remained
that
summer
on
the
Ohio
.
</p>
<p>
In
the
autumn
he
set
out
for
Berkeley
County
,
Virginia
,
to
tell
his
people
of
the
magnificent
country
he
had
discovered
.
The
following
spring
he
persuaded
a
number
of
settlers
,
of
a
like
spirit
with
himself
,
to
accompany
him
to
the
wilderness
.
Believing
it
unsafe
to
take
their
families
with
them
at
once
,
they
left
them
at
Red
Stone
on
the
Monongahela
river
,
while
the
men
,
including
Colonel
Zane
,
his
brothers
Silas
,
Andrew
,
Jonathan
and
Isaac
,
the
Wetzels
,
McCollochs
,
Bennets
,
Metzars
and
others
,
pushed
on
ahead
.
</p>
<p>
The
country
through
which
they
passed
was
one
tangled
,
most
impenetrable
forest
;
the
axe
of
the
pioneer
had
never
sounded
in
this
region
,
where
every
rod
of
the
way
might
harbor
some
unknown
danger
.
</p>
<p>
These
reckless
bordermen
knew
not
the
meaning
of
fear
;
to
all
,
daring
adventure
was
welcome
,
and
the
screech
of
a
redskin
and
the
ping
of
a
bullet
were
familiar
sounds
;
to
the
Wetzels
,
McCollochs
and
Jonathan
Zane
the
hunting
of
Indians
was
the
most
thrilling
passion
of
their
lives
;
indeed
,
the
Wetzels
,
particularly
,
knew
no
other
occupation
.
They
had
attained
a
wonderful
skill
with
the
rifle
;
long
practice
had
rendered
their
senses
as
acute
as
those
of
the
fox
.
Skilled
in
every
variety
of
woodcraft
,
with
lynx
eyes
ever
on
the
alert
for
detecting
a
trail
,
or
the
curling
smoke
of
some
camp
fire
,
or
the
minutest
sign
of
an
enemy
,
these
men
stole
onward
through
the
forest
with
the
cautious
but
dogged
and
persistent
determination
that
was
characteristic
of
the
settler
.
</p>
<p>
They
at
length
climbed
the
commanding
bluff
overlooking
the
majestic
river
,
and
as
they
gazed
out
on
the
undulating
and
uninterrupted
area
of
green
,
their
hearts
beat
high
with
hope
.
</p>
<p>
The
keen
axe
,
wielded
by
strong
arms
,
soon
opened
the
clearing
and
reared
stout
log
cabins
on
the
river
bluff
.
Then
Ebenezer
Zane
and
his
followers
moved
their
families
and
soon
the
settlement
began
to
grow
and
flourish
.
As
the
little
village
commenced
to
prosper
the
redmen
became
troublesome
.
Settlers
were
shot
while
plowing
the
fields
or
gathering
the
harvests
.
Bands
of
hostile
Indians
prowled
around
and
made
it
dangerous
for
anyone
to
leave
the
clearing
.
Frequently
the
first
person
to
appear
in
the
early
morning
would
be
shot
at
by
an
Indian
concealed
in
the
woods
.
