A
STORY
REMODELED
</head>
<p>
The
pretended
Halloween
was
a
great
success
.
So
very
excited
,
indeed
,
did
David
become
over
the
swinging
apples
and
popping
nuts
that
he
quite
forgot
to
tell
Mr.
Jack
what
the
Lady
of
the
Roses
had
said
until
Jill
had
gone
up
to
bed
and
he
himself
was
about
to
take
from
Mr.
Jack
's
hand
the
little
lighted
lamp
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Oh
,
Mr.
Jack
,
I
forgot
,
&quot;
he
cried
then
.
&quot;
There
was
something
I
was
going
to
tell
you
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Never
mind
to-night
,
David
;
it
's
so
late
.
Suppose
we
leave
it
until
to-morrow
,
&quot;
suggested
Mr.
Jack
,
still
with
the
lamp
extended
in
his
hand
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
But
I
promised
the
Lady
of
the
Roses
that
I
'd
say
it
to-night
,
&quot;
demurred
the
boy
,
in
a
troubled
voice
.
</p>
<p>
The
man
drew
his
lamp
halfway
back
suddenly
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
The
Lady
of
the
Roses
!
Do
you
mean
--
she
sent
a
message
--
to
ME
?
&quot;
he
demanded
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Yes
;
about
the
story
,
'
The
Princess
and
the
Pauper
,
'
you
know
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
With
an
abrupt
exclamation
Mr.
Jack
set
the
lamp
on
the
table
and
turned
to
a
chair
.
He
had
apparently
lost
his
haste
to
go
to
bed
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
See
here
,
David
,
suppose
you
come
and
sit
down
,
and
tell
me
just
what
you
're
talking
about
.
And
first
--
just
what
does
the
Lady
of
the
Roses
know
about
that
--
that
'
Princess
and
the
Pauper
'
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Why
,
she
knows
it
all
,
of
course
,
&quot;
returned
the
boy
in
surprise
.
&quot;
I
told
it
to
her
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
You
--
told
--
it
--
to
her
!
&quot;
Mr.
Jack
relaxed
in
his
chair
.
&quot;
David
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Yes
.
And
she
was
just
as
interested
as
could
be
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
do
n't
doubt
it
!
&quot;
Mr.
Jack
's
lips
snapped
together
a
little
grimly
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Only
she
did
n't
like
the
ending
,
either
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Mr.
Jack
sat
up
suddenly
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
She
did
n't
like
--
David
,
are
you
sure
?
Did
she
SAY
that
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
David
frowned
in
thought
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Well
,
I
do
n't
know
as
I
can
tell
,
exactly
,
but
I
'm
sure
she
did
n't
like
it
,
because
just
before
she
told
me
WHAT
to
say
to
you
,
she
said
that
--
that
what
she
was
going
to
say
would
probably
have
something
to
do
with
the
ending
,
anyway
.
Still
--
&quot;
David
paused
in
yet
deeper
thought
.
&quot;
Come
to
think
of
it
,
there
really
is
n't
anything
--
not
in
what
she
said
--
that
CHANGED
that
ending
,
as
I
can
see
.
They
did
n't
get
married
and
live
happy
ever
after
,
anyhow
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Yes
,
but
what
did
she
say
?
&quot;
asked
Mr.
Jack
in
a
voice
that
was
not
quite
steady
.
&quot;
Now
,
be
careful
,
David
,
and
tell
it
just
as
she
said
it
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Oh
,
I
will
,
&quot;
nodded
David
.
&quot;
SHE
said
to
do
that
,
too
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Did
she
?
&quot;
Mr.
Jack
leaned
farther
forward
in
his
chair
.
&quot;
But
tell
me
,
how
did
she
happen
to
--
to
say
anything
about
it
?
Suppose
you
begin
at
the
beginning
--
away
back
,
David
.
I
want
to
hear
it
all
--
all
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
David
gave
a
contented
sigh
,
and
settled
himself
more
comfortably
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Well
,
to
begin
with
,
you
see
,
I
told
her
the
story
long
ago
,
before
I
was
sick
,
and
she
was
ever
so
interested
then
,
and
asked
lots
of
questions
.
Then
the
other
day
something
came
up
--
I
've
forgotten
how
--
about
the
ending
,
and
I
told
her
how
hard
I
'd
tried
to
have
you
change
it
,
but
you
would
n't
.
And
she
spoke
right
up
quick
and
said
probably
you
did
n't
want
to
change
it
,
anyhow
.
But
of
course
I
settled
THAT
question
without
any
trouble
,
&quot;
went
on
David
confidently
,
&quot;
by
just
telling
her
how
you
said
you
'd
give
anything
in
the
world
to
change
it
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
And
you
told
her
that
--
just
that
,
David
?
&quot;
cried
the
man
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Why
,
yes
,
I
had
to
,
&quot;
answered
David
,
in
surprise
,
&quot;
else
she
would
n't
have
known
that
you
DID
want
to
change
it
.
Do
n't
you
see
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Oh
,
yes
!
I
--
see
--
a
good
deal
that
I
'm
thinking
you
do
n't
,
&quot;
muttered
Mr.
Jack
,
falling
back
in
his
chair
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Well
,
then
is
when
I
told
her
about
the
logical
ending
--
what
you
said
,
you
know
,
--
oh
,
yes
!
and
that
was
when
I
found
out
she
did
n't
like
the
ending
,
because
she
laughed
such
a
funny
little
laugh
and
colored
up
,
and
said
that
she
was
n't
sure
she
could
tell
me
what
a
logical
ending
was
,
but
that
she
would
try
to
find
out
,
and
that
,
anyhow
,
YOUR
ending
would
n't
be
hers
--
she
was
sure
of
that
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
David
,
did
she
say
that
--
really
?
&quot;
Mr.
Jack
was
on
his
feet
now
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
She
did
;
and
then
yesterday
she
asked
me
to
come
over
,
and
she
said
some
more
things
,
--
about
the
story
,
I
mean
,
--
but
she
did
n't
say
another
thing
about
the
ending
.
She
did
n't
ever
say
anything
about
that
except
that
little
bit
I
told
you
of
a
minute
ago
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Yes
,
yes
,
but
what
did
she
say
?
&quot;
demanded
Mr.
Jack
,
stopping
short
in
his
walk
up
and
down
the
room
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
She
said
:
'
You
tell
Mr.
Jack
that
I
know
something
about
that
story
of
his
that
perhaps
he
does
n't
.
In
the
first
place
,
I
know
the
Princess
a
lot
better
than
he
does
,
and
she
is
n't
a
bit
the
kind
of
girl
he
's
pictured
her
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Yes
!
Go
on
--
go
on
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
'
Now
,
for
instance
,
'
she
says
,
'
when
the
boy
made
that
call
,
after
the
girl
first
came
back
,
and
when
the
boy
did
n't
like
it
because
they
talked
of
colleges
and
travels
,
and
such
things
,
you
tell
him
that
I
happen
to
know
that
that
girl
was
just
hoping
and
hoping
he
'd
speak
of
the
old
days
and
games
;
but
that
she
could
n't
speak
,
of
course
,
when
he
had
n't
been
even
once
to
see
her
during
all
those
weeks
,
and
when
he
'd
acted
in
every
way
just
as
if
he
'd
forgotten
.
