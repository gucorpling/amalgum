TIFU
by
accidentally
hooking
up
my
buddies
potential
girlfriend
with
a
new
guy
</head>
<sp who="#Fennemore_Branch">
<p>
This
happened
last
night
.
I
'm
out
of
town
visiting
a
good
friend
of
mine
for
the
weekend
.
I
'll
call
him
W.
Yesterday
afternoon
he
asked
if
it
was
okay
if
a
girl
he
met
on
Tinder
and
has
been
hanging
out
with
can
join
us
.
I
'll
call
her
B.
I
said
sure
,
the
more
the
merrier
.
They
have
hung
out
a
few
times
as
friends
and
W
has
told
me
that
he
really
wants
to
start
a
relationship
with
B.
We
hung
out
in
the
pool
at
W
's
apartment
complex
for
a
few
hours
,
went
back
to
his
apartment
,
ate
dinner
,
played
games
and
drank
beers
.
A
few
hours
later
,
the
topic
of
Tinder
comes
up
and
me
an
W
start
talking
about
how
hard
it
is
for
guys
on
there
and
how
he
got
lucky
snagging
somebody
as
awesome
and
cool
as
B.
Both
B
and
W
seem
to
be
getting
along
well
,
they
are
flirting
with
each
other
and
cuddling
on
the
couch
together
.
B
starts
showing
us
the
countless
stupid
messages
she
gets
from
guys
she
matches
on
a
daily
basis
.
All
three
of
us
decide
it
would
be
hilarious
to
troll
some
of
these
guys
so
B
gives
me
her
phone
and
we
(
mostly
me
)
start
coming
up
with
stupid
things
to
send
these
guys
and
just
sitting
on
the
couch
laughing
out
butts
off
about
it
.
Some
get
pissed
off
and
unmatch
,
others
keep
talking
.
This
one
guy
,
I
'll
call
him
T
,
asks
for
her
number
and
we
send
him
W
's
number
.
He
calls
and
I
start
impersonating
David
Letterman
and
pretending
like
T
is
my
guest
on
the
show
.
W
and
B
are
rolling
on
the
floor
laughing
.
About
an
hour
later
,
the
conversation
starts
to
get
a
little
more
serious
and
T
asks
B
if
they
could
talk
just
the
two
of
them
.
B
calls
him
on
her
phone
,
stops
cuddling
with
W
,
moves
to
the
other
couch
in
the
room
and
turns
the
phone
off
speaker
.
We
all
just
sat
there
for
another
hour
while
they
talked
about
each
other
.
Finally
I
decide
to
go
to
bed
on
the
couch
like
I
'm
supposed
to
,
so
B
goes
outside
to
talk
to
T.
Me
and
W
start
talking
about
what
the
hell
just
happened
and
I
can
tell
he
's
upset
.
He
starts
telling
me
how
he
's
tired
of
playing
games
with
people
and
how
every
time
he
starts
hanging
out
with
a
girl
and
it
seems
promosing
,
something
happens
and
he
never
sees
them
again
.
I
feel
like
a
complete
low-life
since
I
was
mostly
responsible
and
we
finally
went
to
sleep
after
talking
for
a
while
.
Two
hours
later
,
B
comes
back
in
,
and
crashes
on
the
couch
.
Both
B
and
W
are
still
sleeping
so
I
'm
out
walking
around
town
,
still
feeling
like
an
asshole
,
to
clear
my
head
and
make
sense
of
what
happend
.
TL
;
DR
.
Hung
out
with
a
buddy
and
his
potential
girlfriend
,
start
trolling
guys
on
Tinder
,
she
matches
with
one
and
starts
talking
to
him
,
leading
to
an
almost
all
night
phone
call
and
my
buddy
feeling
like
crap
.
Now
I
feel
like
a
low-life
for
accidently
cock-blocking
my
best
friend
</p>

<sp who="#Alcwathwen">

How
did
your
friend
ask
her
to
join
?
She
might
have
thought
it
was
a
date
and
then
felt
friendzoned
.
Younger
me
would
not
have
a
clue
what
was
happening
if
a
guy
I
liked
asked
me
to
hang
out
and
it
ended
up
a
chill
session
with
his
buddy
without
him
making
that
clear
to
me
.
I
might
feel
annoyed
but
worried
to
be
confrontational
,
because
who
knows
.
I
just
know
you
from
Tinder.
.
and
indeed
prefer
to
lick
my
wounds
and
hang
with
someone
else
I
might
click
with
a
bit
.
Especially
since
my
date
has
been
downgraded
to
a
hang
out
.
If
she
knew
beforehand
,
then
yeah
,
she
's
definitely
rude
.
And
older
me
would
communicate
much
better
.
Oh
well
.
