Ride-hailing
as
an
Emerging
Mode
of
Transportation
</head>
<p>
Ride-hailing
is
a
transportation
service
that
allows
passengers
to
request
a
ride
in
a
real-time
via
smartphone
applications
that
link
passengers
to
nearby
drivers
.
Once
a
driver
accepts
the
request
,
the
passenger
can
evaluate
the
waiting
time
and
decide
whether
to
accept
the
ride
.
Both
the
passenger
and
the
driver
can
use
Global
Position
System
(
GPS
)
navigation
during
the
trip
,
and
the
application
guides
the
driver
to
shortcuts
and
less-congested
roadways
.
Many
terms
are
used
to
describe
this
emerging
transportation
mode
,
including
ride-sourcing
,
ride-hailing
,
TNC
’s
,
e-hailing
,
and
app-based
on-demand
service
.
</p>
<p>
Literature
on
the
benefits
and
effectiveness
of
ride-hailing
services
is
mixed
.
Research
points
to
several
measurable
advantages
of
the
services
,
such
as
low
waiting
times
and
reduced
commute-related
stress
,
cost-effectiveness
over
other
modes
and
congestion
mitigation
particularly
for
the
shared-ride
options
.
On
the
other
hand
,
the
advanced
technology
of
e-hailing
does
not
guarantee
success
.
This
is
often
due
to
key
challenges
,
such
as
determining
an
appropriate
local
strategy
for
an
e-hailing
platform
,
and
also
frequent
cancellations
by
passengers
.
According
to
a
study
by
Jin
et
al.
,
ride-hailing
impacts
the
efficiency
,
equity
,
and
sustainability
of
cities
.
While
ride-hailing
offers
economic
efficiency
in
many
cases
,
there
have
been
issues
reported
related
to
discrimination
and
security
among
riders
and
drivers
.
Also
,
the
environmental
impacts
of
ride-hailing
remain
to
be
substantively
documented
or
tracked
over
time
.

The
Comparison
of
Ride-hailing
and
Traditional
Taxis
</head>
<p>
The
literature
points
to
several
potential
impacts
of
e-hailing
on
the
traditional
taxi
industry
.
Some
studies
have
compared
ride-hailing
and
yellow
taxis
side-by-side
,
and
investigated
the
ways
in
which
yellow
taxis
could
compete
with
ride-hailing
services
.
A
recent
study
in
Shenzhen
,
China
,
found
that
taxis
could
effectively
compete
with
ride-hailing
services
in
peak
periods
and
in
dense
areas
.
It
found
that
traditional
taxis
with
experienced
and
professional
drivers
tended
to
operate
more
efficiently
during
peak
hours
and
in
more
congested
locations
than
the
often-amateur
drivers
of
ride-hailing
services
,
many
of
whom
rely
heavily
on
GPS
rather
than
personal
knowledge
.
This
line
of
research
posits
that
the
emergence
of
ride-hailing
is
unlikely
to
eliminate
the
demand
for
traditional
taxis
,
and
both
services
are
ultimately
required
(
and
desired
)
in
large
metropolitan
areas
.
</p>
<p>
Another
line
of
research
compares
the
influences
of
determinant
factors
on
ride-hailing
versus
traditional
taxi
services
.
Studies
indicate
that
weather
conditions
may
affect
Uber
and
Lyft
ridership
more
than
yellow
taxi
ridership
,
likely
due
to
their
flexible
pricing
structure
.
According
to
a
study
conducted
in
New
York
City
,
the
number
of
Uber
and
Lyft
rides
per
hour
increases
dramatically
when
it
rains
.
Evidence
shows
that
ridership
for
yellow
taxis
is
less
likely
to
be
influenced
by
rain
.

Another
study
by
Rayle
et
al.
surveyed
380
ride-hailing
patrons
in
San
Francisco
,
and
compared
them
with
a
control
group
of
taxi
riders
in
the
same
city
.
Findings
confirmed
that
frequent
ride-hailing
users
were
mostly
younger
,
better
educated
,
and
more
car-dependent
than
the
control
group
of
frequent
taxi
riders
.
Moreover
,
time
efficiency
and
convenience
were
found
to
be
the
main
attractions
for
ride-hailing
services
.
Their
average
wait
time
was
reported
to
be
less
than
10
minutes
,
and
ride-hailing
trips
documented
in
the
study
were
generally
shorter
than
the
control
group
’s
taxi
trips
.
Finally
,
a
majority
of
the
ride-hailing
trips
requested
by
patrons
were
for
social
purposes
,
indicating
a
robust
pool
of
choice
riders
.
</p>
<p>
Other
studies
focused
on
determinants
of
traditional
taxi
demand
.
For
instance
,
Schaller
,
found
that
the
number
of
employees
using
subway
,
households
with
no
car
ownership
and
the
number
of
airport
taxi
trips
accounted
for
the
increasing
number
of
taxi
cabs
in
the
US
.
Another
study
,
linked
taxi
demand
with
land
use
attributes
,
socio-demographics
,
and
employment
factors
from
1972
’s
Traffic
Analysis
Zones
(
TAZs
)
in
Washington
DC
.
Results
confirm
that
land
use
measures
such
as
residential
density
,
employment
density
,
average
block
size
,
and
number
of
transit
stations
have
a
significant
and
positive
impact
on
ridership
demand
for
taxis
.
At
the
same
time
,
land
use
mix
negatively
correlates
with
the
number
of
taxi
pick-ups
in
each
TAZ
.
The
study
concludes
by
positing
that
the
demand
for
taxis
is
higher
in
zones
that
host
more
workplaces
than
residences
,
such
as
central
business
districts
(
CBD
’
s
)
.
Among
the
sociodemographic
factors
,
income
was
found
to
be
positively
related
to
taxi
demand
.
