Put
your
napkin
on
your
lap
,
right
away
.
Once
you
have
been
seated
by
the
host
,
the
first
and
foremost
thing
you
should
do
is
pick
up
your
napkin
and
without
flicking
it
violently
,
unfold
it
and
place
it
comfortably
on
your
lap
.
This
is
its
home
until
either
you
need
to
go
to
the
restroom
,
or
the
meal
has
finished
.

Wipe
your
mouth
with
care
.
During
the
meal
,
it
will
be
customary
that
you
will
need
to
wipe
your
mouth
at
certain
promptings
.
To
wipe
your
mouth
,
gently
dab
your
mouth
and
allow
the
napkin
to
soak
residue
from
the
area
.
It
is
also
vital
that
you
use
your
napkin
before
sipping
your
wine
or
other
beverage
,
so
you
do
nâ€™t
leave
any
greasy
mouth
excess
on
the
lip
of
the
glass
.

Do
not
use
it
as
a
handkerchief
.
At
no
stage
during
the
meal
should
you
use
your
napkin
like
a
tissue
as
a
means
to
blow
your
nose
.
Simply
excuse
yourself
from
the
table
if
you
need
to
,
and
visit
the
bathroom
instead
.

Be
careful
when
you
get
up
.
If
you
do
need
to
take
a
trip
to
the
restroom
during
the
meal
,
excuse
yourself
from
the
table
and
place
your
napkin
neatly
on
the
lap
of
your
seat
(
not
the
arm
or
the
top
)
until
you
return
.
Never
place
it
back
onto
the
table
during
the
meal
.

Wrap
up
at
the
end
of
the
meal
.
The
host
should
signal
that
you
have
reached
the
end
of
the
meal
by
placing
his
or
her
napkin
on
the
table
beside
the
plate
(
never
on
it
)
.
It
is
fine
for
you
to
mimic
this
gesture
and
at
the
same
time
thank
them
for
a
wonderful
meal
if
you
can
.
