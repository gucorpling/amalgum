Teotihuacan
</hi>
,
also
known
as
the
City
of
the
Gods
,
is
an
archeological
site
40
km
northeast
of
<ref target="Mexico%20City">
Mexico
City
</ref>
.
Náhuatl
for
&quot;
the
place
where
men
became
gods
&quot;
,
Teotihuacan
is
home
to
some
of
the
largest
ancient
pyramids
in
the
world
.
According
to
legend
,
it
was
here
where
the
gods
gathered
to
plan
the
creation
of
man
.
The
site
is
listed

Teotihuacan
was
the
largest
Pre-Columbian
city
in
the
Americas
,
reaching
a
total
population
of
150,000
at
its
height
.
The
name
is
also
used
to
refer
to
the
civilization
this
city
dominated
,
which
at
its
greatest
extent
included
most
of
Mesoamerica
.
</p>
<p>
Construction
of
Teotihuacán
commenced
around
300
BC
,
with
the
Pyramid
of
the
Sun
built
by
150
BC
.
Construction
continued
from
150
to
450
AD
.
</p>
<p>
By
the
time
the
Spaniards
arrived
,
this
place
was
not
used
as
a
settlement
anymore
,
but
served
as
a
spiritual
and
religious
destination
for
the
people
of
Tenochtitlan
.
</p>
<p>
A
lot
of
artifacts
have
wisely
been
moved
to
National
Anthropological
Museum

in

It
takes
about
45
minutes
from
the
Mexico
City
,
city
center
if
you
use
the
toll
highway
.
It
takes
much
longer
,
but
more
interesting
,
if
you
use
the
old
free
road
.
There
is
a
small
fee
for
parking
at
the
site
.
A
taxi
may
be
prohibitively
expensive
,
though
sometimes
tours
with
a
car
and
driver/guide
can
be
arranged
for
a
reasonable
fee
if
you
want
the
convenience
.

<p>
Buses
to
Teotihuacán
leave
from
Mexico
City
about
every
half
hour
from
two
locations
:
(
outside
Autobuses
del
Norte
Metro
station
,
Line
5
)
or
from
outside
the
(
Line
3
)
.
A
one-way
ticket
will
cost
50
pesos
(
April
2019
)
.
From
Terminal
Autobuses
del
Norte
,
walk
towards
Gate
8
.
There
is
a
ticket
booth
almost
at
the
end
of
the
concourse
.
Check
that
your
bus
goes
to
the
site
entrance
of
<hi rend="italic">
Teotihuacán
ruinas
</hi>
and
not
just
to
the
town
of
San
Juan
Teotihuacán
nearby
.
From
Potrero
,
exit
the
station
and
look
for
white
buses
that
go
to
<hi rend="italic">
Piramides
</hi>
–
they
mean
the
pyramids
of
Teotihuacán
.
The
trip
will
take
around
an
hour
,
and
the
buses
run
until
about
18:00
.
When
alighting
the
bus
,
check
the
last
departure
with
the
driver
.
You
will
be
dropped
off
and
picked
up
at
(
closest
to
the
Temple
of
Quetzalcóatl
)
.

Most
travel
agencies
offer
half
or
full
day
tours
to
the
site
,
often
combined
with
the
Plaza
de
las
Tres
Culturas
and
the
Basilica
of
Guadalupe
,
both
of
which
are
outside
the
city
center
.
It
’s
a
convenient
way
to
combine
the
three
,
but
note
our
comments
above
about
getting
to
the
site
early
.
The
price
is
around
700
pesos
for
an
adult
.
As
with
guided
tours
everywhere
in
the
world
,
these
tours
will
waste
much
of
your
time
by
promoting
gift
shops
,
but
they
are
still
a
convenient
way
to
get
here
for
Mexico
City-based
tourists
.

There
is
an
entrance
fee
of
M$
75
(
July
2017
)
to
enter
the
park
for
non-Mexican
visitors
.
This
is
a
large
site
,
a
lot
of
walking
is
required
as
there
are
few
other
ways
to
navigate
the
complex
,
unless
you
have
a
car
,
then
you
can
freely
drive
around
the
perimeter
(
if
you
are
staying
at
the
hotel
in
the
park
or
heading
to
one
of
the
many
restaurants
)
.
There
are
tractor-drawn
wagons
with
seats
and
shelter
that
run
on
a
schedule
known
only
to
them
.
If
you
go
by
bus
,
they
will
deliver
you
to
one
spot
,
from
which
you
will
be
required
to
walk
to
and
from
.
If
you
tire
easily
,
pack
light
for
this
excursion
(
i.
e.
,
no
backpacks
,
heavy
purses
,
etc.
)
</p>
<p>
There
are
plenty
of
<hi rend="italic">
friendly
</hi>
park
police
there
,
they
may
limit
your
driving
around
the
site
unless
you
are
staying
at
the
hotel
.
Taxi
drivers
are
not
allowed
to
drive
you
around
the
site
,
you
must
have
a
destination
,
like
a
restaurant
,
inside
of
the
park
.
If
you
are
adventurous
and
lucky
,
you
may
be
able
to
rent
a
bicycle
to
ride
around
the
perimeter
on
the
cobble
stone
road
(
a
bit
bouncy
)
.
If
you
are
visiting
the
site
and
do
not
have
an
opportunity
to
explore
the
perimeter
where
the
shops
,
restaurants
and
old
buildings
are
,
you
are
missing
out
.
Just
a
little
creativity
should
help
you
find
some
transportation
<hi rend="italic">
inside
</hi>
of
the
complex
.
The
locals
are
very
friendly
and
a
few
pesos
will
go
a
long
way
.
Try
to
at
least
find
a
<hi rend="italic">
ride
</hi>
around
the
perimeter
to
view
the
complex
.
It
will
be
worth
the
effort
.

This
site
has
many
small
pyramids
,
but
essentially
there
are
only
four
main
attractions
.
</p>
<list type="unordered">
<item>
<hi rend="bold">
Pirámide
del
Sol
</hi>
(
Pyramid
of
the
Sun
)
.
The
largest
pyramid
in
the
structure
with
an
excellent
view
of
the
surrounding
mountains
.
Wear
sunscreen
,
they
do
n't
call
it
the
Temple
of
the
Sun
for
nothing
.
</item>
<item>
<hi rend="bold">
Pirámide
de
la
Luna
</hi>
(
Pyramid
of
the
Moon
)
.
A
medium-sized
pyramid
off
from
the
center
of
the
complex
.
</item>
<item>
<hi rend="bold">
Templo
de
Quetzalcoatl
</hi>
(
Temple
of
Quetzalcoatl
)
.
One
of
the
most
sacred
temples
in
the
complex
,
this
structure
is
decorated
with
many
stone
serpent
heads
.
</item>
<item>
<hi rend="bold">
Museo
Teotihuacán
</hi>
.
The
museum
at
the
park
with
outstanding
displays
and
a
miniature
recreation
of
the
entire
site
.
Well
worth
the
visit
.
</item>
</list>
<p>
There
are
also
many
interesting
constructions
along
the
<hi rend="bold">
Avenue
of
the
Dead
</hi>
which
runs
along
the
middle
of
the
site
,
so
do
n't
just
walk
from
one
temple
to
the
other
.
On
the
left
side
of
the
plaza
in
front
of
the
Pyramid
of
the
Moon
are
several
areas
including
the
,
which
includes
the
<hi rend="bold">
Palacio
de
los
Jaguares
</hi>
(
<hi rend="italic">
Palace
of
the
Jaguars
</hi>
)
and
the
<hi rend="bold">
Templo
de
los
Caracoles
Emplumados
</hi>
,
with
many
wall
paintings
,
sculptures
,
and
underground
rooms
.
</p>
<p>
There
are
also
some
smaller
structures
surrounding
the
complex
,
no
more
than
four
or
five
meters
in
height
.
A
drive
around
the
perimeter
,
on
the
road
along
the
park
will
provide
many
surprises
and
is
worth
the
trip
.
Hitching
a
ride
or
even
paying
a
few
pesos
for
a
ride
will
be
worth
the
effort
.
