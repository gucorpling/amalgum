When
writing
about
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witchcraft">
witches
</ref>
Barrett
stated
that
he
did
not
believe
that
their
power
to
torment
or
kill
by
enchantment
,
touch
or
by
using
a
wax
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effigy">
effigy
</ref>
came
from
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satan">
Satan
</ref>
.
He
claimed
if
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Devil">
the
Devil
</ref>
wanted
to
kill
a
man
guilty
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_deadly_sins">
deadly
sin
</ref>
,
he
did
not
need
a
witch
as
an
intermediary
.
</p>
<p>
Barrett
's
belief
in
magical
power
might
be
summed
up
this
way
:
</p>
<p>
The
magical
power
is
in
the
inward
or
inner
man
.
A
certain
proportion
of
the
inner
man
longs
for
the
external
in
all
things
.
When
the
person
is
in
the
appropriate
disposition
an
appropriate
connection
between
man
and
object
can
be
attained
.
