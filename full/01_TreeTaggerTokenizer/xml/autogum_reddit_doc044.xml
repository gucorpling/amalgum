My
parents
(
73
)
want
to
kick
my
brother
(
45
)
and
his
family
out
of
their
house
</head>
<sp who="#yuiawta">
<p>
My
brother
and
his
wife
are
both
medical
missionaries
.
They
have
spent
the
bulk
of
the
last
11
years
in
Africa
through
a
Christian
program
that
places
them
in
understaffed
hospitals
.
They
get
a
monthly
stipend
,
funded
by
charitable
donations
,
for
living
expenses
.
They
have
two
kids
,
now
8
and
14
.
From
one
perspective
,
they
have
put
themselves
through
tremendous
hardships
to
help
those
most
in
need
.
They
have
lived
in
rural
housing
without
flushing
toilets
,
home-schooled
their
kids
while
working
in
understaffed
hospitals
dealing
with
horrific
diseases
without
modern
medical
equipment
.
They
have
built
up
a
small
church
community
in
rural
Africa
from
virtually
nothing
.
And
they
've
likely
meaningfully
touched
more
lives
than
most
of
us
could
ever
dream
of
.
From
another
perspective
,
they
are
now
in
their
mid-40s
and
they
do
n't
have
a
penny
to
their
name
.
Nothing
for
the
kids
'
college
or
their
retirement
.
They
live
in
my
parents
'
basement
when
they
are
in
the
US
,
which
they
have
been
for
about
half
the
time
the
last
4-5
years
.
They
do
n't
pay
for
groceries
or
utilities
.
My
parents
recently
shared
with
me
that
they
are
kicking
them
out
.
When
they
're
here
in
the
US
,
they
do
n't
work
,
saying
that
nobody
wants
to
hire
a
doctor
for
just
a
year
(
and
that
it
would
be
sinful
for
them
to
deceive
them
)
.
They
instead
sit
around
the
house
and
continue
their
homeschooling
of
the
kids
.
They
wo
n't
say
as
much
,
but
I
'm
pretty
sure
their
retirement
plan
is
inheritance
,
though
it
's
hard
to
say
whether
that
will
be
a
sufficient
amount
.
My
parents
shared
with
me
that
they
do
not
really
want
to
kick
them
out
.
What
they
want
is
for
them
to
both
get
jobs
,
to
put
their
kids
in
the
local
public
school
,
and
to
start
to
balance
their
faith
with
reality
.
My
parents
say
they
do
n't
even
care
about
them
living
in
the
house
and
not
contributing
financially
,
if
they
would
just
start
earning
and
saving
some
money
for
the
future
.
My
parents
are
begging
me
to
help
convince
him
to
change
his
ways
.
I
've
tried
in
years
past
to
talk
to
them
about
money
,
but
the
conversation
turns
to
the
true
riches
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
and
we
get
nowhere
.
When
I
ask
about
funding
for
college
they
say
God
will
show
them
the
right
path
when
the
time
comes
.
It
's
like
we
do
n't
even
speak
the
same
language
.
My
mother
is
increasingly
stressed
and
she
tells
me
she
is
barely
sleeping
.
She
threatened
to
sell
the
house
and
downsize
to
somewhere
my
brother
and
family
would
n't
be
able
to
fit
,
but
my
brother
talked
her
out
of
it
(
and
she
was
bluffing
anyway
,
she
's
lived
in
that
house
for
decades
and
she
does
n't
want
to
move
)
.
She
yells
at
him
about
the
damage
to
her
dishes
and
her
furniture
from
his
kids
,
but
he
dismisses
any
concerns
with
material
possessions
as
trivial
and
meaningless
.
I
really
want
to
help
my
parents
,
but
I
have
n't
the
slightest
clue
how
.
My
brother
and
his
wife
wo
n't
listen
to
us
.
What
do
you
think
I
and
my
parents
should
do
?
TL
;
DR
:
Failure-to-launch
brother
and
his
family
are
saving
the
world
but
not
a
penny
for
themselves
.
My
mother
wants
them
to
either
move
out
or
get
jobs
,
but
they
refuse
,
and
are
in
an
increasingly
awkward
stand-off
.

I
would
sit
your
brother
and
or
his
wife
down
and
say
listen
mom
and
dad
have
sent
me
to
talk
to
you
.
They
are
going
to
kick
you
and
your
family
out
unless
you
guys
begin
earning
an
income
to
contribute
.
(
Your
parents
could
charge
them
a
rent
and
stash
it
as
part
of
their
inheritance
later
or
something
if
they
want
)
say
that
holy
riches
will
not
pay
for
a
roof
over
you
and
you
and
your
family
's
head
or
food
in
your
bellies
.
You
say
something
will
happen
when
the
time
comes
.
Well
the
time
has
come
.
Make
them
believe
they
have
got
to
.
go
or
get
a
job
and
you
will
be
the
one
enforcing
it
for
your
parents
since
they
've
been
pushed
over
already
.
