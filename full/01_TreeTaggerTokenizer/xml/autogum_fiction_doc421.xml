“
There
’s
ingratitude
for
you
!
”
Miss
Dolly
Foster
exclaimed
suddenly
.
</p>
<p>
“
Where
!
”
I
asked
,
rousing
myself
from
meditation
.
</p>
<p>
She
pointed
to
a
young
man
who
had
just
passed
where
we
sat
.
He
was
dressed
very
smartly
,
and
was
walking
with
a
lady
attired
in
the
height
of
the
fashion
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
made
that
man
,
”
said
Dolly
,
“
and
now
he
cuts
me
dead
before
the
whole
of
the
Row
!
It
’s
atrocious
.
Why
,
but
for
me
,
do
you
suppose
he
’d
be
at
this
moment
engaged
to
three
thousand
a
year
and
--
and
the
plainest
girl
in
London
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Not
that
,
”
I
pleaded
;
“
think
of
--
”
</p>
<p>
“
Well
,
very
plain
anyhow
.
I
was
quite
ready
to
bow
to
him
.
I
almost
did
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
In
fact
you
did
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
did
n’t
.
I
declare
I
did
n’t
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Oh
,
well
,
you
did
n’t
then
.
It
only
looked
like
it
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
met
him
,
”
said
Miss
Dolly
,
“
three
years
ago
.
At
that
time
he
was
--
oh
,
quite
unpresentable
.
He
was
everything
he
should
n’t
be
.
He
was
a
teetotaler
,
you
know
,
and
he
did
n’t
smoke
,
and
he
was
always
going
to
concerts
.
Oh
,
and
he
wore
his
hair
long
,
and
his
trousers
short
,
and
his
hat
on
the
back
of
his
head
.
And
his
umbrella
--
”
</p>
<p>
“
Where
did
he
wear
that
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
He
carried
that
,
Mr.
Carter
.
Do
n’t
be
silly
!
Carried
it
unrolled
,
you
know
,
and
generally
a
paper
parcel
in
the
other
hand
;
and
he
had
spectacles
too
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
He
has
certainly
changed
,
outwardly
at
least
.
</p>
<p>
“
Yes
,
I
know
;
well
,
I
did
that
.
I
took
him
in
hand
,
and
I
just
taught
him
,
and
now
--
!
”
</p>
<p>
“
Yes
,
I
know
that
.
But
how
did
you
teach
him
?
Give
him
Saturday
evening
lectures
,
or
what
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Oh
,
every-evening
lectures
,
and
most-morning
walks
.
And
I
taught
him
to
dance
,
and
broke
his
wretched
fiddle
with
my
own
hands
!
”
</p>
<p>
“
What
very
arbitrary
distinctions
you
draw
!
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
do
n’t
know
that
you
mean
.
I
do
like
a
man
to
be
smart
,
anyhow
.
Do
n’t
you
,
Mr.
Carter
?
You
’re
not
so
smart
as
you
might
be
.
Now
,
shall
I
take
you
in
hand
?
”
And
she
smiled
upon
me
.
</p>
<p>
“
Let
’s
hear
your
method
.
What
did
you
do
to
him
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
To
Phil
Meadows
?
Oh
,
nothing
.
I
just
slipped
in
a
remark
here
and
there
,
whenever
he
talked
nonsense
.
I
used
to
speak
just
at
the
right
time
,
you
know
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
But
how
had
your
words
such
influence
,
Miss
Foster
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Oh
,
well
,
you
know
,
Mr.
Carter
,
I
made
it
a
condition
that
he
should
do
just
what
I
wanted
in
little
things
like
that
.
Did
he
think
I
was
going
to
walk
about
with
a
man
carrying
a
brown
paper
parcel
--
as
if
we
had
been
to
the
shop
for
a
pound
of
tea
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Still
,
I
do
n’t
see
why
he
should
alter
all
his
--
”
</p>
<p>
“
Oh
,
you
are
stupid
!
Of
course
,
he
liked
me
,
you
know
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Oh
,
did
he
?
I
see
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
You
seem
to
think
that
very
funny
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Not
that
he
did
--
but
that
,
apparently
,
he
does
n’t
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Well
you
got
out
of
that
rather
neatly
--
for
you
.
No
,
he
does
n’t
now
.
You
see
,
he
misunderstood
my
motive
.
He
thought
--
well
,
I
do
believe
he
thought
I
cared
for
him
,
you
know
.
Of
course
I
did
n’t
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Not
a
bit
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Just
as
a
friend
--
and
a
pupil
,
you
know
.
And
when
he
’d
had
his
hair
cut
and
bought
a
frock
coat
(
fancy
he
’d
never
had
one
!
)
,
he
looked
quite
nice
.
He
has
nice
eyes
.
Did
you
notice
them
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Lord
,
no
!
”
</p>
<p>
“
Well
,
you
’re
so
unobservant
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Oh
,
not
always
.
I
’ve
observed
that
your
--
”
</p>
<p>
“
Please
do
n’t
!
It
’s
no
use
,
is
it
?
”
</p>
<p>
I
looked
very
unhappy
.
There
is
an
understanding
that
I
am
very
unhappy
since
Miss
Foster
’s
engagement
to
the
Earl
of
Mickleham
was
announced
.
</p>
<p>
“
What
was
I
saying
before
--
before
you
--
you
know
--
oh
,
about
Phil
Meadows
,
of
course
.
I
did
like
him
very
much
,
you
know
,
or
I
should
n’t
have
taken
all
that
trouble
.
Why
,
his
own
mother
thanked
me
!
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
have
no
more
to
say
,
”
said
I.
</p>
<p>
“
But
she
wrote
me
a
horrid
letter
afterward
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
You
’re
so
very
elliptical
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
So
very
what
,
Mr.
Carter
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
You
leave
so
much
out
,
I
mean
.
After
what
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Why
,
after
I
sent
him
away
.
Did
n’t
I
tell
you
?
Oh
,
we
had
the
most
awful
scene
.
He
raved
,
Mr.
Carter
.
He
called
me
the
most
horrid
names
,
and
--
”
</p>
<p>
“
Tore
his
hair
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
It
was
n’t
long
enough
to
get
hold
of
,
”
she
tittered
.
“
But
do
n’t
laugh
.
It
was
really
dreadful
.
And
so
unjust
!
And
then
,
next
day
,
when
I
thought
it
was
comfortably
over
,
you
know
,
he
came
back
,
and
--
and
apologized
,
and
called
himself
the
most
awful
names
,
and
--
well
,
that
was
really
worse
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
What
did
the
fellow
complain
of
?
”
I
asked
in
wondering
tones
.
</p>
<p>
“
Oh
,
he
said
I
’d
destroyed
his
faith
in
women
,
you
know
,
and
that
I
’d
led
him
on
,
and
that
I
was
--
well
,
he
was
very
rude
indeed
.
And
he
went
on
writing
me
letters
like
that
for
a
whole
year
?
It
made
me
quite
uncomfortable
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
But
he
did
n’t
go
back
to
short
trousers
and
a
fiddle
,
did
he
?
”
I
asked
anxiously
.
