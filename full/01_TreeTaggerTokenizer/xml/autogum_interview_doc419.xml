What
would
you
bring
to
the
table
beyond

A

I
would
bring
a
determination
always
to
keep
an
eye
on
long
range
goals
and
needs
while
focusing
on
achievable
,
immediate
priorities
,
and
not
mortgage
the

Q
:
</hi>
Describe
the
three
most
important
issues
in
your
campaign
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
A
:
</hi>
Property
taxes
,
crime
and
traffic
are
three
hot
topic
issues
.
I
believe
that
homeowners
and
businesses
are
being
over
taxed
.
Generation
of
revenue
is
not
a
problem
for
the
city
,
the
way
we
spend
taxpayers
money
needs
to
be
re-evaluated
.
We
need
to
hire
more
police
officers
and
we
need
to
give
them
the
resources
to
do
their
job
effectively
.
I
believe
that
a
city
the
size
of
Toronto
should
have
at
least
one
regularly
operating
police
helicopter
.
We
can
also
address
youth
crime
by
giving
our
youth
the
opportunity
to
spend
their
time
in
healthful
and
productive
ways
.
I
have
suggested
that
the
city
should
work
with
the
school
boards
to
open
high
school
gyms
to
their
student
for
after
school
activities
.
Currently
,
a
lot
of
school
gyms
are
closed
to
students
after
school
due
to
a
lack
of
qualified
supervisors
.
Finally
,
infiltration
of
traffic
onto
the
streets
of
Leaside
have
incresed
<hi rend="italic">
[
sic
]
</hi>
drastically
over
the
past
few
years
.
I
suggest
reducing
vehicular
access
to
the
streets
of
Leaside
during
peak
hours
for
non-residents
or
their
visitors
.
I
also
support
the
construction
of
the
Redway
Rd
.
extension
to
ease
traffic
flow
.

Q
:
</hi>
What
one
election
issue
do
you
feel
is
most
relevant
to
your
ward
in
this
election
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
A
:
</hi>
As
I
mentioned
before
,
I
believe
that
that
property
taxes
for
homeowners
and
businesses
need
to
be
frozen
.
We
are
being
over
taxed
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Q
:
</hi>
Why
have
you
chosen
to
involve
yourself
in
the
political
process
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
A
:
</hi>
I
have
lived
in
ward
26
for
thirty
years
.
I
have
also
attended
school
here
,
worked
here
,
and
I
have
been
a
volunteer
football
coach
at
Leaside
High
School
since
1989
.
I
believe
that
I
can
be
a
strong
and
effective
voice
for
our
community
at
City
Hall
without
partisan
influence
because
I
am
not
a
member
of
any
political
party
.

A

</hi>
I
have
deep
roots

Being

resident

I

and
concerns
of
quite
a
number
of
the
residents
of
Ward
26
.
