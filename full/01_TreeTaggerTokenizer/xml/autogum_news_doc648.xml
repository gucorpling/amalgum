<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bono">

</ref>
reflected
on
Sheehan
's
life
to
the
audience
,
saying
how
he
was
family
to
the
band
.
Bono
said
,
&quot;
U2
's
family
â€”
it
's
a
brotherhood
,
although
there
's
a
lot
of
sisters
in
it
too
...
but
the
extended
family
is
very
important
to
us
and
we
look
after
each
other
.
It
takes
a
lot
to
put
on
a
show
like
tonight
,
and
last
night
we
lost
a
member
of
our
family
.
Dennis
Sheehan
was
his
name
.
He
was
U2
's
tour
manager
for
33
years
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
During
the
show
,
Bono
also
added
,
&quot;
A
lot
of
U2
songs
over
the
years
were
written
to
fill
a
void
,
an
absence
,
a
hole
in
a
heart
left
by
a
loved
one
.
With
the
loss
of
Sheehan
,
U2
now
has
such
a
wound
.

Whether

social
lives
,
which
they
are
very
particular
about
,
or
in
their
business
life
...
they

them
give
of
their
best
