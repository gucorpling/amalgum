Frequency
Control
in
the
Korean
Power
System
</head>
<p>
As
the
frequency
is
a
major
parameter
indicating
the
balance
between
generation
and
demand
of
a
power
system
,
it
is
controlled
in
the
Korean
power
system
by
providing
frequency
control
services
.
The
frequency
control
services
consist
of
primary
and
secondary
frequency
control
,
which
are
provided
by
the
resources
’
local
responses
and
the
automatic
generation
control
(
AGC
)
central
response
,
respectively
,
as
shown
in
Table
1
.
</p>
<p>
The
primary
frequency
control
is
the
frequency
response
provided
mainly
by
the
generator
’s
governor
,
and
ESS
was
permitted
to
participate
in
the
primary
frequency
control
service
in
2015
.
Table
2
summarizes
the
requirements
for
providing
the
frequency
response
service
defined
in
the
Korean
electricity
market
rule
.
</p>
<p>
In
addition
,
in
the
Korean
power
system
,
the
frequency
response
is
evaluated
by
using
two
indices
,
the
speed
droop
and
the
response
quantity
.
The
speed
droop
is
evaluated
by
calculating
the
ratio
of
the
responding
amount
of
a
generator
power
to
the
frequency
change
in
percentage
.
The
responding
quantity
,
which
is
defined
as
the
governor
free
response
quantity
(
GFRQ
)
,
is
evaluated
by
the
difference
between
outputs
before
and
after
the
disturbance
using
the
Equation
(
1
)
:
(
1
)
where
is
the
time
of
a
disturbance
,
is
the
time
of
reaching
59.8
Hz
after
the
disturbance
,
and
is
the
power
at
time
.
</p>
<p>
The
secondary
frequency
control
is
provided
by
participating
resources
’
responses
to
the
AGC
frequency
control
signal
,
which
are
determined
by
the
energy
management
system
(
EMS
)
.
All
generators
,
except
for
the
nuclear
generators
,
participate
in
the
secondary
frequency
control
service
.
ESS
was
permitted
to
participate
in
the
secondary
frequency
control
service
in
2016
,
but
it
is
not
yet
participating
.

BESS
for
Providing
Frequency
Response
in
the
Korean
Power
System
</head>
<p>
KEPCO
announced
a
plan
to
install
MW-scale
BESS
to
provide
a
frequency
response
in
2015
.
According
to
the
plan
,
a
BESS
of
376
MW
is
being
operated
commercially
to
provide
the
frequency
response
by
KEPCO
in
13
substations
.
<figure>
Figure
1
</figure>
shows
each
location
and
the
capacity
of
installed
BESS
in
Korea
.
</p>
<p>
The
main
purpose
of
MW-scale
BESS
is
substituting
the
existing
primary
frequency
response
reserves
from
a
thermal
generator
,
which
has
low
generation
cost
.
By
doing
that
,
the
thermal
generator
can
increase
the
generation
level
,
and
the
system
marginal
price
(
SMP
)
will
be
reduced
by
excluding
high-cost
generators
in
the
electricity
market
.
Furthermore
,
the
BESS
can
provide
or
absorb
the
power
within
200
ms
,
considering
the
communication
delay
.
Therefore
,
the
BESS
can
provide
the
needed
frequency
response
by
injecting
the
power
into
the
power
system
just
after
the
disturbance
.
</p>
<p>
Presently
,
the
proposed
control
strategy
has
been
implemented
in
a
376-MW
BESS
installed
at
13
substations
to
provide
both
virtual
inertia
response
and
primary
frequency
response
.
The
proposed
control
strategy
is
loaded
in
the
individual
control
unit
,
where
four
power
conversion
systems
(
PCS
)
are
dispatched
,
as
shown
in
<figure>
Figure
2
</figure>
.
Additionally
,
there
is
another
control
algorithm
upstream
of
the
individual
control
unit
.
However
,
this
paper
focused
on
the
more
indicative
control
strategy-related
frequency
response
.
