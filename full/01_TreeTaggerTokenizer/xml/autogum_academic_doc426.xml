Introduction

<p>
Equity
in
health
was
defined
by
Margaret
Whitehead
in
1991
,
and
is
an
utmost
issue
related
to
an
unfair
and
uneven
distribution
of
healthcare
.
In
the
scope
of
the
United
Nations
2030
Agenda
for
sustainable
development
goals
(
SDGs
)
,
health
promotion
—
SDG
3
—
is
a
multidimensional
target
directly
related
to
other
goals
,
such
as
inequality
reduction
—
SDG
10
—
which
emphasizes
its
complexity
.
It
is
widely
recognized
that
health
outcomes
have
a
strong
association
with
socioeconomic
position
,
becoming
more
evident
in
unequal
societies
and
in
dense
urban
areas
.
Individual
health
condition
is
no
longer
considered
only
as
a
consequence
of
biological
causes
as
previous
studies
indicate
that
it
is
also
influenced
by
social
,
environmental
,
cultural
,
political
,
and
economic
factors
.
These
factors
include
housing
quality
,
access
to
healthcare
and
education
,
work
conditions
,
environmental
quality
,
sanitation
availability
,
and
safety
.
</p>
<p>
Welfare
states
,
namely
in
Europe
,
play
an
important
role
in
the
development
of
policies
and
strategies
aiming
to
reduce
health
vulnerabilities
and
inequalities
through
social
transfers
and
provision
of
services
.
The
biggest
public
health
policy
challenge
is
to
promote
universal
health
services
,
which
results
in
healthier
communities
.
This
promotion
should
be
supported
through
education
and
health
literacy
that
ensure
healthy
lifestyles
.
European
Health
2020
policy
focuses
on
the
reduction
of
health
gaps
that
are
directly
associated
with
social
determinants
.
The
objective
is
to
reduce
health
differences
and
disparities
within
and
across
groups
.
The
worst
and
most
visible
outcome
of
health
disparities
is
death
by
avoidable
causes
,
resulting
from
absent
,
delayed
,
or
inadequate
healthcare
services
.
</p>
<p>
The
concept
of
“
fundamental
causes
”
of
death
was
developed
stating
that
socioeconomic
status
is
the
main
cause
of
inequality
in
mortality
.
Within
this
concept
,
socioeconomic
status
embodies
an
availability
of
resources
,
such
as
money
,
knowledge
,
prestige
,
power
,
and
beneficial
social
connections
that
may
provide
relevant
mechanisms
,
at
any
given
time
,
that
facilitate
access
to
specialized
medical
services
.
The
World
Health
Organization
analyzed
health
determinants
at
a
multiscale
level
,
deriving
the
following
key
findings
:
</p>
<p>
<list>
<item>
▪
Social
factors
determine
populations
health
;
</item>
<item>
▪
Social
determinants
of
health
produce
inequalities
;
</item>
<item>
▪
Disadvantaged
groups
are
more
vulnerable
to
disease
,
die
younger
and
experience
worse
health
conditions
;
</item>
<item>
▪
Plans
and
actions
to
fight
against
health
inequalities
imply
a
multidisciplinary
approach
due
to
its
complexity
;
</item>
<item>
▪
Development
of
instruments
to
measure
social
determinants
in
health
are
useful
to
provide
knowledge
to
design
tailored
public
health
policies
;
</item>
<item>
▪
Monitoring
is
very
important
;
thus
,
health
inequalities
diagnosis
should
not
be
the
goal
but
the
starting
point
of
health
plans
and
policies
;
</item>
<item>
▪
Health
policies
’
effects
should
be
understood
as
a
way
to
evaluate
effectiveness
in
reducing
inequalities
.

The
Portuguese
National
Health
Service
(
NHS
)
was
founded
with
the
purpose
to
assure
universal
access
to
healthcare
,
independently
of
one
’s
socio
and
economic
condition
,
including
foreigners
,
stateless
,
and
political
refugees
.
Despite
the
gains
of
the
NHS
public
health
policies
intervention
in
Portugal
,
recent
studies
reveal
a
mismatch
between
services
offered
and
populations
needs
.
This
gap
is
aggravated
in
rural
and
isolated
areas
where
aged
,
poorly
educated
,
and
unemployed
groups
are
predominant
.
</p>
<p>
This
paper
addresses
the
vulnerability
in
health
aligned
within
the
scope
of
the
UN
Sustainable
Development
Goals
:
“
no
one
is
left
behind
”
.
For
decades
,
investments
in
healthcare
infrastructures
and
professionals
of
NHS
have
been
focused
on
densely
populated
urban
centers
to
cover
growing
population
needs
,
neglecting
isolated
and
rural
areas
.
However
,
the
systematic
phenomenon
of
depopulation
,
observed
for
decades
,
is
worsening
in
rural
areas
.
Response
to
acute
medical
emergencies
is
rather
difficult
in
areas
far
from
densely
urban
centers
where
specialized
healthcare
services
are
located
,
therefore
specifically
affecting
the
underprivileged
communities
of
rural
areas
.
Recent
international
studies
have
highlighted
that
the
human
right
to
health
must
consider
,
among
other
factors
,
that
the
universal
health
“
coverage
should
be
on
the
basis
of
need
,
with
extra
weight
given
to
the
needs
of
the
underprivileged
”
.
</p>
<p>
Further
research
on
national
health
vulnerabilities
and
recommendations
for
policies
to
cope
with
this
issue
remains
a
challenge
due
to
the
scarcity
of
data
.
Furthermore
,
the
difficulty
of
accessing
periodic
data
needed
to
design
longitudinal
studies
is
another
limitation
.
Alongside
these
difficulties
,
Portugal
health
’s
inequalities
are
dispersed
across
the
country
,
justifying
a
local-scale
approach
to
study
this
subject
.
</p>
<p>
In
this
context
,
the
present
work
proposes
a
composite
index
—
socioeconomic
health
vulnerability
index
(
<hi rend="italic">
SEHVI
</hi>
)
—
built
with
several
indicators
related
to
health
determinants
and
health
outcomes
.
<hi rend="italic">
SEHVI
</hi>
was
applied
on
three
different
years
over
a
nine-year
period
to
assess
the
evolution
of
the
Portuguese
reality
:
2009
is
the
onset
of
a
financial
and
economic
crisis
;
in
2015
,
the
United
Nations
declared
the
2030
Agenda
of
Sustainable
Development
;
and
2017/2018
correspond
to
the
last
data
available
on
the
national
databases
.
