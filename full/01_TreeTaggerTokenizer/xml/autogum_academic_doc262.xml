OLSR
Protocol
</head>
<p>
The
optimized
link
state
routing
protocol
is
one
of
the
most
used
protocols
in
MANETs
.
It
is
part
of
the
table-driven
(
proactive
)
routing
protocols
that
build
the
routing
tables
by
periodically
exchanging
topology
control
messages
.
The
OLSR
has
adopted
the
MPR
concept
to
achieve
good
dissemination
of
TC
messages
.
The
MPR
concept
optimizes
the
overhead
,
firstly
,
by
selecting
the
minimum
number
of
nodes
to
act
as
forwarders
of
TC
messages
.
Secondly
,
only
links
between
MPRs
and
their
selectors
are
shared
to
reduce
the
size
of
TC
messages
.
<figure>
Figure
2
</figure>
shows
the
principle
of
the
MPR
concept
.
We
model
the
OLSR
network
as
a
unit
disk
graph
,
where
<hi rend="italic">
V
</hi>
represents
the
set
of
nodes
and
<hi rend="italic">
E
</hi>
the
set
of
symmetric
edges
.
is
the
signal
length
of
the
node
<hi rend="italic">
u
</hi>
.
For
simplicity
,
we
consider
that
signal
range
<hi rend="italic">
R
</hi>
is
uniform
for
all
nodes
.
Two
nodes
<hi rend="italic">
u
</hi>
and
<hi rend="italic">
v
</hi>
form
a
symmetric
link
if
and
only
if
they
are
at
distance
.
The
OLSR
protocol
maintains
regularly
local
information
and
global
information
in
each
node
.
Neighborhood
information
is
broadcasted
via
HELLO
messages
by
each
node
<hi rend="italic">
u
</hi>
in
the
network
.
The
HELLO
messages
are
never
forwarded
and
they
serve
to
discover
one-hop
and
two-hop
neighbor
sets
denoted
and
,
respectively
.
Every
node
elects
from
its
neighbors
a
set
of
nodes
to
act
as
MPRs
to
forward
TC
messages
.
We
denote
the
set
of
MPRs
of
a
node
<hi rend="italic">
u
</hi>
as
and
the
set
of
MPR
selectors
as
.
A
node
<hi rend="italic">
u
</hi>
updates
its
topology
information
information
each
time
a
HELLO
or
a
TC
message
is
received
.
The
topology
information
on
a
node
<hi rend="italic">
u
</hi>
is
a
directed
subgraph
of
the
graph
<hi rend="italic">
G
</hi>
denoted
.
</p>
<p>
In
this
section
,
we
describe
the
MPR
concept
of
OLSR
,
especially
the
MPR
selection
and
the
default
forwarding
rules
(
DFR
)
of
TC
messages
.

.
The
MPR
Computation
of
OLSR
</head>
<p>
The
OLSR
exchanges
HELLO
messages
on
a
regular
interval
to
sense
links
between
nodes
,
to
discover
one-hop
and
two-hop
neighbors
and
to
build
a
local
topology
.
HELLO
messages
are
exchanged
in
broadcast
manner
and
they
are
never
forwarded
to
other
nodes
.
A
device
informs
,
within
the
HELLO
messages
,
its
adjacent
nodes
about
its
links
with
other
nodes
.
The
MPR
set
is
computed
every
time
a
HELLO
message
is
received
.
A
node
selects
among
its
one-hop
neighbors
the
minimum
number
of
MPRs
to
cover
its
two-hop
neighbors
.
After
the
MPR
computation
is
completed
,
all
the
two-hop
neighbors
are
covered
.
The
MPR
collection
should
be
as
small
as
possible
.
The
smaller
the
MPR
collection
is
,
the
lower
the
overhead
would
be
.
Let
us
consider
the
OLSR
network
presented

<p>
According
to
the
default
MPR
computation
algorithm
in
<figure>
Figure

</figure>
,
<hi rend="italic">
x
</hi>
adds
<hi rend="italic">
a
</hi>
and
<hi rend="italic">
d
</hi>
to
because
they
are
the
only
nodes
connected
to
<hi rend="italic">
e
</hi>
and
<hi rend="italic">
i
</hi>
,
respectively
.
,
,
,
and
.
Both
<hi rend="italic">
b
</hi>
and
<hi rend="italic">
c
</hi>
have
the
same
reachability
.
However
,
.
The
node
<hi rend="italic">
x
</hi>
will
select
node
<hi rend="italic">
c
</hi>
as
MPR
and
all
nodes
in
will
be
covered
.
This
MPR
set
rises
the
broadcast
zone
because
nodes
<hi rend="italic">
c
</hi>
and
<hi rend="italic">
d
</hi>
are
close
to
each
other
which
will
increase
the
collision
.
