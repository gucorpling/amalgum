WAR
AND
ART
</head>
<p>
THIS
war
is
going
to
have
a
tremendous
in-
fluence
on
Art
--
vitalize
it
,
you
know
,
and
make
it
REAL
,
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
.
In
fact
,
it
's
doing
it
already
.
We
took
up
the
war
last
night
--
our
Little
Group
of
Serious
Thinkers
,
you
know
--
in
quite
a
serious
way
and
considered
it
thoroughly
in
all
its
aspects
and
we
decided
that
it
would
put
more
SOUL
into
Art
.
</p>
<p>
And
into
life
,
too
,
you
know
.
</p>
<p>
Already
you
can
see
it
on
every
hand
how
much
serious
purpose
it
is
putting
into
lives
that
were
merely
trivial
before
.
Even
poor
,
dear
Mamma
--
and
really
,
it
would
be
hard
to
imagine
a
more
trivial
person
than
Mamma
!
--
is
knitting
socks
.
</p>
<p>
She
is
going
to
send
them
to
the
Poles
.
She
wanted
to
send
them
to
the
Belgians
.
</p>
<p>
But
I
said
to
her
,
&quot;
Positively
,
Mamma
,
you
are
ALWAYS
behind
the
times
.
Do
n't
you
know
the
Belgians
are
going
out
and
the
Poles
are
coming
in
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
And
,
you
know
,
it
's
been
months
since
really
Smart
People
have
knit
for
the
Belgians
.
The
Poles
are
QUITE
the
thing
now
.
</p>
<p>
It
's
strange
how
great
movements
keep
going
on
and
on
from
mountain
peak
to
mountain
peak
of
usefulness
like
that
,
is
n't
it
?
--
changing
their
direction
now
and
then
as
evolution
itself
does
,
but
always
progressing
,
progressing
!
</p>
<p>
That
is
one
wonderful
thing
about
evolution
--
it
ALWAYS
progresses
.
</p>
<p>
When
one
thinks
it
over
,
one
grows
more
and
more
conscious
that
the
human
race
owes
a
great
deal
to
Evolution
,
does
n't
one
?
</p>
<p>
WHAT
could
we
have
done
without
it
?
</p>
<p>
It
's
as
somebody
said
about
something
else
one
time
--
if
we
had
n't
had
it
,
you
know
,
it
would
have
been
necessary
to
invent
it
,
though
for
the
life
of
me
,
I
ca
n't
remember
who
it
was
or
what
he
said
about
it
.
Although
likely
it
was
Madame
de
Stael
.
We
took
her
up
once
and
it
developed
that
she
had
said
a
most
surprising
number
of
things
like
that
things
,
you
know
,
that
would
be
quite
quotable
if
you
could
only
remember
them
.
</p>
<p>
Is
n't
memory
a
wonderful
facility
,
though
?
</p>
<p>
I
've
always
intended
to
go
in
for
developing
mine
systematically
and
scientifically
.
</p>
<p>
But
I
've
never
done
it
because
I
always
forget
whether
I
should
order
the
book-shop
people
to
send
home
a
work
on
numismatics
or
a
work
on
mnemonics
.
One
of
them
is
about
money
,
you
know
,
and
the
other
is
about
memory
.
And
once
when
I
was
shopping
and
thought
I
had
it
right
it
turned
out
--
the
book
did
,
when
I
got
it
home
--
to
be
all
about
air
and
things
.
Pneumatics
,
you
know
!
Was
n't
it
perfectly
ridiculous
?
</p>
<p>
But
,
of
course
,
one
learns
by
one
's
mistakes
.
</p>
<p>
Have
you
seen
dear
Nijinsky
?
</p>
<p>
We
were
discussing
him
last
evening
--
our
little
group
,
you
know
--
and
decided
that
while
he
has
more
Personality
than
Mordkin
he
has
less
Temperament
,
if
you
get
what
I
mean
.
</p>
<p>
One
of
the
girls
said
last
evening
,
&quot;
Mordkin
is
more
exotic
,
but
Nijinsky
is
more
esoteric
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
And
another
said
,
&quot;
One
of
them
shows
intellect
obviously
mingled
with
spirit
,
but
the
other
shows
spirit
occultly
mingled
with
intellect
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Fothergil
Finch
said
,
&quot;
They
are
alike
in
their
differences
,
but
subtly
differentiated
in
their
likenesses
,
n'est-cd
pas
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Fothy
has
a
simply
delightful
faculty
of
summing
a
thing
up
in
a
sentence
like
that
,
but
it
makes
him
very
vain
if
you
show
you
think
so
;
so
I
put
him
in
his
place
and
closed
the
discussion
with
one
remark
:
</p>
<p>
&quot;
It
is
all
,
&quot;
I
said
,
&quot;
it
is
ALL
a
question
of
Interpretation
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
And
,
quite
seriously
,
when
you
come
to
think
about
it
,
it
usually
is
,
is
n't
it
?
</p>
<head>
A
SPIRITUAL
DIALOGUE
</head>
<p>
Last
night
I
met
Hermione
,
And
eagerly
she
said
to
me
:
&quot;
Thoughts
from
the
ambient
everywhere
Electrify
our
worldly
air
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
My
soul
,
&quot;
I
said
,
&quot;
grabs
off
such
hints
As
butter
,
whether
pats
or
prints
,
Receives
and
holds
all
unaware
Small
strands
of
drifting
,
golden
hair
.
But
have
YOU
thought
,
O
Maiden
fair
,
O
,
have
you
thought
profoundly
of
The
psychic
consciousness
in
crows
?
Or
why
the
Malay
when
in
love
Wears
rubber
earrings
on
his
toes
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
lady
shook
her
lovely
head
--
'
Twas
coiffed
divinely
--
and
she
said
:
&quot;
Have
you
reflected
on
the
part
Primeval
instinct
plays
in
Art
?
It
's
simply
wonderful
the
way
Old
things
grow
new
from
day
to
day
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
That
's
true
,
&quot;
I
said
,
&quot;
I
often
ape
The
Ape
to
get
my
Art
in
shape
--
And
with
the
Simian
going
strong
,
Behold
,
another
Rennysawng
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Perhaps
,
&quot;
she
said
,
&quot;
across
the
verge
Of
darkness
,
from
the
Cosmic
Urge
,
The
Light
is
speeding
in
bright
waves
,
E'en
now
to
show
the
way
to
slaves
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
The
thought
,
&quot;
I
said
,
&quot;
is
cheerful
--
but
These
Swamis
WILL
chew
betel-nut
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Alas
!
&quot;
she
said
,
&quot;
alas
!
too
true
!
But
oh
!
it
's
wonderful
of
you
To
sympathize
and
understand
--
&quot;
(
She
gestured
with
a
jeweled
hand
)
--
&quot;
The
joy
of
being
understood
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Our
talk
,
&quot;
I
said
,
&quot;
has
done
me
good
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
WILL
THE
BEST
PEOPLE
RECEIVE
THE
SUPERMAN
SOCIALLY
?
</p>
<p>
WE'VE
been
taking
up
Metabolism
lately
--
our
Little
Group
of
Serious
Thinkers
,
you
know
--
and
it
's
wonderful
;
just
simply
WONDERFUL
!
</p>
<p>
I
really
do
n't
know
how
I
got
along
for
so
many
years
without
it
--
it
opens
up
such
new
vistas
,
does
n't
it
?
</p>
<p>
I
can
never
think
in
the
same
way
again
about
even
the
most
trivial
things
since
I
have
learned
all
about
Protoplasm
and
--
and
--
well
,
all
these
marvelous
scientific
things
,
you
know
.
