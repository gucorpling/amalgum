ALL
FOUND
</head>
<p>
I
had
seen
her
but
once
before
,
and
that
was
at
the
Savoy
on
New
Year
's
Eve
.
She
had
been
with
her
party
at
one
table
,
and
I
with
mine
at
another
.
And
in
the
midst
of
the
reveling
I
had
chanced
to
look
up
and
into
one
of
the
great
mirrors
which
made
a
panel
upon
the
wall
.
There
I
had
seen
the
girl
,
sitting
back
in
her
chair
,
smiling
and
fresh
and
white-shouldered
,
in
a
dress
of
black
and
gold
,
her
fingers
about
the
stem
of
her
goblet
.
Not
talking
,
listening
,
rather
,
to
the
words
of
a
man
at
her
side
,
whose
eyes
were
watching
her
smiling
lips
somewhat
greedily
.
He
had
red
hair
,
I
remember
,
and
a
moustache
brushed
up
to
hide
a
long
upper
lip
.
And
,
as
I
looked
,
she
also
had
looked
up
,
and
our
eyes
had
met
.
There
and
then
I
had
raised
my
wine
and
toasted
her
--
her
of
the
looking-glass
.
The
smile
had
deepened
.
Then
she
had
raised
her
glass
,
and
drunk
to
me
in
return
.
That
was
all
.
And
when
Berry
had
leaned
across
the
table
and
asked
:
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Who
's
your
friend
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
wish
I
knew
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Pshaw
!
&quot;
said
my
brother-in-law
.
&quot;
I
say
it
deliberately
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
drank
to
a
thought
,
&quot;
said
I.
&quot;
Believe
me
.
&quot;
After
all
,
a
thought
is
a
reflection
.
And
now
here
she
was
,
sitting
in
the
grass
by
the
wayside
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
She
's
brown
,
is
n't
she
?
&quot;
said
I.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
As
a
berry
.
I
like
his
breeches
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
I
bowed
.
&quot;
Thank
you
.
And
for
you
,
'
picturesque
'
is
the
word
--
one
of
the
words
.
Shall
I
compare
you
to
a
summer
's
day
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
'd
rather
you
collected
that
cow
.
She
's
getting
too
near
the
river
for
my
liking
.
I
'm
looking
after
the
dears
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Are
you
?
&quot;
said
I.
&quot;
But-
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
But
what
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
'
Quis
custodiet
--
'
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
apple
she
threw
passed
over
my
shoulder
.
</p>
<p>
Mountains
and
valleys
,
swift
rivers
and
curling
roads
,
here
and
there
a
village
shining
in
the
hot
sun
,
and
once
in
a
while
a
castle
in
the
woods
,
white-walled
,
red-roofed
,
peaceful
enough
now
in
its
old
age
,
but
hinting
at
wild
oats
sown
and
reaped
when
it
was
young
.
Hinting
broadly
,
too
.
At
nights
shaken
with
the
flare
of
torches
and
the
clash
of
arms
,
at
oaths
and
laughter
and
the
tinkle
of
spurs
on
the
worn
steps
,
at
threats
and
bloodlettings
and
all
the
good
old
ways
,
now
dead
,
out
of
date
,
and
less
indebted
to
memory
than
imagination
.
And
then
at
galleries
with
creaking
floors
,
at
arras
and
the
rustle
of
a
dress
;
whisperings
,
too
,
and
the
proud
flash
of
eyes
,
hands
lily-white
,
whose
fingers
men
must
kiss
and
in
the
eyes
mirror
themselves
.
But
these
things
are
not
dead
.
Old-fashioned
wrath
is
over
--
gone
to
its
long
home
:
love
is
not
even
wrinkled
.
Yet
again
it
was
before
wrath
...
</p>
<p>
I
set
out
to
describe
the
province
of
Krain
,
and
now
I
have
strayed
from
the
highway
up
one
of
those
curling
roads
to
one
of
those
white
castles
,
only
to
lose
myself
in
the
thicket
of
Romance
beyond
.
Perhaps
it
does
not
matter
.
Anyway
,
it
was
on
the
slope
of
a
green
meadow
all
among
the
mountains
of
Krain
that
the
girl
was
sitting
,
herself
unminded
,
minding
her
cows
.
And
out
of
the
woods
above
her
a
round
,
white
tower
proclaimed
a
chateau
set
on
the
shoulder
of
a
hill
.
</p>
<p>
Her
dress
was
that
of
the
country
,
and
yet
,
perhaps
,
rather
such
as
Croatian
peasants
wear
.
All
white
linen
,
embroidered
ever
so
richly
,
cut
low
and
round
at
the
neck
,
and
with
the
skirt
falling
some
four
inches
below
her
knee
:
short
sleeves
,
a
small
,
white
apron
,
and
over
her
thick
,
fair
hair
a
bright
red
kerchief
.
But
her
stockings
were
of
white
silk
,
and
small
,
black
buckled
slippers
kept
the
little
feet
.
Clear
,
blue
eyes
hers
,
and
a
small
merry
mouth
,
and
a
skin
after
the
sun
's
own
heart
.
It
was
so
brown
--
such
an
even
,
delicate
brown
.
Brown
cheeks
and
temples
,
brown
arms
and
hands
,
brown
throat
.
Oh
,
very
picturesque
.
</p>
<p>
I
rounded
up
the
cow
errant
,
returned
to
my
lady
,
and
took
my
seat
by
her
side
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Thank
you
,
&quot;
she
said
.
&quot;
And
now
,
who
are
you
and
what
do
you
want
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
My
name
,
&quot;
said
I
,
&quot;
is
Norval
.
And
I
want
to
know
the
way
to
the
pageant-ground
,
and
when
does
your
scene
come
on
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
It
is
a
nice
dress
,
is
n't
it
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
She
rose
and
stood
smoothing
her
frock
and
apron
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Sweet
.
Only
you
ought
to
have
bare
brown
legs
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
My
dear
man
,
this
is
n't
the
Garden
of
Eden
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
No
?
Some
other
Paradise
,
I
suppose
.
Old
Omar
's
,
perhaps
.
Besides
,
I
forgot
.
Dolls
never
go
barefoot
,
do
they
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Dolls
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Yes
.
Are
n't
you
the
'
great
big
beautiful
doll
'
they
sing
of
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
She
threw
back
her
head
,
and
laughed
at
that
,
pleasedly
.
Then
she
began
to
sing
softly
:
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Oh
,
you
beautiful
doll
,
You
great
big
beautiful
doll
...
&quot;
</p>
<p>
We
finished
the
verse
together
,
the
cows
watching
us
with
big
eyes
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
think
we
're
rather
good
,
&quot;
said
I
,
when
it
was
over
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
know
we
're
both
mad
,
&quot;
said
she
.
&quot;
And
I
do
n't
feel
a
bit
like
singing
really
,
either
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Oh
,
great
and
beautiful
one
,
&quot;
said
I
,
&quot;
what
is
the
matter
?
Indicate
to
me
the
fly
that
dares
to
lurk
in
this
fair
bowl
of
ointment
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
She
looked
away
over
the
river
.
Then
:
</p>
<p>
&quot;
After
all
,
it
's
nothing
to
do
with
you
.
&quot;
