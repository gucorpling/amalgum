Make
Art
Work
Inspired
by
Autumn
</head>
<p>
A
crisp
,
sunny
,
day
in
fall
is
a
perfect
time
to
get
outdoors
and
take
in
nature
’s
beauty
.
For
those
able
to
take
an
actual
walk
,
being
outside
is
sure
to
awaken
your
senses
and
powers
of
observation
.
Once
inside
again
,
drawing
and
painting
what
you
have
seen
during
this
special
,
colorful
season
is
a
good
way
to
remember
your
day
.
If
your
art
abilities
or
confidence
are
minimal
,
not
to
worry
.
Doing
a
collage
of
pictures
of
things
you
might
encounter
on
a
fall
walk
is
just
as
creative
and
fun
.

Assemble
your
mark-making
art
materials
.
These
supplies
can
be
as
simple
as
a
box
of
crayons
,
#2
yellow
pencil
,
eraser
and
black
fine
line
marker
to
--
-sets
of
varied
types
of
marking
devices
.
Each
offers
ease
of
use
and
loads
of
fun
.
The
sky
’s
the
limit
!
Set
out
items
from
what
you
already
own
before
taking
a
trip
to
the
store
to
accumulate
new
ones
.

Gather
your
watercolor
materials
.
A
basic
8-color
set
of
dry
pigments
from
the
discount
store
will
work
,
but
for
richer
colors
that
are
smoother
to
apply
,
invest
in
a
nicer
set
.
Tube
paints
need
a
palette
to
hold
them
and
blank
spaces
for
mixing
.
Any
type
of
watercolor
will
work
.
The
final
step
will
be
to
add
color
,
as
much
or
as
little
as
you
want
.

If
you
have
used
heavy
watercolor
paper

do
n’t
hesitate
to
glue
on
small
items
such
as
pretty
,
colorful
leaves
,
petals
,
greenery
,
nut
or
seed
pods
.
For
heavier
items
you
might
need

with
time
to
let
it
dry
flat
,
or
a
hot
glue
gun
to
adhere
them
.
