I
interviewed
a
musician
named
John
Vanderslice
</ref>
,
and
off-the-record
he
talked
about
how
the
mainstream
music
press
has
almost
lost
all
influence
--

</hi>
;
those
kinds
of
magazines
.
He
said
that
whenever
he
did
some
small
blog
interview
his
web
site
jumped
up
in
hits
.
But
when
he
got
a
favorable
review
in
<hi rend="italic">
Rolling
Stone
</hi>
he
said
,
“
I
barely
heard
a
word
about
it
.
”

The
whole
music
industry
has
shifted
over
into
networking
sites
,
the
Internet
,
and
it
's
just
extremely
comparable
.
The
way
that
it
's
functioned
--
and
now
half
of
the
music
industry
is
made
up
of
this
kind
of
independent
record
label
--
that
's
what
's
happening
with
books
.
You
do
n't
have
mid
level
artists
recording
at
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony%20Records">
Sony
</ref>
,
and
you
do
n't
have
many
mid-list
authors
at
the
large
houses
.
The
little
presses
are
snapping
them
up
.
Of
course
,
the
large
houses
are
aware
of
this
,
in
the
same
way
that
the
large
record
labels
are
aware
of
it
,
and
I
think
that
they
're
gearing
themselves
to
either
take
them
over
or
have
imprints
address
it
.
Like
,
MTV
Books
now
has
Vice
books
.
They
do
like
cool
,
beautiful
books
,
and
they
've
given
Vice
a
real
platform
to
do
what
they
want
.

DS
:
Do
you
think
it
's
becoming
like
the
pharmaceutical
industry
?
There
the
really
big
drug
companies
do
n't
have
a
lot
of
drugs
in
the
pipeline
,
but
there
are
all
these
like
little
drug
companies
that
are
existing
for
one-or-two-drug
clinical
trials
,
and
the
big
drug
companies
are
watching
them
.
Once
they
have
a
seller
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big%20Pharma">
big
pharma
</ref>
goes
in
and
snaps
up
the
little
companies
.
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
JR

</hi>
That
's
exactly
what
it
is
.
I
do
n't
know
if
it
's
all
bad
,
though
.
When
a
big
press
buys
a
small
press
,
the
small
press
sort
of
loses
its
identity
.
But
it
does
n't
happen
right
away
.
Right
now
,
the
distribution
of
the
small
presses
is
so
piss
poor
for
the
most
part
,
that
it
's
just
very
hard
for
them
to
move
units
.
It
's
a
real
challenge
.
Most
of
them
do
n't
care
that
much
;
they
want
to
have
one
or
two
books
that
are
hits
,
but
to
sell
big
numbers
of
books
,
distribution
is
a
real
problem
.

DS
:
How
does
the
business
model
for
small
presses
make
up
for
a
lack
of
blockbuster
books
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
JR
:
</hi>
They
need
one
or
two
,
but
most
small
presses
that
do
n't
care
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
It
's
more
of
an
idealistic
enterprise
,
then
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
JR
:
</hi>
Yeah
,
if
it
's
a
non-profit
--
they
get
some
grants
.
For
the
functional
small
presses
--
let
's
say
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akashic%20Books">
Akashic
Books
</ref>
,
or
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archipelago%20Books">
Archipelago
Books
</ref>
--
which
are
very
small
but
I
believe
run
at
a
profit
,
the
business
model
is
to
put
all
these
books
out
there
,
and
if
one
or
two
of
them
hits
every
couple
of
years
,
they
're
fine
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft%20Skull%20Press">
Soft
Skull
</ref>
is
another
one
.
I
love
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacAdam%20Cage">
MacAdam
Cage
</ref>
;
I
do
n't
know
how
they
're
making
any
money
,
but
they
do
wonderful
books
.
They
've
got
to
have
a
few
titles
that
sell
a
lot
of
copies
.
One
press
who
used
to
have
this
theory
of
publishing
is
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint%20Martin's%20Press">
Saint
Martin

,
a
sort
of

shit
at
the
wall
and
see
what
sticks

phenomenon
.
