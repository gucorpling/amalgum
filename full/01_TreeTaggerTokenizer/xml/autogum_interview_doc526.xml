Jaslene
Gonzalez
</ref>
is
not
your
typical
model
.
She
rose
to
fame
after
winning
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America's%20Next%20Top%20Model,%20Cycle%208">
Cycle
8

</hi>
,
and
since
then
,
has
been
aggressively
tapping
into
the
fashion
industry
.
As
a
result
of
her
Latin
background
,
Gonzalez
has
been
successful
at
marketing
herself
both
in
the
English-speaking
and
Spanish-speaking
worlds
.
However
,
Gonzalez
is
much
much
more
–
a
fighter
,
a
humanitarian
,
and
a
good
Latin
granddaughter
.
</p>
<p>
Born
in
Chicago
to
a
Latina
mother
,
and
a
Puerto
Rican-born
father
,
Gonzalez
had
,
in
many
ways
,
a
typical
U.S.
Latino
experience
–
her
tight
knit
family
,
grandparents
,
and
spirituality
played
an
intrinsic
part
in
her
upbringing
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
went
to
an
all-girl
Catholic
school
and
grew
up
with
tons
of
family
...
.
.
My
family
was
very
close
knit
and
supportive
.
They
were
involved
in
my
life
everyday
.
So
there
was
so
much
joy
in
every
little
occasion
...
.
.
Every
Sunday
we
would
go
to
my
grandmother
's
house
where
we
[
the
family
]
would
hang
out
together
...
.
We
enjoyed
being
around
each
other
and
being
together
,
&quot;
states
Gonzalez
.
</p>
<p>
Her
grandfather
was
the
director
of
a
local
dance
group
,
Viva
La
Gente
,
which
Gonzalez
credits
with
impacting
her
life
positively
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
was
a
dancer
for
12
years
and
life
revolved
around
dancing
.
I
was
a
very
active
girl
,
and
was
always
involved
with
my
grandfather
's
dance
studio
.
The
whole
family
was
.
My
aunts
,
my
cousins
–
everyone
took
part
in
performances
and
were
involved
in
the
group
...
That
's
how
we
spent
our
summers
,
and
we
looked
forward
to
being
outside
,
dancing
salsa
,
hip
hop
,
merengue
,
&quot;
states
Gonzalez
.
Through
her
involvement
in
the
dance
studio
,
Gonzalez
's
horizon
was
broadened
significantly
,
and
her
humanitarian
streak
began
to
deepen
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
We
were
always
constantly
traveling
.
We
traveled
to
Mexico
to
poor
villages
where
we
gave
performances
to
give
back
to
the
community
,
&quot;
said
Gonzalez
.
</p>
<p>
Ironically
,
ANTM
gave
her
the
opportunity
to
overcome
her
own
difficulties
and
to
further
help
those
in
need
.
&quot;
I
went
in
there
,
without
knowing
that
I
was
in
an
abusive
relationship
.
They
were
the
ones
that
brought
that
up
to
me
...
they
felt
I
was
emotionally
destroyed
,
they
wanted
me
to
get
support
,
&quot;
commented
Gonzalez
.
While
the
ANTM
staff
was
supportive
,
she
also
credits
her
life
long
dream
for
helping
her
get
out
of
the
abusive
relationship
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Having
a
dream
and
having
a
goal
in
life
,
is
the
most
important
thing
I
did
in
my
life
.
Because
of
that
I
maneuvered
my
way
to
that
dream
.
I
knew
I
was
better
than
that
,
I
wanted
to
be
happier
,
”
stated
Gonzalez
.
</p>
<p>
Soon
after
winning
ANTM
,
Gonzalez
became
a
spokesperson
for
Liz
Claiborne
and
the
National
Domestic
Violence
Hotline
,
and
began
traveling
the
country
reaching
out
to
women
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
We
had
several
meetings
,
and
they
asked
me
to
be
a
spokesperson
.
I
was
so
happy
and
blessed
to
help
women
,
to
have
that
title
.
It
's
something
I
want
to
do
,
besides
modelling
...
.
I
enjoy
sharing
my
personal
experiences
because
I
can
educate
them
,
but
I
can
also
save
someone
's
life
.
It
's
something
precious
,
it
's
a
gift
,
&quot;
stated
Gonzalez
.
</p>
<p>
Abuse
is
not
the
only
obstacle
Jaslene
has
had
to
face
.
Growing
up
Latina
had
its
own
set
of
difficulties
.
&quot;
Being
a
minority
is
a
challenge
no
matter
what
,
&quot;
states
Gonzalez
.
</p>
<p>
However
,
Gonzalez
also
states
that
being
a
Latina
has
many
positive
aspects
in
regards
to
her
profession
.
&quot;
As
a
Latina
,
you
have
the
advantage
of
being
a
Latina
.
Not
only
do
you
have
this
corporate
job
,
but
you
can
relate
to
many
groups
as
a
person
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
When
asked
if
the
fashion
industry
forces
Latina
models
to
change
certain
aspects
about
themselves
,
she
remarks
that
she
focuses
on
always
staying
true
to
herself
.
&quot;
Modeling
is
a
difficult
job
because
of
what
you
go
through
.
80
%
of
the
time
it
's
a
no
...
When
I
go
in
,
I
go
in
like
me
,
I
do
n't
have
to
change
anything
.
Any
time
I
get
a
chance
to
show
who
I
am
,
I
do
.
I
am
a
Spanish
girl
,
trying
to
pursue
my
dreams
.
I
try
to
be
the
best
I
can
be
,
&quot;
remarked
Gonzalez
.
</p>
<p>
It
is
that
same
confidence
and
will
to
succeed
that
she
seems
to
appreciate
in
other
woman
.
&quot;
I
find
women
beautiful
.
I
find
a
girl
with
no
makeup
,
not
worrying
about
her
style
and
appearance
,
I
find
that
sexy
.
I
find
confidence
beautiful
...
Its
so
simple
.
It
's
being
natural
and
confident
,
&quot;
said
Gonzalez
.
</p>
<p>
As
a
role
model
,
she
has
two
key
pieces
advice
that
she
offers
women
:
nurture
your
mind
with
positive
thoughts
,
and
identify
and
foster
the
principles
in
life
you
value
.
</p>
<p>
It
is
not
surprising
to
see
why
Gonzalez
's
family
is
proud
of
her
.
&quot;
My
family
is
so
funny
.
They
are
so
happy
.
I
've
never
seen
them
so
full
of
life
.
My
mom
acts
like
she
won
.
My
grandmother
screams
'
<ref target="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/flaca">
mi
flaca
</ref>
'
every
time
she
sees
me
.
They
are
so
proud
.
Especially
my
grandparents
.
I
was
practically
raised
by
them
.
To
see
them
see
you
so
happy
and
successful
,
there
could
n't
be
a
better
feeling
,
&quot;
said
Gonzalez
.
</p>
<p>
She
adds
that
her
grandparents
would
be
extremely
happy
if
she
appeared
on
<hi rend="italic">
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristina%20Saralegui">
Cristina
</ref>
</hi>
,
the
Spanish-language
talk
show
whose
host
is
referred
to
as
&quot;
the
Spanish
Oprah
Winfrey
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
In
the
coming
years
,
Gonzalez
plans
to
continue
on
the
path
she
is
on
.
She
wants
to
continue
gracing
magazine
covers
,
as
well
as
dedicating
herself
to
helping
young
teens
develop
self
growth
and
esteem
.
&quot;
Every
time
I
wake
up
,
God
gives
me
the
opportunity
to
be
a
better
me
...
Life
gets
better
as
it
goes
by
.
