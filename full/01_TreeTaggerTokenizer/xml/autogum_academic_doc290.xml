On
the
basis
of
wearable

,
web
services
,
and
linked
open
data
,
this
study
’s
intelligent
travel
cloud
information
monitor
and
recommendation
multi-agent
system
explored
LOD
access
technologies
for

by
integrating
the
aforementioned
UAI
technology
links
for
increasing
the
accuracy
,
authenticity
,
and
integrity
of
intelligent
tourism
information
,
effectively
adding
value
to
the
quality
of
cloud

through
the
support

This
paper
extends
the
application
scope
of
Dr.
What-Info
and
reached
the
ultimate
goal
of
the
research
—
the
construction
of
an
intelligent
mobile
information
monitoring
and
recommendation
multi-agent
system
with
friendly
interfaces
for
autonomously
providing
corresponding
cloud
information
.
The
results
and
conclusions
of
the
system
’s
practical
exploration
are
listed
as
follows
:

This
study
established
three-tier
address-based
,
UAI-based
LOD
access
technology
by
actively
developing
the
proposed
system
with
friendly
interfaces
that
assist
users
in
quickly
,
accurately
,
and
effectively
obtaining
relevant
and
timely
useful
links
and
open
information
.

With
the
operational
support
of
CEOntoIAS
,
this
study
established
a
cloud
interactive
paradigm
supported
by
web
services
through
the
corresponding
query
semantic
content
with
the
CURRL
in
JSON
format
.
With
the
support
of
three-stage
intelligent
decision-making
,
such
as
OntoDMA
,
OntoCBRA
,
and
OntoIAS
,
the
proposed
system
APPs
autonomously
and
effectively
added
value
to
the
quality
of
the
monitoring
and
to
the
recommendation
of
intelligent
tourism
information
.
Therefore
,
this
study
is
unique
and
different
from
other
information
agents
found
in
the
literature
.

Furthermore
,
regarding
the
evaluation
results
mentioned
above
,
the
mobile
APP
,
as
proposed
in
this
system
,
can
be
easily
solved
,
which
is
completely
in
line
with
the
original
intention
of
the
research
—
timely
,
appropriate
,
and
free
,
as
well
as
providing
the
latest
and
complete
mobile
information
services
.
In
addition
,
based
on
Tu
’s
comparison
table
for
LBSs
,
the
proposed
system
receives
an
overall
function
up-to-standard
rate
of
87.5
%
,
and
such
recommendations
provide
users
with
high
information
correctness
and
user
satisfaction
.
The
proposed
system
architecture
not
only
uses
the
back-end
database
more
efficiently
;
it
also
provides
users
with
more
all-inclusive
LBS
.
The
satisfaction
score
of
the
usability
of
the
proposed
system
and
the
ease
of
using
the
interface
design
was
84
points
in
terms
of
Quesenbery
’s
5Es
and
Nielsen
ratings
,
which
indicated
that
this
system
APP
must
be
improved
in
two
aspects
:
error
tolerance
and
help
documents
.
The
verification
results
of
the
interface
design
showed
that
the
human
–
machine
interface
of
our
proposed
system
can
meet
important
design
preferences
and
provide
approximate
optimal
balance
with
average
<hi rend="italic">
BI
</hi>
=
0.008430
.
Finally
,
although
the
interface
appearance
is
more
convenient
,
the
operation
and
fluency
are
somewhat
insufficient
,
and
should
be
enhanced
.
Information
correctness
was
graded
as
being
high
,
and
the
graphical
menu
design
of
the
system
APP
was
easy
for
users
to
use
,
which
were
obvious
outcomes
.
Although
there
is
plenty
of
room
for
improvement
in
experience
and
in
more
travel-related
agents
,
such
as
instant
traffic
assistance
agents
and
trip
planning
agents
,
the
feasibility
of
the
proposed
service
architecture
has
been
proven
.
