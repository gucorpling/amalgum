I

insist

</hi>
I
think
Hillary

My
reasoning
is
completely
ridiculous
:
I
distrust
men
who
are
that
skinny
.
You
and
I
are
both
lean
,
but
if
I
told
you
,
you
've
got
to
go
take
this
stump
out
to
the
backyard
,
and
I
gave
you
an
axe
,
I
'd
be
pretty
confident
you
could
do
it
.
Obama
does
n't
look
like
he
could
do
it
to
me

How

<hi rend="bold">

</hi>
How
would
I

die

I
do
n't
know

Most
men
stop
being
afraid
of
dying
.
Then
,
when
they
have
kids
,
suddenly
they
're
afraid
of
it
again
.
But
not
for
themselves
,
for
their
kids
.
So
I
do
n't
really
care
,
just
as
long
as
my
kids
are
provided
for

You

most

pre-parenthood

lose

their

I

Were
you
ever
afraid

<p>
<hi rend="bold">
JR
:
</hi>
Yeah
,
I
was
afraid
of
it
in
my
early
twenties
;
and
as
a
kid
,
I
just
remember
being
really
,
really
afraid
of
dying
,
and
it
being
incomprehensible
and
depressing
.

Did
that

</hi>
Well
,
my
daughter
,
too
.
We
had
a
lizard
die
,
and
that
was
a
big
deal
.
She
was
asking
these
questions
,
&quot;
Is
it
gonna
be
another
lizard
?
&quot;
You
know
,
she
has
all
of
these

<p>
<hi rend="bold">

&quot;
Where
does
it
go
?

</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
JR
:
</hi>
Yeah
,
she
has
a
lot
of
really
valid
questions
.
I
do
n't
know
;
I
also
do
n't
feel
that
we
understand
everything
.
For
all
the
people
who
praise
Shakespeare
,
Shakespeare
is
still
really
quite
extraordinary
.
The
sense
that
I
have
of
Shakespeare
is
he
does
understand
that
on
some
level
,
we
as
human
beings
,
our
bodies
,
are
like
the
top
of
an
iceberg
that
you
can
see
.
Then
there
's
all
this
other
stuff
under
the
water
that
you
ca
n't
see
.
That
's
my
feeling
about
it
.
I
'm
not
that
afraid
of
it
anymore
because
I
feel
like
there
's
all
this
other
stuff
under
the
water
.
But
it
does
worry
me
