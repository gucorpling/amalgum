$50k
Debt
,
Bills
are
met
with
current
income
but
ca
n't
afford
payments
.

<sp who="#HelpFinancially">

So
I
just
Graduated
from
a
low
end
university
with
a
degree
in
Health
Sciences
.
I
'm
currently
making
roughly
$
16000
a
year
at
a
job
I
love
and
do
n't
want
to
leave
.
I
could
move
up
to
management
and
make
$
25000
a
year
but
it
's
a
bit
competitive
,
take
at
least
another
3
months
,
and
the
position
would
not
be
as
good
for
mental
health
.
Even
if
I
do
not
move
up
I
will
get
a
pay
bump
at
the
same
time
and
make
an
extra
40-70
a
month
.
In
addition
,
I
'm
working
hard
on
Binary
Options
and
think
that
I
could
eventually
make
a
good
living
in
a
couple
years
time
as
I
've
only
been
successful
with
Demo
using
small
amounts
for
the
last
2
months
.
I
've
currently
got
0
money
in
savings
.
I
'm
trying
to
stick
to
a
diet
plan
that
I
've
found
<hi rend="bold">
finally
</hi>
works
for
me
as
I
've
been
gaining
weight
for
years
(
340
lbs
)
and
after
trying
everything
from
not
eating
anything
,
to
400
calories
a
day
,
to
2000
calories
a
day
and
everything
in
between
(
All
of
which
caused
weight
gain
)
.
It
's
a
pure
protien
diet
with
no
carbs
and
minimal
fat
.
This
costs
me
$
300
a
month
sticking
to
cheap
chicken
and
rent
is
$
550
including
utilities
.
I
also
have
car
insurance
at
$
150
a
month
and
I
've
dropped
my
phone
bill
in
favor
of
google
voice
.
Health
Insurance
is
$
70
a
month
with
a
$12k
deductable
.
So
,
total
expenses
come
to
$
1070
a
month
and
I
make
just
barely
over
$
1350
.
Now
,
I
've
got
slightly
less
than
$32k
of
student
loan
debt
(
including
interest
)
which
I
plan
to
start
paying
as
soon
as
possible
at
$
350
a
month
to
finish
in
10
years
.
This
would
max
out
my
current
earnings
and
leave
me
nothing
for
emergencies
or
anything
else
.
In
addition
I
've
got
4
credit
cards
that
have
moved
to
debt
collectors
which
total
another
$
12500
.
Discover
at
$
800
,
Chase
at
$
2700
and
$
6000
,
and
PayPal
at
$
3000
.
The
vast
majority
of
this
was
spent
on
tuition
and
food
.
Most
of
my
assets
have
been
liquidated
to
make
rent
and
I
'm
down
to
a
$5k
car
,
Xbox
One
S
(
My
only
entertainment
)
,
a
couple
monitors
$
100
monitors
,
and
a
Desktop
worth
maybe
$
350
...
Maybe
.
Reading
through
this
subreddit
I
see
a
lot
of
advice
about
not
talking
to
the
credit
card
companies
or
debt
collectors
until
you
can
make
an
offer
of
30
%
lump
sum
.
I
ca
n't
put
together
$15k
anytime
soon
.
As
of
today
I
have
n't
talked
to
anyone
who
is
remotely
assiated
with
the
debt
of
$50k
.
I
've
decided
to
ask
for
more
personalized
advise
as
my
case
is
a
bit
different
and
I
recently
read
a
topic
here
about
court
.
I
do
n't
want
to
go
to
court
over
this
and
it
's
already
been
over
a
year
since
I
've
stopped
paying
my
debts
.
What
would
be
the
best
course
of
action
?
I
do
n't
plan
to
use
credit
much
in
the
forseeable
future
.
Would
the
Debt
Collectors
come
after
me
if
I
continue
to
not
communicate
?
What
's
the
worst
case
scenario
here
?
I
think
getting
a
better
paying
job
now
would
help
tremendously
,
and
I
'm
sure
I
could
get
a
$20k
job
now
that
I
've
got
my
degree
.
However
,
my
current
job
is
amazing
for
introverts
like
myself
and
for
once
the
staff
is
n't
trying
to
stomp
eachother
into
the
ground
in
order
to
get
by
.

It
is
sad
story
considering
you
are
indebted
for
education
.
as
another
member
has
mentioned
you
can
call
them
and
since
it
was
federal
you
may
get
income
based
repayment
which
is
helpful
.
I
have
had
the
same
situation
a
bit
worst
because
I
could
n't
even
get
the
job
to
survive
so
I
can
understand
the
moral
pressure
of
such
condition
.
My
suggestion
might
seem
a
bit
off
topic
but
it
helped
me
a
lot
.
I
realized
the
pressures
paralyzed
me
and
do
n't
allow
me
to
concentrate
(
How
could
I
while
my
landlord
set
a
deadline
to
leave
the
home
)
I
told
myself
a
week
of
thinking
and
planing
is
better
than
seeking
for
a
job
without
result
.
I
assumed
that
everything
is
fine
and
Someone
pays
me
to
plan
his
her
life
.
this
was
the
first
step
because
I
could
n't
plan
for
myself
because
I
was
trying
to
justify
defects
or
make
exception
about
myself
so
I
imagined
the
plan
is
written
for
someone
else
.
</p>
<p>
What
was
the
plan
?
The
perspective
and
the
solutions
with
exact
timeline
.
I
made
promises
to
everyone
based
on
this
timeline
.
</p>
<p>
For
example
I
told
to
my
landlord
exactly
when
and
how
much
will
he
receive
and
He
accepted
my
proposal
.
</p>
<p>
Just
be
realistic
and
rational
in
your
planning
.
for
example
you
mentioned
about
Binary
options
and
basically
online
trading
.
This
is
my
interest
as
well
but
I
did
n't
relied
on
it
on
my
plan
because
I
had
n't
seen
anyone
makes
living
with
binary
options
.
Yes
there
were
lots
of
bragging
here
and
there
on
forums
or
YouTube
but
my
overall
result
was
negative
after
2
years
of
trading
.
So
how
did
I
place
it
in
my
plan
?
I
searched
for
real
sample
of
successful
BO
trader
first
with
proper
proofs
.
I
found
but
the
problem
was
the
tuition
fee
for
the
courses
.
as
a
result
saving
money
for
education
took
place
in
my
plan
and
so
on
.
</p>
<p>
I
think
I
wanted
to
say
plan
and
prioritize
your
activities
and
I
promise
it
gonna
work
.
</p>
<p>
Wish
you
the
best
</p>
