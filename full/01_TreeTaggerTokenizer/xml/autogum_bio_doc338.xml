In
1678
Zumba
accepted
a
peace
treaty
offered
by
the
Portuguese
Governor
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pernambuco">
Pernambuco
</ref>
,
which
required
that
the
Palmarinos
relocate
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cucaú_Valley">
Cucaú
Valley
</ref>
.
The
treaty
was
challenged
by
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zumbi">
Zumbi
</ref>
,
one
of
Ganga
Zumba
's
nephews
,
who
led
a
revolt
against
him
.
In
the
confusion
that
followed
,
Ganga
Zumba
was
poisoned
,
most
likely
by
one
of
his
own
relatives
for
entering
into
a
treaty
with
the
Portuguese
.
And
many
of
his
followers
who
had
moved
to
the
Cucaú
Valley
were
re-enslaved
by
the
Portuguese
.
Resistance
to
the
Portuguese
then
continued
under
Zumbi
.

The

film
<hi rend="italic">

Ganga

</ref>
</hi>
was
made
in
1963
but
was
not
released
until
1972
because
there
was
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964_Brazilian_coup_d'état">
military
coup
in
Brazil

,
and
films
about

,
even
those
taking
place
in
the
17th
century
,
were
considered
politically
dangerous

The

is
based
on
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/João_Felício_dos_Santo">

and
focuses
on
a

The
