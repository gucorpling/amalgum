Who
was
that
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Amanda
Carter
:
</hi>
It
was
Brendan
Stroud
at
the
time
,
who
was
coaching
the
Dandenong
Rangers
women
's
team
.
I
just
happened
to
cross
him
at
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northland%20Shopping%20Centre">
Northland
</ref>
,
the
shopping
centre
.
And
he
said
:
&quot;
Why
do
n't
you
come
out
and
play
for
Dandenong
?
&quot;
I
was
looking
fit
and
everything
else
,
so
I
thought
&quot;
Okay
,
I
'll
come
out
to
one
training
session
and
see
how
I
go
.
&quot;
And
from
there
played
in
the
2008
Women
's
National
League
.
And
was
voted
MVP
â€”
most
valuable
one-pointer
,
and
all-star
five
.
So
at
that
point
,
in
2009
,
after
that
,
they
went
to
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Beijing">
Beijing
</ref>
,
so
I
watched
Beijing
from
home
,
because
I
was
n't
involved
in
the
Gliders
program
.
I
just
really
came
back
to
do
women
's
league
.
In
2009
,
I
received
some
phone
calls
from
the
coaching
staff
,
John
Trescari
,
who
was
coaching
the
Gliders
at
that
point
,
who
invited
me
back
in
to
the
Glider
's
training
program
,
about
February
,
and
I
said
I
would
come
to
the
one
camp
and
see
how
I
went
.
And
went
to
the
one
camp
and
then
got
selected
to
go
to
Canada
.
So
,
since
then
I
've
been
back
in
the
team
.

Back
in
the
Gliders
again
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Amanda
Carter
:
</hi>
Yeah
!
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
(
(
</hi>
<hi rend="bold">
WN
</hi>
<hi rend="bold">
)
)
</hi>
And
of
course
you
got
selected
for
2012
...
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Amanda
Carter
:
</hi>
Yes
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
(
(

</hi>

)
</hi>
My
recollection
is
that
you
were
n't
on
the
court
a
great
deal
,
but
there
was
a
game
when
you
scored
five
points
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Amanda
Carter
:
</hi>
Yeah
!
Within
a
couple
of
minutes
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
(
(
</hi>
<hi rend="bold">
WN
</hi>
<hi rend="bold">
)
)
</hi>
That
was
against
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Mexico">
Mexico
</ref>
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Amanda
Carter
:
</hi>
Yes
.
That
was
a
good
win
,
actually
,
that
one
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
(
(
</hi>
<hi rend="bold">
WN
</hi>
<hi rend="bold">
)
)
</hi>
The
strange
thing
was
that
afterwards
the
Mexicans
were
celebrating
like
they
'd
won
...
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Amanda
Carter
:
</hi>
Oh
yeah
!
It
was
very
strange
.
I
guess
one
of
the
things
that
,
like
,
I
am
in
some
ways
the
backup
one
pointer
in
some
ways
,
but
what
gives
me
my
one
point
classification
,
because
I
used
to
be
a
two
,
is
my
arm
,
the
damage
I
received
,
and
the
quadriplegia
from
the
transverse
myelitis
.
So
despite
the
fact
I
probably
shoot
more
accurately
that
most
people
in
the
team
,
because
I
've
just
had
to
learn
to
shoot
,
it
also
slows
me
down
;
I
'm
not
the
quickest
in
the
team
for
getting
up
and
down
the
court
,
because
of
having
trouble
with
grip
and
stuff
on
my
right
hand
to
push
.
I
push
reasonably
quick
!
Most
people
would
say
I
'm
reasonably
quick
,
but
when
you
at
me
in
comparison
to
,
say
,
the
other
eleven
girls
in
the
team
,
I
am
not
as
quick
.
</p>

)
</hi>
The
speed
at
which
things
move
is
quite
astonishing
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Amanda
Carter
:
</hi>
Yeah
,
and
my
ability
is
more
in
knowing
where
people
want
to
get
to
,
so
I
aim
to
get
there
first
by
taking
the
most
direct
route
.
