Rather
than
striving
for
the
big
hit

protect
your
capital
first

aggressive
risk

profits

Before
asking
,
&quot;
what
kind
of
profit
can
I
make
?
&quot;
,
ask
first
,
&quot;
what
potential
loss
can
I
suffer
?
&quot;
This
is
astute
stock-trading
risk
management
.

A
storekeeper
takes
a
risk
every
time
s/he
stocks
new
merchandise
.
If
it
does
not
sell
,
s/he
will
lose
money
.
A
smart
businessperson
takes
only
risks
that
will
not
put
him/her
out
of
business
,
even
if
s/he
makes
several
mistakes
in
a
row

Define
your
risk
.
As
a
stock
trader
,
you
are
in
the
business
of
trading
.
You
need
to
define
your
business
risk
,
the
most
money
you
are
willing
to
risk
(
or
lose
)
on
any
single
trade
.
Here
are
some
basic
risk-management
principles
:

There
is
no
standard
amount
of
money
to
risk
,
just
like
there
is
no
standard
business
.
Your
acceptable
risk
level
depends
on
the
size
of
your
trading
account
,
your
trading
method
and
your
tolerance
for
&quot;
pain
.

Beware
of
emotional
trading
.
Trading
can
be
so
exciting
that
it
leads
to
emotional
highs
and
lows
in
rapid
succession
.
It
rarely
happens
that
a
trader
will
make
serious
money
while
riding
an
emotional
roller
coaster
.
Emotional
trading
is
the
enemy
of
success
.
Fear
and
greed
can
undo
a
stock
trader
.
A
real
professional
does
not
get
too
ecstatic
or
too
depressed
about
specific
wins
or
losses
.
This
is
a
good
mental
state
for
stock
trading
and
for
life
in
general
.
If
you
're
thinking
about
a
past
opportunity
,
you
'll
miss
the
next
one
to
come
your
way
.

Focus
on
being
the
best
.
The
goal
of
a
successful
professional
in
any
field
is
to
reach
his/her
personal
best
.
You
need
to
concentrate
on
trading
right
.
Each
trade
has
to
be
handled
like
a
surgical
procedure
:
seriously
,
soberly
,
without
sloppiness
or
shortcuts
.
This
is
a
stock-trading
risk-management
plan
.
A
loser
cannot
cut
his
losses
quickly
.
When
a
trade
starts
going
sour
,
the
loser
may
hope
and
hang
on
while
the
losses
pile
up
;
or
he
may
sell
his
position
just
before
the
market
comes
roaring
back
.

Trends
emerge
because
most
losers
are
alike
.
They
act
on
their
gut
feelings
instead
of
using
their
heads
.
Personal
emotions
do
n't
follow
cultural
backgrounds
or
educational
levels
.
</item>
<item>
Emotional
traders
go
into
risky
gambles
to
avoid
taking
certain
losses
.
It
is
human
nature
to
take
profits
quickly
and
postpone
taking
losses
.
Emotional
trading
destroys
otherwise
intelligent
traders
.
Good
money
management
and
timing
techniques
will
keep
them
out
of
the
hole
.
Losing
traders
look
for
a
&quot;
sure
thing
&quot;
,
hang
on
out
of
hope
,
and
irrationally
refuse
to
accept
small
losses
.
