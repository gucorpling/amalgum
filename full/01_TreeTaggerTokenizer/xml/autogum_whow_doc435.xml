Be
careful
with
colour
.
Dark
colours
will
definitely
make
your
room
appear
smaller
.
Light
neutral
colours
will
give
off
the
greatest
appearance
of
space
in
your
apartment
office
,
but
at
the
same
time
,
they
can
get
boring
.
However
,
there
are
many
fun

colours

out
there
,
and
you
can
always
get
them
in
a
lighter
shade
.

Use
large
decorations
A
lot
of
small
decorations
everywhere
can
give
the
appearance
of
clutter
.
A
few
larger
decorations
,
such
as
a
large
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Make_a_Wall_Poster_Using_Rasterbator">
wall
poster
</ref>
,
can
create
wonderful
focal
points
for
your
apartment
office
while
opening
the
room
up
.

Keep
your
desk
clean
</ref>
.
Whatever
size
desk
you
need
for
your
apartment
,
keep
it
clean
.
Do
n’t
add
decorative
clutter
to
it
if
you
’re
goal
is
to
open
up
space
.
If
you
have
a
computer
,
try

many
wires
as
you
can

Use
smart
apartment
storage
.
Do
n’t
just
leave
everything
out
in
your
apartment
office
.
Look
into
trendy
storage
solutions
to
keep
all
your
apartment
clutter
in
a
small
space
and
out
of
the
way
.
If
you
have
stuff
that
you
traditionally
keep
in
your
apartment
office
but
hardly
ever
use
,
consider
storing
it
elsewhere
in
your
apartment
.

Use
smart
layout
.
If
you
have
a
smaller
apartment
office
,
do
not
put
your
desk
in
the
centre
of
the
room
.
Keep
it
in
the
corner
,
so
that
you
have
as
much
open
space
as
possible
.

Do
n’t
buy
large
plants
.
A
small
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Grow_a_Cactus">
cactus
</ref>
or
other
plant
can
give
any
room
more
life
without
taking
up
lots
of
space
in
your
apartment
.
Think
of
strategic
ways
to
place
it
where
it
’ll
give
the
greatest
illusion
of
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Make_a_Small_Room_Seem_Larger">
lots
of
space
</ref>
(
as
the
only
decoration
in
the
centre
of
a
large
table
,
for
example
)
.
The
trick
is
to
contrast
one
small
item
with
something
much
larger
.

Only
keep
what
you
need
.
Often
apartment
offices
do
n’t
have
a
lot
of
space
,
even
while
the
rest
of
the
apartment
does
.
If
this
is
the
case
,
you
might
put
a
few
office
items
in
other
places
around
your
apartment
.
If
you
do
n’t
print
a
lot
but
you
own
a
printer
,
there
’s
might
be
a
place
somewhere
else
in
your
apartment
that
’s
out
of
the
way
.
