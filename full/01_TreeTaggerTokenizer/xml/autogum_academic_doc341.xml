Proof
of
Concept
and
Validation
</head>
<p>
In
order
to
test
the
capabilities
of
the
system
,
it
has
been
subjected
to
several
tests
.
First
,
the
system
has
been
tested
with
a
large
number
of
incoming
threats
,
being
capable
of
analyzing
each
one
in
an
average
time
of
0.01
s.
Then
,
the
system
was
also
tested
with
threats
from
more
than
one
source
of
information
,
some
with
a
high
degree
of
confidence
and
others
with
a
very
low
level
.
At
the
end
of
each
analysis
,
a
JSON
document
with
the
results
is
generated
.
An
example
of
this
kind
of
document
is
shown
in
<figure>
Figure
9
</figure>
.
</p>
<p>
Here
,
126
threats
were
analyzed
,
which
came
from
sources
of
information
with
a
high
level
of
confidence
,
and
therefore
,
all
of
them
were
influenced
by
the
confidence
assigned
to
that
source
.
As
can
be
seen
,
there
is
a
considerable
difference
between
the
general
risk
for
Spain
(
riskSpain
)
and
the
risk
when
taking
into
account
the
history
of
attacks
,
that
is
,
the
memory
of
the
system
related
to
how
old
the
attacks
are
by
applying
equation
5
(
riskSpainWithMemory
)
.
If
this
situation
were
maintained
over
time
,
the
risk
with
memory
would
end
up
converging
with
the
instantaneous
risk
.
In
addition
,
the
risk
within
an
AC
,
i.
e.
,
Andalusia
,
is
calculated
based
on
48
threats
,
both
with
and
without
memory
.
</p>
<p>
In
order
to
simplify
the
visualization
of
the
data
produced
by
the
system
,
a
graphical
interface
was
implemented
by
using
Java
’s
library
JFreeChart
.
<figure>
Figure
10
</figure>
shows
the
history
of
the
general
risk
in
Spain
,
both
with
memory
and
the
instantaneous
one
.
</p>
<p>
As
can
be
observed
,
the
risk
with
memory
tends
to
follow
the
trend
of
the
instantaneous
,
but
if
the
variations
are
very
fast
,
it
tends
to
represent
the
average
of
these
.
The
strongest
peaks
of
memory
risk
are
due
to
the
fact
that
certain
measurements
are
composed
of
a
large
number
of
threats
and
,
therefore
,
great
representativeness
.
The
history
described
in
<figure>
Figure
10
</figure>
is
composed
of
36
risk
measurements
,
each
generated
with
a
range
of
threat
events
from
100
to
500
.
Each
threat
event
has
been
compounded
by
its
geographic
location
,
IP
,
a
timestamp
,
severity
index
,
the
event
confidence
,
name
of
the
detected
threat
,
etc.
The
threats
simulated
were
balanced
in
terms
of
impact
level
and
confidence
in
the
source
of
information
.
This
is
why
the
instantaneous
trend
,
represented
by
the
red
line
,
has
such
pronounced
peaks
.
</p>
<p>
The
system
also
provides
the
analyst
with
a
detailed
asset
histogram
,
which
can
be
grouped
by
a
specific
AC
,
as
<figure>
Figure
11
</figure>
shows
.
Finally
,
the
risk
in
real-time
can
also
be
observed
.
In
this
sense
,
<figure>

shows
the
risk
in
real-time
as
measurements
are
produced
.
