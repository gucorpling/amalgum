Register
a
Boat
</head>
<p>
If
you
’re
planning
to
get
a
motorized
boat
,
make
sure
you
follow
the
law
regarding
registration
.
Just
like
cars
,
states
require
boats
to
be
registered
.
Registration
lets
the
authorities
know
who
’s
operating
boats
legally
on
a
given
waterway
.
States
vary
when
it
comes
to
boat
registration
rules
and
fees
.
Before
you
go
out
on
the
water
in
your
boat
,
check
with
the
appropriate
state
agency
to
ensure
you
’re
in
compliance
.

agency
in-person

the
agency
’s
website

If
you
just
bought
a
brand
new
boat
,
the
dealer
most
likely
will
give
you
a
boat
registration
application
and
tell
you
where
to
send
it
.
</item>
<item>
You
can
also
search
online
to
find
out
which
agency
in
the

where
you
park
your

Fill
out
the
boat
registration
application
.
Boat
registration
applications
are
detailed
and
ask
for
information
such
as
your
name
and
address
.
You
have
to
state
truthfully
that
you
are
the
owner
of
the
boat
and
attach
proof
of
ownership
.
You
also
must
provide
details
about
what
the
boat
is
made
out
of
as
well
as
the
hull
identification
number
.

Gather
your
proof
of
ownership
documents
.
You
’re
required
to
show
proof
of
ownership
of
your
boat
.
A
boat
title
in
your
name
is
the
best
proof
of
ownership
,
but
if
you
do
n’t
have
one
,
a
bill
of
sale
,
which
is
basically
a
sales
receipt
for
your
boat
,
works
fine
.
If
you
bought
the
boat
and
have
n’t
yet
paid
off
the
owner
,
you
can
provide
your
sales
contract
as
proof
of
ownership
.

cases
,

can
expect
to
pay
less
than
$
100
for
the
boat
registration
sticker
and
documents

<item>
While
waiting
for
your
registration
,
your
state
agency
or
boat
dealer
can
issue
you
a
temporary
registration
which
allows
you
to
park
and
use
your
boat
.
</item>
<item>
You
do
n’t
need
to
register
a
non-motorized
boat
like
a
canoe
or
kayak
.
You
may
,
however
,
need
a
permit
to
use
your
non-motorized
boat
,
depending
on
park
or
waterway
regulations
.
</item>
<item>
Remember
,
as
long
as
your
boat
is
properly
registered
in
the
state
where
you
normally
keep
it
,
you
do
n’t
need
to
register
your
boat
in
another
state
if
you
’re
just
visiting
.
Most
states
allow
visitors
to
bring
and
use
their
boats
for
a
limited
amount
of
time
without
registration
.
