EXPLANATORY
</head>
<p>
IN
this
book
a
number
of
dialects
are
used
,
to
wit
:
the
Missouri
negro
dialect
;
the
extremest
form
of
the
backwoods
Southwestern
dialect
;
the
ordinary
“
Pike
County
”
dialect
;
and
four
modified
varieties
of
this
last
.
The
shadings
have
not
been
done
in
a
haphazard
fashion
,
or
by
guesswork
;
but
painstakingly
,
and
with
the
trustworthy
guidance
and
support
of
personal
familiarity
with
these
several
forms
of
speech
.
</p>
<p>
I
make
this
explanation
for
the
reason
that
without
it
many
readers
would
suppose
that
all
these
characters
were
trying
to
talk
alike
and
not
succeeding
.

CHAPTER
I.
</p>
<p>
YOU
do
n't
know
about
me
without
you
have
read
a
book
by
the
name
of
The
Adventures
of
Tom
Sawyer
;
but
that
ai
n't
no
matter
.
That
book
was
made
by
Mr.
Mark
Twain
,
and
he
told
the
truth
,
mainly
.
There
was
things
which
he
stretched
,
but
mainly
he
told
the
truth
.
That
is
nothing
.
I
never
seen
anybody
but
lied
one
time
or
another
,
without
it
was
Aunt
Polly
,
or
the
widow
,
or
maybe
Mary
.
Aunt
Polly
--
Tom
's
Aunt
Polly
,
she
is
--
and
Mary
,
and
the
Widow
Douglas
is
all
told
about
in
that
book
,
which
is
mostly
a
true
book
,
with
some
stretchers
,
as
I
said
before
.
</p>
<p>
Now
the
way
that
the
book
winds
up
is
this
:
Tom
and
me
found
the
money
that
the
robbers
hid
in
the
cave
,
and
it
made
us
rich
.
We
got
six
thousand
dollars
apiece
--
all
gold
.
It
was
an
awful
sight
of
money
when
it
was
piled
up
.
Well
,
Judge
Thatcher
he
took
it
and
put
it
out
at
interest
,
and
it
fetched
us
a
dollar
a
day
apiece
all
the
year
round
--
more
than
a
body
could
tell
what
to
do
with
.
The
Widow
Douglas
she
took
me
for
her
son
,
and
allowed
she
would
sivilize
me
;
but
it
was
rough
living
in
the
house
all
the
time
,
considering
how
dismal
regular
and
decent
the
widow
was
in
all
her
ways
;
and
so
when
I
could
n't
stand
it
no
longer
I
lit
out
.
I
got
into
my
old
rags
and
my
sugar-hogshead
again
,
and
was
free
and
satisfied
.
But
Tom
Sawyer
he
hunted
me
up
and
said
he
was
going
to
start
a
band
of
robbers
,
and
I
might
join
if
I
would
go
back
to
the
widow
and
be
respectable
.
So
I
went
back
.
</p>
<p>
The
widow
she
cried
over
me
,
and
called
me
a
poor
lost
lamb
,
and
she
called
me
a
lot
of
other
names
,
too
,
but
she
never
meant
no
harm
by
it
.
She
put
me
in
them
new
clothes
again
,
and
I
could
n't
do
nothing
but
sweat
and
sweat
,
and
feel
all
cramped
up
.
Well
,
then
,
the
old
thing
commenced
again
.
The
widow
rung
a
bell
for
supper
,
and
you
had
to
come
to
time
.
When
you
got
to
the
table
you
could
n't
go
right
to
eating
,
but
you
had
to
wait
for
the
widow
to
tuck
down
her
head
and
grumble
a
little
over
the
victuals
,
though
there
war
n't
really
anything
the
matter
with
them
,
--
that
is
,
nothing
only
everything
was
cooked
by
itself
.
In
a
barrel
of
odds
and
ends
it
is
different
;
things
get
mixed
up
,
and
the
juice
kind
of
swaps
around
,
and
the
things
go
better
.
</p>
<p>
After
supper
she
got
out
her
book
and
learned
me
about
Moses
and
the
Bulrushers
,
and
I
was
in
a
sweat
to
find
out
all
about
him
;
but
by
and
by
she
let
it
out
that
Moses
had
been
dead
a
considerable
long
time
;
so
then
I
did
n't
care
no
more
about
him
,
because
I
do
n't
take
no
stock
in
dead
people
.
</p>
<p>
Pretty
soon
I
wanted
to
smoke
,
and
asked
the
widow
to
let
me
.
But
she
would
n't
.
She
said
it
was
a
mean
practice
and
was
n't
clean
,
and
I
must
try
to
not
do
it
any
more
.
That
is
just
the
way
with
some
people
.
They
get
down
on
a
thing
when
they
do
n't
know
nothing
about
it
.
Here
she
was
a-bothering
about
Moses
,
which
was
no
kin
to
her
,
and
no
use
to
anybody
,
being
gone
,
you
see
,
yet
finding
a
power
of
fault
with
me
for
doing
a
thing
that
had
some
good
in
it
.
And
she
took
snuff
,
too
;
of
course
that
was
all
right
,
because
she
done
it
herself
.
</p>
<p>
Her
sister
,
Miss
Watson
,
a
tolerable
slim
old
maid
,
with
goggles
on
,
had
just
come
to
live
with
her
,
and
took
a
set
at
me
now
with
a
spelling-book
.
She
worked
me
middling
hard
for
about
an
hour
,
and
then
the
widow
made
her
ease
up
.
I
could
n't
stood
it
much
longer
.
Then
for
an
hour
it
was
deadly
dull
,
and
I
was
fidgety
.
Miss
Watson
would
say
,
“
Do
n't
put
your
feet
up
there
,
Huckleberry
;
”
and
“
Do
n't
scrunch
up
like
that
,
Huckleberry
--
set
up
straight
;
”
and
pretty
soon
she
would
say
,
“
Do
n't
gap
and
stretch
like
that
,
Huckleberry
--
why
do
n't
you
try
to
behave
?
”
Then
she
told
me
all
about
the
bad
place
,
and
I
said
I
wished
I
was
there
.
She
got
mad
then
,
but
I
did
n't
mean
no
harm
.
All
I
wanted
was
to
go
somewheres
;
all
I
wanted
was
a
change
,
I
war
n't
particular
.
She
said
it
was
wicked
to
say
what
I
said
;
said
she
would
n't
say
it
for
the
whole
world
;
she
was
going
to
live
so
as
to
go
to
the
good
place
.
Well
,
I
could
n't
see
no
advantage
in
going
where
she
was
going
,
so
I
made
up
my
mind
I
would
n't
try
for
it
.
But
I
never
said
so
,
because
it
would
only
make
trouble
,
and
would
n't
do
no
good
.
