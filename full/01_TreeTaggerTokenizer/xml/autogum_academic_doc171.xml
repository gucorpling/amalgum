CU
and
PU
Partition
Types
Analysis
in
Singly
Compressed
HEVC
Videos
and
AVC/HEVC
Videos
</head>
<p>
In
the
AVC
and
HEVC
encoding
process
,
quantization
and
reconstruction
are
basic
operations
,
but
they
will
introduce
irreversible
quantization
errors
and
reconstruction
errors
,
which
make
the
decoded
video
different
from
the
original
one
.
The
change
of
video
content
will
further
affect
the
CU
and
PU
partition
types
and
makes
them
different
between
AVC/HEVC
videos
and
singly
compressed
HEVC
videos
.
We
will
illustrate
the
difference
elaborately
in
this
section
.

<figure>
Figure

describes
the
simplified
block
diagram
of
AVC/HEVC
transcoding
.
YUV
video
is
a
kind
of
uncompressed
video
and
often
used
as
test
example
of
video
encoders
.
Given
a
YUV
video
<b>
<hi rend="italic">
V
</hi>
</b>
,
the
first
step
is
to
encode
<b>
<hi rend="italic">
V
</hi>
</b>
into
the
AVC
bit
stream
with
bitrate
.
Then
will
be
decoded
to
YUV
video
and
recompressed
into
the
HEVC
bit
stream
with
bitrate
.
Please
note
two
points
here
.
One
is
that
the
reconstruction
module
in
the
encoding
process
is
equivalent
to
the
decoding
process
;
thus
we
directly
use
the
reconstruction
module
to
represent
the
decoder
in
<figure>
Figure
4
</figure>
to
save
space
.
The
other
one
is
that
only
HEVC
encoding
is
implemented
for
a
singly
compressed
HEVC
video
.
That
is
to
say
,
for
a
singly
compressed
HEVC
video
,
the
input
video
is
the
uncompressed
YUV
video
<b>
<hi rend="italic">
V
</hi>
</b>
,
not
its
decoded
version
.
</p>
<p>
From
<figure>
Figure
4
</figure>
,
we
can
see
that
CU
and
PU
partition
types
of
each
picture
are
determined
by
the
content
of
the
picture
and
the
number
of
bits
allocated
to
it
by
the
rate
control
module
.
Here
,
please
note
that
in
this
paper
,
a
picture
contains
only
one
slice
.
Though
CU
and
PU
partition
types
in
I
pictures
are
different
from
P
pictures
,
the
partition
strategy
is
similar
.
Therefore
,
we
take
the
CU
types
in
P
pictures
as
an
example
to
analyze
the
difference
between
AVC/HEVC
videos
and
singly
compressed
HEVC
videos
.
</p>
<p>
Now
let
â€™s
consider
the
AVC/HEVC
transcoding
process
.
Assume
one
uncompressed
video
sequence
<b>
<hi rend="italic">
V
</hi>
</b>
consists
of
<hi rend="italic">
N
</hi>
P
pictures
and
is
expressed
as
Equation
(
1
)
,
where
denotes
the
<hi rend="italic">
n
</hi>
th
P
picture
of
<b>
<hi rend="italic">
V
</hi>
</b>
,
then
the
bit
stream
can
be
obtained
by
implementing
the
prediction
,
transform
,
quantization
,
and
entropy
coding
process
.
(

)
</p>
<p>
In
the
AVC
encoding
process
,
a
rate
control
process
is
implemented
.
Assume
the
bit
rate
for
<b>
<hi rend="italic">
V
</hi>
</b>
is
<hi rend="italic">
r
</hi>
,
let
denote
the
rate
control
process
,
then
,
the
number
of
bits
allocated
to
the
<hi rend="italic">
n
</hi>
th
P
picture
can
be
represented
as
.
After
that
,
the
quantization
step
for
the
picture
will
be
determined
according
to
.
In
addition
,
AVC
standard
adopts
macroblock
as
the
basic
coding
unit
and
does
not
introduce
the
concept
of
CU
;
hence
,
CU
types
do
not
exist
in
the
AVC
encoding
process
.
</p>
<p>
The
decoding
process
is
the
inverse
process
of
encoding
.
Let
stand
for
the
prediction
signal
of
,
and
represent
discrete
cosine
transform
(
DCT
)
and
inverse
DCT
,
respectively
,
then
the
decoded
video
sequence
can
be
obtained
by
Equations
(
2
)
and
(
3
)
,
where
means
the
decoded
version
of
,
represents
the
rounding
operator
,
and
denote
the
irreversible
quantization
error
and
reconstruction
error
of
and
,
respectively
.
The
quantization
error
means
the
error
introduced
in
the
quantization
process
.
The
reconstruction
error
means
the
rounding
error
and
truncation
error
generated
in
the
reconstruction
process
.

</p>
<p>
In
the
process
of
transcoding
to
the
HEVC
bit
stream
,
the
number
of
bits
are
allocated
to
the
<hi rend="italic">
n
</hi>
th
P
picture
according
to
Equation
(
4
)
.
Here
we
use
rather
than
to
represent
the
rate
control
process
because
the
bits
allocation
function
adopted
in
HEVC
is
different
from
the
AVC
standard
.
(

)
</p>
<p>
Knowing
the
number
of
bits
allocated
to
the
<hi rend="italic">
n
</hi>
th
P
picture
,
the
type
of
the
<hi rend="italic">
k
</hi>
th
CU
in
the
<hi rend="italic">
n
</hi>
th
P
picture
can
be
written
as
Equation
(
5
)
,
where
stands
for
the
CU
partition
process
,
and
denotes
the
corresponding
prediction
signal
of
.
(

)
</p>
<p>
For
a
singly
compressed
HEVC
video
with
bitrate
,
the
number
of
bits
allocated
to
the
<hi rend="italic">
n
</hi>
th
P
picture
,
and
the
CU
partition
type
will
be
determined
by
Equations
(
6
)
and
(
7
)
.
(

)
(

)
</p>
<p>
Eventually
,
we
can
get
the
difference
of
CU
partition
types
between
the
AVC/HEVC
video
and
the
singly
compressed
HEVC
video
according
to
Equation
(

)
.
