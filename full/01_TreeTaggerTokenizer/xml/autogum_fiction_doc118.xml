THE
BURGLARS
</head>
<p>
It
was
much
too
fine
a
night
to
think
of
going
to
bed
at
once
,
and
so
,
although
the
witching
hour
of
nine
P.M.
had
struck
,
Edward
and
I
were
still
leaning
out
of
the
open
window
in
our
nightshirts
,
watching
the
play
of
the
cedar-branch
shadows
on
the
moonlit
lawn
,
and
planning
schemes
of
fresh
devilry
for
the
sunshiny
morrow
.
From
below
,
strains
of
the
jocund
piano
declared
that
the
Olympians
were
enjoying
themselves
in
their
listless
,
impotent
way
;
for
the
new
curate
had
been
bidden
to
dinner
that
night
,
and
was
at
the
moment
unclerically
proclaiming
to
all
the
world
that
he
feared
no
foe
.
His
discordant
vociferations
doubtless
started
a
train
of
thought
in
Edward
's
mind
,
for
the
youth
presently
remarked
,
a
propos
of
nothing
that
had
been
said
before
,
“
I
believe
the
new
curate
's
rather
gone
on
Aunt
Maria
.
”
</p>
<p>
I
scouted
the
notion
.
“
Why
,
she
's
quite
old
,
”
I
said
.
(
She
must
have
seen
some
five-and-twenty
summers
.
)
</p>
<p>
“
Of
course
she
is
,
”
replied
Edward
,
scornfully
.
“
It
's
not
her
,
it
's
her
money
he
's
after
,
you
bet
!
”
</p>
<p>
“
Did
n't
know
she
had
any
money
,
”
I
observed
timidly
.
</p>
<p>
“
Sure
to
have
,
”
said
my
brother
,
with
confidence
.
“
Heaps
and
heaps
.
”
</p>
<p>
Silence
ensued
,
both
our
minds
being
busy
with
the
new
situation
thus
presented
,
--
mine
,
in
wonderment
at
this
flaw
that
so
often
declared
itself
in
enviable
natures
of
fullest
endowment
,
--
in
a
grown-up
man
and
a
good
cricketer
,
for
instance
,
even
as
this
curate
;
Edward
's
(
apparently
)
,
in
the
consideration
of
how
such
a
state
of
things
,
supposing
it
existed
,
could
be
best
turned
to
his
own
advantage
.
</p>
<p>
“
Bobby
Ferris
told
me
,
”
began
Edward
in
due
course
,
“
that
there
was
a
fellow
spooning
his
sister
once
--
”
</p>
<p>
“
What
's
spooning
?
”
I
asked
meekly
.
</p>
<p>
“
Oh
,
<hi rend="italic">
I
</hi>
dunno
,
”
said
Edward
,
indifferently
.
“
It's
--
it's
--
it
's
just
a
thing
they
do
,
you
know
.
And
he
used
to
carry
notes
and
messages
and
things
between
'
em
,
and
he
got
a
shilling
almost
every
time
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
What
,
from
each
of
'
em
?
”
I
innocently
inquired
.
</p>
<p>
Edward
looked
at
me
with
scornful
pity
.
“
Girls
never
have
any
money
,
”
he
briefly
explained
.
“
But
she
did
his
exercises
and
got
him
out
of
rows
,
and
told
stories
for
him
when
he
needed
it
--
and
much
better
ones
than
he
could
have
made
up
for
himself
.
Girls
are
useful
in
some
ways
.
So
he
was
living
in
clover
,
when
unfortunately
they
went
and
quarrelled
about
something
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Do
n't
see
what
that
's
got
to
do
with
it
,
”
I
said
.
</p>
<p>
“
Nor
do
n't
I
,
”
rejoined
Edward
.
“
But
anyhow
the
notes
and
things
stopped
,
and
so
did
the
shillings
.
Bobby
was
fairly
cornered
,
for
he
had
bought
two
ferrets
on
tick
,
and
promised
to
pay
a
shilling
a
week
,
thinking
the
shillings
were
going
on
for
ever
,
the
silly
young
ass
.
So
when
the
week
was
up
,
and
he
was
being
dunned
for
the
shilling
,
he
went
off
to
the
fellow
and
said
,
'
Your
broken-hearted
Bella
implores
you
to
meet
her
at
sundown
,
--
by
the
hollow
oak
,
as
of
old
,
be
it
only
for
a
moment
.
Do
not
fail
!
'
He
got
all
that
out
of
some
rotten
book
,
of
course
.
The
fellow
looked
puzzled
and
said
,
--
</p>
<p>
“
'
What
hollow
oak
?
I
do
n't
know
any
hollow
oak
.
'
</p>
<p>
“
'
Perhaps
it
was
the
Royal
Oak
?
'
said
Bobby
promptly
,
'
cos
he
saw
he
had
made
a
slip
,
through
trusting
too
much
to
the
rotten
book
;
but
this
did
n't
seem
to
make
the
fellow
any
happier
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Should
think
not
,
”
I
said
,
“
the
Royal
Oak
's
an
awful
low
sort
of
pub
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
know
,
”
said
Edward
.
“
Well
,
at
last
the
fellow
said
,
'
I
think
I
know
what
she
means
:
the
hollow
tree
in
your
father
's
paddock
.
It
happens
to
be
an
elm
,
but
she
would
n't
know
the
difference
.
All
right
:
say
I
'll
be
there
.
'
Bobby
hung
about
a
bit
,
for
he
had
n't
got
his
money
.
'
She
was
crying
awfully
,
'
he
said
.
Then
he
got
his
shilling
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
And
was
n't
the
fellow
riled
,
”
I
inquired
,
“
when
he
got
to
the
place
and
found
nothing
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
He
found
Bobby
,
”
said
Edward
,
indignantly
.
“
Young
Ferris
was
a
gentleman
,
every
inch
of
him
.
He
brought
the
fellow
another
message
from
Bella
:
'
I
dare
not
leave
the
house
.
My
cruel
parents
immure
me
closely
If
you
only
knew
what
I
suffer
.
Your
broken-hearted
Bella
.
'
Out
of
the
same
rotten
book
.
This
made
the
fellow
a
little
suspicious
,
'
cos
it
was
the
old
Ferrises
who
had
been
keen
about
the
thing
all
through
:
the
fellow
,
you
see
,
had
tin
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
But
what
's
that
got
to
--
”
I
began
again
.
</p>
<p>
“
Oh
,
<hi rend="italic">
I
</hi>
dunno
,
”
said
Edward
,
impatiently
.
“
I
'm
telling
you
just
what
Bobby
told
me
.
He
got
suspicious
,
anyhow
,
but
he
could
n't
exactly
call
Bella
's
brother
a
liar
,
so
Bobby
escaped
for
the
time
.
But
when
he
was
in
a
hole
next
week
,
over
a
stiff
French
exercise
,
and
tried
the
same
sort
of
game
on
his
sister
,
she
was
too
sharp
for
him
,
and
he
got
caught
out
.
Somehow
women
seem
more
mistrustful
than
men
.
They
're
so
beastly
suspicious
by
nature
,
you
know
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
<hi rend="italic">
I
</hi>
know
,
”
said
I.
“
But
did
the
two
--
the
fellow
and
the
sister
--
make
it
up
afterwards
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
do
n't
remember
about
that
,
”
replied
Edward
,
indifferently
;
“
but
Bobby
got
packed
off
to
school
a
whole
year
earlier
than
his
people
meant
to
send
him
,
--
which
was
just
what
he
wanted
.
So
you
see
it
all
came
right
in
the
end
!
