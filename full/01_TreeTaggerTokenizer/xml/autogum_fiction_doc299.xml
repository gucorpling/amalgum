I.
THE
ORIGIN
OF
THE
WAR
</head>
<p>
A
deadly
feud
was
raging
among
the
boys
of
Numedale
.
The
East-Siders
hated
the
West-Siders
,
and
thrashed
them
when
they
got
a
chance
;
and
the
West-Siders
,
when
fortune
favored
them
,
returned
the
compliment
with
interest
.
It
required
considerable
courage
for
a
boy
to
venture
,
unattended
by
comrades
,
into
the
territory
of
the
enemy
;
and
no
one
took
the
risk
unless
dire
necessity
compelled
him
.
</p>
<p>
The
hostile
parties
had
played
at
war
so
long
that
they
had
forgotten
that
it
was
play
;
and
now
were
actually
inspired
with
the
emotions
which
they
had
formerly
simulated
.
Under
the
leadership
of
their
chieftains
,
Halvor
Reitan
and
Viggo
Hook
,
they
held
councils
of
war
,
sent
out
scouts
,
planned
midnight
surprises
,
and
fought
at
times
mimic
battles
.
I
say
mimic
battles
,
because
no
one
was
ever
killed
;
but
broken
heads
and
bruised
limbs
many
a
one
carried
home
from
these
engagements
,
and
unhappily
one
boy
,
named
Peer
Oestmo
,
had
an
eye
put
out
by
an
arrow
.
</p>
<p>
It
was
a
great
consolation
to
him
that
he
became
a
hero
to
all
the
West-Siders
and
was
promoted
for
bravery
in
the
field
to
the
rank
of
first
lieutenant
.
He
had
the
sympathy
of
all
his
companions
in
arms
and
got
innumerable
bites
of
apples
,
cancelled
postage
stamps
,
and
colored
advertising-labels
in
token
of
their
esteem
.
</p>
<p>
But
the
principal
effect
of
this
first
serious
wound
was
to
invest
the
war
with
a
breathless
and
all-absorbing
interest
.
It
was
now
no
longer
“
make
believe
,
”
but
deadly
earnest
.
Blood
had
flowed
;
insults
had
been
exchanged
in
due
order
,
and
offended
honor
cried
for
vengeance
.
</p>
<p>
It
was
fortunate
that
the
river
divided
the
West-Siders
from
the
East-Siders
,
or
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
tell
what
might
have
happened
.
Viggo
Hook
,
the
West-Side
general
,
was
a
handsome
,
high-spirited
lad
of
fifteen
,
who
was
the
last
person
to
pocket
an
injury
,
as
long
as
red
blood
flowed
in
his
veins
,
as
he
was
wont
to
express
it
.
He
was
the
eldest
son
of
Colonel
Hook
of
the
regular
army
,
and
meant
some
day
to
be
a
Von
Moltke
or
a
Napoleon
.
He
felt
in
his
heart
that
he
was
destined
for
something
great
;
and
in
conformity
with
this
conviction
assumed
a
superb
behavior
,
which
his
comrades
found
very
admirable
.
</p>
<p>
He
had
the
gift
of
leadership
in
a
marked
degree
,
and
established
his
authority
by
a
due
mixture
of
kindness
and
severity
.
Those
boys
whom
he
honored
with
his
confidence
were
absolutely
attached
to
him
.
Those
whom
,
with
magnificent
arbitrariness
,
he
punished
and
persecuted
,
felt
meekly
that
they
had
probably
deserved
it
;
and
if
they
had
not
,
it
was
somehow
in
the
game
.
</p>
<p>
There
never
was
a
more
absolute
king
than
Viggo
,
nor
one
more
abjectly
courted
and
admired
.
And
the
amusing
part
of
it
was
that
he
was
at
heart
a
generous
and
good-natured
lad
,
but
possessed
with
a
lofty
ideal
of
heroism
,
which
required
above
all
things
that
whatever
he
said
or
did
must
be
striking
.
He
dramatized
,
as
it
were
,
every
phrase
he
uttered
and
every
act
he
performed
,
and
modelled
himself
alternately
after
Napoleon
and
Wellington
,
as
he
had
seen
them
represented
in
the
old
engravings
which
decorated
the
walls
in
his
father
’s
study
.
</p>
<p>
He
had
read
much
about
heroes
of
war
,
ancient
and
modern
,
and
he
lived
about
half
his
own
life
imagining
himself
by
turns
all
sorts
of
grand
characters
from
history
or
fiction
.
</p>
<p>
His
costume
was
usually
in
keeping
with
his
own
conception
of
these
characters
,
in
so
far
as
his
scanty
opportunities
permitted
.
An
old
,
broken
sword
of
his
father
’s
,
which
had
been
polished
until
it
“
flashed
”
properly
,
was
girded
to
a
brass-mounted
belt
about
his
waist
;
an
ancient
,
gold-braided
,
military
cap
,
which
was
much
too
large
,
covered
his
curly
head
;
and
four
tarnished
brass
buttons
,
displaying
the
Golden
Lion
of
Norway
,
gave
a
martial
air
to
his
blue
jacket
,
although
the
rest
were
plain
horn
.
</p>
<p>
But
quite
independently
of
his
poor
trappings
Viggo
was
to
his
comrades
an
august
personage
.
I
doubt
if
the
Grand
Vizier
feels
more
flattered
and
gratified
by
the
favor
of
the
Sultan
than
little
Marcus
Henning
did
,
when
Viggo
condescended
to
be
civil
to
him
.
</p>
<p>
Marcus
was
small
,
round-shouldered
,
spindle-shanked
,
and
freckle-faced
.
His
hair
was
coarse
,
straight
,
and
the
color
of
maple
sirup
;
his
nose
was
broad
and
a
little
flattened
at
the
point
,
and
his
clothes
had
a
knack
of
never
fitting
him
.
They
were
made
to
grow
in
and
somehow
he
never
caught
up
with
them
,
he
once
said
,
with
no
intention
of
being
funny
.
His
father
,
who
was
Colonel
Hook
’s
nearest
neighbor
,
kept
a
modest
country
shop
,
in
which
you
could
buy
anything
,
from
dry
goods
and
groceries
to
shoes
and
medicines
.
You
would
have
to
be
very
ingenious
to
ask
for
a
thing
which
Henning
could
not
supply
.
The
smell
in
the
store
carried
out
the
same
idea
;
for
it
was
a
mixture
of
all
imaginable
smells
under
the
sun
.
</p>
<p>
Now
,
it
was
the
chief
misery
of
Marcus
that
,
sleeping
,
as
he
did
,
in
the
room
behind
the
store
,
he
had
become
so
impregnated
with
this
curious
composite
smell
that
it
followed
him
like
an
odoriferous
halo
,
and
procured
him
a
number
of
unpleasant
nicknames
.
The
principal
ingredient
was
salted
herring
;
but
there
was
also
a
suspicion
of
tarred
ropes
,
plug
tobacco
,
prunes
,
dried
codfish
,
and
oiled
tarpaulin
.
