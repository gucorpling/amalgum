Marmara

Marmara
Ereğlisi
occupies
a
triangular
peninsula
with
a
‘
hook
’
attached
on
its
tip
on
the
northern
coast
of
the
Sea
of
Marmara
.
In
the
past
,
the
town
was
known
as
<hi rend="bold">
Perinthos
</hi>
and
subsequently
as
<hi rend="bold">
Herakleia
</hi>
,
out
of
which
modern
name
derived
.
The
town
is
locally
known
as
<hi rend="bold">
Ereğli
</hi>
,
and
Marmara
,
although
an
official
part
of
the
name
,
serves
as
a
disambiguator
to
differentiate
the
town
from
other
two
Ereğlis
in
Turkey
.
</p>
<p>
Although
older
parts
of
the
town
resemble
more
of
a
village
today
,
with
roosters
crowing
here
and
there
,
during
the
days
of
Perinthos
,
town
served
as
the
capital
of
Roman
province
of
<ref target="Thrace">
Thrakia
</ref>
,
and
it
’s
hard
to
believe
but
what
is
today
<ref target="Istanbul">
Istanbul
</ref>
was
just
a
village
administered
from
Perinthos

Despite
being
a
coastal
town
,
there
are
no
scheduled
ferry
services
to
the
town
and
quite
frankly
there
is
not
somewhere
suitable
to
anchor
if
you
even
arrive
by
your
own
boat
.
You
may
better
anchor
your
boat
in
<ref target="Tekirda%C4%9F">

and
then
bus
the
rest
40

The
ostentatious
days
of
Perinthos
are
long
gone
for
more
than
two
millennia
,
so
many
of
the
historical
sights
described
here
are
slowly
vanishing
.
In
fact
many
can
be
distinguished
from
natural
formations
only
by
careful
eyes
and
only
people
really
interested
in
history
may
find
them
worth
of
a
check
.

Park
</hi>
.
There
is
an
open-air
display
of
marble
columns
and
sarcophagi
–
as
is
usual
in
any
ancient
Roman
site-
dating
back
to
Perinthos
in
a
park
located
a
few
metres
down
the
town
square
towards
eastern
waterfront
.
This
is
probably
the
historical
sight
in
best
condition
.

Old
town
</hi>
.
Situated
on
the
top
of
the
hill
rising
on
the
tip
of
the
peninsula
,
this
is
the
oldest
part
of
town
.
There
are
many
houses
around
maintaining
Greek
architecture
but
most
are
very
badly
in
need
of
a
repair
.
One
exception
is
<hi rend="bold">
Constantine
’s
Residence
</hi>
(
<hi rend="italic">
Konstantin’in
Evi
</hi>
)
,
a
stone
two-floor
mansion
known
by
its
former
owner
’s
name
.
It
’s
situated
near
the
western
coast
,
a
block
or
so
down
the
town
square
.
</item>
<item>
<hi rend="bold">
City
walls
</hi>
.
Most
of
the
old
town
is
surrounded
by
ancient
city
walls
,
though
in
most
parts
they
resemble
more
of
a
somewhat
high
garden
fence
rather
than
grandiose
city
walls
.
You
may
occasionally
spot
a
(
largely
ruined
)
tower
here
and
there
if
you
walk
around
them
a
bit
.
</item>
<item>
<hi rend="bold">
Roman
breakwater
</hi>
.
Located
on
the
western
coast
,
you
can
more
easily
spot
it
from
the
top
of
the
cliff
as
it
appears
as
random
rocks
on
two
straight
rows
lying
parallel
to
each
other
when
you
hit
to
the
beach
next
to
it
.
Nice
to
watch
the
cormorants
playing
with
the
waves
though
.
</item>
<item>
<hi rend="bold">
Amphitheatre
</hi>
.
You
will
not
find
the
usual
marble
seats
as
they
are
covered
by
grass
and
earth
several
feet
thick
.
However
the
amphitheatral
form
of
half-moon
ascending
from
a
stage
is
still
clearly
distinguishable
,
in
fact
it
looks
more
majestic
with
the
grass
and
all
.
To
get
there
from
the
town
centre
,
walk
uphill
through
the
old
town
,
and
as
you
come
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
overlooking
the
sea
,
turn
left
(
towards
east
)
.
You
’ll
walk
on
an
unpaved
path
for
about
15-20
minutes
passing
beside
,
below
and
over
some
remnants
of
city
walls
.
The
amphitheatre
is
located
right
below
the
lighthouse
on
the
top
of
the
hill
:
Take
the
lighthouse
(
which
will
appear
after
you
walked
for
about
5-10
min
)
as
a
bearing
if
it
’ll
make
it
easier
for
you
.
Do
n’t
ask
the
locals
about
amphitheatre
,
they
seem
to
be
even
unaware
of
its
existence
and
when
asked
about
where
the
<hi rend="italic">
tiyatro
</hi>
is
,
they
show
the
way
to
the
modern
cultural
centre
which
has
a
theatre
stage
.
It
offers
a
very
beautiful
view
of
the
sea
located
below
the
cliff
next
to
the
amphitheatre
.
</item>
<item>
<hi rend="bold">
Tumulii
</hi>
(
singular
:
tumulus
,
in
Turkish
:
tümülüs
)
.
These
are
conical
not-so-high
hills
,
rising
suddenly
out
of
ground
and
somewhat
natural
at
first
glance
.
They
are
actually
man-made
,
remained
from
<hi rend="bold">
Thracians
</hi>
,
the
native
folk
of
this
region
before
the
arrival
of
Greeks
and
Romans
among
others
.
They
were
erected
to
serve
as
mausoleum
for
Thracian
kings
and
nobles
(
think
of
them
as
local
variation
of
the
<ref target="Cairo/Giza">
pyramids
</ref>
,
though
these
two
are
historically
unrelated
)
.
Although
the
tumulii
are
scattered
all
around
<ref target="Thrace">
Thrace
</ref>
,
the
area
about
5
km
north
of
Marmara
Ereğlisi
has
an
exceptionally
high
number
of
tumulii
,
as
Perinthos
was
an
important
centre
of
the
region
even
before
Romans
.
The
tumulii
5
km
out
of
town
may
not
worth
the
trouble
to
go
there
,
so
you
may
take
a
distant
look
at
a
quite
a
few
of
them
in
the
same
frame
when
returning
from
the
amphitheatre
,
just
before
entering
the
old
town
and
immediately
after
the
path
swings
to
right
(
towards
north
)
.

<list type="unordered">
<item>
Take
a
bottle
of
<hi rend="bold">
wine
</hi>
,
go
to
the
amphitheatre
and
enjoy
it
,
perhaps
against
the
sunset
.
The
amphitheatre
is
so
beautifully
located
that
the
sun
sets
exactly
in
the
same
direction
the
amphitheatre
faces
,
beyond
the
sea
.
