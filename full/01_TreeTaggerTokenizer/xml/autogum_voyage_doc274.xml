Fort
Wayne
is
a
metropolitan
city
with
a
small
community
feel
.

an
intimate
personal
connection
with
those
who
live
or
visit
here
.
Fort
Wayne
is
the
second
largest

The
city
itself
has
a
long
history
going
back
to
the
1700s
,

has
lately
succumbed
to
the
urban
sprawl
so
widespread
in
the
Midwest
.
It
is
nicknamed
the
&quot;
Summit
City
&quot;
because
,
even
though
the
surrounding
area
seems
completely
flat
,
it
is
on
the
high
point
of
the
old
Wabash-Erie
canal
