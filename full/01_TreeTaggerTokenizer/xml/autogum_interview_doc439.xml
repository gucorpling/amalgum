Why
are
you
running
for
political
office
,
why
at
the
federal
level
,
why
this
party
,
and
why
in
this
riding
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
Canada
is
at
risk
of
losing
its
identity
,
economy
and
place
on
the
international
stage
.
Through
changes
to
foreign
ownership
rules
,
big
corporate
tax
cuts
,
aggressive
changes
to
foreign
policy
and
diminishing
Arts
budgets
,
we
are
seeing
an
erosion
of
Canadian
control
of
our
broadcasters
,
our
manufacturing
sector
,
our
environment
and
the
level
of
respect
we
command
on
the
world
over
.
This
is
why
I
am
running
for
the
NDP
in
Don
Valley
West
.
We
must
fight
for
the
Canada
we
deserve
.
We
must
demand
that
government
put
all
of
our
residents
first
before
big
,
foreign
controlled
business
and
speculator
and
shareholder
profits
.
Families
are
suffering
and
facing
uncertainty
over
real
,
daily
kitchen
table
issues
and
we
need
a
responsive
government
and
vocal
,
fearless
representatives
to
fight
for
the
issues
important
to
them
.
</p>
<p>
I
have
lived
in
and
around
Don
Valley
West
for
19
years
.
My
family
and
I
lived
for
three
years
in
Flemingdon
Park
.
My
children
attended
Gateway
Public
School
.
We
now
live
in
Leaside
and
I
feel
that
my
experience
in
these
diverse
communities
along
with
my
work
in
both
the
public
and
private
sectors
as
an
ambulance
attendant
and
as
a
self-employed
actor
,
writer
and
film
maker
will
allow
me
to
identify
with
the
many
issues
facing
different
areas
within
our
riding
.
</p>
<p>
Jack
Layton
and
the
NDP
have
practical
solutions
that
will
address
the
kitchen
table
issues
facing
the
people
of
Don
Valley
West
.
I
have
always
felt
that
only
by
addressing
the
needs
of
residents
at
the
local
daily
level
of
their
lives
can
you
properly
represent
this
great
country
we
share
.
The
NDP
does
that
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Previous
to
this
campaign
,
have
you
been
politically
involved
?
How
will
you
apply
your
previous
work/volunteer/life
experience
to
serving
your
constituents
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
I
am
currently
the
Vice
President
of
Member
Services
for
ACTRA
Toronto
and
a
national
councillor
for
ACTRA
National
.
I
have
lobbied
on
behalf
of
all
cultural
workers
in
Ottawa
and
at
the
Ontario
Legislature
to
improve
the
funding
and
support
of
our
talented
Canadian
artists
and
thereby
the
projection
of
Canada
's
voice
to
Canadians
and
the
world
.
I
will
use
this
experience
to
continue
our
fight
for
Canada
's
identity
and
the
reflection
of
our
more
established
and
emerging
cultures
.
And
I
will
use
my
skills
,
developed
over
18
years
in
this
profession
,
to
fight
for
the
important
local
issues
facing
the
people
of
Don
Valley
West
at
the
national
level
.
