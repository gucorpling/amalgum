When
the
weather
was
dark
and
cloudy
Edna
could
not
work
.
She
needed
the
sun
to
mellow
and
temper
her
mood
to
the
sticking
point
.
She
had
reached
a
stage
when
she
seemed
to
be
no
longer
feeling
her
way
,
working
,
when
in
the
humor
,
with
sureness
and
ease
.
And
being
devoid
of
ambition
,
and
striving
not
toward
accomplishment
,
she
drew
satisfaction
from
the
work
in
itself
.
</p>
<p>
On
rainy
or
melancholy
days
Edna
went
out
and
sought
the
society
of
the
friends
she
had
made
at
Grand
Isle
.
Or
else
she
stayed
indoors
and
nursed
a
mood
with
which
she
was
becoming
too
familiar
for
her
own
comfort
and
peace
of
mind
.
It
was
not
despair
;
but
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
life
were
passing
by
,
leaving
its
promise
broken
and
unfulfilled
.
Yet
there
were
other
days
when
she
listened
,
was
led
on
and
deceived
by
fresh
promises
which
her
youth
held
out
to
her
.
</p>
<p>
She
went
again
to
the
races
,
and
again
.
Alcee
Arobin
and
Mrs.
Highcamp
called
for
her
one
bright
afternoon
in
Arobin
's
drag
.
Mrs.
Highcamp
was
a
worldly
but
unaffected
,
intelligent
,
slim
,
tall
blonde
woman
in
the
forties
,
with
an
indifferent
manner
and
blue
eyes
that
stared
.
She
had
a
daughter
who
served
her
as
a
pretext
for
cultivating
the
society
of
young
men
of
fashion
.
Alcee
Arobin
was
one
of
them
.
He
was
a
familiar
figure
at
the
race
course
,
the
opera
,
the
fashionable
clubs
.
There
was
a
perpetual
smile
in
his
eyes
,
which
seldom
failed
to
awaken
a
corresponding
cheerfulness
in
any
one
who
looked
into
them
and
listened
to
his
good-humored
voice
.
His
manner
was
quiet
,
and
at
times
a
little
insolent
.
He
possessed
a
good
figure
,
a
pleasing
face
,
not
overburdened
with
depth
of
thought
or
feeling
;
and
his
dress
was
that
of
the
conventional
man
of
fashion
.
</p>
<p>
He
admired
Edna
extravagantly
,
after
meeting
her
at
the
races
with
her
father
.
He
had
met
her
before
on
other
occasions
,
but
she
had
seemed
to
him
unapproachable
until
that
day
.
It
was
at
his
instigation
that
Mrs.
Highcamp
called
to
ask
her
to
go
with
them
to
the
Jockey
Club
to
witness
the
turf
event
of
the
season
.
</p>
<p>
There
were
possibly
a
few
track
men
out
there
who
knew
the
race
horse
as
well
as
Edna
,
but
there
was
certainly
none
who
knew
it
better
.
She
sat
between
her
two
companions
as
one
having
authority
to
speak
.
She
laughed
at
Arobin
's
pretensions
,
and
deplored
Mrs.
Highcamp
's
ignorance
.
The
race
horse
was
a
friend
and
intimate
associate
of
her
childhood
.
The
atmosphere
of
the
stables
and
the
breath
of
the
blue
grass
paddock
revived
in
her
memory
and
lingered
in
her
nostrils
.
She
did
not
perceive
that
she
was
talking
like
her
father
as
the
sleek
geldings
ambled
in
review
before
them
.
She
played
for
very
high
stakes
,
and
fortune
favored
her
.
The
fever
of
the
game
flamed
in
her
cheeks
and
eyes
,
and
it
got
into
her
blood
and
into
her
brain
like
an
intoxicant
.
People
turned
their
heads
to
look
at
her
,
and
more
than
one
lent
an
attentive
ear
to
her
utterances
,
hoping
thereby
to
secure
the
elusive
but
ever-desired
“
tip
.
”
Arobin
caught
the
contagion
of
excitement
which
drew
him
to
Edna
like
a
magnet
.
Mrs.
Highcamp
remained
,
as
usual
,
unmoved
,
with
her
indifferent
stare
and
uplifted
eyebrows
.
</p>
<p>
Edna
stayed
and
dined
with
Mrs.
Highcamp
upon
being
urged
to
do
so
.
Arobin
also
remained
and
sent
away
his
drag
.
</p>
<p>
The
dinner
was
quiet
and
uninteresting
,
save
for
the
cheerful
efforts
of
Arobin
to
enliven
things
.
Mrs.
Highcamp
deplored
the
absence
of
her
daughter
from
the
races
,
and
tried
to
convey
to
her
what
she
had
missed
by
going
to
the
“
Dante
reading
”
instead
of
joining
them
.
The
girl
held
a
geranium
leaf
up
to
her
nose
and
said
nothing
,
but
looked
knowing
and
noncommittal
.
Mr.
Highcamp
was
a
plain
,
bald-headed
man
,
who
only
talked
under
compulsion
.
He
was
unresponsive
.
Mrs.
Highcamp
was
full
of
delicate
courtesy
and
consideration
toward
her
husband
.
She
addressed
most
of
her
conversation
to
him
at
table
.
They
sat
in
the
library
after
dinner
and
read
the
evening
papers
together
under
the
droplight
;
while
the
younger
people
went
into
the
drawing-room
near
by
and
talked
.
Miss
Highcamp
played
some
selections
from
Grieg
upon
the
piano
.
She
seemed
to
have
apprehended
all
of
the
composer
's
coldness
and
none
of
his
poetry
.
While
Edna
listened
she
could
not
help
wondering
if
she
had
lost
her
taste
for
music
.
</p>
<p>
When
the
time
came
for
her
to
go
home
,
Mr.
Highcamp
grunted
a
lame
offer
to
escort
her
,
looking
down
at
his
slippered
feet
with
tactless
concern
.
It
was
Arobin
who
took
her
home
.
The
car
ride
was
long
,
and
it
was
late
when
they
reached
Esplanade
Street
.
Arobin
asked
permission
to
enter
for
a
second
to
light
his
cigarette
--
his
match
safe
was
empty
.
He
filled
his
match
safe
,
but
did
not
light
his
cigarette
until
he
left
her
,
after
she
had
expressed
her
willingness
to
go
to
the
races
with
him
again
.
</p>
<p>
Edna
was
neither
tired
nor
sleepy
.
She
was
hungry
again
,
for
the
Highcamp
dinner
,
though
of
excellent
quality
,
had
lacked
abundance
.
She
rummaged
in
the
larder
and
brought
forth
a
slice
of
Gruyere
and
some
crackers
.
She
opened
a
bottle
of
beer
which
she
found
in
the
icebox
.
Edna
felt
extremely
restless
and
excited
.
She
vacantly
hummed
a
fantastic
tune
as
she
poked
at
the
wood
embers
on
the
hearth
and
munched
a
cracker
.
