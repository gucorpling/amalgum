Use
the
Pursuit
Intervention
Technique
(
PIT
Maneuver
)
in
a
Car
</head>
<p>
The
Precision
Immobilization
Technique
(
PIT
maneuver
)
is
a
procedure
which
has
been
used
by
law
enforcement
departments
around
the
world
(
this
is
also
known
by
some
as
the
Precision
Immobilization
Technique
)
.
<hi rend="bold">
Vehicles
at
high
speed
are
</hi>
,
by
laws
of
physics
and
aerodynamics
,
<hi rend="bold">
inherently
less
stable
than
at
lower
speeds
</hi>
.
The
rear
of
the
vehicle
is
also
fundamentally
less
stable
than
the
front
of
the
vehicle
(
especially
a
RWD
vehicle
,
under
acceleration
)
.
This
is
even
true
of
aerodynamically
designed
vehicles
such
as
NASCAR
;
the
PIT
maneuver
is
also
used
in
this
sport
,
though
most
NASCAR
drivers
only
complain
when
they
are
the
victims
of
such
a
technique
.
</p>
<p>
Before
the
PIT
maneuver
is
performed
,
it
is
assumed
that
Car
A
is
approaching
Car
B
from
behind
.
<hi rend="bold">

Car

At
speeds
greater
than
,
Car
B
requires
not
much
more
than
a
good
strong
kiss
from
Car
A.
At
speeds
closer
to
,
Car
A
may
need
to
sacrifice
a
bit
of
the
front-end
of
the
car
to
give
a
strong
slam
to
the
rear
of
Car
B.

After
Car
A
gives
the
initial
tap
,
Car
B
's
back-end
will
slide
out
if
enough
force
was
applied
.

Car
A
will
need
to
straighten
out
,
so
as
to
not
follow
through
too
much
and
lose
control
.
Car
A
then
needs
to
slow
down
immediately
to
avoid
broadsiding
Car
B.
</item>
<item>
For
two
comparable
cars
,
Car
A
should
always
be
able
to
slow
down
faster
than
Car
B
,
due
to
efficiencies
of
braking
in
a
straight
line
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Be
prepared
for
Car
B
to
try
to
drive
off
as
soon
as
it
has
slowed
enough
to
regain
control
.

An
experienced
driver
in
a
FWD
vehicle
could
recover
and
drive
off
in
the
original
direction
at
surprisingly
fast
speeds

An
experienced
driver
in
a
RWD
vehicle
will
,
once
the
vehicle
is
slowed
most
of
the
way
,
likely
try
to
accelerate
in
the
opposite
direction
of
the
initial
pursuit

Additional
aspects
of
the
maneuver
can
be
added
to
help
Car
A.
For
example
,
before
the
tap
into
Car
B
's
rear
quarter
,
easing
off
the
throttle
(
or
even
using
the
brake
a
bit
)
at
the
same
time
as
the
turn-in
,
will
<hi rend="bold">
increase
front
tire
down-force
and
increase
traction
for
a
very
short
period
of
time
</hi>
,
which
can
add
lateral
velocity
into
Car
B.

Tips

<list type="unordered">
<item>
At
freeway
speeds
,
a
hit
from
the
side
may
not
be
necessary
;
often
a
strong
hit
in
the
rear
bumper
at
a
bit
of
an
angle
may
cause
the
vehicle
to
lose
control
.

With
correct
technique
,
a
small
car
has
the
ability
to
take
down
even
large
trucks
,
but
it
becomes
much
more
difficult
.
</item>
<item>
Note-
This
is
also
used
in
racing
sports
such
as
NASCAR
,
and
is
one
of
the
most
effective
moves
to
take
out
an
opponent

This
is
a
very
difficult
and
dangerous
maneuver
,
and
should
only
be
performed
if
you
have
been
trained
in
the
technique
.
</item>
<item>
Any
practicing
you
do
should
not
be
done
on
public
streets
!
Your
own
private
property
is
the
best
.
</item>
<item>
Always
drive
safely
.
Be
observant
of
pedestrians
and
other
vehicles
.
</item>
<item>
Tactical
or
Technical
Driving
can
be
very
dangerous
,
and
it
should
only
be
done
in
emergency
situations
,
when
no
other
choice
is
available
.
</item>
<item>
The
P.I.T.
maneuver
is
illegal
in
most
states
.
Do
not
attempt
.
</item>
<item>
Successfully
performing
this
technique
will
depend
a
good
deal
on
the
driving
abilities
of
Car
B.
If
Car
B
is
aware
of
Car
A
,
avoiding
the
lateral
force
by
simple
swerves
is
possible
(
professional
PIT
Maneuver
training
may
also
include
evading
the
PIT
Maneuver
)
.
</item>
<item>
Never
break
the
law
!
Obey
speed
limits
,
research
state
and
local
laws
,
and
be
sure
to
obey
all
the
laws
.
</item>
<item>
While
practice
is
crucial
,
it
should
be
noted
that
many
of
the
maneuvers
can
cause
damage
to
vehicles
.
Alignment
,
engine
mounts
,
bearings
and
many
other
parts
can
suffer
wear
or
malfunctions
.
Some
people
use
a
cheap
&quot;
practice
car
&quot;
to
practice
with
.
