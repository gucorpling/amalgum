Based
on
the
Kirchhoff

voltage
law
(
KVL
)
,
the
equivalent
circuit
model

is
built
by

where

<p>
The

can
be
expressed
by

</p>
<p>
Due
to
the
far
distance
,
the
mutual
inductance
between
the
transmitter
and
the
receiver
is
small
.
In
general
,
and
are
far
greater
than
the
non-adjacent
coupling
coefficient
.
Thus
,
the
influence
of
mutual
inductance
on
the
system
can
be
ignored
.
This
paper
assumes
.
Solving
the
KVL
equation
of
the
equivalent
circuit
,
the
current
expression
of
each
circuit
can
be
obtained
,
and
all
the
current
solutions
given
in

)
are
valid
only
at
the
resonant
frequency

where
(

</p>

Furthermore
,
the
expressions
of
the

To
facilitate
the
analysis
,
the
distance
between
the
transmitter
coil
and
the
intermediate
coil-1
is
;
the
transfer
distance
between
the
transmitter
and
the
receiver
coil
is
<hi rend="italic">

,
and
the
distance
coefficient
is
defined
as
the
position
of
the
intermediate
coil-1
:

)
</p>
<p>
On
this
topology
,
to
ensure
that
the
intermediate
coil-1
is
always
between
the
transmitter
coil
and
the
receiver
coil
,
the
distance
coefficient
should
be
in
the
following
constraint
condition
:
(

)
</p>
<p>
The
mutual
inductances
are
related
to
the
distances
between
the
coils
,
and
the
coupling
coefficients
are
directly
derived
from
the
mutual
inductances
.
In
addition
,
the
transfer
power
is
related
to
the
coupling
coefficients
.
Thus
,
the
transfer
power
is
also
related
to
the
distance
coefficient
.
The
mutual
inductance
between
the
coils
is
shown

and
are
the
numbers
of
turns
of
the
two

and
,
are
the
radii
of
the
two
circular
coils
.
and
are
the
complete
elliptic
integrals
of
the
first
type
and
the
second
type
,
respectively
,
and
is
the
center
distance
of
the
two
round
coils
.
The
flat
circular
spiral
coil
can
be
considered
as
the
overlay
group
of
several
single-turn
coaxial
rings
with
different
radii
on
the
same
plane
.
Similarly
,
the
mutual
inductance
between
two
spiral
coils
can
be
considered
as
the
overlay
group
of
several
pairs
on
different
planes
.

<p>
The
mutual
inductance
between
the
adjacent
coils
can
be
expressed
as
:

</p>
<p>
The
mutual
inductance
between
the
coils
and
can
be
further
expressed
as
:
(

)
</p>
<p>
The
relationship
between
transfer
power
and
distance
coefficient
can
be
obtained
by
Equations

</p>
<p>
By
solving
the
above
equation
,
the
position
of
the
intermediate
coil-1
can
be
decided
,
and
then
transmission
power
is
maximized

<p>
Two
intermediate
coils
have
the
short
circuit
topology
.
The
transmission
distance
is

owing
to
