<p>
Nobody
has
been
appointed
to
take
over
running
the
trust
that
promotes
the
faith
,
which
has
over
1,200
centres
worldwide
.
There
are
fears
the
family
and
trust
could
argue
,
leading
to
a
government
takeover
.
&quot;
If
the
government
has
to
take
over
the
affairs
of
Sai
Baba
's
mission
that
could
spell
its
end
,
&quot;
warned
one
devotee

<p>
&quot;
Some
people
out
of
their
mean-mindedness
are
trying
to
tarnish
the
image
of
Sai
Baba
,
&quot;
said
Baba
in
2000
,
after
allegations
of
sexual
abuse
were
made
against
him
by
young
men
,
claims
the
BBC
highlighted
in
2004
.
&quot;
I
am
not
after
name
and
fame
.
So
,
I
do
not
lose
anything
by
their
false
allegations

My
glory
will
go
on
increasing
day
by

Claims
that
Śrī
Baba
was
a
charlatan
and
allegations
of
sexual
abuse
dogged
him
constantly
.
In
1993
,
six
people
&quot;
died
violently
in
the
spiritual
leader
's
private
rooms

<hi rend="italic">
The

No
full
explanation
has
ever
been
given
for
the
deaths
,

speculation
of
a
money
dispute
has
been
raised
.

In

Minister
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Manmohan_Singh">

kept
at

flood
them
