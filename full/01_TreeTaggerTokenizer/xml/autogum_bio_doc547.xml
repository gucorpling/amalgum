History

<p>
Giovanni
Antonio
de
Carbonariis
accompanied
Francesco
Pagano
’s
diplomatic
mission
to
London
at
the
start
of
1490
,
as
did
Christopher
Carbonariis
,
who
appears
to
have
some
family
connection
.
Jones
says
that
&quot;
de
Carbonariis
&quot;
appears
to
be
a
family
name
.
Giovanni
Carbonariis
'
association
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cabot">
John
Cabot
</ref>
has
been
known
since
the
19th
century
,
based
on
his
letter
of
20
June
1498
to
the
Duke
of
Milan
.
He
said
that
‘
Messer
Giovanni
Antonio
de
Carbonariis
’
had
accompanied
Cabot
’s
recently
departed
expedition
.
The
Friar
had
left
with
five
ships
provided
by
King
Henry
VII
of
England
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-2">

The
Spanish
envoy
in
London
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_de_Ayala">
Pedro

,
wrote
to
the
Crown
noting
that
one
of
the
five
ships
in
Cabot
's
expedition
had
been
badly
damaged
in
a
storm
and
was
forced
to
land
in
Ireland
,
leaving
Cabot
to
sail
on
.
The
ambassador
notes
that
on
the
damaged
ship
was
‘
another

This
was
an
allusion

Based
on
limited
information
,
historians
thought
that
Carbonariis
was
a
minor
player
in
the
expeditions
,
and
may
not
have
sailed
further
than
Ireland
.
Historian
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Williamson_(historian)">
James
Williamson
</ref>
had
ascertained
that
Carbonariis
was
'
a
man
of
some
importance
'
,
having
served
as
an
envoy
between
the
Duke
of
Milan
and
Henry

,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-friar-4">

</ref>
of

<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_London">

</ref>
was
one
of
the
world
's
foremost
experts
on
John
Cabot
's
expedition
and
suggested
in
correspondence
that
Carbonariis
had
a
more
important
role
,
but
due
to
ill
health
was
unable
to
publish
her
findings
.
After
her
death
in
December
2005
,
all
of
her
research
notes
and
materials
were
destroyed
,
according
to
instructions
in
her
will
.
Learning
of
her
research
,
Dr
Evan
Jones
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Bristol">
University
of
Bristol
</ref>
has
re-investigated
her
claims
,
finding
new
documents
and
verifying
some
of
her
positions
.
This
includes
that
Carbonariis
was
an
Augustinian
friar
who
had
been
educated
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavia">
Pavia
</ref>
.
In
the
late
15th
century
,
he
was
serving
as
the
deputy
papal
tax
collector
in
England
.
Since
his
principal
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adriano_Castellesi">
Adriano
Castellesi
</ref>
,
had
been
in
Rome
since
1494
,
Carbonariis
was
in
effective
control
of
one
of
the
most
lucrative
clerical
appointments
in
England
.
In
this
period
,
the
Church
still
owned
about
one
third
of
the
land
in
England
,
and
the
Pope
took
ten
per
cent
of
the
income
generated
from
that
property
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-alwyn-5">

Based
on
his
position
,
Carbonariis
controlled
institutional
wealth
and
had
access
to
King
Henry
.

<p>
Fr
.
Giovanni
Antonio
Carbonariis
emerges
as
a
key
player
in
Ruddock
's
account
of
John
Cabot
's
voyages
.
While
she
never
published
a
full
account
,
she
claimed
that
he
was
the
explorer
's
most
important
backer
in
England
,
having
arranged
for
Cabot
to
get
a
loan
from
Italian
bankers
in
London
for
an
expedition
after
the
Venetian
arrived
in
London
in
1495
.
Even
more
importantly
,
she
suggests
that
it
was
Carbonariis
who
secured
Cabot
an
audience
with
King
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VII_of_England">
Henry
VII
of
England
</ref>
.
In
March
1496
Cabot
and
his
three
grown
sons
were
granted
royal
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letters_patent">
Letters
patent
</ref>
for
westward
exploration
.
Ruddock
also
claims
that
Carbonariis
outfitted
a
ship
,
called
the
<hi rend="italic">
Dominus
Nobiscum
</hi>
,
which
accompanied
the
1498
expedition
.
The
ship
carried
other
Italian
friars
who
,
with
Carbonariis
,
are
believed
to
have
established
a
church
and
religious
community
in
Newfoundland
.

While
the
religious
community
in
Newfoundland
is
thought
to
have
lasted
at
most
only
a
few
years
,
it
would
have
been
significant
as
North
America
's
first
Christian
settlement
.
This
church
appears
to
have
been
named
after
the
church
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Giovanni_a_Carbonara">
San
Giovanni
a
Carbonara
</ref>
in
Naples
,
which
was
the
mother
church
of
a
group
of
reformed
Augustinian
Friars
called
the
'
Carbonara
'
.
Dr
Ruddock
suggested
that
the
community
was
located
at
what
is
now
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonear,_Newfoundland_and_Labrador">
