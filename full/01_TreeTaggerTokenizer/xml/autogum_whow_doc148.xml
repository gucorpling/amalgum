Communicate
With
Older
Adults
</head>
<p>
Whether
you
are
visiting
a
grandparent
or
you
are
a
social
worker
who
deals
with
older
adults
from
time
to
time
,
age-related
health
problems
can
present
a
barrier
to
effective
communication
.
Chronic
conditions
,
such
as
dementia
and
hearing
loss
,
as
well
as
the
effects
of
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Remember_to_Take_Medication">
medication
</ref>
can
complicate
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Start_a_Conversation_with_a_Stranger">
conversations
</ref>
and
understanding
.
During
periods
of
diminished
lucidity
,
interactions
can
create
a
frustrating
and
seemingly
helpless
experience
.
However
,
there
are
techniques
you
can
use
to
help
facilitate
interaction
with
older
adults
to
create
a
communication-friendly
environment
.

<list type="ordered">
<item>
Be
aware
of
the
person
's
health
issues
.
Older
adults
may
have
health
problems
that
add
difficulty
to
speaking
and
understanding
.
Be
sure
you
consider
the
person
's
health
<hi rend="italic">
before
</hi>
you
engage
in
communication
.
For
example
,
they
may
have
hearing
problems
,
speech
problems
,
and
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Overcome_Short_Term_Memory_Loss">
memory
loss
</ref>
.
These
factors
complicate
communication
.
And
remember
,
chronological
age
is
not
always
a
true
indicator
of
a
person
’s
health
(
see
Warnings
)
.

<item>
Be
attentive
to
the
environment
in
which
you
are
communicating
.
Be
sure
to
evaluate
the
environment
in
which
you
are
communicating
,
which
might
have
an
effect
on
hearing
and
speech
problems
.
Is
there
any
disturbing
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Sleep_with_Lots_of_Noise">
background
noise
</ref>
?
Are
many
people
speaking
in
the
same
room
?
Is
there
any
intrusive
music
?
Are
there
any
distractions
that
could
affect
your
communication
?
Ask
the
older
adult
if
the
environment
is
comfortable
for
them
.
If
you
sense
any
disturbance
,
try
to
move
to
a
more
peaceful
and
quiet
location
.

Speak
clearly
</ref>
and
articulately
,
and
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Make_Eye_Contact">
make
eye
contact
</ref>
.
Older
adults
may
have
trouble
hearing
.
It
is
important
to
articulate
your
words
and
speak
clearly
.
Direct
your
speech
at
the
individual
's
face
--
not
to
their
side
.
Do
not
eat
your
words
:
move
your
mouth
and
pronounce
each
word
carefully
and
precisely
.
When
your
tongue
“
dances
”
inside
your
mouth
when
you
talk
,
you
articulate
more
clearly
.
If
your
tongue
“
sleeps
”
and
plays
a
passive
role
,
you
are
more
likely
not
articulating
as
well
as
you
could
.
<figure rend="Communicate With Older Adults Step 3.jpg">

</item>
<item>
Adjust
your
volume
appropriately
.
There
is
a
difference
between
enunciating
and
talking
loudly
.
Learn
to
adapt
your
voice
to
the
needs
of
the
individual
.
Evaluate
the
environment
and
how
it
relates
to
the
person
’s
hearing
abilities
.
Do
n't
shout
simply
because
the
listener
is
older
.
Treat
the
individual
with
respect
by
articulating
and
speaking
at
a
comfortable
volume
that
is
suitable
for
both
of
you
.
<figure rend="Communicate With Older Adults Step 4.jpg">

<item>
Use
clear
and
precise
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Ask_a_Question_Intelligently">
questions
</ref>
and
sentences
.
Do
not
hesitate
to
repeat
or
rephrase
your
sentences
and
questions
if
you
sense
there
is
an
absence
of
comprehension
.
Complicated
questions
and
sentences
may
confuse
older
adults
who
have
short-term
memory
or
hearing
loss
.
Clear
and
precise
constructions
are
easier
to
comprehend
.
<figure rend="Communicate With Older Adults Step 5.jpg">
</figure>
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Use
direct
questions
:
&quot;
Did
you
have
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Make_Lentil_Soup">
soup
</ref>
for
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Pack_a_Lunch_Box">
lunch
</ref>
?
&quot;
&quot;
Did
you
have
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Make_a_Salad">
salad
</ref>
for
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Order_a_Plate_Lunch">
lunch
</ref>
?
&quot;
Instead
of
:
&quot;
What
did
you
have
for
lunch
?
&quot;
The
more
precise
you
are
in
your
language
,
the
less
difficulty
the
elderly
have
in
understanding
.
</item>
<item>
Reduce
the
&quot;
noise
&quot;
in
your
sentences
and
questions
.
Limit
your
sentences
and
questions
to
20
words
or
less
.
Do
n't
use
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Find_the_Definition_of_Slang_Words">
slang
</ref>
or
filler
words
and
phrases
.
(
&quot;
Like
,
&quot;
&quot;
well
,
&quot;
and
&quot;
you
know
&quot;
are
a
few
examples
.
)
Keep
your
sentences
brief
and
direct
to
the
point
.
</item>
<item>
Avoid
the
confusion
of
mixed
ideas
and
questions
.
Try
to
define
your
ideas
and
questions
logically
.
If
you
mix
ideas
,
it
may
be
confusing
for
the
older
adult
to
understand
.
Express
one
idea
and
message
at
a
time
.
For
example
,
&quot;
It
is
a
good
idea
to
call
John
,
your
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Tolerate_an_Annoying_Brother">
brother
</ref>
.
Later
,
we
can
call
Susan
,
your
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Be_Friends_with_Your_Younger_Sister">
sister
</ref>
.
&quot;
A
more
complicated
construction
would
be
:
&quot;
I
think
we
should
call
your
brother
,
John
,
first
,
and
then
later
we
could
call
your
sister
,
Susan
.
&quot;
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Employ
visual
aids
,
if
possible
.
If
an
older
adult
has
a
hearing
or
memory
problem
,
it
is
important
to
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Be_Creative">
be
creative
</ref>
.
Visual
aids
help
.
Show
the
individual
what
or
who
you
are
talking
about
.
For
example
,
it
may
be
better
to
say
,
&quot;
Is
there
any
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Reduce_Chronic_Pain">
pain
</ref>
in
your
back
(
pointing
to
your
back
)
?
Is
there
any
pain
in
your
stomach
(
pointing
to
your
stomach
)
?
&quot;
instead
of
simply
asking
&quot;
Do
you
have
any
pain
or
discomfort
?

Take
it
slow

<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Be_Patient">
be
patient
</ref>
,
and
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Smile">
smile

.
</hi>
A
sincere
smile
shows
that
you
are
understanding
.
It
also
creates
a
friendly
environment
in
which
to
communicate
.
Remember
to
pause
between
sentences
and
questions
.
Give
the
individual
an
opportunity
to
understand
and
digest
information
and
questions
.
This
is
a
particularly
valuable
technique
if
a
person
has
memory
loss
.
When
you
pause
,
you
show
respect
and
patience
.

Tips
</head>
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Remember
that
touching
,
holding
hands
,
and
physical
warmth
often
communicate
more
than
words
.
</item>
<item>
Remember
that
a
few
words
of
love
and
respect
also
mean
a
lot
to
them
because
at
such
an
old
age
all
they
need
is
some
love
,
care
,
and
respect
.
</item>
<item>
If
the
older
adult
approves
,
you
may
want
to
consult
the
help
of
a
speech-language
pathologist
and/or
an
audiologist
.
These
are
professionals
that
specialize
in
communication
problems
and
may
be
able
to
help
.
They
focus
on
clear
speech
and
how
well
the
person
hears
,
not
comprehension
of
what
the
older
adult
is
hearing
.
</item>
<item>
Take
cultural
background
and
traditions
into
consideration
.
For
example
,
in
some
cultures
,
it
is
disrespectful
for
younger
generations
to
make
eye
contact
with
older
persons
.
A
younger
person
in
this
context
may
do
well
to
sit
alongside
and
face
in
the
same
direction
.
Above
all
-
follow
the
lead
of
the
elderly
person
.

<head>
Warnings
</head>
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Never
act
like
the
elderly
person
who
you
are
with
is
ancient
(
even
if
they
are
!
)
or
&quot;
obsolete
&quot;
.
Elderly
people
have
feelings
too
,
and
are
human
beings
just
like
everyone
else
.
Treat
them
with
respect
and
kindness
.
</item>
<item>
Not
all
older
adults
have
all
of
these
problems
!
There
are
many
senior
citizens
who
are
in
practically
perfect
mental
and
physical
health
.
Only
use
these
steps
if
you
sense
the
older
adult
has
trouble
communicating
,
otherwise
you
may
offend
him
or
her
.
