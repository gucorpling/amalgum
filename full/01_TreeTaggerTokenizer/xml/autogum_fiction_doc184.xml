Chapter
XV
</head>
<p>
A
forlorn
woman
went
along
a
lighted
avenue
.
The
street
was
filled
with
people
desperately
bound
on
missions
.
An
endless
crowd
darted
at
the
elevated
station
stairs
and
the
horse
cars
were
thronged
with
owners
of
bundles
.
</p>
<p>
The
pace
of
the
forlorn
woman
was
slow
.
She
was
apparently
searching
for
some
one
.
She
loitered
near
the
doors
of
saloons
and
watched
men
emerge
from
them
.
She
scanned
furtively
the
faces
in
the
rushing
stream
of
pedestrians
.
Hurrying
men
,
bent
on
catching
some
boat
or
train
,
jostled
her
elbows
,
failing
to
notice
her
,
their
thoughts
fixed
on
distant
dinners
.
</p>
<p>
The
forlorn
woman
had
a
peculiar
face
.
Her
smile
was
no
smile
.
But
when
in
repose
her
features
had
a
shadowy
look
that
was
like
a
sardonic
grin
,
as
if
some
one
had
sketched
with
cruel
forefinger
indelible
lines
about
her
mouth
.
</p>
<p>
Jimmie
came
strolling
up
the
avenue
.
The
woman
encountered
him
with
an
aggrieved
air
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Oh
,
Jimmie
,
I
've
been
lookin
'
all
over
fer
yehs
--
,
&quot;
she
began
.
</p>
<p>
Jimmie
made
an
impatient
gesture
and
quickened
his
pace
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Ah
,
do
n't
bodder
me
!
Good
Gawd
!
&quot;
he
said
,
with
the
savageness
of
a
man
whose
life
is
pestered
.
</p>
<p>
The
woman
followed
him
along
the
sidewalk
in
somewhat
the
manner
of
a
suppliant
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
But
,
Jimmie
,
&quot;
she
said
,
&quot;
yehs
told
me
ye
'd
--
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Jimmie
turned
upon
her
fiercely
as
if
resolved
to
make
a
last
stand
for
comfort
and
peace
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Say
,
fer
Gawd
's
sake
,
Hattie
,
don
'
foller
me
from
one
end
of
deh
city
teh
deh
odder
.
Let

,
will
yehs
!
Give
me
a
minute
's
res
'
,
ca

?
Yehs
makes
me
tired
,
allus
taggin

.
See

Ain

no
sense
.
Do
yehs
want
people
teh
get
onto
me
?
Go
chase
yerself
,
fer
Gawd
's
sake
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
woman
stepped
closer
and
laid
her
fingers
on
his
arm
.
&quot;
But
,
look-a-here
--
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Jimmie
snarled
.
&quot;
Oh
,
go
teh
hell
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
He
darted
into
the
front
door
of
a
convenient
saloon
and
a
moment
later
came
out
into
the
shadows
that
surrounded
the
side
door
.
On
the
brilliantly
lighted
avenue
he
perceived
the
forlorn
woman
dodging
about
like
a
scout
.
Jimmie
laughed
with
an
air
of
relief
and
went
away
.
</p>
<p>
When
he
arrived
home
he
found
his
mother
clamoring
.
Maggie
had
returned
.
She
stood
shivering
beneath
the
torrent
of
her
mother
's
wrath
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Well
,
I
'm
damned
,
&quot;
said
Jimmie
in
greeting
.
</p>
<p>
His
mother
,
tottering
about
the
room
,
pointed
a
quivering
forefinger
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Lookut
her
,
Jimmie
,
lookut
her
.
Dere
's
yer
sister
,
boy
.
Dere
's
yer
sister
.
Lookut
her
!
Lookut
her
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
She
screamed
in
scoffing
laughter
.
</p>
<p>
The
girl
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
.
She
edged
about
as
if
unable
to
find
a
place
on
the
floor
to
put
her
feet
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
,
&quot;
bellowed
the
mother
.
&quot;
Dere
she
stands
!
Ain
'
she
purty
?
Lookut

!
Ain
'
she
sweet
,
deh
beast
?
Lookut
her
!
Ha
,
ha
,
lookut
her
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
She
lurched
forward
and
put
her
red
and
seamed
hands
upon
her
daughter
's
face
.
She
bent
down
and
peered
keenly
up
into
the
eyes
of
the
girl
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Oh
,
she
's
jes
'
dessame
as
she
ever
was
,
ain
'
she
?
She
's
her
mudder
's

she
?
Lookut
her
,
Jimmie
!
Come
here
,
fer
Gawd
's
sake
,
and
lookut
her
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
loud
,
tremendous
sneering
of
the
mother
brought
the
denizens
of
the
Rum
Alley
tenement
to
their
doors
.
Women
came
in
the
hallways
.
Children
scurried
to
and
fro
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
What
's
up
?
Dat
Johnson
party
on
anudder
tear
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Naw
!
Young
Mag
's
come
home
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Deh
hell
yeh
say
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Through
the
open
door
curious
eyes
stared
in
at
Maggie
.
Children
ventured
into
the
room
and
ogled
her
,
as
if
they
formed
the
front
row
at
a
theatre
.
Women
,
without
,
bended
toward
each
other
and
whispered
,
nodding
their
heads
with
airs
of
profound
philosophy
.
A
baby
,
overcome
with
curiosity
concerning
this
object
at
which
all
were
looking
,
sidled
forward
and
touched
her
dress
,
cautiously
,
as
if
investigating
a
red-hot
stove
.
Its
mother
's
voice
rang
out
like
a
warning
trumpet
.
She
rushed
forward
and
grabbed
her
child
,
casting
a
terrible
look
of
indignation
at
the
girl
.
</p>
<p>
Maggie
's
mother
paced
to
and
fro
,
addressing
the
doorful
of
eyes
,
expounding
like
a
glib
showman
at
a
museum
.
Her
voice
rang
through
the
building
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Dere
she
stands
,
&quot;
she
cried
,
wheeling
suddenly
and
pointing
with
dramatic
finger
.
&quot;
Dere
she
stands
!
Lookut
her
!
Ain
'
she
a
dindy
?
An
'
she
was
so
good
as
to
come
home
teh
her
mudder
,
she
was
!
Ain
'
she
a
beaut
'
?
Ain
'
she
a
dindy
?
Fer
Gawd
's
sake
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
jeering
cries
ended
in
another
burst
of
shrill
laughter
.
</p>
<p>
The
girl
seemed
to
awaken
.
&quot;
Jimmie
--
&quot;
</p>
<p>
He
drew
hastily
back
from
her
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Well
,
now
,
yer
a
hell
of
a
t'ing
,
ain
'
yeh
?
&quot;
he
said
,
his
lips
curling
in
scorn
.
Radiant
virtue
sat
upon
his
brow
and
his
repelling
hands
expressed
horror
of
contamination
.
</p>
<p>
Maggie
turned
and
went
.
</p>
<p>
The
crowd
at
the
door
fell
back
precipitately
.
A
baby
falling
down
in
front
of
the
door
,
wrenched
a
scream
like
a
wounded
animal
from
its
mother
.
Another
woman
sprang
forward
and
picked
it
up
,
with
a
chivalrous
air
,
as
if
rescuing
a
human
being
from
an
oncoming
express
train
.
</p>
<p>
As
the
girl
passed
down
through
the
hall
,
she
went
before
open
doors
framing
more
eyes
strangely
microscopic
,
and
sending
broad
beams
of
inquisitive
light
into
the
darkness
of
her
path
.
On
the
second
floor
she
met
the
gnarled
old
woman
who
possessed
the
music
box
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
So
,
&quot;
she
cried
,
&quot;
'
ere
yehs
are
back
again
,
are
yehs
?
An
'
dey
've
kicked
yehs
out
?
Well
,
come
in
an
'
stay
wid
me
teh-night
.
I
ain
'
got
no
moral
standin
'
.
