It
's
been
two
nights
since
the
last
update
.
I
had
told
my
wife
about
having
seen
her
in
the
living
room
and
she
had
told
me
that
she
had
seen
me
in
the
bedroom
.
In
both
instances
,
it
was
definitely
not
us
.
We
had
agreed
to
sleep
in
the
same
bed
and
to
lock
the
front
door
.
The
first
night
,
neither
of
us
got
much
sleep
.
She
was
absolutely
terrified
,
and
I
had
been
totally
wrong
about
the
effect
that
would
have
on
her
bladder
.
She
had
to
get
up
to
use
the
bathroom
just
as
much
,
if
not
more
,
than
normal
.
Being
scared
,
she
required
that
I
get
up
and
escort
her
to
the
bathroom
and
back
.
It
was
a
mild
annoyance
,
but
I
got
where
she
was
coming
from
and
I
was
happy
to
oblige
.
While
standing
outside
the
bathroom
door
during
one
of
these
late
night
trips
,
I
saw
the
front
door
knob
start
to
turn
.
I
had
a
little
mini-heart
attack
as
I
watched
it
slowly
rotate
,
and
I
breathed
a
silent
sigh
of
relief
when
it
clicked
against
the
locking
mechanism
.
Then
it
did
it
again
.
And
again
,
a
little
harder
.
Summoning
all
of
the
courage
that
I
full
grown
man
behind
a
locked
door
with
another
adult
nearby
can
muster
,
I
walked
up
to
the
door
and
looked
through
the
peephole
.
That
was
stupid
.
It
was
night
time
.
I
could
n't
see
anything
.
As
I
slowly
reached
towards
the
switch
to
the
outside
lights
,
I
heard
the
toilet
flush
from
the
nearby
bathroom
followed
by
a
rustling
and
blur
of
movement
outside
.
I
returned
to
my
post
outside
of
the
bathroom
door
,
waited
while
my
wife
took
forever
to
wash
her
hands
,
and
then
went
back
to
bed
.
She
did
n't
need
to
know
what
had
just
happened
;
she
was
scared
enough
.
I
did
n't
sleep
for
the
rest
of
the
night
.
I
just
waited
and
listened
.
I
heard
the
door
knob
jiggle
one
more
time
that
night
.
I
saw
people-sized
shadows
move
past
the
blinds
.
I
could
just
barely
hear
the
back
door
being
jiggled
.
Finally
,
I
heard
a
loud
clang
,
a
bang
,
and
a
strange
,
long
,
wheezing
,
frustrated
moan
.
I
had
never
heard
anything
like
it
.
You
ever
get
mad
while
trying
to
fix
something
,
so
you
throw
your
tool
and
shout
&quot;
Ahh
!
&quot;
It
was
like
that
,
but
like
the
sound
was
made
while
inhaling
air
rather
than
exhaling
it
.
The
sound
woke
up
my
wife
,
who
started
freaking
out
,
and
neither
of
us
returned
to
sleep
.
Nothing
else
happened
that
night
.
In
the
morning
,
secure
in
the
safety
of
the
sunlight
and
the
hunting
rifle
in
my
hands
,
I
took
a
walk
around
the
outside
of
the
home
.
The
door
knob
on
the
back
door
had
been
completely
broken
.
The
knob
and
some
bent
inside-parts
were
on
the
ground
.
It
had
been
turned
until
it
broke
.
The
door
was
still
locked
;
I
had
to
jimmy
a
screwdriver
into
the
locking
mechanism
to
get
it
open
.
The
birdfeeders
had
also
been
knocked
over
.
Nothing
else
was
out
of
sorts
.
I
thought
it
over
all
morning
and
afternoon
,
but
I
finally
decided
to
tell
my
wife
what
had
happened
last
night
and
about
the
backdoor
.
She
had
spent
most
of
the
day
pacing
around
worried
,
and
I
was
really
unsure
as
to
whether
I
should
worry
her
more
.
As
I
suspected
,
that
new
information
sent
her
over
the
edge
.
She
wasted
no
time
in
grabbing
a
plastic
shopping
bag
of
clothes
and
heading
out
the
door
.
She
was
going
to
go
to
her
mother
's
house
about
an
hour
away
to
spend
the
night
.
I
would
have
gone
with
her
,
maybe
I
should
have
gone
with
her
,
but
I
had
a
~~better~~
different
plan
.
I
was
going
to
confront
whatever
it
was
that
had
been
visiting
us
and
,
if
it
was
aggressive
or
not
a
person
,
I
'd
put
it
down
.
I
secretly
hoped
that
it
was
friendly
,
after
all
,
it
had
never
attacked
either
of
us
despite
having
the
opportunity
.
At
the
same
time
,
the
backdoor
told
a
different
story
and
I
also
secretly
hoped
to
become
famous
by
killing
some
mythical
beast
.
About
20
minutes
after
my
wife
left
,
the
sun
had
gone
down
.
I
sat
by
an
open
window
that
overlooked
the
locked
front
door
and
waited
.
I
left
the
outside
lights
on
.
Around
midnight
I
got
a
text
message
from
my
wife
's
mother
.
She
wanted
to
know
if
everything
was
okay
,
as
my
wife
had
n't
shown
up
yet
despite
calling
to
tell
her
that
she
was
on
her
way
.
I
did
n't
know
what
to
do
.
I
replied
that
I
would
check
and
then
turned
off
my
phone
.
I
'll
deal
with
that
in
a
bit
.
I
could
see
my
wife
walking
up
the
driveway
.
She
walked
up
to
the
front
door
and
tried
to
turn
the
handle
.
It
was
still
locked
.
She
looked
like
a
kid
who
could
n't
figure
out
why
an
unplugged
TV
was
n't
turning
on
when
the
button
was
pressed
.
She
tried
to
turn
the
handle
again
.
I
had
her
in
my
opensights
,
but
I
was
having
second
thoughts
on
shooting
.
It
was
n't
like
you
might
see
on
TV
,
where
the
hero
hesitates
because
the
thing
looks
just
like
a
loved
one
and
he
has
trouble
pulling
the
trigger
.
Maybe
I
'm
heartless
,
but
I
was
mostly
worried
about
myself
.
This
thing
looks
just
like
my
wife
;
what
if
I
shoot
it
and
it
stays
that
way
?
No
cop
is
going
to
believe
that
this
was
n't
a
simple
case
of
a
husband
killing
his
wife
.
Heck
,
she
had
packed
a
bag
and
left
to
go
to
her
mom
's
,
which
definitely
sounds
like
the
result
of
a
fight
,
and
then
not
shown
up
.
&quot;
Hey
!
&quot;
I
shouted
down
in
my
most
assertive
voice
.
My
wife
froze
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
slowly
looked
up
at
me
.
&quot;
Explain
yourself
!
&quot;
&quot;
Is
.
Everything
.
Okay
.
Sweety
?
&quot;
She
replied
like
she
was
trying
to
talk
to
me
in
my
own
voice
.
It
was
a
mediocre
impression
of
my
voice
,
and
each
word
was
said
flatly
as
she
inhaled
.
Without
breaking
eye
contact
,
she
reached
over
and
tried
to
open
the
door
again
.
&quot;
Are
.
You
.
Okay
?
&quot;
&quot;
What
are
you
?
&quot;
I
shouted
back
.
&quot;
What
.
Are
.
You
.
&quot;
She
said
.
Was
she
just
repeating
me
?
No.
That
was
n't
me
.
She
was
n't
using
my
voice
anymore
.
That
was
my
wife
's
voice
.
&quot;
Get
.
Away
.
From
.
Me
.
&quot;
Her
eyes
never
looked
away
from
mine
and
she
was
turning
the
handle
harder
and
harder
.
&quot;
Stay
.
Back
.
Stop
.
&quot;
The
door
handle
cracked
and
the
door
started
to
open
.
I
shot
her
.
I
shot
it
.
I
do
n't
know
what
I
shot
,
but
it
was
n't
her
.
It
looks
like
her
.
I
ran
outside
.
The
body
feels
like
her
.
It
does
n't
smell
like
her
.
It
smells
like
copper
and
meat
.
I
called
my
wife
.
She
did
n't
answer
.
I
called
911
.
I
just
told
them
to
send
police
.
I
did
n't
tell
them
why
.
I
do
n't
know
what
I
'll
say
when
they
show
up
.
I
've
got
at
least
twenty
minutes
to
think
.
If
I
tell
them
the
truth
,
they
wo
n't
believe
me
.
They
'll
think
I
killed
my
wife
.
Would
an
autopsy
show
something
else
?
That
's
a
long
shot
.
If
I
tell
them
she
was
trying
to
break
in
to
hurt
me
,
I
've
got
the
broken
door
handles
to
back
me
up
,
but
they
probably
still
wo
n't
believe
me
.
I
do
n't
know
.
I
've
got
time
to
think
.
