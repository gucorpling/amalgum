Nigel
Farage

today
reversed
his
decision
to
stand
down
as
leader
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_Independence_Party">
UK
Independence
Party
</ref>
(
UKIP
)
after
its
National
Executive
Committee
(
NEC
)
rejected
his
resignation
.
Farage
had
previously
said
he
would
stand
down
as
leader
because
he
did
not
win
the

</ref>
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
This
offer
was
unanimously
rejected
by
the
NEC
members
who
produced
overwhelmingly
evidence
that
the
UKIP
membership
did
not
want
Nigel
to
go
&quot;
,
UKIP
chairman
Steve
Crowther
said
in
a
statement
.
&quot;
The
NEC
also
concluded
that
UKIP
's
general
election
campaign
had
been
a
great
success
.
We
have
fought
a
positive
campaign
with
a
very
good
manifesto
and
despite
relentless
,
negative
attacks
and
an
astonishing
last
minute
swing
to
the

]
,
that
in
these
circumstances
,
4
million
votes
was
an
extraordinary
achievement
.
On
that
basis
Mr
Farage
withdrew
his
resignation
and
will
remain
leader
of
UKIP
.
In
addition
the
NEC
recognised
that

and

best

to
fight
that
campaign

by
Nigel

Farage
said
he
had
been
reluctant
to
continue
being
party
leader
but
,
in
the
face
of
evidence
presented
to
him
by
the
NEC
,
&quot;
I
breathed
deep
,
and
thought
for
as
long
as
I
possibly
had
,
given
the
meeting
was
ongoing
,
and
still
is
,
at
my
time
of
writing
this
.
I
decided
that
as
much
as
I
had
earned
my
holidays
.
As
much
as
I
wanted
to
spend
the
summer
fishing
,
walking
,
and
of
course
,
in
the
European
Parliament
where
all
hell
is
currently
breaking
loose
—
that
I
owed
it
to
the
party
that
got
me
here
.
There
are
some
huge
battles
about
to
take
place
,
and
as
much
as
I
had
thought
that
taking
at
least
the
summer
off
was
in
my
best
interests
,
I
realise
now
that
the
party
comes
before
me

and
indeed

that
this
country
comes

both

,
including
UK
withdrawal
from
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/European_Union">

and
electoral
reform
,
Farage
said
:
&quot;
I
feel
the
need
to
stay
involved
for
just
a
little
bit
longer
,
to
add
my
voice
to
those
who
want
Britain
to
be
a
country
that
trades
and
deals
with
the
world

rather
than
ties
itself

and

.
&quot;
In
concluding
remarks
,
he
wrote
:
&quot;
Have
I
done
the
right
thing
by
my
party
and
my
country
?
I
think
so
.
And
I
’m
sure
many
people
will
have
their
opinions
on
the
matter
.
All
I
can
say
is
that
I
’m
ready

challenges

Farage
,
who
has
lead
the
party
since
2010
,
announced
his
resignation
on
Friday
,
with
the
recommendation
that

serve
as

leader

&quot;
I
feel
a

weight
has
been
lifted
off
my
shoulders

,
he
commented
at
the
time
.
After
intending
to
&quot;
take
the
summer
off
,
enjoy
meself
a
little
bit
,
not
do
very
much
politics
at
all
&quot;
,
Farage
said
,
a
UKIP
leadership
election
would
happen
in
September
;
he
would
decide
whether
or
not
to
stand
again
as
leader
at
a
later
date
.
On
the
same
day
,
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Ed_Miliband">
Ed
Miliband
</ref>
had
announced
he
would
stand
down
as
Labour
leader
,
while
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Nick_Clegg">
Nick
Clegg
</ref>
said
he
would
resign
as
leader
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Liberal_Democrats">
Liberal
Democrats
</ref>
.
</p>
<p>
UKIP
achieved
a
12.6
%
share
of
the
vote
at
the
general
election
,
an
increase
of
9.5
%
on
their
2010
performance
,
placing
them
third
behind
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)">
Labour
</ref>
and
Conservatives
in
terms
of
popular
vote
.
However
,
the
party
gained
only
one
seat
out
of
650
,
taken
by
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas%20Carswell">

.
Farage
has
claimed
these
results
illustrate
how
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post%20voting">
first-past-the-post
</ref>
,
the
electoral
system
used
in
UK
general
elections
,
is
&quot;
bankrupt
because
one
party
can
get
50
%
of
the
vote
in
Scotland
and
nearly
100
%
of
the
seats
,
and
our
party
can
get
4
million
votes
and
just
one
seat
.
[
...
]
For
those
reasons
there
are
a
lot
of
angry
UKIP
people
out
there
.
They
're
not
giving
up
on
UKIP
,
but
absolutely
determined
that
we
get
a
fairer
,
more
reflective
system
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Farage
was
once
a
Conservative
Party
member
but
left
the
party
,
objecting
to
the
UK
's
decision
to
sign
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maastricht%20Treaty">
Maastricht
Treaty
</ref>
creating
the
European
Union
,
and
became
a
founding
member
of
UKIP
in
1993
.
He
was
elected
as
an
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Member_of_the_European_Parliament">
MEP
</ref>
for
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South%20East%20England%20(European%20Parliament%20constituency)">

in
1999
and
began
his
first
stint
as
party
leader
in
2006
.
He
stood
down
in
2009
in
an
attempt
to
challenge
