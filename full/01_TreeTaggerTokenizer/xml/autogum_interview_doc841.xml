Ahmadinejad
came
to
Columbia
</ref>
and
brought
that
argument
up
.
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
NS
:
</hi>
Yeah
,
right
.
So
we
have
squandered
our
moral
legitimacy
,
we
have
squandered
the
legitimacy
of
the
whole
international
human
rights
regime
post
World
War
II
,
of
democracy
,
and
as
I
always
tell
my
students
,
once
you
lose
your
credibility
or
people
’s
respect
for
your
integrity
,
it
may
not
be
irreparable
,
but
it
takes
<hi rend="italic">
such
</hi>
a
long
time
to
restore
that
,
and
ultimately
our
national
security
depends
on
that
.
So
I
’m
really
fearful
.
I
’m
ultimately
optimistic
in
the
long
run
,
but
it
’s
a
longer
run
than
it
would
have
been
pre-9/11
,
and
not
because
of
the
terrorist
attacks
,
but
because
of
our
reaction
to
the
terrorist
attacks
.
And
the
use
of
that
to
get
us
into
Iraq
,
and
the
erosion
of
trust
—
this
is
something
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck%20Hagel">
Hagel
</ref>
was
talking
about
—
the
erosion
of
trust
toward
government
on
the
part
of
the
American
people
,
and
particularly
younger
generations
.
It
was
really
corrosive
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
It
’s
surprising
that
Hagel
gave
that
criticism
since
it
is
his
party
that
has
instituted
the
fear
of
government
into
our
culture
.
Such
as
Reagan
’s
famous
line
that
the
most
terrifying
words
in
the
English
language
are
,
“
I
’m
from
the
government
and
I
’m
here
to
help
.
”
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
NS
:
</hi>
These
parties
are
so
heterogeneous
,
believe
me
,
I
would
not
want
to
be
associated
with
a
single
one
.
Even
the
ACLU
does
things
I
personally
disagree
with
,
so
I
would
not
want
guilt
by
association
.
If
the
party
platform
reflected
[
Hagel
’s
]
views
,
it
would
be
a
different
party
than
it
is
now
.

When
I
interviewed
Gay
Talese
</ref>
,
I
asked
him
how
the
Iraq
War
affected
him
and
he
said
it
had
not
.
He
said
,
“
I
wish
it
did
!
”
He
said
he
does
n’t
feel
anything
and
that
he
does
n’t
think
anyone
else
does
,
either
.
He
feels
you
ca
n’t
have
a
war
affect
people
unless
you
have
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription%20in%20the%20United%20States">
conscription
</ref>
.
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
NS
:
</hi>
I
totally
agree
with
that
,
I
completely
agree
with
that
.
Charlie
Rangel
,
as
you
probably
know
,
I
completely
agree
with
that
.
The
ACLU
has
always
opposed
the
draft
,
going
back
to
our
founding
,
as
in
our
view
being
inconsistent
with
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">
Thirteenth
Amendment
</ref>
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involuntary%20servitude">
involuntary
servitude
</ref>
,
but
our
fall-back
position
has
always
been
,
having
lost
on
that
argument
,
that
if
you
are
going
to
have
a
draft
then
it
may
not
be
discriminatory
;
it
should
apply
to
women
as
well
as
men
.
We
took
that
case
to
the
Supreme
Court
.
You
ca
n’t
have
exemptions
for
students
and
others
who
are
privileged
,
and
partly
because
that
’s
consistent
with
Equal
Protection
guarantees
,
but
that
means
that
the
way
to
enforce
fairness
:
everybody
has
to
be
treated
equally
.
To
have
members
of
Congress
and
the
Executive
Branch
send
<hi rend="italic">
other
</hi>
people
’s
kids
off
to
war
,
or
other
people
’s
spouses
,
they
are
<hi rend="italic">
not
</hi>
making
a
responsible
decision
if
they
do
not
have
to
feel
the
cost
.
I
could
not
agree
with
that
more
strongly
.
The
result
might
be
then
we
would
then
have
no
war
.
It
’s
the
same
thing
with
all
the
deprivations
of
liberty
in
the
war
on
terror
,
if
I
may
say
so
.
All
those
surveys
that
say
,
“
Are
you
willing
to
give
up
freedom
to
enhance
national
security
?
”
The
reason
people
say
yes
is
they
are
willing
to
give
up
somebody
ELSE’S
freedom
.
Okay
,
so
take
it
away
from
the
Muslims
…
