CHAPTER
48
.
Agony
</head>
<p>
The
day
that
the
deed
of
gift
had
been
sent
to
the
king
,
the
cardinal
caused
himself
to
be
transported
to
Vincennes
.
The
king
and
the
court
followed
him
thither
.
The
last
flashes
of
this
torch
still
cast
splendor
enough
around
to
absorb
all
other
lights
in
its
rays
.
Besides
,
as
it
has
been
seen
,
the
faithful
satellite
of
his
minister
,
young
Louis
XIV
.
,
marched
to
the
last
minute
in
accordance
with
his
gravitation
.
The
disease
,
as
Guenaud
had
predicted
,
had
become
worse
;
it
was
no
longer
an
attack
of
gout
,
it
was
an
attack
of
death
;
then
there
was
another
thing
which
made
that
agony
more
agonizing
still
,
--
and
that
was
the
agitation
brought
into
his
mind
by
the
donation
he
had
sent
to
the
king
,
and
which
,
according
to
Colbert
,
the
king
ought
to
send
back
unaccepted
to
the
cardinal
.
The
cardinal
had
,
as
we
have
said
,
great
faith
in
the
predictions
of
his
secretary
;
but
the
sum
was
a
large
one
,
and
whatever
might
be
the
genius
of
Colbert
,
from
time
to
time
the
cardinal
thought
to
himself
that
the
Theatin
also
might
possibly
have
been
mistaken
,
and
that
there
was
at
least
as
much
chance
of
his
not
being
damned
,
as
there
was
of
Louis
XIV
.
sending
back
his
millions
.
</p>
<p>
Besides
,
the
longer
the
donation
was
in
coming
back
,
the
more
Mazarin
thought
that
forty
millions
were
worth
a
little
risk
,
particularly
of
so
hypothetic
a
thing
as
the
soul
.
Mazarin
,
in
his
character
of
cardinal
and
prime
minister
,
was
almost
an
atheist
,
and
quite
a
materialist
.
Every
time
that
the
door
opened
,
he
turned
sharply
round
towards
that
door
,
expecting
to
see
the
return
of
his
unfortunate
donation
;
then
,
deceived
in
his
hope
,
he
fell
back
again
with
a
sigh
,
and
found
his
pains
so
much
the
greater
for
having
forgotten
them
for
an
instant
.
</p>
<p>
Anne
of
Austria
had
also
followed
the
cardinal
;
her
heart
,
though
age
had
made
it
selfish
,
could
not
help
evincing
towards
the
dying
man
a
sorrow
which
she
owed
him
as
a
wife
,
according
to
some
;
and
as
a
sovereign
,
according
to
others
.
She
had
,
in
some
sort
,
put
on
a
mourning
countenance
beforehand
,
and
all
the
court
wore
it
as
she
did
.
</p>
<p>
Louis
,
in
order
not
to
show
on
his
face
what
was
passing
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
,
persisted
in
remaining
in
his
own
apartments
,
where
his
nurse
alone
kept
him
company
;
the
more
he
saw
the
approach
of
the
time
when
all
constraint
would
be
at
an
end
,
the
more
humble
and
patient
he
was
,
falling
back
upon
himself
,
as
all
strong
men
do
when
they
form
great
designs
,
in
order
to
gain
more
spring
at
the
decisive
moment
.
Extreme
unction
had
been
administered
to
the
cardinal
,
who
,
faithful
to
his
habits
of
dissimulation
,
struggled
against
appearances
,
and
even
against
reality
,
receiving
company
in
his
bed
,
as
if
he
only
suffered
from
a
temporary
complaint
.
</p>
<p>
Guenaud
,
on
his
part
,
preserved
profound
secrecy
;
wearied
with
visits
and
questions
,
he
answered
nothing
but
&quot;
his
eminence
is
still
full
of
youth
and
strength
,
but
God
wills
that
which
He
wills
,
and
when
He
has
decided
that
man
is
to
be
laid
low
,
he
will
be
laid
low
.
&quot;
These
words
,
which
he
scattered
with
a
sort
of
discretion
,
reserve
,
and
preference
,
were
commented
upon
earnestly
by
two
persons
,
--
the
king
and
the
cardinal
.
Mazarin
,
notwithstanding
the
prophecy
of
Guenaud
,
still
lured
himself
with
a
hope
,
or
rather
played
his
part
so
well
,
that
the
most
cunning
,
when
saying
that
he
lured
himself
,
proved
that
they
were
his
dupes
.
</p>
<p>
Louis
,
absent
from
the
cardinal
for
two
days
;
Louis
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
that
same
donation
which
so
constantly
preoccupied
the
cardinal
;
Louis
did
not
exactly
know
how
to
make
out
Mazarin
's
conduct
.
The
son
of
Louis
XIII
.
,
following
the
paternal
traditions
,
had
,
up
to
that
time
,
been
so
little
of
a
king
that
,
whilst
ardently
desiring
royalty
,
he
desired
it
with
that
terror
which
always
accompanies
the
unknown
.
Thus
,
having
formed
his
resolution
,
which
,
besides
,
he
communicated
to
nobody
,
he
determined
to
have
an
interview
with
Mazarin
.
It
was
Anne
of
Austria
,
who
,
constant
in
her
attendance
upon
the
cardinal
,
first
heard
this
proposition
of
the
king
's
,
and
transmitted
it
to
the
dying
man
,
whom
it
greatly
agitated
.
For
what
purpose
could
Louis
wish
for
an
interview
?
Was
it
to
return
the
deed
,
as
Colbert
had
said
he
would
?
Was
it
to
keep
it
,
after
thanking
him
,
as
Mazarin
thought
he
would
?
Nevertheless
,
as
the
dying
man
felt
that
the
uncertainty
increased
his
torments
,
he
did
not
hesitate
an
instant
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
His
majesty
will
be
welcome
,
--
yes
,
very
welcome
,
&quot;
cried
he
,
making
a
sign
to
Colbert
,
who
was
seated
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
,
and
which
the
latter
understood
perfectly
.
&quot;
Madame
,
&quot;
continued
Mazarin
,
&quot;
will
your
majesty
be
good
enough
to
assure
the
king
yourself
of
the
truth
of
what
I
have
just
said
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Anne
of
Austria
rose
;
she
herself
was
anxious
to
have
the
question
of
the
forty
millions
settled
--
the
question
which
seemed
to
lie
heavy
on
the
mind
of
every
one
.
Anne
of
Austria
went
out
;
Mazarin
made
a
great
effort
,
and
,
raising
himself
up
towards
Colbert
:
&quot;
Well
,
Colbert
,
&quot;
said
he
,
&quot;
two
days
have
passed
away
--
two
mortal
days
--
and
,
you
see
,
nothing
has
been
returned
from
yonder
.
