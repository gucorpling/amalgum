EB

</hi>
Yeah
,
well
that
--
and
also
,
it
reflects
sort
of
where
people
are
at
in
their
lives
,
and
so
,
you
know
,
romances
will
perennially
be
interesting
to
people
because
most
people
that
are
really
actively
looking
for
movies
and
books
are
in
their
twenties
and
thirties
,
and
they're
--
that
's
what
their
life
is
all
about
.
But
I
want
to
say
one
other
thing
,
which
I
--
I
actually
ran
a
symposium
at
the
Public
Library
a
couple
of
years
ago
,
which
nobody
seemed
to
find
very
important
,
but
I
really
think
is
important
,
which
is
:
If
you
really
want
to
look
for
the
new
literature
,
you
got
to
look
at
graphic
novels
,
which
are
wildly
popular
.
Just
look
at
them
,
look
at
the
way
they
're
structured
--
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
Yeah
.
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
EB
:
</hi>
--
and
look
at
the
way
they
tell
the
story
:
you
're
completely
outside
Psychological
Character-land
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil%20Gaiman">
Neil
Gaiman
</ref>
is
the
king
of
that
world
as
well
as
a
number
of
other
guys
,
and
then
they
're
making
movies
based
on
that
stuff
.

<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30%20Days%20of%20Night%20(film)">
30
Days
of
Night
</ref>
</hi>
is
a
good
example
of
that
,
too
,
where
you
did
have
a
central
character
,
but
you
did
n't
really
go
into
the
psychology
of
anything
.
It
was
based
on
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30%20Days%20of%20Night">
graphic
novel
</ref>
.
It
's
vampires
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrow,%20Alaska">
Barrow
,
Alaska
</ref>
.
You
do
n't
go
into
the
vampires
at
all
.
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
EB
:
</hi>
No
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
One
of
the
criticisms
that
somebody
told
me
was
that
they
really
did
n't
go
into
the
vampires
.
You
had
these
creatures
show
up
;
they
wanted
to
kill
.
They
were
interesting
,
but
you
did
n't
go
into
what
motivated
them
--
it
became
more
about
survival
.
You
had
all
of
these
different
scenarios
and
how
people
's
lives
affected
how
they
reacted
to
this
sudden
threat
that
had
entered
their
town
.
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
EB
:
</hi>
Right
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
It
was
sort
kind
of
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinwheel%20narrative">
pinwheel
narrative
</ref>
,
but
you
did
n't
get
into
,
&quot;
What
's
driving
them
?
What
can
stop
them
?
&quot;
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
EB
:
</hi>
Yeah
,
that
's
our
little
symposium
on
the
future
of
narrative
.

DS
:
What
is
something
you
notice
missing
from
your
Wikipedia
article
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
EB
:
</hi>
There
are
two
items
that
are
interesting
that
are
n't
on
my
Wikipedia
article
.
I
do
n't
know
how
big
that
page
has
to
be
,
but
I
made
an
album
with
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank%20Zappa">
Frank
Zappa
</ref>
in
1986
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
What
's
it
called
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
EB
:
</hi>
It
's
called
<hi rend="italic">
Blood
on
the
Canvas
</hi>
.
I
also
co-created
a
TV
series
with
Spielberg
in
1996
that
ran
for
two
years
on
ABC
called
High
Incident
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
How
do
you
come
across
these
projects
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
EB
:
</hi>
They
get
in
touch
with
me
.
There
were
times
when
I
was
sort
of
an
interesting
person
and
I
'd
get
a
call
from
somebody
who
's
working
with
Frank
Zappa
and
ask
me
if
I
would
like
to
meet
with
him
?
Very
often
I
'll
meet
with
somebody
and
there
's
really
nowhere
to
go
with
it
,
or
you
ca
n't
really
figure
out
how
to
make
it
happen
and
it
would
be
great
if
it
did
,
but
--
it
does
n't
.
But
in
the
case
of
Zappa
,
I
mean
he
's
one
of
my
greatest
heroes
;
I
would
do
whatever
he
wanted
to
do
,
and
that
's
what
we
ended
up
doing
.
