Early
career
</head>
<p>
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Carrillo">
Carrillo
de
Mendoza
</ref>
was
born
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valladolid">
Valladolid
</ref>
.
He
joined
the
army
at
an
early
age
,
where
he
was
distinguished
by
his
energy
,
valor
and
intelligence
.
He
rose
to
the
rank
of
cavalry
general
,
and
was
made
lord
of
the
bedchamber
for
the
king
.
He
served
as
viceroy
of
Aragon
before
being
sent
to
the
Americas
.
</p>
<head>
Viceroy
of
New
Spain
</head>
<p>
Arriving
in
New
Spain
in
1621
,
he
found
the
administration
in
a
bad
state
and
immediately
took
steps
to
improve
the
moral
standards
of
the
functionaries
.
He
organized
detachments
of
armed
highway
patrolmen
and
assigned
them
to
the
principal
highways
to
combat
an
epidemic
of
robbery
.
He
authorized
the
immediate
hanging
of
robbers
caught
in
the
act
.
</p>
<p>
He
bought
grain
and
distributed
it
to
the
poor
of
the
capital
and
its
environs
to
combat
the
continuing
drought
and
famine
.
He
opposed
the
monopoly
of
the
grain
merchants
,
formed
to
drive
up
prices
.
This
made
him
enemies
.
Also
in
his
first
year
,
he
founded
a
chair
of
surgery
at
the
University
.
This
chair
was
first
occupied
by
the
Mexican-born
doctor
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristóbal_Hidalgo_y_Bandabal">

(

.

<p>
On
March
7
,
1623
the
viceroy
ordered
work
on
the
drainage
system
of
the
Valley
of
Mexico
to
cease
,
because
he
considered
it
costly
and
unlikely
to
be
effective
.
He
also
ordered
the
destruction
of
the
dike
that
diverted
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Río_Cuautitlán">
Río
Cuautitlán
</ref>
from
entering
the
lakes
around
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City">

</ref>
.
However
,
the
next
rainy
season
led
again
to
large
floods
,
many
lost
lives
and
much
damage
.
This
caused
a
considerable
loss
of
the
viceroy
's
prestige
.
</p>
<head>
Conflict
with
the
archbishop
</head>
<p>
As
the
result
of
numerous
complaints
concerning
venality
and
partiality
,
Viceroy
Carrillo
de
Mendoza
began
an
investigation
of
the
archbishop
of
Mexico
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Pérez_de_la_Serna">
Juan
Pérez
de
la
Serna
</ref>
.
The
viceroy
instructed
the
archbishop
not
to
grant
divorces
so
readily
,
not
to
accept
gifts
,
and
not
to
charge
high
prices
in
the
butcher
shop
the
archbishop
owned
.
</p>
<p>
This
caused
animosity
between
the
two
,
but
the
final
break
occurred
because
of
a
court
case
against
Melchor
Pérez
de
Veraiz
,
<hi rend="italic">
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corregidor_(position)">
corregidor
</ref>
</hi>
of
Mexico
City
.
Pérez
de
Veraiz
was
accused
of
monopolizing
maize
and
keeping
illicit
granaries
.
He
fled
to
the
convent
of
Santo
Domingo
to
avoid
arrest
.
The
judges
posted
guards
around
the
convent
,
but
the
archbishop
,
invoking
ecclesiastical
immunity
,
excommunicated
the
judges
,
their
clerks
and
the
soldiers
.
The
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiencia_Real">
Audiencia
</ref>
appealed
to
the
bishop
of
Puebla
,
the
apostolic
judge
in
such
cases
,
and
he
ordered
the
excommunicated
absolved
.
Archbishop
Pérez
de
la
Serna
responded
with
a
general
interdiction
,
closing
all
the
churches
in
the
capital
for
some
days
.
</p>
<p>
On
January
11
,
1624
,
the
archbishop
in
his
sedan
chair
made
an
appearance
at
the
viceregal
palace
,
in
front
of
an
excited
crowd
.
Also
present
was
the
viceroy
,
who
together
with
the
Audiencia
,
had
determined
to
depose
the
archbishop
.
The
archbishop
responded
by
excommunicating
the
viceroy
and
the
members
of
the
Audiencia
.
He
reiterated
the
interdiction
and
ordered
clerics
on
horseback
to
ride
the
streets
of
the
capital
shouting
&quot;
<hi rend="italic">
¡
Viva
Cristo
!
</hi>
&quot;
and
&quot;
<hi rend="italic">
¡
Muera
el
mal
gobierno
!
</hi>
&quot;
(
&quot;
Long
live
Christ
!
&quot;
and
&quot;
Death
to
bad
government
!
&quot;
)
.
</p>
<p>
Thereupon
the
viceroy
arrested
the
archbishop
and
ordered
him
escorted
back
to
Spain
.
</p>
<p>
Three
of
the
members
of
the
Audiencia
revoked
the
order
deposing
the
archbishop
,
but
the
viceroy
took
prisoners
.
All
of
this
provoked
a
popular
riot
on
January
15
,
1624
in
front
of
the
viceregal
palace
demanding
the
resignation
of
the
viceroy
.
The
rioters
burned
part
of
the
palace
and
invaded
part
.
That
afternoon
Archbishop
Pérez
,
who
in
the
meantime
had
been
allowed
to
escape
,
proclaimed
Carrillo
de
Mendoza
deposed
as
viceroy
,
and
nominated
Licenciado
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Gabiría">
Pedro
Gabiría
</ref>
as
captain
general
.
That
night
the
viceroy
,
on
the
point
of
being
killed
by
the
mob
,
disguised
himself
as
a
servant
and
fled
to
the
church
of
San
Francisco
,
where
he
remained
,
surrounded
by
guards
.
&quot;
Although
the
crown
briefly
reinstated
Gelves
before
replacing
him
,
the
marqués
was
in
effect
the
first
Mexican
viceroy
overthrown
by
popular
revolt
.

In

,
where
he
had
an
audience
with
King
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_IV_of_Spain">
Philip

and
attempted
to
justify
his
decisions
as
viceroy
.
The
king
approved
some
of
the
measures
he
had
taken
against
the
archbishop
,
but
rejected
others
.
