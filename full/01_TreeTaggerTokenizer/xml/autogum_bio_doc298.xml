Life
</head>
<p>
Hans
Witdoeck
was
a
pupil
of
the
engraver
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_Vorsterman">
Lucas
Vorsterman
</ref>
in
the
years
1630-1631
.
Vorsterman
had
joined
Rubens
'
workshop
around
1617
or
1618
and
had
established
himself
as
Rubens
'
primary
engraver
since
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-4">
[

</ref>
Hans
Witdoeck
broke
the
three-year
training
contract
with
Vorsterman
after
only
two
years
at
the
instigation
of
his
father
.
He
then
trained
for
two
years
with
the
painter
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornelis_Schut">
Cornelis
Schut
</ref>
who
introduced
him
to
painting
.
He
subsequently
trained
with
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Paul_Rubens">
Rubens
</ref>
where
he
learned
the
engraving
of
large
plates
.
After
the
death
of
Rubens
in
1640
,
Witdoeck
worked
mainly
as
an
art
dealer
.
</p>
<p>
He
married
Catherina
Gommaerts
on
24
June
1642
.
Since
there
are
no
further
records
on
Withdoeck
following
his
marriage
,
it
is
presumed
that
he
died
shortly
afterwards
.

Work
</head>
<p>
In
his
early
engravings
he
made
for
Cornelis
Schut
,
Witdoeck
followed
a
traditional
style
similar
to
that
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornelis_Galle_the_Elder">
Cornelis
Galle
</ref>
and
his
workshop
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-ox-3">
[

]
</ref>
This
early
style
was
characterized
by
dry
lines
using
many
curves
and
an
emphasis
on
plasticity
.
Witdoeck
made
two
engravings
after
paintings
of
Cornelis
Schut
and
nine
Madonna
images
,
usually
of
a
small
size
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Rubens-5">

His
style
became
more
fluid
while
he
worked
at
Rubens
'
workshop
where
he
produced
his
best
work
.

At
Rubens
'
workshop
Witdoeck
learned
to
engrave
large
plates
.
Witdoeck
worked
between
1634
and
1638
under
the
close
supervision
of
Rubens
on
many
engravings
,
including
<hi rend="italic">
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Meeting_Between_Abraham_and_Melchizedek_(Rubens)">

and
Melchizedek

</ref>
</hi>
,
<hi rend="italic">
Cicero
</hi>
and
<hi rend="italic">
Demosthenes
</hi>
.
Rubens
specified
the
year
1638
for
all
these
prints
likely
so
that
he
only
needed
to
apply
for
one
printing
privilege
for
the
lot
.
The
following
year
an
<hi rend="italic">
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assumption_of_the_Virgin_Mary_(Rubens)">
Assumption
of
Mary
</ref>
</hi>
and
the
<hi rend="italic">
Miracle
of
St.
Just
</hi>
by
Witdoeck
were
published
.
Witdoeck
also
produced
a
few
undated
prints
while
at
Rubens
'
workshop
.

<p>
It
is
clear
from
the
revision
and
production
process
of
these
prints
that
Rubens
was
closely
involved
in
their
design
and
execution
.

This
is
documented
by
the
process
of
the
creation
of
a
series
of
twelve
plates
after
antique
marble
portrait
sculptures
(
heads
,
busts
,
herms
)
by
the
four
printmakers
Hans
Witdoeck
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulus_Pontius">
Paulus
Pontius
</ref>
,
Lucas
Vorsterman
,
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boetius_à_Bolswert">
Boetius
à
Bolswert
</ref>
working
for
Rubens
.
The
production
of
the
prints
was
closely
supervised
by
Rubens
as
is
demonstrated
by
five
retouched
proof
impressions
.
Only
six
of
Rubens
'
preparatory
drawings
for
the
series
have
survived
.

Witdoeck
showed
in
his
prints
after
Rubens
a
great
skill
in
capturing
the
movement
and
variety
of
colour
in
the
original
works
through
his
clever
use
of
black
,
grey
and
white
tones
.
A
typical
example
is

Abraham
and
Melchizedek

.
