Descriptive
Results
</head>
<p>
The
data
set
gained
according
to
the
method
described
in
Section
4.2
is
assessed
for
plausibility
by
calculating
the
minimum
,
maximum
and
first
two
sample
moments
.
Table

shows
the

<p>
From
Table
5
,
the
great
variance
of
distribution
grids
in
Baden-Württemberg
is
evident
.
Population
density
(
Dpo
in
Inhabitants
km−2
)
is
between
54
and
5288
.
The
number
of
inhabitants
in
the
lowest
voltage
level
nia
corresponds
in
distribution
.
The
number
of
grid
connection
points
ngc
ranges
from
around
300
to
3,000,000
.
Equally
the
other
attributes
,
withdrawal
of
electricity
WOP
and
yearly
photovoltaic
feed-in
WPV
vary
widely
.

shows
the
clustering
results
for
the
attributes
and
DPO
,
which
examines
that
high
population
density
requires
high
levels
of
peak
power
photovoltaics
in
grid
connection
points
.
</p>
<p>
Using
k-Means
four
plausible
clusters
are
identified
,
where
three
clusters
show
areas
of
low
to
moderate
population
density
and
three
levels
(
circle
,
square
,
triangle
)
of
peak
power
photovoltaics
per
grid
connection
point
.
For
the
cluster
marked
with
cross
low
population
density
corresponds
with
the
installed
peak
power
capacity
.
For
the
intermediate
cluster
no
definite
statement
on
the
adequacy
of
grid
development
can
be
made
.
For
the
upper
third
cluster
(
triangle
)
,
the
installed
PV
peak
power
capacity
is
high
as
compared
to
population
density
and
there
are
no
development
requirements
at
present
.
The
right/lower
forth
cluster
(
cross
)
however
is
critical
due
low
installed
PV
peak
power
capacity
in
spite
of
high
population
density
.
Further
development
needs
could
result
,
when
PV
fed-in
steps
up
.
</p>
<p>
The
results
for
k-means
clustering
provide
some
overview
on
the
network
structure
but
are
little
precise
concerning
the
results
.
A
comparatively
high
number
of
DSO
results
in
the
top-left
(
triangle
)
cluster
or
in
the
second
cluster
(
squares
)
,
while
only
a
single
critical
DSO
in
the
fourth
cluster
(
cross
)
is
identified
.
The
method
risks
to
underestimate
check-up
and
development
requirements
.

Figure

shows
the
clustering
results
with
k-means
considering
the
attributes
lc
and
ngc
.
</p>
<p>
The
area
in
the
left
lower
quadrant
comprises
the
grids
of
with
few
of
grid
connection
points
ngc
(
for
each
grid-
and
transformation
level
)
and
low
cable
length
lc
,
which
is
typical
for
lean
rural
grids
.
The
grids
located
in
the
upper
right
quadrant
are
characterized
by
a
large
number
of
grid
connection
points
and
high
cable
lengths
,
a
typical
status
of
well-developed
urban
grids
.
K-means
identifies
a
fourth
cluster
comprising
only
a
single
grind
with
very
high
lc
and
ngc
values
,
which
like
the
grids
in
cluster
3
is
balanced
and
thus
does
not
require
development
.
The
grids
in
the
lower
right
section
have
got
a
large
number
of
connection
points
and
low
cable
lengths
i.e.
are
densely
interconnected
,
and
there
is
no
development
need
.
K-Means
clustering
delivers
a
large
number
of
grids
in
this
section
,
which
however
are
broadly
dispersed
and
partly
overlap
with
other
sections
.
The
upper
left
area
however
comprises
grids
of
high
cable
length
but
few
interconnection
points
.
These
grids
are
poorly
interconnected
to
neighboring
networks
and
among
themselves
and
should
be
developed
further
to
master
high
photovoltaic
peak
inflows
.
K-means
locates
none
of
the
grids
in
this
section
.
Since
these
results
of
k-means
do
not
deliver
precise
information
on
development
requirements
,
other
algorithms
are
tried
to
obtain
more
distinct
insights
.

Results
for
DBSCAN
Algorithm
</head>
<p>
To
improve
and
validate
the
results
,
now
the
corresponding
analysis
is
performed
with
the
DBSCAN
Algorithm
and
using
four
clusters
with
the
parameters
of
nmin
=
3
and
ε
=
0.07
.

Figure

</figure>
illustrates
that
DB
SCAN
identifies
essentially
three
comprehensive
clusters
of
DSO
.
Some
noise
(
cross
)
remains
.
The
first
cluster
(
circle
)
in
the
left-bottom
area
comprises
DSO
in
rural
areas
,
i.
e.
,
of
low
population
density
and
low
peak
power
photovoltaics
in
grid
connection
points
.
The
grids
in
this
cluster
are
adequately
equipped
corresponding
to
the
present
low
PV-requirements
.
The
second
cluster
(
square
)
comprises
DSO
with
low
population
density
but
high
peak
power
photovoltaics
in
grid
connection
points
,
these
grids
are
very
well
equipped
above
the
requirements
at
present
.
The
third
cluster
(
triangle
)
on
the
other
hand
comprises
DSO
with
high
population
density
buy
low
peak
power
photovoltaics
in
grid
connection
points
,
i.
e.
,
poorly
furnished
grids
which
should
be
inspected
and
remunerated
to
stabilize
the
Baden-Württemberg
TSO
network
as
a
whole
.
</p>
<p>
Although
there
is
some
noise
the
DBSCAN
Algorithm
provides
valuable
results
and
reliably
extracts
grids
with
remuneration
needs
.
The
results
for
Baden-Württemberg
are
more
plausible
for
DBSCAN
than
for
K-Means
,
since
DBSCAN
selects
a
limited
number
of
improvable
DSO
more
accurately
.
