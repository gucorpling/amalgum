Home
Maintenance

<p>
Maintaining
that
home
is
not
something
that
most
of
us
are
prepared
for
and
can
sometimes
be
overwhelming
.
However
,
if
planned
correctly
,
home
maintenance
can
be
a
rewarding
experience
.
Home
maintenance
should
be
thought
of
like
the
maintenance
of
your
car
.
To
keep
it
performing
at
its
best
,
it
should
be
done
on
time
,
correctly
and
by
someone
who
knows
what
they
’re
doing
.
The
secret
to
lower
out
of
pocket
expenses
and
lowering
the
number
of
unplanned
breakdowns
is
a
good
preventative
regime
.
In
the
long
run
preventative
home
maintenance
is
much
cheaper
than
reactive
maintenance
that
you
're
unprepared
for
.
