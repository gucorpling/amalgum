WHAT
A
SPARROW
SAW
</head>
<p>
Ever
since
the
eventful
morning
when
Carl
had
neglected
the
Big
Gray
for
a
stolen
hour
with
Jennie
,
Cully
had
busied
himself
in
devising
ways
of
making
the
Swede
's
life
miserable
.
With
a
boy
's
keen
insight
,
he
had
discovered
enough
to
convince
him
that
Carl
was
“
dead
mashed
on
Jennie
,
”
as
he
put
it
,
but
whether
“
for
keeps
”
or
not
he
had
not
yet
determined
.
He
had
already
enriched
his
songs
with
certain
tender
allusions
to
their
present
frame
of
mind
and
their
future
state
of
happiness
.
“
Where
was
Moses
when
the
light
went
out
!
”
and
“
Little
Annie
Rooney
”
had
undergone
so
subtle
a
change
when
sung
at
the
top
of
Mr.
James
Finnegan
's
voice
that
while
the
original
warp
and
woof
of
those
very
popular
melodies
were
entirely
unrecognizable
to
any
but
the
persons
interested
,
to
them
they
were
as
gall
and
wormwood
.
This
was
Cully
's
invariable
way
of
expressing
his
opinions
on
current
affairs
.
He
would
sit
on
the
front-board
of
his
cart
,
--
the
Big
Gray
stumbling
over
the
stones
as
he
walked
,
the
reins
lying
loose
,
--
and
fill
the
air
with
details
of
events
passing
in
the
village
,
with
all
the
gusto
of
a
variety
actor
.
The
impending
strike
at
the
brewery
had
been
made
the
basis
of
a
paraphrase
of
“
Johnnie
,
get
your
gun
;
”
and
even
McGaw
's
red
head
had
come
in
for
its
share
of
abuse
to
the
air
of
“
Fire
,
boys
,
fire
!
”
So
for
a
time
this
new
development
of
tenderness
on
the
part
of
Carl
for
Jennie
served
to
ring
the
changes
on
“
Moses
”
and
“
Annie
Rooney
.
”
</p>
<p>
Carl
's
budding
hopes
had
been
slightly
nipped
by
the
cold
look
in
Tom
's
eye
when
she
asked
him
if
it
took
an
hour
to
give
Jennie
a
tattered
apron
.
With
some
disappointment
he
noticed
that
except
at
rare
intervals
,
and
only
when
Tom
was
at
home
,
he
was
no
longer
invited
to
the
house
.
He
had
always
been
a
timid
,
shrinking
fellow
where
a
woman
was
concerned
,
having
followed
the
sea
and
lived
among
men
since
he
was
sixteen
years
old
.
During
these
earlier
years
he
had
made
two
voyages
in
the
Pacific
,
and
another
to
the
whaling-ground
in
the
Arctic
seas
.
On
this
last
voyage
,
in
a
gale
of
wind
,
he
had
saved
all
the
lives
aboard
a
brig
,
the
crew
helpless
from
scurvy
.
When
the
lifeboat
reached
the
lee
of
her
stern
,
Carl
at
the
risk
of
his
life
climbed
aboard
,
caught
a
line
,
and
lowered
the
men
,
one
by
one
,
into
the
rescuing
yawl
.
He
could
with
perfect
equanimity
have
faced
another
storm
and
rescued
a
second
crew
any
hour
of
the
day
or
night
,
but
he
could
not
face
a
woman
's
displeasure
.
Moreover
,
what
Tom
wanted
done
was
law
to
Carl
.
She
had
taken
him
out
of
the
streets
and
given
him
a
home
.
He
would
serve
her
in
whatever
way
she
wished
as
long
as
he
lived
.
</p>
<p>
He
and
Gran'pop
were
fast
friends
.
On
rainy
days
,
or
when
work
was
dull
in
the
winter
months
,
the
old
man
would
often
come
into
Carl
's
little
chamber
,
next
the
harness-room
in
the
stable
,
and
sit
on
his
bed
by
the
hour
.
And
Carl
would
tell
him
about
his
people
at
home
,
and
show
him
the
pictures
tacked
over
his
bed
,
those
of
his
old
mother
with
her
white
cap
,
and
of
the
young
sister
who
was
soon
to
be
married
.
</p>
<p>
On
Sundays
Carl
followed
Tom
and
her
family
to
church
,
waiting
until
they
had
left
the
house
.
He
always
sat
far
back
near
the
door
,
so
that
he
could
see
them
come
out
.
Then
he
would
overtake
Pop
with
Patsy
,
whenever
the
little
fellow
could
go
.
This
was
not
often
,
for
now
there
were
many
days
when
the
boy
had
to
lie
all
day
on
the
lounge
in
the
sitting-room
,
poring
over
his
books
or
playing
with
Stumpy
,
brought
into
the
kitchen
to
amuse
him
.
</p>
<p>
Since
the
day
of
Tom
's
warning
look
,
Carl
rarely
joined
her
daughter
.
Jennie
would
loiter
by
the
way
,
speaking
to
the
girls
,
but
he
would
hang
back
.
He
felt
that
Tom
did
not
want
them
together
.
</p>
<p>
One
spring
morning
,
however
,
a
new
complication
arose
.
It
was
a
morning
when
the
sky
was
a
delicate
violet-blue
,
when
the
sunlight
came
tempered
through
a
tender
land
haze
and
a
filmy
mist
from
the
still
sea
,
when
all
the
air
was
redolent
with
sweet
smells
of
coming
spring
,
and
all
the
girls
were
gay
in
new
attire
.
Dennis
Quigg
had
been
lounging
outside
the
church
door
,
his
silk
hat
and
green
satin
necktie
glistening
in
the
sun
.
When
Jennie
tripped
out
Quigg
started
forward
.
The
look
on
his
face
,
as
with
swinging
shoulders
he
slouched
beside
her
,
sent
a
thrill
of
indignation
through
Carl
.
He
could
give
her
up
,
perhaps
,
if
Tom
insisted
,
but
never
to
a
man
like
Quigg
.
Before
the
walking
delegate
had
“
passed
the
time
of
day
,
”
the
young
sailor
was
close
beside
Jennie
,
within
touch
of
her
hand
.
</p>
<p>
There
was
no
love
lost
between
the
two
men
.
Carl
had
not
forgotten
the
proposition
Quigg
had
made
to
him
to
leave
Tom
's
employ
,
nor
had
Quigg
forgotten
the
uplifted
shovel
with
which
his
proposal
had
been
greeted
.
Yet
there
was
no
well-defined
jealousy
between
them
.
Mr.
Walking
Delegate
Dennis
Quigg
,
confidential
agent
of
Branch
No.
3
,
Knights
of
Labor
,
had
too
good
an
opinion
of
himself
ever
to
look
upon
that
“
tow-headed
duffer
of
a
stable-boy
”
in
the
light
of
a
rival
.
Nor
could
Carl
for
a
moment
think
of
that
narrow-chested
,
red-faced
,
flashily
dressed
Knight
as
being
able
to
make
the
slightest
impression
on
“
Mees
Jan.
”
