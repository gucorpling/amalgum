2

Hi
,
I
recently
purchased
a
new
pair
of
loudspeakers
and
an
amp
to
replace
my
old
amp
-
I
saw
no
reason
to
not
hook
up
my
old
pair
of
loudspeakers
to
my
amp
with
the
new
ones
too
,
but
upon
doing
so
I
've
noticed
that
the
volume
levels
of
each
pair
are
very
different
-
the
old
pair
only
add
a
little
to
the
overall
sound
.
My
amplifier
is
a
Pioneer
A-10K
,
one
pair
of
speakers
are
B&amp;O
Beovox
S60s
,
and
the
other
(
old
)
pair
are
pioneer
S-P510s
(
they
're
not
very
good
,
and
were
sold
originally
as
a
whole
package
with
a
different
amplifier
)
.
I
do
n't
really
understand
the
electrical
theory
stuff
,
but
as
far
as
I
've
found
on
the
internet
(
both
pairs
bought
second
hand
,
I
do
n't
have
a
user
's
manual
)
they
have
the
same
impedance
.
Could
anyone
tell
me
the
main
factors
which
would
cause
this
difference
and
(
if
possible
)
a
way
to
fix
it
?
Sorry
if
this
is
a
silly
question
,
google
did
n't
really
ease
my
confusion
.
TL
;
DR
why
are
two
pairs
of
loudspeakers
hooked
up
the
same
amp
with
the
same
impedance
producing
different
volumes
.
Thank
you

Different
speakers
have
different
sensitivities
efficiencies
.
</p>
<p>
This
is
a
great
explanation
of
the
differences
similarities
that
you
might
find
useful
.
Note
:
SPL
(
sound
pressure
level
)
is
expressed
in
decibels
(
dB
's
)
.
</p>
<p>
&gt;Well
,
my
answer
is
a
little
bit
different
-
so
I
guess
you
get
to
take
your
pick
!
</p>
<p>
&gt;Unfortunately
the
relevant
terms
get
used
inconsistently
or
imprecisely
,
leading
many
people
to
think
that
efficiency
and
sensitivity
are
the
same
thing
.
</p>
<p>
&gt;Here
is
the
convention
that
I
follow
.
Some
manufacturers
also
follow
this
,
but
not
all
.
</p>
<p>
&gt;As
commonly
used
in
consumer
audio
,
efficiency
is
the
1
meter
on-axis
broadband
anechoic
SPL
that
a
speaker
delivers
with
a
1
watt
input
.
Some
manufacturers
use
a
non-anechoic
measurement
(
including
room
contribution
)
,
and
some
use
a
peak
somewhere
in
the
response
curve
instead
of
using
a
broadband
average
-
so
comparing
two
manufacturer
's
numbers
may
not
really
be
apples-to-apples
.
</p>
<p>
&gt;
Sensitivity
is
the
1
meter
SPL
the
speaker
delivers
from
a
2.83
volt
input
.
Sometimes
called
voltage
sentitivity
to
make
that
clear
.
The
same
opportunities
for
optimistic
specs
enter
the
picture
-
namely
,
using
non-anechoic
conditions
and
or
taking
the
measurement
at
a
peak
rather
than
using
a
broadband
average
.
</p>
<p>
&gt;So
,
to
recap
:
Efficiency
is
related
to
Watts
,
and
Sensitivity
is
related
to
Volts
.
</p>
<p>
&gt;(Some
manufacturers
use
these
terms
interchangeably
or
backwards
from
this
convention
,
so
it
's
up
to
you
to
read
carefully
and
figure
out
what
they
're
really
saying
.
Look
and
see
whether
they
are
talking
about
1
watt
input
,
or
2.83
volts
input
.
)
</p>
<p>
&gt;Now
,
here
is
how
the
two
are
related
:
2.83
volts
into
8
ohms
is
one
watt
;
2.83
volts
into
4
ohms
is
2
watts
;
and
2.83
volts
into
16
ohms
is
one-half
watt
.
</p>
<p>
&gt;So
if
you
have
a
4-ohm
,
91-dB
2.83
volt
sensitive
speaker
,
it
's
an
88-dB
1
watt
efficient
speaker
.
If
you
have
a
16-ohm
,
85
dB
2.83
volt
speaker
,
it
is
also
an
88
dB
1
watt
efficient
speaker
.
I
prefer
to
convert
back
to
watts
,
because
you
can
usually
figure
out
the
amplifier
's
maximum
wattage
output
into
a
given
load
more
easily
than
you
can
figure
out
its
maximum
voltage
output
(
which
may
or
may
not
vary
with
load
,
depending
on
the
amplifier
)
,
and
because
if
you
are
interested
in
power
handling
then
you
want
to
know
the
wattage
going
into
the
speaker
.
</p>
<p>
&gt;Hope
this
helps
.
