In
the
late
1980s
,
you
retired
from
music
completely
.
Was
this
a
difficult
decision
for
you
to
make
?
What
things
did
you
want
out
of
your
life
which
required
you
to
leave
music
?
Where
did
you
go
,
and
what
did
you
do
in
retirement
?

Nothing
is
ever
difficult
when
we
accept
to
assume
our
choice
.
Those
years
were
very
disco
,
we
were
entering
terrains
I
was
n't
ready
to
tread
,
and
I
had
been
spoiled
by
my
artist
's
life
by
going
ever
farther
and
farther
from
home
.
The
French
media
ignored
me
after
my
victory
for
Luxembourg
.
Everyone
wanted
a
second
&quot;
Tu
te
reconnaîtras
&quot;
and
that
is
impossible
.
</p>
<p>
And
so
I
went
where
the
public
awaited
me
,
by
changing
countries
nearly
daily
,
and
this
tired
me
.
I
told
myself
that
my
life
was
not
made
<hi rend="italic">
only
</hi>
of
songs
and
glory
,
and
that
I
was
passionate
[
about
]
many
other
things
.
I
would
have
had
to
sacrifice
far
too
many
things
and
people
to
recover
a
place
in
France
,
like
going
to
live
in
France
,
living
a
life
of
popularity
,
etc
...
I
told
myself
that
I
had
already
been
spoiled
,
so
I
said
<hi rend="italic">
stop
!
</hi>
in
1987
after
the
[
Song
]
Festival
in
Chile
.
I
participated
in
[
many
]
great
projects
[
revolving
]
around
the
Lusitanian
horses
and
the
fighting
bulls
which
I
raised
with
passion
and
love
,
but
[
my
]
life
[
eventually
]
did
not
follow
those
paths
...
maybe
because
<hi rend="italic">
my
</hi>
life
is
the
stage
and
<hi rend="italic">
life
</hi>
took
charge
[
and
reminded
]
me
of
that

You
came
out
of
retirement
five
years
ago
.
How
often
did
you
think
about
returning
to
music
while
in
retirement
?
Was
music
something
you
felt
you
could
n't
just
&quot;
let
go

?

When
I
decide
to
do
something
,
I
do
it
.
When
I
decide
to
stop
something
,
I
do
that
too
.
But
that
is
n't
taking
into
account
that
there
are
things
which
we
want
to
do
,
and
those
which
life
decides
for
us
!
In
1987
,
I
vowed
never
to
return
to
the
stage
,
but
as
I
said
,
life
sometimes
serves
you
dishes
that
you
did
n't
choose
,
and
in
2003
it
's
chance
that
made
me
return
to
the
stage
,
and
it
's
my
fans
whom
I
never
imagined
[
I
had
]
in
such
numbers
and
whom
,
so
many
years
later
,
had
conserved
their
love
,
which
made
me
stay
.
I
owe
them
a
lot
and
will
never
forget
that
.

Tell
us
about
the
CDs
you
have
released
since
coming
out
of
retirement
.
Are
you
experimenting
with
any
new
musical
styles
?
I
read
you
had
a
lot
of
input
into
your
CD
&quot;
Federico
&quot;

describe
the
direction
you
wanted

It
's
thanks
to
the
fans
from
my
fan
club
that
I
could
create
a
live
CD
,
which
I
titled
&quot;
Live
à
Charleroi
&quot;
(
Live
at
Charleroi
)
.
They
sent
me
money
via
my
fan
club
to
allow
me
to
be
at
the
concert
,
and
they
bought
my
CD
in
advance
even
before
it
existed
.
[
All
of
this
was
]
just
to
help
me
,
just
to
show
me
how
much
they
wanted
to
find
me
[
on
stage
]
again
[
for
that
moment
]
,
in
the
space
of
14
songs
with
a
simple
piano
.
