Have
a
Family
Meeting
</head>
<p>
Every
family
has
its
time
when
they
have
to
talk
about
things
and
get
everyone
to
agree
on
something
.
Whether
it
's
something
about
when
to
watch
TV
,
or
discussions
about
a
new
house
,
we
all
have
a
good
reason
.
But
how
do
you
put
it
together
?
Follow
these
steps
to
make
the
family
meetings
a
little
easier
for
every
person
in
your
household
.

<item>
Decide
on
what
you
want
to
discuss
.
It
is
important
to
go
into
a
family
meeting
with
something
important
to
discuss
,
or
it
will
be
pointless
to
even
have
it
.
Do
you
need
to
talk
about
who
owns
the
remote
?
Or
what
about
the
many
concerts
coming
up
?
Or
maybe
it
is
a
topic
that
is
a
little
bit
harder
to
discuss
.
Make
sure
you
know
what
to
talk
about
and
some
replacement
topics
just
in
case
things
get
a
little
too
rough
.

Set
up
the
meeting
.
When
do
want
to
have
the
meeting
?
Talk
it
over
with
your
significant
other
and
decide
if
your
time
is
reasonable
.
Then
,
talk
it
over
with
each
of
your
kids
individuality
.
Tell
them
the
time
and
,
if
appropriate
,
the
subject
.
Make
sure
that
they
are
available
.
If
they
say
they
do
n't
want
to
come
,
which
will
most
likely
occur
with
teenagers
or
tweens
,
tell
them
that
they
have
to
come
because
the
meeting
is
very
important
.

Make
sure
that
everyone
did
n't
forget
about
the
meeting
the
day
before
it
is
due
to
happen
.
Especially
if
you
planned
it
out
well
in
advance
,
there
is
a
chance
that
they
might
have
.
Remind
everyone
if
possible
.
If
they
are
n't
available
at
the
moment
leave
them
a
reminder
on
their
desk
or
something
.
Leave
a
note
on
the
refrigerator
.

Go
to
the
meeting
.
Make
sure
everyone
's
there
.
If
they
are
not
,
go
get
them
.
If
they
still
ca
n't
make
it
,
cancel
the
meeting
and
reschedule
.
If
they
make
it
,
discuss
the
topics
and
make
sure
everyone
gets
a
chance
to
say
something
.
If
there
are
a
ton
of
bad
responses
from
everyone
in
your
household
,
then
attempt
to
change
the
subject
.
If
things
go
smoothly
,
then
you
'll
know
that
you
did
a
great
job
.

Apply
the
discussion
in
real
life
.
For
example
,
if
you
discussed
a
TV
schedule
,
abide
by
that
schedule
.
If
your
whole
household
has
to
do
something
and
you
do
n't
,
they
will
most
likely
think
that
it
is
unfair
,
and
they
will
become
very
upset
with
you
.

Tips

<list type="unordered">
<item>
Sometimes
some
meetings
may
have
information
that
some
kids
are
not
ready
to
hear
.
If
they
seemed
confused
during
then
meeting
,
then
sit
down
with
them
after
the
meeting
is
over
and
explain
what
you
talked
about
in
terms
that
they
can
understand
better
.
</item>
<item>
If
any
of
your
younger
kids
throw
a
fit
about
any
topic
because
they
do
n't
like
it
,
then
excuse
them
and
yourself
,
and
go
to
talk
to
them
for
a
minute
so
that
they
can
work
to
accept
the
change
.

Warnings
</head>
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Make
sure
not
to
yell
at
anyone
if
they
are
upset
or
confused
.
It
will
only
make
things
worse
for
everyone
in
the
household
,
because
yelling
may
start
an
argument
.
