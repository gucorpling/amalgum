Chapter
XIX
The
Viscount
and
the
Persian
</head>
<p>
Raoul
now
remembered
that
his
brother
had
once
shown
him
that
mysterious
person
,
of
whom
nothing
was
known
except
that
he
was
a
Persian
and
that
he
lived
in
a
little
old-fashioned
flat
in
the
Rue
de
Rivoli
.
</p>
<p>
The
man
with
the
ebony
skin
,
the
eyes
of
jade
and
the
astrakhan
cap
bent
over
Raoul
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
hope
,
M.
de
Chagny
,
&quot;
he
said
,
&quot;
that
you
have
not
betrayed
Erik
's
secret
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
And
why
should
I
hesitate
to
betray
that
monster
,
sir
?
&quot;
Raoul
rejoined
haughtily
,
trying
to
shake
off
the
intruder
.
&quot;
Is
he
your
friend
,
by
any
chance
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
hope
that
you
said
nothing
about
Erik
,
sir
,
because
Erik
's
secret
is
also
Christine
Daae
's
and
to
talk
about
one
is
to
talk
about
the
other
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Oh
,
sir
,
&quot;
said
Raoul
,
becoming
more
and
more
impatient
,
&quot;
you
seem
to
know
about
many
things
that
interest
me
;
and
yet
I
have
no
time
to
listen
to
you
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Once
more
,
M.
de
Chagny
,
where
are
you
going
so
fast
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Can
not
you
guess
?
To
Christine
Daae
's
assistance
...
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Then
,
sir
,
stay
here
,
for
Christine
Daae
is
here
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
With
Erik
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
With
Erik
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
How
do
you
know
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
was
at
the
performance
and
no
one
in
the
world
but
Erik
could
contrive
an
abduction
like
that
!
...
Oh
,
&quot;
he
said
,
with
a
deep
sigh
,
&quot;
I
recognized
the
monster
's
touch
!
...
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
You
know
him
then
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
Persian
did
not
reply
,
but
heaved
a
fresh
sigh
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Sir
,
&quot;
said
Raoul
,
&quot;
I
do
not
know
what
your
intentions
are
,
but
can
you
do
anything
to
help
me
?
I
mean
,
to
help
Christine
Daae
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
think
so
,
M.
de
Chagny
,
and
that
is
why
I
spoke
to
you
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
What
can
you
do
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Try
to
take
you
to
her
...
and
to
him
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
If
you
can
do
me
that
service
,
sir
,
my
life
is
yours
!
...
One
word
more
:
the
commissary
of
police
tells
me
that
Christine
Daae
has
been
carried
off
by
my
brother
,
Count
Philippe
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Oh
,
M.
de
Chagny
,
I
do
n't
believe
a
word
of
it
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
It
's
not
possible
,
is
it
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
do
n't
know
if
it
is
possible
or
not
;
but
there
are
ways
and
ways
of
carrying
people
off
;
and
M.
le
Comte
Philippe
has
never
,
as
far
as
I
know
,
had
anything
to
do
with
witchcraft
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Your
arguments
are
convincing
,
sir
,
and
I
am
a
fool
!
...
Oh
,
let
us
make
haste
!
I
place
myself
entirely
in
your
hands
!
...
How
should
I
not
believe
you
,
when
you
are
the
only
one
to
believe
me
...
when
you
are
the
only
one
not
to
smile
when
Erik
's
name
is
mentioned
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
And
the
young
man
impetuously
seized
the
Persian
's
hands
.
They
were
ice-cold
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Silence
!
&quot;
said
the
Persian
,
stopping
and
listening
to
the
distant
sounds
of
the
theater
.
&quot;
We
must
not
mention
that
name
here
.
Let
us
say
'
he
'
and
'
him
;
'
then
there
will
be
less
danger
of
attracting
his
attention
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Do
you
think
he
is
near
us
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
It
is
quite
possible
,
Sir
,
if
he
is
not
,
at
this
moment
,
with
his
victim
,
IN
THE
HOUSE
ON
THE
LAKE
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Ah
,
so
you
know
that
house
too
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
If
he
is
not
there
,
he
may
be
here
,
in
this
wall
,
in
this
floor
,
in
this
ceiling
!
...
Come
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
And
the
Persian
,
asking
Raoul
to
deaden
the
sound
of
his
footsteps
,
led
him
down
passages
which
Raoul
had
never
seen
before
,
even
at
the
time
when
Christine
used
to
take
him
for
walks
through
that
labyrinth
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
If
only
Darius
has
come
!
&quot;
said
the
Persian
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Who
is
Darius
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Darius
?
My
servant
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
They
were
now
in
the
center
of
a
real
deserted
square
,
an
immense
apartment
ill-lit
by
a
small
lamp
.
The
Persian
stopped
Raoul
and
,
in
the
softest
of
whispers
,
asked
:
</p>
<p>
&quot;
What
did
you
say
to
the
commissary
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
said
that
Christine
Daae
's
abductor
was
the
Angel
of
Music
,
ALIAS
the
Opera
ghost
,
and
that
the
real
name
was
...
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Hush
!
...
And
did
he
believe
you
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
No.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
He
attached
no
importance
to
what
you
said
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
No.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
He
took
you
for
a
bit
of
a
madman
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Yes
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
So
much
the
better
!
&quot;
sighed
the
Persian
.
</p>
<p>
And
they
continued
their
road
.
After
going
up
and
down
several
staircases
which
Raoul
had
never
seen
before
,
the
two
men
found
themselves
in
front
of
a
door
which
the
Persian
opened
with
a
master-key
.
The
Persian
and
Raoul
were
both
,
of
course
,
in
dress-clothes
;
but
,
whereas
Raoul
had
a
tall
hat
,
the
Persian
wore
the
astrakhan
cap
which
I
have
already
mentioned
.
It
was
an
infringement
of
the
rule
which
insists
upon
the
tall
hat
behind
the
scenes
;
but
in
France
foreigners
are
allowed
every
license
:
the
Englishman
his
traveling-cap
,
the
Persian
his
cap
of
astrakhan
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Sir
,
&quot;
said
the
Persian
,
&quot;
your
tall
hat
will
be
in
your
way
:
you
would
do
well
to
leave
it
in
the
dressing-room
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
What
dressing-room
?
&quot;
asked
Raoul
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Christine
Daae
's
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
And
the
Persian
,
letting
Raoul
through
the
door
which
he
had
just
opened
,
showed
him
the
actress
'
room
opposite
.
They
were
at
the
end
of
the
passage
the
whole
length
of
which
Raoul
had
been
accustomed
to
traverse
before
knocking
at
Christine
's
door
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
How
well
you
know
the
Opera
,
sir
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Not
so
well
as
'
he
'
does
!
&quot;
said
the
Persian
modestly
.
</p>
<p>
And
he
pushed
the
young
man
into
Christine
's
dressing-room
,
which
was
as
Raoul
had
left
it
a
few
minutes
earlier
.
</p>
<p>
Closing
the
door
,
the
Persian
went
to
a
very
thin
partition
that
separated
the
dressing-room
from
a
big
lumber-room
next
to
it
.
He
listened
and
then
coughed
loudly
.
