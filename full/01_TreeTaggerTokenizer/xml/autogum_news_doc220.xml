Danny
Fitzsimons
,
30
,
gave
evidence
today
to
the
court
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karkh">
Karkh
</ref>
,
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Baghdad">

</ref>
trying
him
for
murdering
a
fellow
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_Kingdom">
Brit
</ref>
and
an
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Australia">
Australian
</ref>
in
August
2009
.
The
security
contractor
said
his
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArmorGroup">
ArmorGroup
</ref>
collegues
had
tried
to
kill
him
in
the
city
's
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green%20Zone">

</ref>
,
challenged
the
fairness
of
his
trial
and
offered
a
plea
bargain
.
</p>
<p>
Fitzsimons
used
his
pistol
to
kill
Darren
Hoare
,
37
,
from
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Queensland">
Queensland
</ref>
,
Australia
and
Paul
McGuigan

The
first
Westerner
tried
in
Iraq
since
the
invasion
in
2003
,
he
testified
that
the
trio
were
drinking
whisky
and
began
fighting
after
he
punched
McGuigan
's
face
.
He
claimed
McGuigan
had
him
at
gunpoint
with
an
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M4%20rifle">

rifle
</ref>
while
Hoare
pushed
him
on
the
ground
after
the
pair
entered
his
room
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
was
seconds
away
from
my
death
so
I
pulled
my
pistol
,
&quot;
Fitzsimons
told
the
three-judge
panel
.
&quot;
I
shouted
twice
to
put
down
the
weapon
.
He
did
n't
respond
to
my
commands
,
my
requests
,
so
I
made
a
decision
.
I
shot
him
[
McGuigan
]
twice
in
the
chest
.
&quot;
Acting
out
the
events
,
he
added
&quot;
Bang
,
bang
in
his
chest
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Next
,
according
to
Fitzsimons
,
he
fired
a
third
shot
,
this
time
hitting
McGuigan
in
the
face
.
His
widow
has
described
the
three
shots
as
an
&quot;
execution
&quot;
.
In
further
testimony
today
Fitzsimons
told
the
judges
Hoare
then
grabbed
the
pistol
and
tried
to
force
it
&quot;
to
my
throat
to
kill
me
...
and
while
we
were
wrestling
I
fired
two
shots
in
the
chest
.
I
made
the
decision
and
pulled
the
trigger
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
He
then
fled
for
the
British
Embassy
,
but
was
stopped
by
an
Iraqi
guard
who
ordered
the
blood-soaked
man
to
stop
at
gunpoint
.
Fitzsimons
pulled
his
own
gun
and
shot
the
guard
in
the
thigh
,
for
which
he
faces
an
attempted
murder
charge
.
</p>
<p>
Iraqi
law
requires
the
entry
of
a
plea
at
the
end
of
a
trial
,
and
Fitzsimons
entered
not
guilty
pleas
.
He
also
offered
the
judges
a
plea
bargain
-
he
would
plead
guilty
to
the
lesser
charge
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/manslaughter">
manslaughter
</ref>
,
which
,
unlike
murder
,
does
not
carry
the
death
penalty
.
The
verdict
has
been
delayed
until
February
20
while
the
judges
seek
documentation
clarifying
the
accused
's
psychiatric
state
and
consider
if
this
should
impact
their
decision
as
to
guilt
or
innocence
.
</p>
<p>
Fitzsimons
was
previously
diagnosed
by
a
medical
committee
with
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/post%20traumatic%20stress%20disorder">
post
traumatic
stress
disorder
</ref>
and
made
multiple
requests
to
tell
the
judges
about
this
.
These
were
refused
,
the
judges
saying
they
were
sufficiently
aware
of
this
already
.
Fitzsimons
retorted
that
he
believes
this
breaches
his
right
to
a
fair
trial
:
&quot;
This
is
not
fair
.
I
do
n't
believe
it
is
a
fair
trial
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
right
to
a
fair
trial
is
enshrined
in
Article
10
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights">
Universal
Declaration
of
Human
Rights
</ref>
,
which
states
&quot;
[

to
a
fair
and
public
hearing
by
an
independent
and
impartial
tribunal
,
in
the
determination
of
...
any
criminal
charge
against
him
.
&quot;
The
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Iraq">

states
in
Article
19
&quot;
[
t]he

,
&quot;
