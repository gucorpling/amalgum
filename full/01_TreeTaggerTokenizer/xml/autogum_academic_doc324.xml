Methodology
</head>
<p>
The
ground
deformation
field
,
limited
to
the
single
direction
(
LOS
)
,
can
be
decomposed
into
three
mutually
perpendicular
components
(
east
–
west
,
north
–
south
,
and
up
–
down
)
.
Theoretically
,
we
can
obtain
the
three-dimensional
deformation
field
utilizing
multiple
InSAR
measurement
results
acquired
by
different
SAR
satellites
.
However
,
this
method
is
not
applicable
in
the
Darbandikhan
earthquake
because
of
three
reasons
.
First
,
most
current
SAR
satellites
fly
in
near-polar
orbits
,
so
the
acquired
SAR
data
is
not
quite
sensitive
to
the
north
–
south
deformation
.
Second
,
the
interferograms
of
different
satellites
are
right-looking
.
Third
,
the
source
mechanism
of
different
organization
(
Table
1
)
indicate
that
this
earthquake
had
a
strike-slip
movement
close
to
the
north
–
south
direction
accompanied
by
large
deformations
.
The
along-track
deformation
field
,
extracted
from
each
interferometric
pair
,
can
overcome
the
limitations
of
LOS
deformation
and
acquire
reliable
results
.
Therefore
,
combining
the
LOS
and
along-track
measurements
,
we
can
get
the
complete
3D
displacement
.
</p>
<p>
In
this
study
,
we
mapped
the
complete
3D
co-seismic
surface
of
the
earthquake
by
integrating
the
ascending
(
track
72
)
and
descending
orbits
(
track
6
)
LOS
measurements
derived
from
D-InSAR
and
the
along-track
measurements
derived
from
offset-tracking
(
<figure>
Figure
3
</figure>
)
.
The
offset-tracking
method
searches
the
corresponding
point
on
the
amplitude
images
by
the
cross-correlation
technique
and
calculates
the
selected
points′
azimuth
offsets
.
Then
,
the
robust
azimuth
offset
of
the
surface
deformation
can
be
got
by
subtracting
the
components
of
the
topographic
relief
and
orbit
trend
separation
.
Given
four
independent
components
(
LOS
and
along-track
directions
)
(

a
–

)
,
we
can
directly
obtain
the
3D
surface
deformation
.

Analysis
on
the
3D
Co-Seismic
Deformation
Field
</head>
<p>
The
full
3D
co-seismic
surface
deformation
of
the
Darbandikhan
earthquake
are
shown
in
<figure>
Figure

</figure>
e
–
g.
There
are
significant
deformation
in
the
region
around
the
epicenter
in
all
the
three
directions
,
especially
in
the
east
–
west
and
up
–
down
direction
.
In
the
east
–
west
direction
,
the
solution
area
is
characterized
by
westward
movement
and
the
maximum
displacement
can
is
−0.65
m.
In
the
north
–
south
direction
,
there
is
no
horizontal
displacement
toward
the
north
and
the
maximum
deformation
is
−0.73
m.
Therefore
,
the
horizontal
displacement
is
toward
southwest
,
which
suggests
that
the
region
with
co-seismic
deformation
mainly
concentrates
in
the
northeast
part
of
the
seismogenic
fault
.
This
conclusion
is
similar
to
the
focal
mechanism
solution
from
USGS
.
In
the
vertical
direction
,
there
are
two
significant
lobes
in
the
main
rupture
region
.
The
maximum
uplift
is
−0.81
m
and
the
maximum
subsidence
is
−0.28
m.
The
huge
value
difference
between
the
uplift
and
the
subsidence
lobes
on
the
two
sides
of
the
fault
confirms
the
thrust
movement
.
Moreover
,
the
field
geological
survey
shows
that
there
is
no
surface
rupture
related
to
the
seismogenic
fault
.
Therefore
,
this
earthquake
might
be
caused
by
a
blind
thrust
fault
close
to
north
–
south
with
the
deformation
field
concentrating
on
the
northwest
side
of
the
fault
.
