CHAPTER
VI
.
What
Happened
to
Andy
</head>
<p>
With
the
sun
shining
comfortably
upon
his
back
,
and
with
a
cigarette
between
his
lips
,
Andy
sat
upon
his
horse
and
watched
in
silent
glee
while
the
irate
Happy
Family
scurried
here
and
there
behind
the
band
,
swinging
their
ropes
down
upon
the
woolly
backs
,
and
searching
their
vocabularies
for
new
and
terrible
epithets
.
Andy
smiled
broadly
as
a
colorful
phrase
now
and
then
boomed
across
the
coulee
in
that
clear
,
snappy
atmosphere
,
which
carries
sounds
so
far
.
He
did
not
expect
to
do
much
smiling
upon
his
own
account
,
that
day
,
and
he
was
therefore
grateful
for
the
opportunity
to
behold
the
spectacle
before
him
.
</p>
<p>
There
was
Slim
,
for
instance
,
unwillingly
careening
down
hill
toward
home
,
because
,
in
his
zeal
to
slap
an
old
ewe
smartly
with
his
rope
,
he
drove
her
unexpectedly
under
his
horse
,
and
so
created
a
momentary
panic
that
came
near
standing
both
horse
and
rider
upon
their
heads
.
And
there
was
Big
Medicine
whistling
until
he
was
purple
,
while
the
herder
,
with
a
single
gesture
,
held
the
dog
motionless
,
though
a
dozen
sheep
broke
back
from
the
band
and
climbed
a
slope
so
steep
that
Big
Medicine
was
compelled
to
go
after
them
afoot
,
and
turn
them
with
stones
and
profane
objurgations
.
</p>
<p>
It
was
very
funny
--
when
one
could
sit
at
ease
upon
the
hilltop
and
smoke
a
cigarette
while
others
risked
apoplexy
and
their
souls
'
salvation
below
.
By
the
time
they
panted
up
the
last
rock-strewn
slope
of
the
bluff
,
and
sent
the
vanguard
of
the
invaders
under
the
fence
,
Andy
's
mood
was
complacent
in
the
extreme
,
and
his
smile
offensively
wide
.
</p>
<p>
“
Oh
,
you
need
n't
look
so
sorry
for
us
,
”
drawled
the
Native
Son
,
jingling
over
toward
him
until
only
the
fence
and
a
few
feet
of
space
divided
them
.
“
Here
's
where
you
get
yours
,
amigo
.
I
wish
you
a
pleasant
day
--
and
a
long
one
!
”
He
waved
his
hand
in
mocking
adieu
,
touched
his
horse
with
his
silver
spurs
,
and
rode
gaily
away
down
the
coulee
.
</p>
<p>
“
Here
,
sheepherder
's
your
outfit
.
Ma-aa-a-a
!
”
jeered
Big
Medicine
.
“
You
'll
wisht
,
by
cripes
,
you
was
a
dozen
men
just
like
yuh
before
you
're
through
with
the
deal
.
Haw-haw-haw-w
!
”
</p>
<p>
There
were
others
who
,
seeing
Andy
's
grin
,
had
something
to
say
upon
the
subject
before
they
left
.
</p>
<p>
Weary
rode
up
,
and
looked
undecidedly
from
Andy
to
the
sheep
,
and
back
again
.
</p>
<p>
“
If
you
do
n't
feel
like
tackling
it
single-handed
,
I
'll
send
--
”
</p>
<p>
“
What
do
yuh
think
I
am
,
anyway
?
”
Andy
interrupted
crisply
,
“
a
Montgomery
Ward
two-for-a-quarter
cowpuncher
?
Do
n't
you
fellows
waste
any
time
worrying
over
me
!
”
</p>
<p>
The
herders
stared
at
Andy
curiously
when
he
swung
in
behind
the
tail-end
of
the
band
and
kept
pace
with
their
slow
moving
,
but
they
did
not
speak
beyond
shouting
an
occasional
command
to
their
dogs
.
Neither
did
Andy
have
anything
to
say
,
until
he
saw
that
they
were
swinging
steadily
to
the
west
,
instead
of
keeping
straight
north
,
as
they
had
been
told
to
do
.
Then
he
rode
over
to
the
nearest
herder
,
who
happened
to
be
the
bug-killer
.
</p>
<p>
“
You
do
n't
want
to
get
turned
around
,
”
he
hinted
quietly
.
“
That
's
north
,
over
there
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
'm
workin
'
fer
the
man
that
pays
my
wages
,
”
the
fellow
retorted
glumly
,
and
waved
an
arm
to
a
collie
that
was
waiting
for
orders
.
The
dog
dropped
his
head
,
and
ran
around
the
right
wing
of
the
band
,
with
sharp
yelps
and
dartings
here
and
there
,
turning
them
still
more
to
the
west
.
</p>
<p>
Andy
hesitated
,
decided
to
leave
the
man
alone
for
the
present
,
and
rode
around
to
the
other
herder
.
</p>
<p>
“
You
swing
these
sheep
north
!
”
he
commanded
,
disdaining
preface
or
explanation
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
'm
workin
'
for
the
man
that
pays
my
wages
,
”
the
herder
made
answer
stolidly
,
and
chewed
steadily
upon
a
quid
of
tobacco
that
had
stained
his
lips
unbecomingly
.
</p>
<p>
So
they
had
talked
the
thing
over
--
had
those
two
herders
--
and
were
following
a
premeditated
plan
of
defiance
!
Andy
hooked
at
the
man
a
minute
.
“
You
turn
them
sheep
,
damn
you
,
”
he
commanded
again
,
and
laid
a
hand
upon
his
saddle-horn
suggestively
.
</p>
<p>
“
You
go
to
the
devil
,
damn
yuh
,
”
advised
the
herder
,
and
cocked
a
wary
eye
at
him
from
under
his
hat-brim
.
Not
all
herders
,
let
it
be
said
in
passing
,
take
unto
themselves
the
mental
attributes
of
their
sheep
;
there
are
those
who
believe
that
a
bold
front
is
better
than
weak
compliance
,
and
who
will
back
that
belief
by
a
very
bold
front
indeed
.
</p>
<p>
Andy
appraised
him
mentally
,
decided
that
he
was
an
able-bodied
man
and
therefore
fightable
,
and
threw
his
right
leg
over
the
cantle
with
a
quite
surprising
alacrity
.
</p>
<p>
“
Are
you
going
to
turn
them
sheep
?
”
Andy
was
taking
off
his
coat
when
he
made
that
inquiry
.
</p>
<p>
“
Not
for
your
tellin
'
.
You
keep
back
,
young
feller
,
or
I
'll
sick
the
dogs
on
yuh
.
”
He
turned
and
whistled
to
the
nearest
one
,
and
Andy
hit
him
on
the
ear
.
</p>
<p>
They
clinched
and
pummeled
when
they
could
and
where
they
could
.
The
dog
came
up
,
circled
the
gyrating
forms
twice
,
then
sat
down
upon
his
haunches
at
a
safe
distance
,
tilted
his
head
sidewise
and
lifted
his
ears
interestedly
.
He
was
a
wise
little
dog
;
the
other
dog
was
also
wise
,
and
remained
phlegmatically
at
his
post
,
as
did
the
bug-killer
.
</p>
<p>
“
Are
you
going
to
turn
them
sheep
?
”
Andy
spoke
breathlessly
,
but
with
deadly
significance
.
