SNANA’S
FAWN
</head>
<p>
The
Little
Missouri
was
in
her
spring
fullness
,
and
the
hills
among
which
she
found
her
way
to
the
Great
Muddy
were
profusely
adorned
with
colors
,
much
like
those
worn
by
the
wild
red
man
upon
a
holiday
!
Looking
toward
the
sunrise
,
one
saw
mysterious
,
deep
shadows
and
bright
prominences
,
while
on
the
opposite
side
there
was
really
an
extravagant
array
of
variegated
hues
.
Between
the
gorgeous
buttes
and
rainbow-tinted
ridges
there
were
narrow
plains
,
broken
here
and
there
by
dry
creeks
or
gulches
,
and
these
again
were
clothed
scantily
with
poplars
and
sad-colored
bull-berry
bushes
,
while
the
bare
spots
were
purple
with
the
wild
Dakota
crocuses
.
</p>
<p>
Upon
the
lowest
of
a
series
of
natural
terraces
there
stood
on
this
May
morning
a
young
Sioux
girl
,
whose
graceful
movements
were
not
unlike
those
of
a
doe
which
chanced
to
be
lurking
in
a
neighboring
gulch
.
On
the
upper
plains
,
not
far
away
,
were
her
young
companions
,
all
busily
employed
with
the
wewoptay
,
as
it
was
called
--
the
sharp-pointed
stick
with
which
the
Sioux
women
dig
wild
turnips
.
They
were
gayly
gossiping
together
,
or
each
humming
a
love-song
as
she
worked
,
only
Snana
stood
somewhat
apart
from
the
rest
;
in
fact
,
concealed
by
the
crest
of
the
ridge
.
</p>
<p>
She
had
paused
in
her
digging
and
stood
facing
the
sun-kissed
buttes
.
Above
them
in
the
clear
blue
sky
the
father
sun
was
traveling
upward
as
in
haste
,
while
to
her
receptive
spirit
there
appealed
an
awful
,
unknown
force
,
the
silent
speech
of
the
Great
Mystery
,
to
which
it
seemed
to
her
the
whole
world
must
be
listening
!
</p>
<p>
“
O
Great
Mystery
!
the
father
of
earthly
things
is
coming
to
quicken
us
into
life
.
Have
pity
on
me
,
I
pray
thee
!
May
I
some
day
become
the
mother
of
a
great
and
brave
race
of
warriors
!
”
So
the
maiden
prayed
silently
.
</p>
<p>
It
was
now
full-born
day
.
The
sun
shone
hot
upon
the
bare
ground
,
and
the
drops
stood
upon
Snana
’s
forehead
as
she
plied
her
long
pole
.
There
was
a
cool
spring
in
the
dry
creek
bed
near
by
,
well
hidden
by
a
clump
of
chokecherry
bushes
,
and
she
turned
thither
to
cool
her
thirsty
throat
.
In
the
depths
of
the
ravine
her
eye
caught
a
familiar
footprint
--
the
track
of
a
doe
with
the
young
fawn
beside
it
.
The
hunting
instinct
arose
within
.
</p>
<p>
“
It
will
be
a
great
feat
if
I
can
find
and
take
from
her
the
babe
.
The
little
tawny
skin
shall
be
beautifully
dressed
by
my
mother
.
The
legs
and
the
nose
shall
be
embossed
with
porcupine
quills
.
It
will
be
my
work-bag
,
”
she
said
to
herself
.
</p>
<p>
As
she
stole
forward
on
the
fresh
trail
she
scanned
every
nook
,
every
clump
of
bushes
.
There
was
a
sudden
rustle
from
within
a
grove
of
wild
plum
trees
,
thickly
festooned
with
grape
and
clematis
,
and
the
doe
mother
bounded
away
as
carelessly
as
if
she
were
never
to
return
.
</p>
<p>
Ah
,
a
mother
’s
ruse
!
Snana
entered
the
thorny
enclosure
,
which
was
almost
a
rude
teepee
,
and
,
tucked
away
in
the
furthermost
corner
,
lay
something
with
a
trout-like
,
speckled
,
tawny
coat
.
She
bent
over
it
.
The
fawn
was
apparently
sleeping
.
Presently
its
eyes
moved
a
bit
,
and
a
shiver
passed
through
its
subtle
body
.
</p>
<p>
“
Thou
shalt
not
die
;
thy
skin
shall
not
become
my
work-bag
!
”
unconsciously
the
maiden
spoke
.
The
mother
sympathy
had
taken
hold
on
her
mind
.
She
picked
the
fawn
up
tenderly
,
bound
its
legs
,
and
put
it
on
her
back
to
carry
like
an
Indian
babe
in
the
folds
of
her
robe
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
cannot
leave
you
alone
,
Tachinchala
.
Your
mother
is
not
here
.
Our
hunters
will
soon
return
by
this
road
,
and
your
mother
has
left
behind
her
two
plain
tracks
leading
to
this
thicket
,
”
she
murmured
.
</p>
<p>
The
wild
creature
struggled
vigorously
for
a
minute
,
and
then
became
quiet
.
Its
graceful
head
protruded
from
the
elkskin
robe
just
over
Snana
’s
shoulder
.
She
was
slowly
climbing
the
slope
with
her
burden
,
when
suddenly
like
an
apparition
the
doe-mother
stood
before
her
.
The
fawn
called
loudly
when
it
was
first
seized
,
and
the
mother
was
not
too
far
away
to
hear
.
Now
she
called
frantically
for
her
child
,
at
the
same
time
stamping
with
her
delicate
fore-feet
.
</p>
<p>
“
Yes
,
sister
,
you
are
right
;
she
is
yours
;
but
you
cannot
save
her
to-day
!
The
hunters
will
soon
be
here
.
Let
me
keep
her
for
you
;
I
will
return
her
to
you
safely
.
And
hear
me
,
O
sister
of
the
woods
,
that
some
day
I
may
become
the
mother
of
a
noble
race
of
warriors
and
of
fine
women
,
as
handsome
as
you
are
!
”
</p>
<p>
At
this
moment
the
quick
eyes
of
the
Indian
girl
detected
something
strange
in
the
doe
’s
actions
.
She
glanced
in
every
direction
and
behold
!
a
grizzly
bear
was
cautiously
approaching
the
group
from
a
considerable
distance
.
</p>
<p>
“
Run
,
run
,
sister
!
I
shall
save
your
child
if
I
can
,
”
she
cried
,
and
flew
for
the
nearest
scrub
oak
on
the
edge
of
the
bank
.
Up
the
tree
she
scrambled
,
with
the
fawn
still
securely
bound
to
her
back
.
The
grizzly
came
on
with
teeth
exposed
,
and
the
doe-mother
in
her
flight
came
between
him
and
the
tree
,
giving
a
series
of
indignant
snorts
as
she
ran
,
and
so
distracted
Mato
from
his
object
of
attack
;
but
only
for
a
few
seconds
--
then
on
he
came
!
