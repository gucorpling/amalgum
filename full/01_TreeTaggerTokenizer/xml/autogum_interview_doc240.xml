Which
of
your
competitors
do
you
expect
to
pose
the
biggest
challenge
to
your
candidacy
?
Why
?
What
makes
you
the
most
desirable
of
all
candidates
running
in
the
riding
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
The
older
parties
are
a
challenge
because
people
tend
to
vote
along
party
lines
and
that
is
hard
to
change
.
However
,
I
believe
people
,
young
and
old
,
are
realizing
the
importance
of
a
healthy
environment
,
as
I
have
done
,
and
are
starting
to
realize
that
the
Green
Party
is
a
viable
alternative
to
those
parties
that
have
failed
to
lead
on
this
issue
.
</p>
<p>
I
am
an
open
and
friendly
person
and
will
be
approachable
to
my
constituents
.
My
willingness
to
communicate
is
the
key
strength
I
bring
to
the
table
.

What
do
you
feel
are
the
three
most
important
issues
to
voters
in
your
riding
?
Are
these
the
same
top
three
issues
that
are
most
important
to
you
?
What
would
you
do
to
address
these
issues
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
The
top
three
issues
for
voters
in
Willowdale
are
Environment
,
Health
Care
and
Schools
.
My
priorities
are
similar
,
except
I
would
add
Proportional
Representation
.
This
election
,
we
have
a
once
in
a
lifetime
opportunity
to
change
the
electoral
system
and
make
sure
that
every
vote
counts
.
</p>
<p>
The
Green
Party
has
a
comprehensive
platform
for
addressing
Environment
,
Health
Care
and
Schools
,
based
on
sensible
and
affordable
choices
.
We
would
shift
taxes
from
income
or
payroll
to
waste
and
pollution
.
This
will
promote
good
policy
without
costing
more
.
Cleaner
air
and
water
will
mean
lower
health
costs
.
Last
year
88,000
people
went
to
Emergency
Rooms
because
of
air
pollution-caused
difficulties
.
We
also
need
to
focus
on
preventive
medicine
and
encourage
our
Health
Care
system
to
use
alternative
medicine
,
where
appropriate
,
to
keep
us
healthy
.
We
should
be
encouraging
children
and
adults
to
eat
right
and
be
active
by
providing
nutrition
education
and
counselling
and
exercise
programs
.

What
should
be
the
first
order
of
business
in
the
39th
Legislative
Assembly
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
The
Green
Party
would
implement
its
economic
plan
of
shifting
taxes
to
shift
behaviours
and
to
upload
services
to
the
province
that
has
been
downloaded
by
previous
governments
,
so
we
can
start
building
stronger
more
sustainable
cities
in
our
province
.

Are
the
property
taxes
in
your
riding
at
a
fair
level
for
the
amount
of
services
received
in
the
municipality
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
At
the
centre
of
the
Green
Party
’s
platform
is
a
new
way
of
thinking
about
taxes
–
where
we
shift
from
taxing
what
you
earn
to
what
you
burn
.
With
regards
to
property
taxes
,
this
would
mean
replacing
the
existing
system
with
a
&quot;
location
value
tax
&quot;
based
only
on
land
and
not
building
values
,
to
encourage
denser
growth
in
urban
areas
.
