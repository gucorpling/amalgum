The
Feast
's
End
</head>
<p>
THE
FEAST
was
a
noble
feast
,
as
has
already
been
said
.
There
was
an
elegant
ingenuity
displayed
in
the
form
of
pies
which
delighted
my
heart
.
Once
acknowledge
that
an
American
pie
is
far
to
be
preferred
to
its
humble
ancestor
,
the
English
tart
,
and
it
is
joyful
to
be
reassured
at
a
Bowden
reunion
that
invention
has
not
yet
failed
.
Beside
a
delightful
variety
of
material
,
the
decorations
went
beyond
all
my
former
experience
;
dates
and
names
were
wrought
in
lines
of
pastry
and
frosting
on
the
tops
.
There
was
even
more
elaborate
reading
matter
on
an
excellent
early-apple
pie
which
we
began
to
share
and
eat
,
precept
upon
precept
.
Mrs.
Todd
helped
me
generously
to
the
whole
word
BOWDEN
,
and
consumed
REUNION
herself
,
save
an
undecipherable
fragment
;
but
the
most
renowned
essay
in
cookery
on
the
tables
was
a
model
of
the
old
Bowden
house
made
of
durable
gingerbread
,
with
all
the
windows
and
doors
in
the
right
places
,
and
sprigs
of
genuine
lilac
set
at
the
front
.
It
must
have
been
baked
in
sections
,
in
one
of
the
last
of
the
great
brick
ovens
,
and
fastened
together
on
the
morning
of
the
day
.
There
was
a
general
sigh
when
this
fell
into
ruin
at
the
feast
's
end
,
and
it
was
shared
by
a
great
part
of
the
assembly
,
not
without
seriousness
,
and
as
if
it
were
a
pledge
and
token
of
loyalty
.
I
met
the
maker
of
the
gingerbread
house
,
which
had
called
up
lively
remembrances
of
a
childish
story
.
She
had
the
gleaming
eye
of
an
enthusiast
and
a
look
of
high
ideals
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
could
just
as
well
have
made
it
all
of
frosted
cake
,
”
she
said
,
“
but
'
twould
n't
have
been
the
right
shade
;
the
old
house
,
as
you
observe
,
was
never
painted
,
and
I
concluded
that
plain
gingerbread
would
represent
it
best
.
It
was
n't
all
I
expected
it
would
be
,
”
she
said
sadly
,
as
many
an
artist
had
said
before
her
of
his
work
.
</p>
<p>
There
were
speeches
by
the
ministers
;
and
there
proved
to
be
a
historian
among
the
Bowdens
,
who
gave
some
fine
anecdotes
of
the
family
history
;
and
then
appeared
a
poetess
,
whom
Mrs.
Todd
regarded
with
wistful
compassion
and
indulgence
,
and
when
the
long
faded
garland
of
verses
came
to
an
appealing
end
,
she
turned
to
me
with
words
of
praise
.
</p>
<p>
“
Sounded
pretty
,
”
said
the
generous
listener
.
“
Yes
,
I
thought
she
did
very
well
.
We
went
to
school
together
,
an
'
Mary
Anna
had
a
very
hard
time
;
trouble
was
,
her
mother
thought
she
'd
given
birth
to
a
genius
,
an
'
Mary
Anna
's
come
to
believe
it
herself
.
There
,
I
do
n't
know
what
we
should
have
done
without
her
;
there
ai
n't
nobody
else
that
can
write
poetry
between
here
and
'
way
up
towards
Rockland
;
it
adds
a
great
deal
at
such
a
time
.
When
she
speaks
o
'
those
that
are
gone
,
she
feels
it
all
,
and
so
does
everybody
else
,
but
she
harps
too
much
.
I
'd
laid
half
of
that
away
for
next
time
,
if
I
was
Mary
Anna
.
There
comes
mother
to
speak
to
her
,
an
'
old
Mr.
Gilbreath
's
sister
;
now
she
'll
be
heartened
right
up
.
Mother
'll
say
just
the
right
thing
.
”
</p>
<p>
The
leave-takings
were
as
affecting
as
the
meetings
of
these
old
friends
had
been
.
There
were
enough
young
persons
at
the
reunion
,
but
it
is
the
old
who
really
value
such
opportunities
;
as
for
the
young
,
it
is
the
habit
of
every
day
to
meet
their
comrades
,
--
the
time
of
separation
has
not
come
.
To
see
the
joy
with
which
these
elder
kinsfolk
and
acquaintances
had
looked
in
one
another
's
faces
,
and
the
lingering
touch
of
their
friendly
hands
;
to
see
these
affectionate
meetings
and
then
the
reluctant
partings
,
gave
one
a
new
idea
of
the
isolation
in
which
it
was
possible
to
live
in
that
after
all
thinly
settled
region
.
They
did
not
expect
to
see
one
another
again
very
soon
;
the
steady
,
hard
work
on
the
farms
,
the
difficulty
of
getting
from
place
to
place
,
especially
in
winter
when
boats
were
laid
up
,
gave
double
value
to
any
occasion
which
could
bring
a
large
number
of
families
together
.
Even
funerals
in
this
country
of
the
pointed
firs
were
not
without
their
social
advantages
and
satisfactions
.
I
heard
the
words
“
next
summer
”
repeated
many
times
,
though
summer
was
still
ours
and
all
the
leaves
were
green
.
</p>
<p>
The
boats
began
to
put
out
from
shore
,
and
the
wagons
to
drive
away
.
Mrs.
Blackett
took
me
into
the
old
house
when
we
came
back
from
the
grove
:
it
was
her
father
's
birthplace
and
early
home
,
and
she
had
spent
much
of
her
own
childhood
there
with
her
grandmother
.
She
spoke
of
those
days
as
if
they
had
but
lately
passed
;
in
fact
,
I
could
imagine
that
the
house
looked
almost
exactly
the
same
to
her
.
I
could
see
the
brown
rafters
of
the
unfinished
roof
as
I
looked
up
the
steep
staircase
,
though
the
best
room
was
as
handsome
with
its
good
wainscoting
and
touch
of
ornament
on
the
cornice
as
any
old
room
of
its
day
in
a
town
.
</p>
<p>
Some
of
the
guests
who
came
from
a
distance
were
still
sitting
in
the
best
room
when
we
went
in
to
take
leave
of
the
master
and
mistress
of
the
house
.
We
all
said
eagerly
what
a
pleasant
day
it
had
been
,
and
how
swiftly
the
time
had
passed
.
Perhaps
it
is
the
great
national
anniversaries
which
our
country
has
lately
kept
,
and
the
soldiers
'
meetings
that
take
place
everywhere
,
which
have
made
reunions
of
every
sort
the
fashion
.
This
one
,
at
least
,
had
been
very
interesting
.
I
fancied
that
old
feuds
had
been
overlooked
,
and
the
old
saying
that
blood
is
thicker
than
water
had
again
proved
itself
true
,
though
from
the
variety
of
names
one
argued
a
certain
adulteration
of
the
Bowden
traits
and
belongings
.
Clannishness
is
an
instinct
of
the
heart
,
--
it
is
more
than
a
birthright
,
or
a
custom
;
and
lesser
rights
were
forgotten
in
the
claim
to
a
common
inheritance
.
