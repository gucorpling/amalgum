Protocols

Mature
EC
Phenotype
</head>
<p>
It
is
well
known
that
for
clinical
use
,
it
is
mandatory
to
generate
cells
able
to
show
a
high
degree
of
commitment
.
This
requirement
fulfills
not
only
functional
issues
,
but
also
safety
ones
,
in
order
to
prevent
teratoma
formation
after
implantation
.
Thus
,
a
prerequisite
to
exploit
iPSC-ECs
in
the
clinical
setting
is
the
development
of
defined
protocols
to
guide
their
differentiation
into
functional
endothelial
cells
.
The
ideal
induction
protocol
should
be
reproducible
,
easy
to
perform
and
relatively
quick
in
order
to
allow
yielding
an
adequate
quantity
of
homogeneous
cells
.
Current
induction
strategies
include
embryonic
bodies
(
EB
)
generation
,
differentiation
on
monolayers
and
co-culture
with
primary
cells
(

)
.
</p>
<p>
IPSCs
tend
to
self-assemble
into
three-dimensional
(
3D
)
structures
(
EB
)
when
grown
in
suspension
.
From
EBs
,
cell
aggregates
encompassing
all
three
germ
layers
develop
,
and
afterwards
,
within
the
positive
mesodermal
,
EB
cells
tend
to
form
vascular
structures
.
This
method
is
affected
by
low
efficiency
(
1
â€“
5
%
)
and
slow
production
rate
;
however
,
differentiation
can
be
improved
by
adding
proper
growth
factors
to
the
culture
medium
.
Another
approach
involves
a
co-culture
with
primary
cell
lines
able
to
induce
iPSC-EC
differentiation
toward
mature
ECs
.
In
detail
,
Choi
et
al.
directed
hiPSCs
into
mature
ECs
in
the
presence
of
OP9
,
a
mouse
bone
marrow
stromal
cell
line
.
The
authors
speculated
that
these
cells
regulate
iPSC
induction
via
a
paracrine
signaling
.
</p>
<p>
Monolayer
differentiation
holds
a
significantly
higher
efficiency
that
depends
on
external
factors
,
such
as
medium
constituents
,
showing
a
final
yield
that
is
still
too
low
in
the
view
of
clinical
applications
.
To
date
,
the
best
protocols
showing
the
highest
EC
yields
were
developed
by
culturing
a
monolayer
of
hiPSCs
on
a
matrix-coated
culture
plate
and
by
treating
them
with
different
molecules
or
growth
factors
in
a
timed
fashion
in
order
to
guide
the
progressive
differentiation
of
hiPSCs
toward
the
EC
lineage
.
In
this
context
,
GSK3
inhibitors
play
an
important
role
among
the
set
of
molecules
necessary
to
induce
the
differentiation
of
pluripotent
cells
into
mature
ECs
.
In
particular
,
vascular
progenitors
derive
during
human
development
from
latero-posterior
mesoderm
.
To
specify
mesoderm
,
Wnt
signaling
,
which
is
activated
by
GSK3
inhibition
,
is
required
.
In
view
of
this
,
several
authors
have
exploited
GSK3
inhibitors
to
differentiate
hiPSCs
into
ECs
.
Patsch
et
al.
exposed
a
monolayer
of
hiPSC
to
GSK3
inhibitor
CHIR-99021
(
CHIR
)
and
to
mesoderm
inducer
bone
morphogenetic
protein
4
(
BMP4
)
.
The
combination
of
these
two
molecules
led
to
the
production
of
mature
ECs
in
a
relatively
short
time
(
six
days
)
with
80
%
efficiency
.
</p>
<p>
However
,
mesoderm
induction
is
only
the
first
step
of
differentiation
.
The
second
part
starts
upon
mesodermal
commitment
by
exposing
the
cells
to
factors
that
further
induce
the
mature
vascular
phenotype
.
Gu
set
up
a
protocol
through
which
,
after
4
days
of
treatment
with
VEGF
and
bFGF
,
he
produced
mature
ECs
in
only
8
days
.
These
cells
,
when
tested
,
were
molecularly
and
functionally
similar
to
native
ECs
.
</p>
<p>
Paik
et
al.
added
VEGF
,
bFGF
and
BMP4
to
an
already
established
protocol
to
produce
mature
ECs
from
hiPSCs
within
12
days
.
Although
this
protocol
requires
more
time
compared
to
other
ones
reported
in
literature
,
the
aim
of
this
study
was
different
.
In
fact
,
these
cells
were
used
to
draw
an
RNA
signature
at
different
stage
of
differentiation
.
</p>
<p>
The
last
step
included
in
the
differentiation
protocol
is
the
purification
of
positive
cells
.
This
step
is
essential
to
fish
out
a
homogenous
subset
of
cells
and
to
ensure
the
safety
needed
for
the
future
cell
implantation
and
engraftment
.
</p>
<p>
Cell
sorting
is
usually
performed
by
using
magnetic
beads
on
which
surface
specific
antibodies
are
adsorbed
.
These
antibodies
are
directed
against
mature
endothelial
markers
such
as
CD31
or
VE-cadherin
(
also
known
as
CD144
)
.
