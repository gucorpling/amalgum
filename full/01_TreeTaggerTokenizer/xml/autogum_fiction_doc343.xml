Rescued
</head>
<p>
For
a
moment
Ned
and
Mr.
Damon
gazed
at
the
farmer
in
his
rattletrap
of
an
auto
,
and
then
they
looked
at
the
fluttering
piece
of
paper
in
his
hand
.
Thence
their
gaze
traveled
to
the
ragged
and
barefoot
lad
sitting
beside
the
farmer
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
found
it
!
&quot;
announced
the
boy
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Found
what
?
&quot;
asked
Ned
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
That
there
note
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Without
asking
any
more
questions
,
reserving
them
until
they
knew
more
about
the
matter
,
Mr.
Damon
and
Ned
each
reached
out
a
hand
for
the
paper
the
farmer
held
.
The
latter
handed
it
to
Ned
,
being
nearest
him
,
and
at
a
sight
of
the
handwriting
the
young
bank
clerk
exclaimed
:
</p>
<p>
&quot;
It
's
from
Tom
,
all
right
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
What
happened
to
him
?
&quot;
cried
Mr.
Damon
.
&quot;
Where
is
he
?
Is
he
a
prisoner
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
So
it
seems
,
&quot;
answered
Ned
.
&quot;
Wait
,
I
'll
read
it
to
you
,
&quot;
and
he
read
:
</p>
<p>
&quot;
'
Whoever
picks
this
up
please
send
word
at
once
to
Mr.
Swift
or
to
Ned
Newton
in
Shopton
,
or
to
Mr.
Damon
of
Waterfield
.
I
am
a
prisoner
,
locked
in
the
old
factory
.
Tom
Swift
'
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Bless
my
quinine
pills
!
&quot;
cried
Mr
Damon
.
&quot;
What
in
the
world
does
it
mean
?
What
factory
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
That
's
just
what
we
've
got
to
find
out
,
&quot;
decided
Ned
.
&quot;
Where
did
you
get
this
?
&quot;
he
asked
the
farmer
's
boy
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Way
off
over
there
,
&quot;
and
he
pointed
across
miles
of
fields
.
&quot;
I
was
lookin
'
for
a
lost
cow
,
and
I
went
past
an
old
factory
.
There
was
n't
nobody
in
the
place
,
as
far
as
I
knowed
,
but
all
at
once
I
heard
some
one
yell
,
and
then
I
seen
something
white
,
like
a
bird
,
sail
out
of
a
high
window
.
I
was
scared
for
a
minute
,
thinkin
'
it
might
be
tramps
after
me
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
And
what
did
you
do
,
Sonny
?
&quot;
asked
Mr.
Damon
,
as
the
boy
paused
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Well
,
after
a
while
I
went
to
where
the
white
thing
lay
,
and
I
picked
it
up
.
I
seen
it
was
a
piece
of
paper
,
with
writin
'
on
it
,
and
it
was
wrapped
around
part
of
a
brick
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
And
did
you
go
near
the
factory
to
find
out
who
called
or
who
threw
the
paper
out
?
&quot;
Ned
queried
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
did
n't
,
&quot;
the
boy
answered
.
&quot;
I
was
scared
.
I
went
home
,
and
did
n't
even
start
to
find
the
lost
cow
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
No
more
he
did
,
&quot;
chimed
in
the
farmer
.
&quot;
He
come
runnin
'
in
like
a
whitehead
,
and
as
soon
as
I
saw
the
paper
and
heard
what
Bub
had
to
say
,
I
thought
maybe
I
'd
better
do
somethin
'
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Did
you
go
to
the
factory
?
&quot;
asked
Ned
eagerly
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
No.
I
thought
the
best
thing
to
do
would
be
to
find
this
Mr.
Swift
,
or
the
other
folks
mentioned
in
this
letter
.
I
knowed
,
in
a
general
way
,
where
Shopton
was
,
but
I
'd
never
been
there
,
doing
my
tradin
'
in
the
other
direction
,
and
so
I
had
to
stop
and
ask
the
road
.
If
you
can
tell
me
--
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
We
're
two
of
the
persons
spoken
of
in
that
note
,
&quot;
said
Mr.
Damon
,
as
he
mentioned
his
name
and
introduced
Ned
.
&quot;
We
have
been
looking
for
our
friend
Tom
Swift
for
two
days
now
.
We
must
find
him
at
once
,
as
there
is
no
telling
what
he
may
be
suffering
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Where
is
this
old
factory
you
speak
of
,
&quot;
continued
Mr.
Damon
,
&quot;
and
how
can
we
get
there
?
It
's
too
bad
one
of
you
did
n't
go
back
,
after
finding
the
note
,
to
tell
Tom
he
was
soon
to
be
rescued
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Waal
,
maybe
it
is
,
&quot;
said
the
farmer
,
a
bit
put
out
by
the
criticism
.
&quot;
But
I
figgered
it
would
be
better
to
look
up
this
young
man
's
friends
and
let
them
do
the
rescuin
'
,
and
not
lose
no
time
,
'
specially
as
it
's
about
as
far
from
my
place
to
the
factory
as
it
is
to
Shopton
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Well
,
I
suppose
that
's
so
,
&quot;
agreed
Ned
.
&quot;
But
what
is
this
factory
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
It
's
an
old
one
where
they
started
to
make
beet
sugar
,
but
it
did
n't
pan
out
,
&quot;
the
farmer
said
.
&quot;
The
place
is
in
ruins
,
and
I
did
hear
,
not
long
ago
,
that
somebody
run
a
threshin
'
machine
through
it
,
an
'
busted
it
up
worse
than
before
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Great
horned
toads
!
&quot;
cried
Ned
.
&quot;
That
must
be
the
very
factory
Tom
ran
his
tank
through
.
And
to
think
he
should
be
a
prisoner
there
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Held
by
whom
,
do
you
suppose
?
&quot;
asked
Mr.
Damon
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
By
that
Blakeson
gang
,
I
imagine
,
&quot;
Ned
answered
.
&quot;
There
's
no
time
to
lose
.
We
must
go
to
his
rescue
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Of
course
!
&quot;
agreed
Mr.
Damon
.
&quot;
We
're
much
obliged
to
you
for
bringing
this
note
,
&quot;
he
went
on
to
the
farmer
.
&quot;
And
here
is
something
to
repay
you
for
your
trouble
,
&quot;
and
he
took
out
his
wallet
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Shucks
!
I
did
n't
do
this
for
pay
!
&quot;
objected
the
farmer
.
&quot;
It
's
a
pity
I
would
n't
help
anybody
what
's
in
trouble
!
If
I
'd
a-knowed
what
it
meant
,
me
and
Bub
here
would
have
gone
to
the
factory
ourselves
,
maybe
,
and
done
the
work
quicker
.
But
I
did
n't
know
--
what
with
war
times
and
such-like
--
but
that
it
would
be
better
to
deliver
the
note
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
It
turns
out
as
well
,
perhaps
,
&quot;
agreed
Ned
.
&quot;
We
'll
look
after
Tom
now
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
And
I
'll
come
along
and
help
,
&quot;
said
the
farmer
.
&quot;
If
there
's
a
gang
of
tramps
in
that
factory
,
you
may
need
some
reinforcements
.
I
've
got
a
couple
of
new
axe
handles
in
my
machine
,
and
they
'll
come
in
mighty
handy
as
clubs
.
