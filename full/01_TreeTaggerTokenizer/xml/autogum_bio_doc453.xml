he
was

gave
up

at
Edinburgh
on

March

also
of

He
usually
had
a
place
on
important
commissions

and
for
many
years
was
chosen
one
of

assessors
to
the
moderator
to

matters

appointed
by
the
assembly
a
commissioner
for
the
West
of
Fife
,
to
superintend
the
establishment
of
kirks
and
placing
of

Ferguson
formed
one
of
a
deputation
to
wait
on
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_VI">
James
VI
</ref>
in
1583
to
discharge
the
duty
of
admonishing
him
‘
to
beware

to
check
reports

He
jocularly
told
the
king
that
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fergus_Mór">
Fergus
</ref>
was
the
first
king
of

that
he
was

;
but
recognising
that
King
James
had
the
possession
and
was
an
honest
man
he
would
give
him
his
right
.
In
the
discussion
warmth
was
displayed
by
some
of
the
deputies
,
but
Ferguson
succeeded
in
giving
a
new
turn
to
the
topics
at
critical
points
,
the
result
being
that
as
they
took
their
leave
‘
the
king
laid
his
hands
upon
every
one
of
them
.
’
In
August
of
the
same
year
Ferguson
and
six
other
ministers
were
cited
by
the
king
to
attend
a
convention
at
St

to
answer
for
certain
proceedings
of
