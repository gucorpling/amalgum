We
went
straight
to
the
lake
,
as
it
was
called
at
Bly
,
and
I
daresay
rightly
called
,
though
I
reflect
that
it
may
in
fact
have
been
a
sheet
of
water
less
remarkable
than
it
appeared
to
my
untraveled
eyes
.
My
acquaintance
with
sheets
of
water
was
small
,
and
the
pool
of
Bly
,
at
all
events
on
the
few
occasions
of
my
consenting
,
under
the
protection
of
my
pupils
,
to
affront
its
surface
in
the
old
flat-bottomed
boat
moored
there
for
our
use
,
had
impressed
me
both
with
its
extent
and
its
agitation
.
The
usual
place
of
embarkation
was
half
a
mile
from
the
house
,
but
I
had
an
intimate
conviction
that
,
wherever
Flora
might
be
,
she
was
not
near
home
.
She
had
not
given
me
the
slip
for
any
small
adventure
,
and
,
since
the
day
of
the
very
great
one
that
I
had
shared
with
her
by
the
pond
,
I
had
been
aware
,
in
our
walks
,
of
the
quarter
to
which
she
most
inclined
.
This
was
why
I
had
now
given
to
Mrs.
Grose
’s
steps
so
marked
a
direction
—
a
direction
that
made
her
,
when
she
perceived
it
,
oppose
a
resistance
that
showed
me
she
was
freshly
mystified
.
“
You
’re
going
to
the
water
,
Miss
?
—
you
think
she
’s
<hi rend="italic">
in
</hi>
—
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
She
may
be
,
though
the
depth
is
,
I
believe
,
nowhere
very
great
.
But
what
I
judge
most
likely
is
that
she
’s
on
the
spot
from
which
,
the
other
day
,
we
saw
together
what
I
told
you
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
When
she
pretended
not
to
see
—
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
With
that
astounding
self-possession
?
I
’ve
always
been
sure
she
wanted
to
go
back
alone
.
And
now
her
brother
has
managed
it
for
her
.
”
</p>
<p>
Mrs.
Grose
still
stood
where
she
had
stopped
.
“
You
suppose
they
really
<hi rend="italic">
talk
</hi>
of
them
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
could
meet
this
with
a
confidence
!
They
say
things
that
,
if
we
heard
them
,
would
simply
appall
us
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
And
if
she
<hi rend="italic">
is
</hi>
there
—
”
</p>
<p>
“
Yes
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Then
Miss
Jessel
is
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Beyond
a
doubt
.
You
shall
see
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Oh
,
thank
you
!
”
my
friend
cried
,
planted
so
firm
that
,
taking
it
in
,
I
went
straight
on
without
her
.
By
the
time
I
reached
the
pool
,
however
,
she
was
close
behind
me
,
and
I
knew
that
,
whatever
,
to
her
apprehension
,
might
befall
me
,
the
exposure
of
my
society
struck
her
as
her
least
danger
.
She
exhaled
a
moan
of
relief
as
we
at
last
came
in
sight
of
the
greater
part
of
the
water
without
a
sight
of
the
child
.
There
was
no
trace
of
Flora
on
that
nearer
side
of
the
bank
where
my
observation
of
her
had
been
most
startling
,
and
none
on
the
opposite
edge
,
where
,
save
for
a
margin
of
some
twenty
yards
,
a
thick
copse
came
down
to
the
water
.
The
pond
,
oblong
in
shape
,
had
a
width
so
scant
compared
to
its
length
that
,
with
its
ends
out
of
view
,
it
might
have
been
taken
for
a
scant
river
.
We
looked
at
the
empty
expanse
,
and
then
I
felt
the
suggestion
of
my
friend
’s
eyes
.
I
knew
what
she
meant
and
I
replied
with
a
negative
headshake
.
</p>
<p>
“
No
,
no
;
wait
!
She
has
taken
the
boat
.
”
</p>
<p>
My
companion
stared
at
the
vacant
mooring
place
and
then
again
across
the
lake
.
“
Then
where
is
it
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Our
not
seeing
it
is
the
strongest
of
proofs
.
She
has
used
it
to
go
over
,
and
then
has
managed
to
hide
it
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
All
alone
—
that
child
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
She
’s
not
alone
,
and
at
such
times
she
’s
not
a
child
:
she
’s
an
old
,
old
woman
.
”
I
scanned
all
the
visible
shore
while
Mrs.
Grose
took
again
,
into
the
queer
element
I
offered
her
,
one
of
her
plunges
of
submission
;
then
I
pointed
out
that
the
boat
might
perfectly
be
in
a
small
refuge
formed
by
one
of
the
recesses
of
the
pool
,
an
indentation
masked
,
for
the
hither
side
,
by
a
projection
of
the
bank
and
by
a
clump
of
trees
growing
close
to
the
water
.
</p>
<p>
“
But
if
the
boat
’s
there
,
where
on
earth
’s
<hi rend="italic">
she
?
</hi>
”
my
colleague
anxiously
asked
.
</p>
<p>
“
That
’s
exactly
what
we
must
learn
.
”
And
I
started
to
walk
further
.
</p>
<p>
“
By
going
all
the
way
round
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Certainly
,
far
as
it
is
.
It
will
take
us
but
ten
minutes
,
but
it
’s
far
enough
to
have
made
the
child
prefer
not
to
walk
.
She
went
straight
over
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Laws
!
”
cried
my
friend
again
;
the
chain
of
my
logic
was
ever
too
much
for
her
.
It
dragged
her
at
my
heels
even
now
,
and
when
we
had
got
halfway
round
—
a
devious
,
tiresome
process
,
on
ground
much
broken
and
by
a
path
choked
with
overgrowth
—
I
paused
to
give
her
breath
.
I
sustained
her
with
a
grateful
arm
,
assuring
her
that
she
might
hugely
help
me
;
and
this
started
us
afresh
,
so
that
in
the
course
of
but
few
minutes
more
we
reached
a
point
from
which
we
found
the
boat
to
be
where
I
had
supposed
it
.
It
had
been
intentionally
left
as
much
as
possible
out
of
sight
and
was
tied
to
one
of
the
stakes
of
a
fence
that
came
,
just
there
,
down
to
the
brink
and
that
had
been
an
assistance
to
disembarking
.
I
recognized
,
as
I
looked
at
the
pair
of
short
,
thick
oars
,
quite
safely
drawn
up
,
the
prodigious
character
of
the
feat
for
a
little
girl
;
but
I
had
lived
,
by
this
time
,
too
long
among
wonders
and
had
panted
to
too
many
livelier
measures
.
There
was
a
gate
in
the
fence
,
through
which
we
passed
,
and
that
brought
us
,
after
a
trifling
interval
,
more
into
the
open
.
Then
,
“
There
she
is
!
”
we
both
exclaimed
at
once
.
