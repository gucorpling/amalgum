IN
THE
ATMOSPHERE
FACTORY
</head>
<p>
For
two
days
I
waited
there
for
Kantos
Kan
,
but
as
he
did
not
come
I
started
off
on
foot
in
a
northwesterly
direction
toward
a
point
where
he
had
told
me
lay
the
nearest
waterway
.
My
only
food
consisted
of
vegetable
milk
from
the
plants
which
gave
so
bounteously
of
this
priceless
fluid
.
</p>
<p>
Through
two
long
weeks
I
wandered
,
stumbling
through
the
nights
guided
only
by
the
stars
and
hiding
during
the
days
behind
some
protruding
rock
or
among
the
occasional
hills
I
traversed
.
Several
times
I
was
attacked
by
wild
beasts
;
strange
,
uncouth
monstrosities
that
leaped
upon
me
in
the
dark
,
so
that
I
had
ever
to
grasp
my
long-sword
in
my
hand
that
I
might
be
ready
for
them
.
Usually
my
strange
,
newly
acquired
telepathic
power
warned
me
in
ample
time
,
but
once
I
was
down
with
vicious
fangs
at
my
jugular
and
a
hairy
face
pressed
close
to
mine
before
I
knew
that
I
was
even
threatened
.
</p>
<p>
What
manner
of
thing
was
upon
me
I
did
not
know
,
but
that
it
was
large
and
heavy
and
many-legged
I
could
feel
.
My
hands
were
at
its
throat
before
the
fangs
had
a
chance
to
bury
themselves
in
my
neck
,
and
slowly
I
forced
the
hairy
face
from
me
and
closed
my
fingers
,
vise-like
,
upon
its
windpipe
.
</p>
<p>
Without
sound
we
lay
there
,
the
beast
exerting
every
effort
to
reach
me
with
those
awful
fangs
,
and
I
straining
to
maintain
my
grip
and
choke
the
life
from
it
as
I
kept
it
from
my
throat
.
Slowly
my
arms
gave
to
the
unequal
struggle
,
and
inch
by
inch
the
burning
eyes
and
gleaming
tusks
of
my
antagonist
crept
toward
me
,
until
,
as
the
hairy
face
touched
mine
again
,
I
realized
that
all
was
over
.
And
then
a
living
mass
of
destruction
sprang
from
the
surrounding
darkness
full
upon
the
creature
that
held
me
pinioned
to
the
ground
.
The
two
rolled
growling
upon
the
moss
,
tearing
and
rending
one
another
in
a
frightful
manner
,
but
it
was
soon
over
and
my
preserver
stood
with
lowered
head
above
the
throat
of
the
dead
thing
which
would
have
killed
me
.
</p>
<p>
The
nearer
moon
,
hurtling
suddenly
above
the
horizon
and
lighting
up
the
Barsoomian
scene
,
showed
me
that
my
preserver
was
Woola
,
but
from
whence
he
had
come
,
or
how
found
me
,
I
was
at
a
loss
to
know
.
That
I
was
glad
of
his
companionship
it
is
needless
to
say
,
but
my
pleasure
at
seeing
him
was
tempered
by
anxiety
as
to
the
reason
of
his
leaving
Dejah
Thoris
.
Only
her
death
I
felt
sure
,
could
account
for
his
absence
from
her
,
so
faithful
I
knew
him
to
be
to
my
commands
.
</p>
<p>
By
the
light
of
the
now
brilliant
moons
I
saw
that
he
was
but
a
shadow
of
his
former
self
,
and
as
he
turned
from
my
caress
and
commenced
greedily
to
devour
the
dead
carcass
at
my
feet
I
realized
that
the
poor
fellow
was
more
than
half
starved
.
I
,
myself
,
was
in
but
little
better
plight
but
I
could
not
bring
myself
to
eat
the
uncooked
flesh
and
I
had
no
means
of
making
a
fire
.
When
Woola
had
finished
his
meal
I
again
took
up
my
weary
and
seemingly
endless
wandering
in
quest
of
the
elusive
waterway
.
</p>
<p>
At
daybreak
of
the
fifteenth
day
of
my
search
I
was
overjoyed
to
see
the
high
trees
that
denoted
the
object
of
my
search
.
About
noon
I
dragged
myself
wearily
to
the
portals
of
a
huge
building
which
covered
perhaps
four
square
miles
and
towered
two
hundred
feet
in
the
air
.
It
showed
no
aperture
in
the
mighty
walls
other
than
the
tiny
door
at
which
I
sank
exhausted
,
nor
was
there
any
sign
of
life
about
it
.
</p>
<p>
I
could
find
no
bell
or
other
method
of
making
my
presence
known
to
the
inmates
of
the
place
,
unless
a
small
round
hole
in
the
wall
near
the
door
was
for
that
purpose
.
It
was
of
about
the
bigness
of
a
lead
pencil
and
thinking
that
it
might
be
in
the
nature
of
a
speaking
tube
I
put
my
mouth
to
it
and
was
about
to
call
into
it
when
a
voice
issued
from
it
asking
me
whom
I
might
be
,
where
from
,
and
the
nature
of
my
errand
.
</p>
<p>
I
explained
that
I
had
escaped
from
the
Warhoons
and
was
dying
of
starvation
and
exhaustion
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
You
wear
the
metal
of
a
green
warrior
and
are
followed
by
a
calot
,
yet
you
are
of
the
figure
of
a
red
man
.
In
color
you
are
neither
green
nor
red
.
In
the
name
of
the
ninth
ray
,
what
manner
of
creature
are
you
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
am
a
friend
of
the
red
men
of
Barsoom
and
I
am
starving
.
In
the
name
of
humanity
open
to
us
,
&quot;
I
replied
.
</p>
<p>
Presently
the
door
commenced
to
recede
before
me
until
it
had
sunk
into
the
wall
fifty
feet
,
then
it
stopped
and
slid
easily
to
the
left
,
exposing
a
short
,
narrow
corridor
of
concrete
,
at
the
further
end
of
which
was
another
door
,
similar
in
every
respect
to
the
one
I
had
just
passed
.
No
one
was
in
sight
,
yet
immediately
we
passed
the
first
door
it
slid
gently
into
place
behind
us
and
receded
rapidly
to
its
original
position
in
the
front
wall
of
the
building
.
As
the
door
had
slipped
aside
I
had
noted
its
great
thickness
,
fully
twenty
feet
,
and
as
it
reached
its
place
once
more
after
closing
behind
us
,
great
cylinders
of
steel
had
dropped
from
the
ceiling
behind
it
and
fitted
their
lower
ends
into
apertures
countersunk
in
the
floor
.
