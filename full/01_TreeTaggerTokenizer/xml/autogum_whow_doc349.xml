for
Surgery
</head>
<p>
Regardless

whether
it
a
routine
operation
or
a
highly
complex
and
life
changing
one
,
surgery
can
be
a
terrifying
thing
.
It
is
also
something
that
can
be
emotionally
challenging
,
and
getting
your
head
around
the
impending
surgical
process
is
an
important
part
of
being
properly
prepared

You
may
feel
more
confident
about
the
surgery
if
you
understand
what
is
being
done
and
why
it
is
needed
.
Once
you
understand
this
better
,
try
to
explain
the
procedure
to
friends
and
family
;
talking
about
it
and
explaining
what
is
going
to
happen
to
others
can

a
valuable
way
of
boosting
your
confidence
and
helping
you
to
feel
more

is
going
to
be
happening

Pack
for
the
visit
.
Once
you
have
the
answers
to
your
questions
you
can
pack
–
think
about
how
long
you
’re
going
to
be
in
the
hospital
and
what
sorts
of
things
you
’re
going
to
want
.
You
may
want
clean
clothes
,
books
,
spectacles
(
if
you
require
them
)
and
so
on
.
Take
anything
you
think
you
might
miss
or
want
to
use
during
your
stay
,
but
try
to
limit
it
to
just
one
bag
.
If
you
need
something
else
,
your
family
and
friends
are
often
more
than
happy
to
take
your
dirty
clothing
and
bring
you
clean
,
or
exchange
your
books
and
games
when
you
’re
finished
with
one
.

If

’re
religious
,
you
may
choose
to
take
an
item
that
is
significant
to
your

if
not

many
people
choose
to
take

Plan
ahead
.
If
you‘re
going
to
be
out
of
work
for
a
period
of
time
post-surgery
,
take
the
appropriate
steps
to
ensure
that
you
and
your
family
are
provided
for
financially
during
this
time
.
This
may
be
something
you
have
to
discuss
with
your
health
insurance
or
national
health
service
(
it
will
vary
depending
on
where
you
live
)
.
Regardless
of
what
you
need
to
do
in
order
to
manage
it
,
be
sure
that
you
’re
not
going
to
end
up
in
a
tight
spot
financially
as
a
result
of
your
surgery
.
Sorting
this
out
in
advance
will
prevent
you
from
stressing
about
financial
matters
during
your
recovery
.

Continue
to
communicate
your
concerns
.
Regardless
of
whether
it
’s
asking
your
doctor
questions
or
talking
about
your
fears
with
your
partner
,
be
open
about
your
feelings
during
this
time
,
as
keeping
them
to
yourself
could
increase
your
stress
.
The
more
relaxed
you
are
,
the
better
–
some
studies
have
shown
that
there
are
fewer
complications
in
procedures
where
the
patient
feels
confident
and
relaxed
,
particularly
in
women
.
Thus
,
it
is
certainly
worth
trying
to
relax
yourself
and
have
confidence
in
your
surgeon
and
the
procedure
as
much
as
possible
.

You
might
feel
like
keeping
it
to
yourself
when
you
’re
expecting
surgery
,
but
it
can
be
much
more
beneficial
to
share
the
information
with
the
people
you
care
about
and
who
care
about
you
.
You
may
also
find
that
there
are
people
willing
to
help
out
with
your
household
maintenance
,
meals
,
etc.
,
during
your
recovery
but
if
they
do
n't
know
,
they
ca
n't
offer
such
help
.

Have
faith
.
It
does
n’t
have
to
be
a
deity
or
spirit
that
you
choose
to
have
faith
in
.
Have
faith
that
your
doctor
will
do
everything
that
is
needed
to
let
you
continue
living
a
happy
and
healthy
life
,
have
faith
that
your
body
will
heal
.
Have
faith
that
your
family
are
waiting
for
you
,
encouraging
you
.
Have
faith
in
yourself
and
everyone
that
loves
you
;
faith
is
a
simple
concept
that
gives
you
purpose
during
a
time
when
you
desperately
need
it
,
which
can
help
to
reduce
your
stress
levels
and
thus
make
you
more
relaxed
and
confident
.

Keep
as
fit
as
you
can
.
In
the
run
up
to
your
surgery
,
try
to
exercise
as
much
as
your
condition
safely
allows
,

and
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Sleep_Better">
get
plenty
of
rest
</ref>
.
Being
in
tip-top
condition
during
the
surgery
can
improve
your
mood
,
which
helps
you
to
stay
in
a
more
positive
frame
of
mind
,
as
well
as
helping
to
reduce
the
risk
of
complications
,
so
that
you
can
be
even
more
confident
when
going
into
the
surgery
.
