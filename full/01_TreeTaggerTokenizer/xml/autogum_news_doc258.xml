were
fired
by
US

at

The
site
of
the
attack
is
about
nine
miles
(
15
km
)
from
the
town
of
Wana
in
South
Waziristan
,
an

South
Waziristan
is
the
southern
part
of
Waziristan
,
a
mountainous
region
of
northwest
Pakistan
,
bordering
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Afghanistan">
Afghanistan
</ref>
and
covering
some
11,585
km
²
(
4,473
mi²
)
.
It
comprises
the
area
west
and
southwest
of
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Peshawar">
Peshawar
</ref>
between
the
Tochi
River
to
the
North
and
the
Gomal
river
to
the
south
,
forming
part
of
Pakistan
's
Federally
Administered
Tribal
Areas
(
FATA
)
.
The
North-West
Frontier
Province
lies
immediately
to
the
east
.
The
region
was
an
independent
tribal
territory
from
1893
,
remaining
outside
of
British-ruled
empire
and
Afghanistan
.
Tribal
raiding
into
British-ruled
territory
was
a
constant
problem
for
the
British
,
requiring
frequent
punitive
expeditions
between
1860
and
1945
.
The
region
became
part
of
Pakistan
in
1947
.

A
senior
security
official
said
that
&quot;
two
vehicles
fitted
with
guns
were
destroyed
,
&quot;
adding
that
&quot;
the
eight
people
killed
were
all
inside
the
vehicles
.
&quot;
Pakistani
intelligence
said
they
believed
the
extremists
killed
were
members
of
local
Pakistani
Taliban
groups
.
The
reports
also
said
that
the
missiles
&quot;
targeted
vehicles
mounted
with
anti-aircraft
guns
,
and
one
missile
missed
its
intended
target
and
landed
near
a
house
.
&quot;
A
local
official
said
nine
other
extremists
were
wounded
in
the
drone
strike
.

Agence
France-Presse
has
reported
that
&quot;
a
missile
attack
late
last
month
by
a
US
jet
killed
Rashid
Rauf
,
the
alleged
Al-Qaeda
mastermind
of
a
2006
transatlantic
airplane
bombing
plot
,
as
well
as
an
Egyptian
Al-Qaeda
operative
,
security
officials
have
said
.
&quot;
US
unmanned
drones
have
launched
not
less
than
20
missile
attacks
in
Pakistan
Afghan
border
or
tribal
areas
since
August
.
The
strikes
have
raised
tensions
between
Washington
and
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Islamabad">
Islamabad
</ref>
.

<p>
In
November
,
Prime
Minister
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yousuf%20Raza%20Gilani">
Yousuf
Raza
Gilani
</ref>
viewed
these
missile
strikes
as
flagrant
violation
of
Pakistan
's
sovereignty
and
territorial
integrity
.
He
announced
his
government
was
considering
&quot;
a
number
of
options
to
counter
attacks
&quot;
.
BBC
has
reported
,
however
,
that
Pakistan
&quot;
has
been
reluctant
to
move
either
diplomatically
or
militarily
to
stop
these
strikes
.
&quot;
&quot;
This
has
fuelled
speculation
that
the
attacks
may
be
part
of
a
secret
pact
between
Pakistan
and
the
US
,
&quot;
it
added
.
Meanwhile
,
President
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/George_W._Bush">
George
W.
Bush
</ref>
,
last
week
,
said
that
&quot;
you
know
very
well
that
when
it
comes
to
certain
matters
,
the
U.S.
government
does
n't
discuss
operations
.
&quot;
He
ruled
out
consultations
with

,
including

,
prior
to

strikes
operations
.
