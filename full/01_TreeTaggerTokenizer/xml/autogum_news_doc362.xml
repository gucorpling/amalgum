,
curling
the
little
finger
and
thumb
into
the
palm
and
raising
the
three
middle
fingers
in
the
air
.
Use
of
the
gesture
as
a
form
of
protest
began
last
weekend
in
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Bangkok">
Bangkok
</ref>
,
the
capital
of
the
country
.
</p>
<p>
This
form
of
protest
has
drawn
the
attention
of
Thailand
's
military
junta
,
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National%20Council%20for%20Peace%20and%20Order">

,
who
announced
its
intent
on
Tuesday
to
arrest
protestors
who
display
the
gesture
,
in
violation
of
orders
to
stop
.
Speaking
on
behalf
of
the
junta
,
Colonel
Weerachon
Sukhondhapatipak
said
to
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Associated_Press">
Associated
Press
</ref>
,
&quot;
At
this
point
we
are
monitoring
the
movement
.
If
it
is
an
obvious
form
of
resistance
,
then
we
have
to
control
it
so
it
does
n't
cause
any
disorder
in
the
country
.
&quot;
In
a
comment
to
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangkok%20Post">
Bangkok
Post
</ref>
,
Thai
army
Colonel
Winthai
Suwaree
shared
a
similar
sentiment
:
&quot;
[
The
junta
]
must
look
at
[
the
protester
's
]
intention
,
what
they
want
to
communicate
and
surrounding
circumstances
&quot;
.
</p>
<p>
Following
the
ousting
of
Thailand
's
elected
government
in
reportedly
the
fourteenth
coup
experienced
by
the
country
since
the
adoption
of
constitutional
monarchy
in
1932
,
the
country
remains
affected
by
a
curfew
spanning
midnight
to
4am
,
with
only

exempted
,
as
they
are
beach
resorts
frequented
by
tourists
,
a
group
for
whom
the
junta
made
the
move
in
a
bid
to
avoid
adverse
effects
to
the
country
's
tourist
industry
.
</p>
<p>
Nonetheless
,
in
the
wake
of
the
coup
,
the

(
DoS
)
advised
&quot;
U.S.
citizens
reconsider
any
non-essential
travel
to
Thailand
,
particularly
Bangkok
&quot;
.
The
DoS
also
informed
US
citizens
to
stay
away
from
groups
of
protestors
,
citing
that
&quot;
even
demonstrations
that
are
meant
to
be
peaceful
can
turn
confrontational
and
escalate
into
violence
.
&quot;
Other
restrictions
placed
on
citizens
by
the
junta
include
internet
censorship
and
restrictions
on
television
broadcasts
.
Also
banned
were
assemblies
of
five
or
more
people
with
political
intent
.
</p>
<p>
Solitary
displays
of
the
gesture
was
among
a
few
forms
of
protest
utilized
by
the
Thai
people
in
Bangkok
on
Sunday
,
amid
the
placement
of
almost
6000
soldiers
and
police
officers
by
the
junta
in
an
effort
to
suppress
protests
.
Other
displays
of
defiance
included
protestors
banding
together
in
flash
mobs
or
peacefully
walking
through
the
central
shopping
district
donning
masks
in
an
attempt
to
bypass
security
forces
stationed
there
.
</p>
<p>
The
gesture
finds
its
origins
in
<hi rend="italic">
The
Hunger
Games
</hi>
series
,
where
it
was
a
sign
of
thanks
,
admiration
,
and
farewell
to
a
loved
one
,
later
gaining
significance
,
in
the
second
book
<hi rend="italic">
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catching%20Fire">
Catching
Fire
</ref>
</hi>
,
as
a
symbol
of
rebellion
against
the
totalitarian
government
of
Panem
.
Protesters
,
however
,
have
found
their
own
ways
of
deriving
meaning
behind
the
gesture
,
with
some
reportedly
interpreting
it
as
standing
for
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liberté,%20égalité,%20fraternité">
liberté
,
égalité
,
fraternité
</ref>
,
values
popularized
by
the

Revolution
</ref>
.
</p>
<p>
A
purported
alternative
interpretation
by
protesters
held
the
gesture
stood
for
freedom
,
election
,
and
democracy
.
Still
others
have
created
a
photo
montage
of
the
gesture
with
a
picture
from
the
source
movie
,
which
circulated
online
,
with
the
caption
&quot;

.
No
Coup
,
2
.
Liberty
,
3
.
Democracy
&quot;
written
on
the
three
extended
fingers

with
this
message
:

Sombat
Boonngam-anong
,
a
social
activist
who
has
made
efforts
to
rally
the
Thai
people
in
continued
protest
,
offered
his
own
interpretation
of
the
gesture
on
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Facebook">
Facebook
</ref>
.
&quot;
Raising
three
fingers
has
become
a
symbol
in
calling
for
fundamental
political
rights
&quot;
.
Sombat
belongs
to
the
&quot;
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United%20Front%20for%20Democracy%20Against%20Dictatorship">
Red
Shirts
</ref>
&quot;
,
a
protest
group
which
has
supported
Shinawatra
's
government
and
the
earlier
government
of
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Thaksin_Shinawatra">
Thaksin
Shinawatra
</ref>
,
her
brother
,
and
conducted
protests
amid
prosecution
by
the
junta
.
Sombat
advocated
a
form
of
silent
protest
,
raising
of
their
right
arms
,
&quot;
3
fingers
,
3
times
a
day
&quot;
for
30
seconds
at
9
a.
m.
,
1
p.
m.
,
and
5
p.
m.
,
in
public
locations
where
police
officers
and
the
military
are
absent
.
&quot;
Let
's
escalate
the
anti-coup
movement
three
times
a
day
together
,
&quot;
said
Sombat
.
</p>
<p>
Weerachon
expressed
awareness
of
the
gesture
's
origins
,
stating
&quot;
We
know
it
comes
from
the
movie
,
and
let
's
say
it
represents
resistance
against
the
authorities
.
[
...
]
If
a
single
individual
raises
three
fingers
in
the
air
,
we
are
not
going
to
arrest
him
or
her
.
But
if
it
is
a
political
gathering
of
five
people
or
more
,
then
we
will
have
to
take
some
action
.
If
it
persists
,
then
we
will
have
to
make
an
arrest
.
&quot;
On
Sunday
,
protestors
were
reportedly
detained
for
that
reason
.
</p>
<p>
The
decision
to
criminalize
displays
of
the
gesture
have
drawn
the
criticism
of
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Watch">
Human
Rights
Watch
</ref>
,
stating
it
expresses
&quot;
a
mindset
that
views
human
rights
with
disdain
,
and
sees
youthful
defiance
as
the
enemy
.
&quot;
Human
Rights
Watch
's
Asia
director
,
Brad
Adams
,
remarked
:
&quot;
The
Thai
military
's
assault
on
basic
human
rights
has
apparently
grown
to
not
only
target
peaceful
protesters
but
now
also
silent
ones
as
well
—
since
now
just
holding
up
an
arm
with
a
three-finger
salute
is
enough
to
earn
the
junta
's
ire
&quot;
.
</p>
<p>
The
National
Council
for
Peace
and
Order
has
stated
it
imposed
military
rule
over
the
country
due
to
political
deadlock
resulting
from
demonstrations
spanning
seven
months
,
which
occasionally
erupted
into
violence
.
Last
year
,
on
the
volatile
political
situation
in
Thailand
,
scholar
Nicholas
Farrelly
wrote
in
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian%20Journal%20of%20International%20Affairs">
Australian
Journal
of
International
Affairs
</ref>
:
&quot;
Each
year
,
Thailand
tends
to
experience
at
least
one
period
of
frenzied
coup
speculation
.
Coups
clearly
still
play
a
major
role
in
Thai
mainstream
politics
.
