You
know
the
ones
?

<p>
<hi rend="bold">

Yes

And
they
gave
me
that
,
and
they
said
,
&quot;
Oh
,
you
got
no
software
.
&quot;
One
of
the
guys
at
council
said
&quot;
we
've
got
an
old
copy
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DataEase">
DataEase
</ref>
.
We
might
give
you
that
,
&quot;
which
old
an
old
database
programming
tool
.
So
I
took
that
and
I
wrote
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/point%20of%20sale">
point
of
sale
</ref>
system
for
the
centre
.
And
then
we
upgraded
from
DataEase
,
we
went
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dBase%20III">
dBase
III
</ref>
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dBase%20IV">
dBase
IV
</ref>
.
Did
n't
like
dBase
IV
,
it
had
all
these
bugs
in
it
,
so
my
system
started
to
crash
.
So
I
'd
go
home
at
night
and
write
the
program
,
and
then
come
back
and
put
it
into
the
centre
during
the
day
so
they
could
collect
the
statistics
I
wanted
.
It
was
a
simple
point
of
sale
system
,
but
it
was
effective
,
and
then
we
upgraded
that
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper%20(programming%20language)">
Clipper
</ref>
and
I
started
programming
object
orientated
while
I
was
there
,
and
wrote
the
whole
booking
system
,
we
had
bookings
for
the
pools
,
learn-to-swim
bookings
,
point
of
sale
.
We
actually
connected
it
to
an
automatic
turnstyle
with
the
coin
entry
so
it
gave
me
a
whole
heap
of
new
skills
in
IT
that
I
never
had
before
,
self-taught
,
because
I
'd
never
done
any
IT
courses
,
when
I
went
to
Brisbane
City
Council
and
that
did
n't
work
out
then
I
started
my
own
computer
company
.
I
took
what
I
'd
written
in
Clipper
and
decided
to
rewrite
that
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerbuilder">
Powerbuilder
</ref>
.
You
've
probably
heard
of
it
.

So
that
's
when
I
started
my
own
company
.
Walked
out
of
the
Brisbane
City
Council
.
I
had
an
ethical
disagreement
with
my
boss
,
who
spent
some
council
money
going
to
a
convention
at
one
place
and
doing
some
private
consultancy
,
which
I
did
n't
agree
with
Council
funds
being
done
like
that
,
so
I
resigned
.
Probably
the
best
move
of
my
business
life
.
It
then
allowed
me
then
to
become
an
entrepreneur
of
my
own
,
so
I
wrote
my
own
software
,
and
started
selling
a
leisure
package
which
basically
managed
leisure
centres
around
the
country
.
And
I
had
the
AIS
[
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Australian_Institute_of_Sport">
Australian
Institute
of
Sport
</ref>
]
as
one
of
my
clients
.

</hi>
Oh
!
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Tom
Kyle
:
</hi>
Yes
,
they
have
a
turnstyle
entry
system
and
learn-to-swim
booking
system
and
they
were
using
it
for
many
years
.
Had
people
all
over
the
country
.
I
ended
up
employing
ten
people
in
my
company
,
which
was
quite
good
,
right
through
to
,
I
suppose
,
1997
?
,
somewhere
in
there
.
And
I
was
still
coaching
full
time
,
well
,
not
full
time
,
but
,
voluntary
,
for
about
35
hours
a
week
at
Ashgrove
at
the
time
,
as
well
as
doing
,
I
did
the
Brisbane
under-14
rep
side
as
well
,
so
that
gave
me
a
good
appreciation
of
rep
basketball
.
So
I
'd
been
coaching
a
lot
of
school
basketball
in
that
time
.
And
then
in
2000
I
decided
to
give
that
away
and
went
to
work
for
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiters%20Hotel%20and%20Casino">
Jupiters
Casino
</ref>
.
Bit
of
a
change
.
I
started
as
a
business
analyst
and
ended
up
as
a
product
development
manager
.
I
was
doing
that
,
I
was
going
through
a
divorce
,
still
coaching
at
Ashgrove
,
I
had
been
at
Ashgrove
now
from
1992
through
to
2003
.
I
had
been
coaching
full
time
as
the
head
coach
,
coordinator
of
all
the
coaches
and
convener
of
the
sport
for
the
school
.
We
won
our
competitions
a
number
of
times
.
We
went
to
the
state
schools
competition
as
a
team
there
one
year
.
Which
we
did
quite
well
.
Did
n't
win
it
but
,
did
quite
well
.
In
2003
my
boys
had
finished
at
school
and
I
'd
got
a
divorce
at
that
stage
.
Been
offered
another
opportunity
to
go
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villanova%20College">
Villanova
College
</ref>
,
which
was
a
competing
school
across
the
other
side
of
the
river
.
So
I
started
head
coaching
there
for
five
years
.
It
was
there
where
I
started
to
get
into
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Wheelchair_basketball">
wheelchair
basketball
</ref>
.
It
is
an
interesting
story
,
because
at
that
stage
I
'd
moved
on
from
Jupiters
Casino
.
I
'd
actually
started
working
for
various
companies
,
and
I
ended
up
with
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suncorp%20group">
Suncorp
Metway
</ref>
as
a
project
manager
.
Got
out
of
my
own
company
and
decided
to
earn
more
money
as
a
consultant
.
