Incheon
International
Airport

</hi>
(
인천국제공항
)
(
ICN
)
is
South
Korea
's
largest
airport
,
its
main
international
gateway
,
and

airport
of

Understand
</head>
<p>
Incheon
International
Airport
was
built
to
the
west
of
<ref target="Seoul">
Seoul
</ref>
and
opened
in
2001
,
taking
over
from
Seoul
Gimpo
airport
as
the
nation
's
international
hub
.
It
has
comprehensive
connections
to
the
South
Korean
capital
,
and
is
frequently
rated
in
the
top
three
airports
in
the
world
.
The
terminal
buildings
are
architecturally
very
impressive
,
and
are
a
pleasure
to
look
at
,
even
if
you
are
not
flying
.
The
airport
is
beautiful
,
meticulously
clean
and
well
maintained
.
There
's
plenty
to
keep
one
occupied
while
waiting
.
The
nearby
city
of
<ref target="Incheon">
Incheon
</ref>
is
also
a
significant
center
of
industry
.
</p>
<p>
A
second
terminal
was
opened
in
time
for
the
2018
Winter
Olympics
.

Flights
</head>
<p>
Incheon
is
the
main
international
hub
for
both
Korean
Air
and
Asiana
,
with
many
airlines
flying
from
North
America
,
Europe
,
Africa
,
Australasia
and
Asia
.
</p>
<p>
The
vast
majority
of
domestic
Korean
flights
,
as
well
as
some
international
flights
to
China
,
Japan
and
Taiwan
,
are
still
handled
by
<ref target="Seoul">
Seoul
</ref>
Gimpo
airport
which
is
a
short
AREX
train
journey
from
Incheon
airport
.
</p>
<p>
There
are
a
limited
number
of
direct
flights
from
Seoul
Incheon
to
both
<ref target="Busan">
Busan
</ref>
'
s
<ref target="Gimhae%20International%20Airport">
Gimhae
International
Airport
</ref>
and
<ref target="Daegu">
Daegu
</ref>
every
day
.
These
cost
slightly
more
than
the
corresponding
flights
from
Gimpo
,
but
they
are
much
more
convenient
if
you
arrive
on
an
international
flight
.
These
are
actually
treated
as
international
connections
,
and
you
will
pass
immigration
later
at
your
destination
.

and
Gimpo
Airport
(
most
domestic

,
operating
from
05:20
until
00:00
.
There
are
express
services
and
all-stop
services
.
</p>
<p>
Express
services
to
the
city
(
every
half
hour
)
takes
43
minutes
(
Terminal
1
to
Seoul
Station
)
or
51
minutes
(
Terminal

Station
)
and
cost
₩8,500/₩7,000
(
adult/child
)
(
with

.
There
is
a
discounted
fare
of

days
,
groups
of

the
Seoul
Subway
system
)
take
an
hour
and
cost
₩4,150
from

from
T2
.
Many
times
it
's
faster
to
take
the
All-Stop
than
the
Express
train
.
</p>
<p>
The
All-Stop
and
the

train
leave
from
different
platforms
and
have
separate
ticket
booths
.
</p>
<p>

to
Incheon
need
to
enter
the
subway
area
with
a
T-money
or
single

ticket
to
access
the
AREX
platforms
.
The
cost
of
the
subway
ticket
is
refunded
when
buying
an
AREX
ticket
.
The
All-Stop
train
requires
a
T-money
card
or
single
entry
ticket
,
which
require
cash
.
The
Express
train
can
be
paid
with
credit

as
well
.

<p>
If
you
are
flying
with

Air
,
Asiana
Airlines
,
T'Way
Air
and
Jeju

you
can
check
into
your

before
you
get
on
the
AREX
Express
train
if
you
are
there
at
least
3
hours
before
your
departure
time
.
Immigration
officers
are
also
on
hand
to
stamp
your
passport
,
which
means
you
are
processed
and
can
quickly
go
through
the

Look

</p>
<p>
Travel
time
to
Gimpo
Airport
is
28/35
minutes
,
with
both
services
charging
₩3,100
,
making
this
the
fastest
and
cheapest
option
for
inter-airport

as
well
.

Maglev
train
</head>
<p>
In
February
2016
,
Incheon
opened
a
new
maglev
line
to
the
area
around
the
airport
and
adjacent
Yongyu
Island
.
It
begins
at
the
airport
A'REX
station
and
ends
at
<ref target="Yongyu">
Yongyu
</ref>
Station
,
stopping
at
the
airport
administration
building
,
long-term
parking
lots
,
and
a
couple
of
other
places
along
the
way
.
With
a
maximum
speed
of
,
it
is
not
exactly
in
the
same
class
as
the
Shanghai
Maglev
,
but
may
still
be
interesting
to
tourists
wishing
to
ride
a
maglev
for
the
first
time
or
those
in
town
for
an
event
on
Yongyu
.
The
train
runs
every
15
minutes
from
09:00
and
18:00
,
and
fares
are
free
for
the
first
few
years
after
opening
.

By
bus
</head>
<p>
When
traveling
into
Seoul
with
a
lot
of
luggage
or
are
heading
to
southern
parts
of
Seoul
(
eg
.
Gangnam
)
then
the
airport
buses
are
a
very
good
option
.
<hi rend="bold">
<ref target="http://www.kallimousine.com/">
Limousine
buses
</ref>
</hi>
(
₩15,000
to/from
city
for
one
way
,
₩6,500
to/from
Gimpo
Airport
(
domestic
flight
)
)
travel
directly
to
major
areas
and
big
hotels
in
Seoul
,
while
public
buses
(
₩8,000-9.000
)
will
take
you
to
major
transit
hubs
.
If
you
're
visiting
for
the
first
time
,
it
's
worth
paying
a
bit
extra
for
the
limousine
bus
.
For
either
bus
type
,
consult
the
big
maps
or
staff
to
figure
out
which
route
best
suits
your
needs
;
you
can
then
find
the
shuttles
outside
1st
floor
arrivals
(
if
possible
get
this
information
from
your
hotel
before
arriving
)
.
Or
simply
,
walk
out
and
ask
the
many
ticket
sellers
(
they
are
wearing
vests
)
which
bus
goes
to
your
hotel
because
if
it
's
a
popular
one
or
in
a
popular
area
,
they
'll
surely
know
which
you
'll
need
.
It
's
best
to
buy
tickets
at
any
of
the
ticket
gates
near
the
bus
arrival
area
but
you
can
also
pay
the
fare
using
won
or
a
T-Money
card
if
you
have
one
.
The
limousine
bus
drivers
are
extremely
friendly
but
do
n't
count
on
them
knowing
too
much
English
.
There
are
maps
inside
the
buses
letting
passengers
know
which
stops
are
upcoming
and
these
are
also
announced
in
Korean
and
English
.
Pressing
any
of
the
red
buttons
inside
signals
to
the
driver
you
want
off
at
the
next
stop
.
</p>
<p>
You
can
purchase
and
recharge
a
T-Money
card
at
the
GS25
store
which
is
located
at
the
end
of
the
arrivals
area
,
next
to
&quot;
International
Arrivals
F
&quot;
exit
.
</p>
<p>
If
you
have
a
late
flight
and
plan
on
getting
into
Seoul
via
bus
,
make
sure
you
get
out
to
the
curb
as
soon
as
you
can
.
The
last
buses
run
shortly
after
the
last
flights
land
.
If
you
miss
your
bus
,
you
'll
be
stuck
paying
for
a
taxi
,
as
the
trains
will
stop
running
too
.
</p>
<p>
There
are
also
inter-city
and
express
bus
to
cities
other
than
Seoul
.
