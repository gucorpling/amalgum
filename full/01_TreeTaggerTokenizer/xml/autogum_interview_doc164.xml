spoke
to
Joe

and

about
the

spam
</ref>
legislation
in
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/New_Zealand">
New

</ref>
that
comes
into
effect
today
.
Joe
Stewart
is
the
Unit
Manager
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department%20of%20Internal%20Affairs%20(New%20Zealand)">
Department
of
Internal
Affairs
</ref>
new
Anti-Spam
Compliance
Unit
,
and
David
Farrar
is
Chair
of
InternetNZ
’s
Public
Policy
Committee
,
who
also
had
significant
input
into
the
final
bill
.
</p>
<p>
Keith
Norris
,
CEO
of
the
New
Zealand
Marketing
Association
,
did
n't
respond
to
multiple
requests
for
an
interview
.
</p>
<p>
The
anti-spam
legislation
,
or
the
Unsolicited
Electronic
Messages
Act
2007
,
promotes
spam
education
and
awareness
and
will
enable
international
agencies
to
work
together
to
share
information
and
will
enable
cross-border
pursuit
of
serious
law
breakers
.
And
it
does
n't
just
cover
e-mail
spam
,
but
all
electronic
messaging
such
as
SMS/text
messaging
,
etc.
</p>
<p>
However
,
New
Zealand
is
n't
the
most
up-to-date
country
with
implementing
similar
legislation
,
Farrar
says
,
“
We
are
in
fact
almost
the
last
country
in
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD">
OECD
</ref>
to
have
such
legislation
.
”
He
urges
Eastern
Europe
and
China
to
take
part
in
the
fight
against
spam
.
</p>
<p>
Stewart
said
that
the
new
law
would
only
help
combat
a
small
amount
of
spam
,
as
99%-99.9
%
of
all
spam
received
originates
from
overseas
.
He
says
the
legislation
alone
will
not
solve
the
problem
.
</p>
<p>
As
well
as
it
helping
to
fight
New
Zealand-sourced
spam
and
preventing
New
Zealand
from
“
becoming
a
haven
for
spammers
”
,
it
will
promote
good
practices
within
the
e-marketing
community
,
Stewart
said
.
</p>
<p>
The
new
Act
will
affect
legitimate
marketers
in
New
Zealand
by
making
sure
they
have
expressed
or
inferred
consent
to
continue
sending
marketing
messages
to
people
on
their
database
.
Inferred
consent
is
where
the
marketers
have
the
e-mail
address
and
send
messages
to
those
on
their
database
,
but
did
n't
get
expressed
consent
to
send
messages
.
Stewart
does
issue
a
warning
against
using
inferred
consent
saying
,
“
They
may
have
been
sending
these
people
messages
for
years
,
but
this
does
not
establish
consent
.
”
</p>
<p>
A
surge
in
emails
has
also
been
felt
with
companies/marketers
making
sure
they
have
consent
to
continue
the
e-mails
and
asking
those
to
confirm
they
wish
to
continue
their
subscription
.
</p>
<p>
“
However
,
many
marketers
are
already
fulfilling
these
requirements
because
they
are
standard
good
e-marketing
practice
,
”
Stewart
said
.
</p>
<p>
Due
to
legislative
requirements
,
as
well
as
having
consent
,
businesses
will
have
to
provide
details
about
the
company
sending
the
item
,
and
provide
a
free
way
to
unsubscribe
from
future
mailings
.
</p>
<p>
Those
found
breaking
these
requirements
deliberately
could
find
themselves
facing
a
personal
fine
of
up
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NZ$">
NZ$
</ref>
200,000
.
Organisations
could
face
a
fine
of
up
to
$
500,000
.
Farrar
said
,
“
Experience
from
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Australia">
Australia
</ref>
shows
most
cases
are
dealt
with
by
way
of
education
.
”
</p>
<p>
Farrar
also
gives
a
final
piece
of
advice
to
those
annoyed
with
spam
levels
,
“
Never
ever
respond
to
a
spam
e-mail
,
and
only
give
your
real
address
out
to
people
you
trust
.
