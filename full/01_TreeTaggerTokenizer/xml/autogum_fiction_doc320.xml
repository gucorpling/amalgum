THE
SOUL
OF
NICHOLAS
SNYDERS
,
OR
THE
MISER
OF
ZANDAM
</head>
<p>
Once
upon
a
time
in
Zandam
,
which
is
by
the
Zuider
Zee
,
there
lived
a
wicked
man
named
Nicholas
Snyders
.
He
was
mean
and
hard
and
cruel
,
and
loved
but
one
thing
in
the
world
,
and
that
was
gold
.
And
even
that
not
for
its
own
sake
.
He
loved
the
power
gold
gave
him
--
the
power
to
tyrannize
and
to
oppress
,
the
power
to
cause
suffering
at
his
will
.
They
said
he
had
no
soul
,
but
there
they
were
wrong
.
All
men
own
--
or
,
to
speak
more
correctly
,
are
owned
by
--
a
soul
;
and
the
soul
of
Nicholas
Snyders
was
an
evil
soul
.
He
lived
in
the
old
windmill
which
still
is
standing
on
the
quay
,
with
only
little
Christina
to
wait
upon
him
and
keep
house
for
him
.
Christina
was
an
orphan
whose
parents
had
died
in
debt
.
Nicholas
,
to
Christina
’s
everlasting
gratitude
,
had
cleared
their
memory
--
it
cost
but
a
few
hundred
florins
--
in
consideration
that
Christina
should
work
for
him
without
wages
.
Christina
formed
his
entire
household
,
and
only
one
willing
visitor
ever
darkened
his
door
,
the
widow
Toelast
.
Dame
Toelast
was
rich
and
almost
as
great
a
miser
as
Nicholas
himself
.
“
Why
should
not
we
two
marry
?
”
Nicholas
had
once
croaked
to
the
widow
Toelast
.
“
Together
we
should
be
masters
of
all
Zandam
.
”
Dame
Toelast
had
answered
with
a
cackling
laugh
;
but
Nicholas
was
never
in
haste
.
</p>
<p>
One
afternoon
Nicholas
Snyders
sat
alone
at
his
desk
in
the
centre
of
the
great
semi-circular
room
that
took
up
half
the
ground
floor
of
the
windmill
,
and
that
served
him
for
an
office
,
and
there
came
a
knocking
at
the
outer
door
.
</p>
<p>
“
Come
in
!
”
cried
Nicholas
Snyders
.
He
spoke
in
a
tone
quite
kind
for
Nicholas
Snyders
.
He
felt
so
sure
it
was
Jan
knocking
at
the
door
--
Jan
Van
der
Voort
,
the
young
sailor
,
now
master
of
his
own
ship
,
come
to
demand
of
him
the
hand
of
little
Christina
.
In
anticipation
,
Nicholas
Snyders
tasted
the
joy
of
dashing
Jan
’s
hopes
to
the
ground
;
of
hearing
him
plead
,
then
rave
;
of
watching
the
growing
pallor
that
would
overspread
Jan
’s
handsome
face
as
Nicholas
would
,
point
by
point
,
explain
to
him
the
consequences
of
defiance
--
how
,
firstly
,
Jan
’s
old
mother
should
be
turned
out
of
her
home
,
his
old
father
put
into
prison
for
debt
;
how
,
secondly
,
Jan
himself
should
be
pursued
without
remorse
,
his
ship
be
bought
over
his
head
before
he
could
complete
the
purchase
.
The
interview
would
afford
to
Nicholas
Snyders
sport
after
his
own
soul
.
Since
Jan
’s
return
the
day
before
,
he
had
been
looking
forward
to
it
.
Therefore
,
feeling
sure
it
was
Jan
,
he
cried
“
Come
in
!
”
quite
cheerily
.
</p>
<p>
But
it
was
not
Jan.
It
was
somebody
Nicholas
Snyders
had
never
set
eyes
on
before
.
And
neither
,
after
that
one
visit
,
did
Nicholas
Snyders
ever
set
eyes
upon
him
again
.
The
light
was
fading
,
and
Nicholas
Snyders
was
not
the
man
to
light
candles
before
they
were
needed
,
so
that
he
was
never
able
to
describe
with
any
precision
the
stranger
’s
appearance
.
Nicholas
thought
he
seemed
an
old
man
,
but
alert
in
all
his
movements
;
while
his
eyes
--
the
one
thing
about
him
Nicholas
saw
with
any
clearness
--
were
curiously
bright
and
piercing
.
</p>
<p>
“
Who
are
you
?
”
asked
Nicholas
Snyders
,
taking
no
pains
to
disguise
his
disappointment
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
am
a
pedlar
,
”
answered
the
stranger
.
His
voice
was
clear
and
not
unmusical
,
with
just
the
suspicion
of
roguishness
behind
.
</p>
<p>
“
Not
wanting
anything
,
”
answered
Nicholas
Snyders
drily
.
“
Shut
the
door
and
be
careful
of
the
step
.
”
</p>
<p>
But
instead
the
stranger
took
a
chair
and
drew
it
nearer
,
and
,
himself
in
shadow
,
looked
straight
into
Nicholas
Snyders
’
face
and
laughed
.
</p>
<p>
“
Are
you
quite
sure
,
Nicholas
Snyders
?
Are
you
quite
sure
there
is
nothing
you
require
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Nothing
,
”
growled
Nicholas
Snyders
--
“except
the
sight
of
your
back
.
”
The
stranger
bent
forward
,
and
with
his
long
,
lean
hand
touched
Nicholas
Snyders
playfully
upon
the
knee
.
“
Would
n’t
you
like
a
soul
,
Nicholas
Snyders
?
”
he
asked
.
</p>
<p>
“
Think
of
it
,
”
continued
the
strange
pedlar
,
before
Nicholas
could
recover
power
of
speech
.
“
For
forty
years
you
have
drunk
the
joy
of
being
mean
and
cruel
.
Are
you
not
tired
of
the
taste
,
Nicholas
Snyders
?
Would
n’t
you
like
a
change
?
Think
of
it
,
Nicholas
Snyders
--
the
joy
of
being
loved
,
of
hearing
yourself
blessed
,
instead
of
cursed
!
Would
n’t
it
be
good
fun
,
Nicholas
Snyders
--
just
by
way
of
a
change
?
If
you
do
n’t
like
it
,
you
can
return
and
be
yourself
again
.
”
</p>
<p>
What
Nicholas
Snyders
,
recalling
all
things
afterwards
,
could
never
understand
was
why
he
sat
there
,
listening
in
patience
to
the
stranger
’s
talk
;
for
,
at
the
time
,
it
seemed
to
him
the
jesting
of
a
wandering
fool
.
But
something
about
the
stranger
had
impressed
him
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
have
it
with
me
,
”
continued
the
odd
pedlar
;
“
and
as
for
price
--
”
The
stranger
made
a
gesture
indicating
dismissal
of
all
sordid
details
.
“
I
look
for
my
reward
in
watching
the
result
of
the
experiment
.
I
am
something
of
a
philosopher
.
I
take
an
interest
in
these
matters
.
See
.
”
The
stranger
dived
between
his
legs
and
produced
from
his
pack
a
silver
flask
of
cunning
workmanship
and
laid
it
on
the
table
.
</p>
<p>
“
Its
flavour
is
not
unpleasant
,
”
explained
the
stranger
.
“
A
little
bitter
;
but
one
does
not
drink
it
by
the
goblet
:
a
wineglassful
,
such
as
one
would
of
old
Tokay
,
while
the
mind
of
both
is
fixed
on
the
same
thought
:
‘
May
my
soul
pass
into
him
,
may
his
pass
into
me
!
’
The
operation
is
quite
simple
:
the
secret
lies
within
the
drug
.
”
The
stranger
patted
the
quaint
flask
as
though
it
had
been
some
little
dog
.
