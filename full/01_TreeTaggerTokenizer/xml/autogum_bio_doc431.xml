Background
</head>
<p>
Donellan
was
born
in
the
county
of
Galway
,
a
son
of
Mael
Sechlainn
Ó
Dónalláin
,
by
his
wife
Sisly
,
daughter
of
William
Ó
Cellaigh
of
Calla
.
He
was
a
descendant
of

.
</p>
<p>
He
was
entered
as
Nehemiah
Daniel
on
13
January
1579-80
at
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King's_College,_Cambridge">

,
and
shortly
afterwards
matriculated
in
the
same
name
.
Subsequently
,
he
migrated
to

where
he
took
the

<head>
Career
</head>
<p>
On
his
return
to
his
native
country
he
acted
for
some
time
as
coadjutor
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Ó_Maolalaidh">
William
Ó
Maolalaidh
</ref>
,
archbishop
of
Tuam
,
and
afterwards
,
on
the
recommendation
of
Thomas
,
earl
of
Ormonde
,
he
was
appointed
the
successor
of
that
prelate
,
by
letters
patent
dated
17
August
1595
.
</p>
<p>
Two
days
later
he
received
restitution
of
the
temporalities
.
In
the
writ
of
privy
seal
directing
his
appointment
,
it
was
alleged
that
he
was
very
fit
to
communicate
with
the
people
in
their
mother
tongue
,
and
a
very
meet
instrument
to
retain
and
instruct
them
in
duty
and
religion
;
and
that
he
had
also
taken
pains
in
translating
and
putting
to
the
press
the
Communion
Book
and
New
Testament
in
the
Irish
language
,
which
Her
Majesty
greatly
approved
of
.
</p>
<p>
It
is
asserted
by
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teige_Ó_Dubhagáin">
Teige
Ó
Dubhagáin
</ref>
(
see
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dugan">
Dugan
</ref>
)
,
who
drew
up
a
pedigree
of
the
Donellan
family
,
that
he
was
never
in
holy
orders
,
but
probably
the
genealogist
may
have
been
led
to
make
this
startling
assertion
simply
by
an
unwillingness
to
acknowledge
the
orders
of
the
reformed
church
.
In
addition
to
his
see
the
archbishop
held
by
dispensation
the
rectory
of
Kilmore
in
the
county
of
Kilkenny
,
and
the
vicarages
of
Castle-doagh
in
the
diocese
of
Ossory
,
and
of
Donard
in
the
diocese
of
Dublin
.
He
voluntarily
resigned
his
see
in
1609
,
and
dying
shortly
afterwards
at
Tuam
,
was
buried
in
the
cathedral
there
.

Donellan
was
a
master
of
the
Irish
language
,
and
continued
the
version
of
the
New
Testament
which
had
been
commenced
by
John
Kearney
and
Nicholas
Walsh
,
bishop
of
Ossory
,
and
which
was
completed
by
William
O'Donnell
or
Daniell
,
who
was
afterwards
raised
to
the
archiepiscopal
see
of
Tuam
.
It
was
published
in
1602
at
Dublin
,
under
the
title
of
<hi rend="italic">

It
was
brought
out
at
the
expense
of
the
province
of
Connaught
and
of
Sir
William
Usher
,
the
clerk
of
the
council
in
Ireland
.
Great
expectations
were
formed
of
this
undertaking
,
and
it
was
confidently
believed
that
it
would
be
the
means
of
destroying
the
Roman
church
in
Ireland
.
It
is
a
noteworthy
fact
that
of
the
four
scholars
engaged
in
translating
the
New
Testament
into
the
Irish
vernacular
,
three
-
Kearney
,
Walsh
,
and
Donellan
-
received
their
education
in
the
University
of
Cambridge
