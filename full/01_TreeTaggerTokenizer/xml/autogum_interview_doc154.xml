Amanda
Carter
:
</hi>
That
would
have
been
about
right
.
It
was
pretty
packed
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
(
(
</hi>
<hi rend="bold">
WN
</hi>
<hi rend="bold">
)
)
</hi>
That
must
have
been
awesome
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Amanda
Carter
:
</hi>
It
was
.
It
was
.
I
guess
also
because
it
was
the
USA
.
It
was
their
home
crowd
and
everything
,
so
it
was
a
very
packed
game
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
(
(
</hi>
<hi rend="bold">
WN
</hi>
<hi rend="bold">

)
</hi>
They
also
have
a
fondness
for
the
sport
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Amanda
Carter
:
</hi>
They
do
.
They
love
basketball
.
But
Atlanta
again
was
done
very
well
.
Would
have
been
nice
to
get
the
medal
,
‘
cause
I
think
we
sort
of
had
bigger
expectations
of
ourselves
at
that
point
,
‘
cause
we
were
n't
the
new
kids
on
the
block
at
that
point
but
still
finished
fourth
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
(
(
</hi>
<hi rend="bold">

</hi>
<hi rend="bold">

</hi>
They
kept
on
saying
in
London
that
the
Gliders
have
never
won
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Amanda
Carter
:
</hi>
We
've
never
won
a
gold
,
no
.
Not
at
World
's
or
Paralympics
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
(
(
</hi>
<hi rend="bold">
WN
</hi>
<hi rend="bold">
)
)
</hi>
So
that
was
Atlanta
.
Then
there
was
another
tournament
,
the
1998
Gold
Cup
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Amanda
Carter
:
</hi>
Yes
.
Which
was
the
World
Championships
held
in
Sydney
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
(
(
</hi>
<hi rend="bold">
WN
</hi>
<hi rend="bold">
)
)
</hi>
How
did
we
go
in
that
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Amanda
Carter
:
</hi>
Third
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
(
(
</hi>
<hi rend="bold">
WN
</hi>
<hi rend="bold">
)
)
</hi>
But
that
qualified
...
no
,
wait
,
we
did
n't
need
to
qualify
...
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Amanda
Carter
:
</hi>
We
did
n't
need
to
qualify
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
(
(
</hi>
<hi rend="bold">
WN
</hi>
<hi rend="bold">
)
)
</hi>
You
were
the
second
leading
scorer
in
the
event
,
with
thirty
points
scored
for
the
competition
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Amanda
Carter
:
</hi>
Yes
.
Which
was
unusual
for
a
low
pointer
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
(
(
</hi>
<hi rend="bold">
WN
</hi>
<hi rend="bold">
)
)
</hi>
In
basketball
,
some
of
the
low
pointers
do
pretty
well
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Amanda
Carter
:
</hi>
Yeah
,
but
in
those
days
I
guess
it
was
more
unusual
for
a
low
pointer
to
be
more
a
scorer
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
(
(
</hi>
<hi rend="bold">
WN
</hi>
<hi rend="bold">
)
)
</hi>
I
notice
the
scores
seem
lower
than
the
ones
in
London
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Amanda
Carter
:
</hi>
Yes
.
I
think
over
time
the
women
's
game
has
developed
.
Girls
have
got
stronger
and
they
're
competing
against
guys
.
Training
has
got
better
,
and
all
sorts
of
things
.
So
teams
have
just
got
better
.

How
often
do
the
Gliders
get
together
?
It
seems
that
you
are
all
scattered
all
over
the
country
normally
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Amanda
Carter
:
</hi>
Yes
.
I
mean
we
've
got
currently
three
in
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Perth">
Perth
</ref>
,
four
in
Melbourne
,
four
in
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/New_South_Wales">
New
South
Wales
</ref>
,
and
one
in
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Brisbane">
Brisbane
</ref>
out
of
the
twelve
that
were
in
London
.
But
the
squad
is
bigger
again
.
We
usually
get
together
probably
every
six
or
eight
weeks
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
(
(
</hi>
<hi rend="bold">
WN
</hi>
<hi rend="bold">
)
)
</hi>
That
's
reasonably
often
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Amanda
Carter
:
</hi>
Cost-wise
it
's
expensive
to
get
us
all
together
.
What
we
sometimes
do
is
tack
a
camp
on
to
the
Women
's
League
,
when
we
're
mostly
all
together
anyway
,
no
matter
where
it
is
,
and
we
might
stay
a
couple
of
extra
days
in
order
to
train
together
.
But
generally
if
we
come
into
camp
it
would
be
at
the
AIS
.

I
did
n't
see
you
training
in
Sydney
this
time

then
you
went
over
