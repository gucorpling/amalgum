Create
Backgrounds
in
Artwork
</head>
<p>
To
simplify
art
creating
,
there
are
two
major
parts
.
One
is
the
focal
point
,
where
your
eye
rests
,
and
the
background
which
is
the
reference
for
the
main
focal
point
.

Know
what
power
your
background
can
have
.
A
beginning
artist
is
likely
to
draw
or
paint
a
person
from
a
photograph
or
from
real
life
.
If
you
have
studied
drawing
,
you
know
about
proportion
,
shading
,
the
value
of
using
good
paper
,
a
set
of
drawing
pencils
,
the
use
of
pastels
,
charcoal
,
or
how
to
do
the
same
using
watercolor
or
acrylic
paint
.
But
to
really
demonstrate
your
talent
,
you
should
also
include
some
type
of
background
.
The
background
is
the
key
for
showing
the
environment
,
or
surroundings
,
location
,
a
culture
,
historical
reference
,
a
person
’s
status
,
or
circumstance
for
the
artwork
.
This
is
true
for
drawing
a
house
,
people
,
animals
,
a
still
life
,
or
imaginary
characters
.

Look
at
your
subject
closely
.
This
will
help
you
decide
how
to
form
your
background
.
Ask
yourself
some
questions
(
using
a
house
as
an
example
,
but
other
subjects
apply
)
:

When
drawing
your
house
,
the
house
needs
reference
information
.
Is
it
a
ranch
style
with
a
garage
and
a
big
tree
out
front
?
Is
it
a
smaller
home
in
the
country
with
a
pond
and
animals
standing
by
the
barn
?
</item>
<item>
What
makes
this
house
so
special
you
want
to
draw
it
?
Look
for
actual
details
showing
where
the
mailbox
is
,
how
many
bushes
are
in
the
yard
.
Is
the
house
being
drawn
on
a
sunny
day
or
a
cool
autumn
day
when
the
family
is
out
raking
leaves
together
?
This
captures
the
moment
and
makes
the
simple
house
drawing
tell
a
story
.

Do
not
place
the
objects
you
are
drawing
in
the
dead
center
of
the
paper
.
Being
slightly
off
the
mid-point
will
add
interest
,
especially
if
you
are
drawing
a
group
of
objects
such
as
flowers
in
a
vase
,
a
coffee
mug
and
a
newspaper
.
Each
of
these
objects
has
an
unique
shape
and
height
,
and
the
background
should
work
to
located
where
these
objects
can
be
seen
,
in
the
kitchen
,
your
end
table
,
the
back
patio
,
etc.

Look
at
your
walls
.
Besides
the
color
of
the
walls
,
there
are
windows
,
entry
ways
,
bedroom
doors
,
clocks
,
awards
,
family
photos
,
furniture
,
a
t.
v.
,
bookshelves
and
other
items
piled
up
.
Take
in
a
visual
inventory
of
the
interior
space
and
list
things
for
the
next
time
you
do
n’t
know
what
to
add
to
your
drawing
.
Also
,
do
n’t
make
the
background
too
busy
or
unrelated
to
the
focal
area
.
American
Gothic
by
Grant
Wood
has
little
background
but
it
says
a
lot
.

Consider
composition
.
Artists
use
a
term
called
composition
which
means
understanding
the
placement
of
visual
elements
.
Using
a
type
of
grid
,
good
composition
places
some
things
above
the
center
and
others
below
,
especially
in
landscape
drawing
.
Use
a
horizon
line
to
show
subjects
in
the
distance
.
Objects
which
are
closer
are
larger
,
and
they
become
smaller
in
the
distance
.

Plan
the
setting
.
Using
all
you
know
about
background
information
,
think
of
the
setting
.
For
an
drawing
exercise
,
think
of
what
would
you
see
out
your
window
if
you
lived
in
NYC
versus
a
window
in
rural
Iowa
?
Draw
what
you
know
best
or
use
photos
if
you
can
not
picture
it
.

Use
developed
lines
and
textures
.
Practice
using
the
side
of
the
pencil
,
make
marks
which
are
dots
,
dashes
,
short
strokes
and
curved
.
These
techniques
will
enrich
the
overall
quality
of
your
drawing
and
make
your
drawing
become
a
real
standout
.
Above
all
,
do
not
leave
the
background
empty
.
