CHAPTER
TWELVE
.
MARIE
TAKES
A
DESPERATE
CHANCE
</head>
<p>
Domestic
wrecks
may
be
a
subject
taboo
in
polite
conversation
,
but
Joe
De
Barr
was
not
excessively
polite
,
and
he
had
,
moreover
,
a
very
likely
hope
that
Marie
would
yet
choose
to
regard
him
with
more
favor
than
she
had
shown
in
the
past
.
He
did
not
chance
to
see
her
at
once
,
but
as
soon
as
his
work
would
permit
he
made
it
a
point
to
meet
her
.
He
went
about
it
with
beautiful
directness
.
He
made
bold
to
call
her
up
on
“
long
distance
”
from
San
Francisco
,
told
her
that
he
would
be
in
San
Jose
that
night
,
and
invited
her
to
a
show
.
</p>
<p>
Marie
accepted
without
enthusiasm
--
and
her
listlessness
was
not
lost
over
forty
miles
of
telephone
wire
.
Enough
of
it
seeped
to
Joe
's
ears
to
make
him
twist
his
mustache
quite
furiously
when
he
came
out
of
the
telephone
booth
.
If
she
was
still
stuck
on
that
fellow
Bud
,
and
could
n't
see
anybody
else
,
it
was
high
time
she
was
told
a
few
things
about
him
.
It
was
queer
how
a
nice
girl
like
Marie
would
hang
on
to
some
cheap
guy
like
Bud
Moore
.
Regular
fellows
did
n't
stand
any
show
--
unless
they
played
what
cards
happened
to
fall
their
way
.
Joe
,
warned
by
her
indifference
,
set
himself
very
seriously
to
the
problem
of
playing
his
cards
to
the
best
advantage
.
</p>
<p>
He
went
into
a
flower
store
--
disdaining
the
banked
loveliness
upon
the
corners
--
and
bought
Marie
a
dozen
great
,
heavy-headed
chrysanthemums
,
whose
color
he
could
not
name
to
save
his
life
,
so
called
them
pink
and
let
it
go
at
that
.
They
were
not
pink
,
and
they
were
not
sweet
--
Joe
held
the
bunch
well
away
from
his
protesting
olfactory
nerves
which
were
not
educated
to
tantalizing
odors
--
but
they
were
more
expensive
than
roses
,
and
he
knew
that
women
raved
over
them
.
He
expected
Marie
to
rave
over
them
,
whether
she
liked
them
or
not
.
</p>
<p>
Fortified
by
these
,
groomed
and
perfumed
and
as
prosperous
looking
as
a
tobacco
salesman
with
a
generous
expense
account
may
be
,
he
went
to
San
Jose
on
an
early
evening
train
that
carried
a
parlor
car
in
which
Joe
made
himself
comfortable
.
He
fooled
even
the
sophisticated
porter
into
thinking
him
a
millionaire
,
wherefore
he
arrived
in
a
glow
of
self-esteem
,
which
bred
much
optimism
.
</p>
<p>
Marie
was
impressed
--
at
least
with
his
assurance
and
the
chrysanthemums
,
over
which
she
was
sufficiently
enthusiastic
to
satisfy
even
Joe
.
Since
he
had
driven
to
the
house
in
a
hired
automobile
,
he
presently
had
the
added
satisfaction
of
handing
Marie
into
the
tonneau
as
though
she
were
a
queen
entering
the
royal
chariot
,
and
of
ordering
the
driver
to
take
them
out
around
the
golf
links
,
since
it
was
still
very
early
.
Then
,
settling
back
with
what
purported
to
be
a
sigh
of
bliss
,
he
regarded
Marie
sitting
small
and
still
and
listless
beside
him
.
The
glow
of
the
chrysanthemums
had
already
faded
.
Marie
,
with
all
the
girlish
prettiness
she
had
ever
possessed
,
and
with
an
added
charm
that
was
very
elusive
and
hard
to
analyze
,
seemed
to
have
lost
all
of
her
old
animation
.
</p>
<p>
Joe
tried
the
weather
,
and
the
small
gossip
of
the
film
world
,
and
a
judiciously
expurgated
sketch
of
his
life
since
he
had
last
seen
her
.
Marie
answered
him
whenever
his
monologue
required
answer
,
but
she
was
unresponsive
,
uninterested
--
bored
.
Joe
twisted
his
mustache
,
eyed
her
aslant
and
took
the
plunge
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
guess
joy-ridin
'
kinda
calls
up
old
times
,
ay
?
”
he
began
insidiously
.
“
Maybe
I
should
n't
have
brought
you
out
for
a
ride
;
maybe
it
brings
back
painful
memories
,
as
the
song
goes
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Oh
,
no
,
”
said
Marie
spiritlessly
.
“
I
do
n't
see
why
it
should
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
No
?
Well
,
that
's
good
to
hear
you
say
so
,
girlie
.
I
was
kinda
afraid
maybe
trouble
had
hit
you
hard
.
A
sensitive
,
big-hearted
little
person
like
you
.
But
if
you
've
put
it
all
outa
your
mind
,
why
,
that
's
where
you
're
dead
right
.
Personally
,
I
was
glad
to
see
you
saw
where
you
'd
made
a
mistake
,
and
backed
up
.
That
takes
grit
and
brains
.
Of
course
,
we
all
make
mistakes
--
you
was
n't
to
blame
--
innocent
little
kid
like
you
--
”
</p>
<p>
“
Yes
,
”
said
Marie
,
“
I
guess
I
made
a
mistake
,
all
right
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Sure
!
But
you
seen
it
and
backed
up
.
And
a
good
thing
you
did
.
Look
what
he
'd
of
brought
you
to
by
now
,
if
you
'd
stuck
!
”
</p>
<p>
Marie
tilted
back
her
head
and
looked
up
at
the
tall
row
of
eucalyptus
trees
feathered
against
the
stars
.
“
What
?
”
she
asked
uninterestedly
.
</p>
<p>
“
Well
--
I
do
n't
want
to
knock
,
especially
a
fellow
that
's
on
the
toboggan
already
.
But
I
know
a
little
girl
that
's
aw-fully
lucky
,
and
I
'm
honest
enough
to
say
so
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Why
?
”
asked
Marie
obligingly
.
“
Why
--
in
particular
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Why
in
particular
?
”
Joe
leaned
toward
her
.
“
Say
,
you
must
of
heard
how
Bud
's
going
to
the
dogs
.
If
you
have
n't
,
I
do
n't
want
--
”
</p>
<p>
“
No
,
I
had
n't
heard
,
”
said
Marie
,
looking
up
at
the
Big
Dipper
so
that
her
profile
,
dainty
and
girlish
still
,
was
revealed
like
a
cameo
to
Joe
.
“
Is
he
?
I
love
to
watch
the
stars
,
do
n't
you
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
love
to
watch
a
star
,
”
Joe
breathed
softly
.
“
So
you
had
n't
heard
how
Bud
's
turned
out
to
be
a
regular
souse
?
Honest
,
did
n't
you
know
it
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
No
,
I
did
n't
know
it
,
”
said
Marie
boredly
.
“
Has
he
?
”
</p>
