Early
involvement
with
Vancouver
politics
</head>
<p>
In
1989
–
90
,
Bass
served
on
Vancouver
's
Clouds
of
Change
Task
Force
which
addressed
the
issues
of
global
climate
change
.
Bass
,
concerned
about
global
warming
,
entered
electoral
politics
in
1996
as
a
candidate
for
Vancouver
's
civic
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_of_British_Columbia">
Green
Party
</ref>
under
the
leadership
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Parker_(politician)">
Stuart
Parker
</ref>
but
was
defeated
by
a
wide
margin
.
However
,
the
increased
share
of
the
vote
won
by
the
Greens
and
of
a
new
populist
party
called
VOICE
resulted
in
a
total
rout
for
the
city
's
leftist
forces
in
which
every
single
candidate
who
was
not
a
member
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Partisan_Association">
Non-Partisan
Association
</ref>
was
defeated
.
Despite
being
the
Greens
'
second-best
vote-getter
in
the
1996
election
(
second
only
to
the
party
's
provincial
leader
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Parker_(politician)">

)
,
Bass
was
defeated
when
he
sought
renomination
by
the
Greens
in
1999
.
With
the
support
of
the
Greens
'
executive
and
provincial
leadership
,
he
sought
and
won
the
nomination
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_of_Progressive_Electors">

Elected
city
councillor
</head>
<p>
Bass
was
first
elected
to
city
council
in
1999
as
a
member
of
COPE
,
and
topped
the
polls
when
re-elected
in
2002
with
70,525
votes
.
His
political
priorities
were
action
on
the
environment
and
transit
.
Bass
was
outspoken
in
his
opposition
to
the
expansion
of
gambling
and
to
excessive
expenditures
for
rapid
transit
by
a
faction
of
his
party
under
the
leadership
of
Mayor

was

election
,
finishing
12th
overall
with
48,248
votes
.
</p>
<p>
Bass
introduced
a
controversial
motion
in
2005
to
widen
the
sidewalks
on
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrard_Bridge">
Burrard
Bridge
</ref>
to
encourage
cyclists
and
pedestrians
,
but
first
do
a
minimal-cost
trial
of
using
one
lane
in
each
direction
for
bicycles
,
reserving
the
existing
sidewalk
for
pedestrians
,
despite
the
failure
of
a
similar
experiment
in
1996
.
The
sidewalk-widening
was
slated
to
cost
$
13
million
if
the
$
2
million
trial
failed
.
Some
cyclists
applauded
the
move
,
though
other
users
of
the
current
bridge
sidewalks
questioned
whether
any
changes
were
necessary
.
Concerns
about
motorist
rage
did
not
deter
Bass
,
who
stated
&quot;
Motorists
called
for
my
head
long
ago
and
my
head
is
still
on
my
neck
.
&quot;

Heritage
advocates
strongly
supported
the
bicycle
trial
,
since
the
sidewalk-widening
would
impair
the
heritage
value
of
this
landmark
,
art
deco
bridge
.
Bass
was
the
council
lead
on
the
Vancouver
Area
Transit
Plan
,
which
planned
six
new
bus
routes
and
a
number
of
transit-friendly
changes
.

Intentions
to
run
for
mayor
</head>
<p>
In
late
2006
he
announced
his
aspiration
to
run
for
mayor
in
the
next
Vancouver
civic
election
because
of
his
concerns
for
respect
,
global
warming
,
homelessness
and
lack
of
affordable
housing
.
In
August
2007
,
he
announced
that
he
no
longer
intended
to
participate
in
the
mayoral
race
.
