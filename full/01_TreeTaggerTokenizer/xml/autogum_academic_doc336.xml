The
Photovoltaic
Roof
Tile
</head>
<p>
The
subject
of
the
research
was
a
commercial
PV
roof
tile
,
which
consisted
of
nine
monocrystalline
silicon
solar
cells
.
Table
1
shows
the
basic
data
concerning
its
construction
,
while
Table

shows
the
electrical
data
of
the
tested
unit
.
</p>
<p>
Cooling
of
the
PV
roof
tile
,
which
was
heated
by
the
influence
of
incident
light
,
was
made
possible
by
placing
it
in
a
specially
designed
wooden
casing
.
It
was
decided
to
use
wood
to
reproduce
the
conditions
prevailing
on
a
roof
(
PV
roof
tiles
,
similarly
to
traditional
ones
,
are
attached
to
a
wooden
frame
)
.
This
casing
,
together
with
the
inlet
and
outlet
,
formed
a
channel
through
which
the
air
flowed
,
cooling
the
back
wall
of
the
PV
roof
tile
.
To
intensify
the
heat
transfer
and
to
direct
the
air
flow
,
there
were
special
fins
mounted
on
the
bottom
.
The
PV
roof
tile
was
pressed
from
the
top
,
preventing
its
shifting
relative
to
the
entire
casing
.

a
3D
model
of
the
designed
casing
together
with
the
PV
roof
tile
:
this
construction
only
reproduces
a
small
part
of
the
roofing
.
</p>
<p>
As
presented
above
,
the
PV
roof
tile
,
in
accordance
with
the
producer
’s
data
,
could
be
mounted
on
a
roof
in
the
way
shown
in
<figure>
Figure

.
The
PV
roof
tiles
were
hung
on
metal
hooks
attached
to
the
roof
battens
,
and
a
steel
cable
reinforced
the
fixing
.

The
Solar
Light
Simulator
</head>
<p>
Since
the
research
was
carried
out
in
the
laboratory
,
without
access
to
natural
solar
radiation
,
it
was
necessary
to
use
a
halogen
light
simulator
(
<figure>
Figure
3
</figure>
)
,
which
imitated
the
conditions
prevailing
in
the
natural
environment
at
an
acceptable
level
.
For
this
purpose
,
lamps
with
a
total
power
of
10
kW
were
used
.
A
supporting
structure
of
the
simulator
(
the
spherical
shape
with
a
large
radius
)
ensured
that
the
rays
focused
on
the
examined
PV
roof
tile
surface
.
In
addition
,
the
use
of
many
radiation
sources
(
in
this
case
,
20
lamps
)
was
more
advantageous
than
the
case
with
a
single
source
.
Additionally
,
by
adjusting
the
lamps
supply
voltage
,
it
was
possible
to
control
the
light
beam
of
the
radiation
source
precisely
:
this
allowed
for
performing
tests
in
a
wide
range
of
solar
irradiance
.
The
PV
roof
tile
was
1.5
m
away
from
the
presented
solar
light
simulator
,
which
was
in
a
configuration
reflecting
the
position
of
the
sun
at
the
zenith
:
the
light
rays
were
the
shortest
,
and
the
air
mass
coefficient
(
AM
)
was
<hi rend="italic">
AM
</hi>
=
1
.

The
Experimental
Setup
</head>
<p>
The
dedicated
experimental
setup
was
located
in
the
Department
of
Energy
and
Industrial
Apparatus
of
the
Gdansk
University
of
Technology
(
Gdańsk
,
Poland
)
.
It
consisted
of
the
above-described
PV
roof
tile
together
with
the
casing
,
which
formed
a
flow
channel
of
cooling
air
with
a
height
of
51
mm
.
This
set
was
placed
on
a
tripod
perpendicular
to
the
ground
.
