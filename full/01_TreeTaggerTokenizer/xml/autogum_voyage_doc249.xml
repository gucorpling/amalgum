This
region
is
primarily
agricultural
in
the
south
and
forested
in
the
north
.
The
world
famous
(
or
infamous
)
Athabasca
Oilsands
(
aka
the
&quot;
tar
sands
&quot;
)
are
located
here
.
The
terrain
is
very
flat
,
but
marked
by
many
shallow
depressions
,
many
of
which
are
filled
with
lakes
.
The
region
in
known
as
Alberta
's
&quot;
lakeland
&quot;
,
and
hunting
,
sport
fishing
,
and
power
boating
are
popular
here
.
</p>
<p>
The
region
was
first
populated
by
indigenous
peoples
.
The
Chipewyan
people
(
who
are
part
of
the
Dene
or
Athapascan
language
family
)
lived
here
at
the
beginnings
of
European
contact
(
early
1700s
)
,
but
were
soon
joined
by
the
Cree
people
(
from
the
Algonquian
language
family
)
from
the
east
.
Both
peoples
were
nomadic
and
hunted
bison
(
aka
&quot;
buffalo
&quot;
)
on
the
plains
and
moose
(
aka
&quot;
elk
&quot;
)
in
the
forests
and
also
harvested
with
many
smaller
game
animals
,
fish
,
berries
,
roots
,
and
so
on
.
Descendents
of
these
original
peoples
,
who
are
called
the
&quot;
First
Nations
&quot;
in
Canada
,
still
live
in
this
region
and
it
is
possible
to
attend
a
&quot;
pow-wow
&quot;
(
a
competition
or
festival
centred
around
traditional
music
and
dancing
)
here
.
</p>
<p>
They
were
joined
by
traders
from
the
fur
trading
companies
from
England
and
eastern
Canada
seeking
valuable
beaver
furs
to
send
to
Europe
for
the
hat-making
industries
.
The
traders
took
the
furs
from
the
native
people
in
exchange
for
exotic
and
manufactured
goods
such
as
flour
,
pots
,
knives
,
blankets
,
and
so
on
.
It
is
possible
to
visit
several
heritage
sites
related
to
the
fur
trade
here
.
</p>
<p>
Relations
between
the
fur
traders
and
the
indigenous
peoples
were
mostly
peaceful
and
intermarriage
was
extremely
common
,
leading
to
the
creation
of
a
new
ethnic
group
,
the
Métis
,
of
mixed
European
and
indigenous
culture
and
heritage
.
Many
of
Alberta
's
Métis
today
live
in
this
region
,
and
it
is
possible
to
hear
their
traditional
Scottish-
and
French-influenced
music
and
dance
here
.
</p>
<p>
In
1870
the
Hudson
's
Bay
Company
sold
its
claim
over
the
region
to
Canada
,
and
Canada
then
negotiated
treaties
with
the
First
Nations
,
confining
them
to
small
reserves
in
exchange
for
food
and
medicine
(
the
bison
were
nearly
extinct
by
this
time
due
to
overhunting
)
.
A
promised
railway
connection
to
the
rest
of
Canada
did
not
reach
anywhere
near
here
until
1891
,
when
settlers
from
the
rest
of
Canada
and
Europe
began
to
arrive
in
the
region
.
</p>
<p>
This
region
(
or
the
southern
,
agricultural
half
)
was
settled
mostly
by
people
of
non-British
origin
,
unlike
much
of
Canada
and
Alberta
.
The
area
for
a
time
was
home
to
the
largest
concentrations
of
Ukrainian
people
outside
of
Europe
.
They
were
joined
by
many
French-Canadians
,
Germans
,
Scandinavians
,
Poles
,
Romanians
,
Russians
,
and
so
on
.
They
were
mostly
forced
to
give
up
their
native
languages
and
educate
their
children
in
English
(
as
were
the
First
Nations
)
,
especially
during
the
paranoia
during
the
First
World
War
when
thousands
of
recent
immigrants
from
the
Austro-Hungarian
and
German
Empires
were
placed
in
internment
camps
.
Nevertheless
,
there
are
still
many
elements
of
Eastern
European
culture
present
here
,
and
it
is
possible
to
eat
their
traditional
foods
and
enjoy
a
folk
dance
performance
.
</p>
<p>
The
main
industry
here
for
the
early
settlers
was
the
bulk
export
of
cereal
grains
,
especially
wheat
,
by
means
of
rail
.
The
legacy
of
this
are
the
many
heritage
sites
related
to
both
agriculture
and
railways
that
can
be
seen
here
.
</p>
<p>
Since
the
1940s
,
oil
and
gas
exploration
has
been
the
region
's
major
growth
industry
.
Conventional
oil
and
gas
continues
,
by
the
majority
of
the
investment
has
shifted
north
to
the
oil
sands
,
which
are
generally
mined
rather
than
drilled
.
It
is
possible
to
visit
a
science
centre
that
explains
the
process
in
Fort
McMurray
,
the
centre
of
the
industry
.
While
many
locals
work
in
those
industries
,
the
repeated
sudden
oil
booms
have
created
labour
shortages
filled
by
transient
and
temporary
workers
from
Eastern
Canada
and
a
variety
of
other
countries
.
Whether
and
how
these
newcomers
will
change
the
communities
that
long-term
settlers
and
the
First
Nations
have
built
is
an
open
and
unresolved
question
.
</p>
<head>
Talk
</head>
<p>
Alberta
's
official
language
is
English
with
some
limited
rights
for
the
French-speaking
minority
.
Nearly
everyone
here
will
speak
English
fluently
.
However
,
Canadians
are
from
a
diverse
number
of
cultures
and
many
are
recent
immigrants
(
or
temporary
migrant
workers
)
and
you
should
expect
to
interact
with
people
whose
first
language
is
<hi rend="italic">
not
</hi>
English
on
a
regular
basis
in
restaurants
and
hotels
,
especially
in
Fort
McMurray
.
</p>
<p>
A
variety
of
other
languages
are
spoken
by
individual
people
.
However
,
you
should
not
count
on
your
hotel
or
other
businesses
to
be
able
to
serve
you
in
any
other
language
.
They
may
do
so
,
but
it
is
at
their
own
discretion
.
</p>
<p>
Offices
of
the
federal
government
of
Canada
(
post
offices
,
passport
offices
,
the
Royal
Canadian
Mounted
Police
,
and
the
national
parks
)
are
required
to
be
able
to
serve
you
both
English
and
French
,
but
this
does
not
mean
that
every
employee
is
fluent
in
French
,
especially
in
this
region
.
If
you
need
services
in
French
,
you
will
need
to
have
patience
with
non-fluent
speakers
or
wait
for
a
French-speaking
employee
to
become
available
.

The
nearest
major
airport
is
in
Edmonton
which
has
connections
to
the
rest
of
Canada
,
the
US
,
Europe
,
and
Asia
.
However
Fort
McMurray
Airport
also
has
connections
to
most
larger
Canadian
cities
and
a
few
places
in
the
United
States
.
Regional
airports
exist
in
Lloydminster
and
Cold
Lake
with
connections
to
Edmonton
.
</p>
<p>
Via
Rail
,
the
national
passenger
railway
,
runs
through
the
area
but
it
is
an
infrequent
,
slow
,
and
expensive
service
used
mostly
by
sightseers
,
passing
through
on
their
way
to
the
Rocky
Mountains
,
who
rarely
stop
here
.

<p>
Likewise
,
there
are
several
private
inter-city
bus
(
aka
&quot;
coach
&quot;
)
companies
,
but
service
is
limited
outside
of
the
larger
towns
.
</p>
<p>
The
majority
of
trips
through
this
region
are
by
private
automobile
,
and
many
places
are
only
accessible
by
road
.
