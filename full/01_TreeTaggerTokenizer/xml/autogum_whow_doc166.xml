Start
an
Alternative
School
</head>
<p>
Maybe
you
do
n't
like
the
education
your
children
are
getting
.
Maybe
other
parents
in
the
area
feel
the
same
.
Sometimes
this
involves
little
geniuses
that
do
n't
adapt
to
the
lower
level
kinds
of
education
.
Or
,
one
may
use
alternative
kinds
of
education
to
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Graduate_Early_from_High_School">
graduate
early
</ref>
from
high
school
using
homeschooling
,
and/or
take
classes
at
a
junior
college
while
finishing
high
school
--
as
ways
to
advance
.
This
may
be
about
children
working
at
or
above
grade
level
who
are
bored
--
or
,
conversely
,
those
below
grade
level
who
may
be
repeating
a
grade
,
for
one
reason
or
another
,
without
learning
anything
new
.
Another
possibility
is
that
the
public
school
lessons
do
not
go
well
with
your
religious
or
political
beliefs
.
If
your
school
does
n't
offer
a
special
gifted/talented
class
(
or
when
you
think
that
's
not
good
enough
)
you
can
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Homeschool_Your_Children">
homeschool
</ref>
your
child
and
others
'
children
,
by
setting
up
an
private
alternative
kind
of
school
.

<hi rend="bold">
Decide
on
a
location
</hi>
for
your
new
school
.
For
small
starters
,
your
living
room
should
do
it
,
but
depending
on
the
number
of
children
it
may
not
be
practical
for
you
or
for
them
.
Maybe
someone
's
garage
could
be
a
good
option
if
they
do
n't
own
a
car
or
maybe
a
rented
space
(
depending
on
how
many
children
you
intend
to
enroll
in
the
school
one
room
may
be
enough
)
.

Get
the
basic
supplies
.
These
would
be
for
the
average
classroom
a
table
for
each
student
with
a
chair
(
or
maybe
a
big
table
with
chairs
all
around
)
and
a
separate
desk
with
chair
for
the
teacher(s)
.
You
may
want
also
a
bookcase
to
keep
the
students
'
text
books
,
tests
and
record
their
progress
and
keep
their
files
and
worksheets
.
A
cork
bulletin
board
for
notes
(
such
as
announcements
,
for
field
trips
and
lunch
menu
,
etc.
)
and
a
white/chalk
board
will
also
come
in
handy
.

school
plan

as
you
want

to

consider

Think

what

teach

who
will
teach

children

not
yourself

This

be

hard

it

be

likely
the
main
reason

you
are
doing
this

Add
subjects
that
your

may
need
and
do

have
at
regular

anything
goes

including
both
religious

Abolish
any
subjects
you
do
n't
find
appropriate

Many
