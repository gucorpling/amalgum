Diving
in
Mozambique
</head>
<p>
This
article
is
intended
to
provide
the
already
qualified
Scuba
diver
with
information
which
will
help
to
plan
dives
in
the
waters
of
<ref target="Mozambique">
Mozambique
</ref>
,
whether
as
a
local
resident
or
a
visitor
.
Information
is
provided
without
prejudice
,
and
is
not
guaranteed
accurate
or
complete

<head>
General
topography
</head>
<p>
Mozambique
has
a
long
coastline
spread
out
over
the
tropical
east
coat
of
Africa
south
of
the
equator
,
with
several
islands
on
the
continental
shelf
.
Reef-building
corals
live
where
there
is
suitable
substrate
and
good
light
–
generally
where
there
is
no
major
river
mouth
nearby
.
The
current
generally
flows
north
to
south
,
and
can
be
strong
.
This
carries
turbid
water
away
,
and
makes
drift
diving
necessary
in
many
places
.
</p>
<head>
Climate
,
weather
and
sea
conditions
</head>
<p>
Mozambique
has
a
tropical
climate
with
two
seasons
,
a
wet
season
from
October
to
March
and
a
dry
season
from
April
to
September
.
Rainfall
is
heavy
along
the
coast
and
decreases
in
the
north
and
south
.
Cyclones
are
common
during
the
wet
season
.
</p>
<p>
The
sea
temperature
is
tropical
.
Water
temperatures
range
from
29˚C
in
summer
to
22˚C
in
winter
,
and
will
seldom
be
below
24˚C
.
Diving
is
year
round
.
People
from
cooler
climates
may
find
winter
more
comfortable
,
and
there
are
fewer
mosquitos
as
this
is
the
dry
season
.
</p>
<p>
Visibility
can
range
from
8
–
40
m
,
depending
on
the
amount
of
plankton
in
the
water
.
</p>
<head>
Marine
ecology
</head>
<p>
The
marine
ecology
of
Mozambique
is
classified
as
Tropical
Indo-Pacific
,
which
is
the
most
diverse
marine
ecology
known
.
Obviously
not
all
species
from
this
bioregion
will
be
found
in
all
parts
of
it
,
but
this
is
an
indication
of
the
diversity
which
can
be
expected
here
.
A
wide
range
of
reef
building
corals
,
and
also
other
coral
types
can
be
found
here
,
along
with
a
diverse
invertebrate
fauna
sharing
the
shelter
and
habitat
provided
by
the
corals
.
Fish
are
also
represented
by
a
large
diversity
of
species
,
many
of
which
are
particularly
colourful
.
</p>
<p>
Humpback
whales
can
be
spotted
during
their
migration
from
June
until
November
.
</p>
<p>
Whale
sharks
are
present
all
year
round
and
in
abundance
between
November
and
March
.
These
gentle
</p>
<p>
giants
can
reach
up
to
12m
in
length
and
weigh
up
to
20tonnes
.
</p>
<head>
Get
around
</head>
<p>
Pick
up
's
can
be
arranged
through
lodges
,
dive
centres
etc.
But
there
is
ample
public
transport
and
it
is
safe
and
easy
to
walk
to
most
places
in
the
area
.
