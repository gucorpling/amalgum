Understanding
that
third
party
candidates
do
not
often
win
,
what
do
you
hope
to
achieve
by
running
for
governor
of
California
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Cindy
Sheehan
</hi>
:
First
of
all
,
unfortunately
third
party
candidates
NEVER
win
for
high
level
state
or
federal
offices
,
and
now
since
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California%20Proposition%2014%20(2010)">
Prop
14
</ref>
passed
,
it
is
even
harder
.
Having
said
that
,
in
2008
,
I
ran
as
an
independent
against
Nancy
Pelosi
and
I
came
in
second
.
In
California
,
I
think
I
may
have
a
good
chance
to
advance
to
the
general
election
and
hopefully
force
the
other
candidate
,
(
Brown
,
?
)
to
debate
me
and
bring
up
the
issues
and
solutions
to
more
people
.

How
do
you
plan
to
spread
your
message
throughout
the
state
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Sheehan
</hi>
:
We
already
have
many
Californians
who
have
volunteered
to
host
the
campaign
with
fundraisers
and
town
hall
meetings
.
I
am
going
to
ride
my
bike
as
much
as
possible
to
highlight
the
need
to
drastically
cut
our
dependence
on
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fossil%20fuels">
fossil
fuels
</ref>
and
to
transition
to
clean
,
renewable
,
and
sustainable
forms
of
energy
—
also
to
highlight
the
need
for
cheap
and
comprehensive
public
transportation
and
infrastructure
improvement
.

How
would
you
rate
Jerry
Brown
's
performance
as
governor
?
What
would
you
do
differently
than
him
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Sheehan
</hi>
:
Well
,
since
I
am
challenging
him
,
I
would
rate
his
performance
as
poor
.
He
is
in
the
pockets
of
so
many
special
interests
,
like
oil
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/private%20prison">
privatized
prisons
</ref>
,
that
he
is
not
looking
out
for
the
interests
of
everyone
in
this
state
.
I
would
hold
dozens
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/town%20hall%20meeting">
town
hall
meetings
</ref>
to
talk
to
the
people
of
this
state
about
their
struggles
and
community-based
solutions
and
work
with
the
people
to
put
their
needs
first
and
foremost
.
Instead
of
destroying
education
,
I
would
put
a
revival
of
our
public
school
system
as
one
of
the
most
urgent
things
we
need
to
do
.

If
elected
,
how
would
you
work
with
a
legislature
hostile
to
your
agenda
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Sheehan
</hi>
:
By
getting
the
people
involved
in
the
process
.
It
’s
the
only
way
we
can
do
it
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">

Which
past
California
governor
do
you
most
admire
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Sheehan
</hi>
:
I
majored
in
US
History
at
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/UCLA">
UCLA
</ref>
and
was
focusing
on
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History%20of%20California">
California
history
</ref>
,
so
I
admire
someone
who
ran
for
governor
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upton%20Sinclair">
Upton
Sinclair
</ref>
,
more
than
anyone
who
actually
was
elected
.
Our
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End%20Poverty%20in%20California%20movement">
EPIC
</ref>
campaign
is
modeled
off
of
his
.
But
if
I
had
to
pick
one
that
was
actually
governor
,
I
would
say
,
populist-progressive
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiram%20Johnson">
Hiram
Johnson
</ref>
.
May
I
also
say
that
it
’s
way
past
time
that
California
elected
a
female
?
