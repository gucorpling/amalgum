Recognizing
patients
with
monogenic
AIDs
is
difficult
because
their
clinical
spectrum
may
range
from
very
mild
inflammatory
episodes
to
severe
chronic
disease
.
Moreover
,
the
disease
features
significantly
overlap
.
Our
targeted
NGS
approach
resulted
in
genetic
confirmation
in
a
relatively
small
proportion
(
7
%
)
of
patients
.
This
finding
is
consistent
with
two
2019
reports
by
Karacan
et
al.
and
Papa
et
al.
,
who
used
recent
guidelines
for
the
definition
of
positive
diagnosis
as
we
did
.
Three
previous
studies
using
a
broader
definition
claimed
19
%
,
20
%
,
and
22
%
diagnostic
yield
.
In
those
reports
,
for
example
,
frequent
variants
,
such
as
p.
(
Glu148Gln
)
(
<hi rend="italic">
MEFV
</hi>
)
,
p.
(
Arg121Gln
)
(
<hi rend="italic">
TNFRSF1A
</hi>
)
,
or
p.
(
Val198Met
)
(
<hi rend="italic">
NLRP3
</hi>
)
,
and
all
known
susceptibility
factors
for
inflammation
were
considered
consistent
with
the
diagnosis
.
Moreover
,
our
definition
was
more
stringent
than
these
four
previous
studies
because
we
considered
that
we
could
not
conclude
on
the
diagnosis
when
the
parent
’s
DNA
was
lacking
segregation
analyses
of
heterozygous
rare
VOUS
.
</p>
<p>
The
low
performance
of
the
AIDs
panel
might
also
be
explained
by
our
study
design
that
did
not
include
most
of
the
patients
with
features
of
FMF
,
MKD
,
and
DADA2
because
they
were
screened
by
Sanger
sequencing
.
Still
,
the
genes
<hi rend="italic">
MEFV
</hi>
,
<hi rend="italic">
MVK
,
</hi>
and
<hi rend="italic">
ADA2
</hi>
remained
among
the
four
most
frequently
involved
in
the
conclusive
diagnoses
of
our
study
.
This
observation
possibly
stems
from
a
better
detection
by
NGS
of
the
new
molecular
mechanisms
involved
in
AIDs
(
mosaicism
,
CNVs
)
and
better
information
on
these
three
diseases
because
they
are
among
the
best-described
AIDs
.
In
addition
,
FMF
is
now
recognized
as
a
disease
caused
by
gain-of-function
variants
with
a
dosage
effect
rather
than
a
purely
recessive
condition
.
For
one-third
of
the
patients
with
one
heterozygous
pathogenic
variant
in
a
recessive
condition
,
the
gene
was
<hi rend="italic">
MEFV
</hi>
.
If
we
had
included
heterozygous
carriers
of
a
<hi rend="italic">
MEFV
</hi>
pathogenic
variant
,
the
genetic
diagnosis
yield
would
have
improved
up
to
10
%
(

)
.
</p>
<p>
In
an
attempt
to
find
a
cause
that
could
explain
the
low
rate
of
genetic
confirmation
using
panels
in
the
patients
referred
to
us
,
we
wondered
whether
validation
of
the
request
by
a
specialized
reference
center
could
improve
this
performance
.
The
success
of
the
NGS
approach
was
suggested
to
rely
on
its
use
in
the
context
of
a
highly
specialized
clinical
service
for
patients
with
AIDs
.
National
reference
centers
and
networks
cover
all
the
expertise
necessary
for
patient
care
and
operational
management
and
efficiency
.
We
established
a
pre-requisite
for
a
systematic
evaluation
of
undifferentiated
AIDs
patients
by
clinicians
from
reference
centers
.
It
is
possible
that
many
doctors
from
non-reference
centers
could
not
find
the
time
to
present
their
patients
to
MSM
.
This
certainly
accounts
for
the
decrease
in
the
proportion
of
patients
referred
by
the
non-reference
centers
.
However
,
our
study
showed
that
this
strategy
resulted
in
a
better
clinical
filter
for
ordering
genetic
tests
and
almost
doubled
the
performance
of
our
NGS
strategy
.
Also
,
our
reference
center
recently
offered
a
diagnostic
checklist
to
guide
practitioners
who
may
suspect
an
AID
for
ordering
genetic
tests
.
In
our
patients
with
a
conclusive
diagnosis
of
AID
,
the
main
features
identified
were
mucocutaneous
,
articular
,
and
gastro-intestinal
.
This
result
reflects
daily
practice
because
the
cutaneous/mucosal
,
digestive
tract
,
and
musculoskeletal
systems
are
the
three
most
common
systems
involved
in
AIDs
.
</p>
<p>
We
cannot
rule
out
a
relative
underestimation
of
the
potential
of
NGS
panels
for
AIDs
in
general
.
Indeed
,
because
of
our
study
design
,
some
of
the
patients
or
their
relatives
were
not
available
for
NGS
or
segregation
analysis
.
However
,
our
aim
was
not
to
evaluate
the
exact
performance
of
NGS
but
to
find
ways
to
improve
it
.
In
addition
to
the
successful
clinical
option
we
demonstrated
here
,
it
is
easy
to
predict
the
upcoming
discovery
of
new
genes
or
molecular
mechanisms
involved
in
AIDs
that
will
continue
to
revolutionize
our
routine
genetic
diagnosis
.
Recent
inputs
of
the
literature
advocate
closer
interactions
between
clinicians
and
geneticists
in
the
era
of
whole-genome
sequencing
.
Among
them
are
the
identification
of
genetic
modifiers
,
affecting
the
penetrance
of
homozygous
pathogenic
<hi rend="italic">
MVK
</hi>
:
p.
(
Val377Ile
)
variant
;
the
lack
of
detection
of
pathogenic
variants
in
patients
with
a
clear
given
phenotype
,
such
as
pathogenic
canonical
splice
site
variants
not
covered
by
Sanger
and
panel
approaches
(
e.
g.
,
<hi rend="italic">
ADA2
</hi>
:
c.
-47+2T&gt;C
)
;
or
large
chromosomal
rearrangements
,
encompassing
several
genes
in
patients
with
complex
phenotypes
.
In
those
circumstances
,
an
MSM
could
help
find
the
best
appropriate
strategy
in
accordance
with
the
patient
’s
phenotype
.
</p>
<p>
The
role
of
the
reference
centers
is
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
clinical/anamnesis/genealogical
tree
is
compatible
with
a
known
AID
.
If
compatibility
does
not
seem
to
be
the
case
,
the
role
is
to
evaluate
the
potential
added
value
to
perform
the
NGS
.
If
this
value
appears
to
be
low
,
the
reference
center
recommends
that
no
NGS
be
conducted
in
discussion
with
geneticists
.
Thus
,
this
discussion
decreases
the
number
of
individuals
whose
phenotype
is
not
typically
enough
.
