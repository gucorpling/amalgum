Introduction
</head>
<p>
Cities
are
by
far
the
fastest
growing
territorial
units
of
our
times
.
In
2018
,
around
55
%
of
the
world
’s
population
lived
in
urban
areas
.
This
share
is
expected
to
grow
up
significantly
.
It
is
estimated
that
by
2050
,
68
%
of
the
world
population
is
likely
to
be
living
in
cities
or
other
urban
centres
,
which
requires
significant
investment
in
the
construction
of
new
buildings
and
infrastructures
and
the
refurbishment
of
old
ones
.
The
construction
sector
is
unique
in
the
sense
of
the
one-of-a-kind
nature
of
its
projects
,
site
production
,
and
temporary
multi-organization
.
When
compared
to
the
other
economic
sectors
,
the
construction
sector
suffers
from
a
poor
productivity
performance
and
is
waiting
for
a
radical
change
to
reinvent
itself
completely
like
retail
or
manufacturing
did
some
decades
ago
.
While
a
lot
of
attention
has
been
paid
in
the
last
years
to
urban
freight
transport
(
UFT
)
activities
generated
by
specific
market
segments
such
as
food
,
retail
,
or
home
deliveries
,
relatively
little
attention
has
been
paid
to
the
construction
logistics
.
Yet
,
it
represents
a
major
market
segment
,
generating
up
to
30
%
of
the
tonnage
carried
within
cities
.
Distribution
related
to
the
construction
activity
often
results
in
significant
disturbances
to
the
daily
life
of
citizens
,
such
as
congestion
,
safety
hazards
,
noise
,
and
air
pollution
.
It
can
also
lead
to
economic
losses
for
construction
companies
if
not
properly
managed
.
Indeed
,
delays
to
deliveries
could
disrupt
work
plans
and
delay
the
completion
of
construction
projects
.
Logistics
plays
a
major
role
in
construction
,
yet
it
is
still
too
often
considered
as
a
secondary
issue
by
many
operators
.
This
paper
,
based
on
the
work
carried
out
within
the
SUCCESS
project
,
concluded
in
April
2018
,
aims
to
provide
a
better
understanding
of
the
UFT
activity
related
to
the
construction
industry
and
to
explore
some
approaches
that
could
improve
the
current
situation
.
Financed
by
the
European
Union
’s
Horizon
2020
programme
,
the
project
brought
together
eleven
partners
from
the
public
and
private
sectors
with
the
aim
to
reduce
the
negative
impacts
and
costs
of
UFT
generated
by
the
construction
sector
through
improved
supply
chain
management
and
construction
consolidation
centres
.
It
aimed
to
make
the
most
of
this
sector
’s
enormous
potential
for
improvement
by
exploring
and
testing
new
tools
and
methods
,
including
the
potential
creation
of
CCCs
,
in
order
to
provide
replicable
solutions
and
improve
the
use
of
the
existing
transport
infrastructure
and
the
level
of
cooperation
among
the
different
stakeholders
of
the
construction
supply
chain
.
