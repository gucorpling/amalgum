Be
sure

have
time
to
take
care
of
the
dog
.
You
have
to
be
home
at
all
times
or
most
of
the
times
,
but
being
home
all
day
might
give
you
more
time
to
take
care
of
the
dog
.
Your
dog
may
be
uncomfortable
around
you
if
you
do
n’t
have
the
time
.

You
need
to
have
a
dog
that
is
less
playful
while
indoors
.
Aim
for
a
breed
that
is
smart
.
That
will
help
to
take
care
of
the
dog
.

Buy
weeks
worth
of
dog
food
,
so
you
do
n't
have
to
go
and
get
food
everyday
.
But
you
need
to
read
the
lables
to
make
sure
the
food
doesnt
get
old
,
or
you
can
give
your
dog
the
amount
of
food
that
will
be
enough
and
will
not
be
wasted
.

train
your
dog

You
will
need
a
leash
and
a
pad
.
When
your
dog
will
need
to
go
to
the
bathroom
,
which
you
can
tell
if
your
dog
is
whining
or
having
an
excretion
,
you
take
your
dog
to
the
pad
.
Repeat
the
same
thing
for
a
week
.
If
your
dog
still
does
n’t
get
it
,
then
continue
doing
the
same
thing

For
potty
training
outdoors
,
you
need
to
see
which
area
outside
is
avalible
for
your
dog
to
potty
.
You
need
to
pick
it
up
with
a
plastic
bag
.
Turn
the
bag
around
and
throw
it
out
.
You
need
to
do
this

area
to
potty
in

Walk
your
dog
</ref>
in
the
morning
.
Wake
up
the
dog
before
getting
your
dog
because
you
need
to
wake
up
early
to
walk
your
dog

If
your
dog
is
n’t
awake
yet
,
you
still
need
to
get
up
and
wait
for
your
dog
to
get
up

It
’s
ok
if
your
dog
does
n’t
wake
up

you
know
when
to
wake
up

in
a
tub
with
dog
shampoo
