Introduction
</head>
<p>
Sustainable
development
is
nowadays
one
of
the
main
components
used
in
spatial
development
.
It
is
considered
a
Constitutional
Principle
of
the
Republic
of
Poland
,
as
well
as
in
another
European
countries
.
The
definition
of
sustainable
development
can
be
found
in
Polish
legislation
—
it
is
defined
in
the
Environmental
Protection
Act
as
the
socio-economic
development
integrating
political
,
economic
,
and
social
actions
,
balanced
with
environmental
protection
and
a
permanence
of
basic
natural
processes
,
in
order
to
ensure
the
possibility
of
satisfying
the
basic
needs
of
communities
or
individual
citizens
in
both
the
present
and
future
generations
.
In
The
Brundtland
Report
“
Our
Common
Future
”
sustainable
development
is
defined
as
“
development
that
meets
the
needs
of
the
present
without
compromising
the
ability
of
future
generations
to
meet
their
own
needs
”
.
The
report
highlighted
three
fundamental
components
of
sustainable
development
:
environmental
protection
,
economic
growth
,
and
social
equity
.
According
to
Pearce
and
Turner
,
sustainable
development
is
associated
with
maximizing
the
benefits
of
economic
development
,
in
connection
with
protecting
the
quality
and
usability
of
natural
resources
.
Such
economic
development
must
not
only
mean
an
increase
in
income
per
capita
,
but
also
the
comprehensive
improvement
of
other
social
aspects
.
Culture
,
as
the
basis
of
social
life
,
is
considered
to
be
one
of
the
four
pillars
of
sustainable
development
.
Culture
can
be
both
the
goal
of
development
of
a
given
society
as
well
as
the
method
of
that
development
,
but
above
all
it
is
the
development
regulator
.
Cultural
heritage
is
one
of
the
main
elements
of
such
described
culture
and
it
is
understood
much
more
broadly
than
just
in
the
field
of
the
protection
of
monuments
,
it
also
consists
of
:
local
traditions
and
customs
,
cultural
affiliation
or
the
sources
of
non-material
values
.
A
greater
sense
of
cultural
identity
can
also
contribute
to
the
further
development
of
social
capital
,
because
individuals
and
communities
with
a
stronger
sense
of
place
are
more
actively
involved
in
social
matters
.
People
living
in
places
with
a
higher
concentration
of
significant
historical
areas
tend
to
have
a
stronger
sense
of
place
and/or
increased
social
capital
.
Cultural
heritage
is
traditionally
regarded
as
a
non-economic
factor
of
spatial
development
.
However
,
treated
as
a
resource
and
properly
managed
,
it
can
be
transformed
into
capital
that
can
play
an
important
role
in
the
sustainable
development
strategies
,
both
at
the
local
and
national
level
.
The
term
“
cultural
heritage
”
covers
a
broad
spectrum
of
meanings
that
are
not
obvious
and
can
be
ambiguous
.
Cultural
heritage
is
important
as
a
source
of
remembrance
and
inspiration
,
and
at
the
same
time
contributes
to
national
and
local
identity
,
which
is
essential
for
sense
of
place
and
social
cohesion
.
Various
studies
have
shown
the
influence
of
cultural
heritage
as
an
element
of
sustainable
development
on
spatial
planning
,
or
tourism
development
.
</p>
<p>
To
properly
manage
cultural
heritage
within
sustainable
development
,
regardless
of
the
specific
goal
,
knowledge
of
the
location
of
objects
constituting
a
material
element
of
cultural
heritage
is
necessary
.
In
this
article
,
the
starting
point
for
the
conducted
research
and
analyses
were
non-movable
monuments
in
Poland
.
The
legal
basis
for
the
protection
of
monuments
in
Poland
is
the
Act
of
23
July
2003
on
the
protection
of
monument
and
the
care
of
monuments
.
According
to
Article
3
of
the
above-mentioned
Act
,
a
non-movable
monument
is
a
real
estate
,
its
part
or
a
complex
of
real
estate
,
which
is
the
work
of
humankind
or
is
related
to
its
activity
,
and
is
a
testimony
to
a
past
era
or
event
;
whose
protection
is
in
the
public
interest
because
of
its
historical
,
artistic
or
scientific
value
.
Article
6
of
the
Act
indicates
that
non-movable
monuments
may
include
:
cultural
landscapes
,
urban
and
rural
systems
,
building
units
,
works
of
architecture
and
construction
,
works
of
defense
construction
;
technical
objects
;
cemeteries
;
parks
,
gardens
,
and
other
forms
of
designed
greenery
;
as
well
as
places
commemorating
historical
events
or
the
activities
of
remarkable
characters
or
institutions
.
Non-movable
monuments
are
registered
by
entry
in
“
the
register
of
objects
of
cultural
heritage
”
(
pol
.
rejestr
zabytków
)
,
kept
by
the
Voivodeship
Conservators
of
Monuments
.
Voivodeship
registers
of
objects
of
cultural
heritage
currently
contain
approx.
85
thousand
entries
on
non-movable
monuments
,
diversified
in
terms
of
type
.
A
non-movable
monument
can
be
entered
into
the
register
on
the
basis
of
:
an
ex-officio
decision
issued
by
the
Voivodeship
Conservator
of
Monuments
,
or
at
the
request
of
the
owner
of
the
non-movable
monument
or
perpetual
usufructuary
of
the
land
on
which
the
non-movable
monument
is
located
.
In
the
conducted
research
,
the
authors
used
data
obtained
from
The
National
Heritage
Board
of
Poland
.
The
National
Heritage
Board
of
Poland
(
NHBP
)
is
a
cultural
institution
established
by
the
Minister
of
Culture
and
National
Heritage
;
its
present
structure
was
formed
in
2007
.
NHBP
is
a
state
agency
that
gathers
and
disseminates
information
on
heritage
,
sets
standards
for
its
protection
and
conservation
,
and
aims
to
raise
the
social
awareness
on
cultural
heritage
of
Poland
in
order
to
save
it
for
future
generations
in
accordance
with
the
strategy
for
sustainable
development
.
The
generic
division
of
non-movable
monuments
used
by
NHBP
is
