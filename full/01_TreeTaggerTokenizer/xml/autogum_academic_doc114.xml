Concepts
and
Indicators
of
Residential
Environment
Quality
</head>
<p>
The
value
of
the
residential
environment
refers
to
the
value
of
the
living
environment
,
including
the
economic
,
social
,
and
psychological
environment
,
which
extends
from
the
daily
life
of
the
family
unit
to
that
of
the
entire
human
settlement
.
The
residential
environment
refers
to
the
built
surroundings
of
dwelling
units
that
provide
the
setting
for
human
activities
,
and
it
encompasses
a
range
of
built
environments
,
from
immediate
neighbors
to
large-scale
civic
environments
.
</p>
<p>
To
develop
a
REMI
based
on
the
global
criterion
to
evaluate
the
value
of
the
residential
environment
,
we
reviewed
relevant
international
standards
based
on
the
concept
of
sustainable
development
in
terms
of
environmental
,
social
,
and
economic
aspects
.
The
World
Health
Organization
(
WHO
)
,
Organization
for
Economic
Co-operation
and
Development
(
OECD
)
,
United
Nations
Human
Settlements
Programme
(
UN-Habitat
)
,
and
Ministry
of
Land
,
Infrastructure
,
Transport
and
Tourism
(
MLIT
)
of
Japan
,
among
other
international
organizations
,
have
implemented
many
measures
to
improve
urban
living
conditions
.
</p>
<p>
The
WHO
drafted
guidelines
for
the
basic
living
requirements
of
human
beings
by
identifying
four
dimensions
of
the
residential
environment
:
Safety
,
health
,
convenience
,
and
amenity
.
Further
,
the
WHO
suggested
that
these
dimensions
are
important
to
the
promotion
of
public
hygiene
and
health
.
The
OECD
broadened
the
concept
of
quality
of
life
by
considering
the
residential
environment
’s
social
impact
.
Apart
from
emphasizing
quantifiable
physical
dimensions
,
the
OECD
stressed
the
importance
of
subjective
elements
such
as
“
social
network
support
”
and
“
life-satisfaction
”
in
assessing
the
quality
of
life
and
,
therefore
,
included
indicators
such
as
happiness
,
health
,
social
connections
,
civic
engagement
and
governance
,
and
subjective
well-being
.
Further
,
UN-Habitat
presented
urban
indicators
to
monitor
urban
issues
and
the
progress
of
individual
cities
in
improving
the
living
conditions
of
low-income
populations
.
The
indicators
measure
poverty
eradication
,
economic
development
,
diversity
,
and
urban
governance
in
cities
as
sources
of
the
development
problems
faced
by
these
cities
in
terms
of
economic
and
social
conditions
.
Similarly
,
the
United
Kingdom
’s
Index
of
Multiple
Deprivation
is
a
governmental
assessment
tool
that
monitors
the
housing
environment
using
indicators
related
to
deprivation
levels
in
terms
of
income
,
employment
,
education
,
skills
,
health
,
and
living
environment
,
as
well
as
barriers
to
the
accessibility
to
housing
and
services
.
</p>
<p>
Whereas
the
aforementioned
international
indicators
emphasize
basic
quality
of
life
and
the
eradication
of
poverty
at
the
national
or
city
level
,
some
international
organizations
indicate
that
macro-economic
indices
do
not
adequately
reflect
individuals
’
quality
of
life
;
further
,
they
emphasize
neighborhood-level
sustainability
as
an
evaluation
factor
for
the
judgment
criteria
of
the
residential
environment
.
For
instance
,
the
United
States
’
Vital
Signs
introduced
an
index
focusing
on
not
only
housing
development
but
also
community
activities
.
Similarly
,
the
Japanese
MLIT
added
the
indicators
of
safety
,
convenience
,
comfort
,
and
sustainability
to
the
neighborhood
environmental
index
,
which
typically
assesses
microeconomic
impacts
,
with
particular
emphasis
on
increasing
the
community
’s
sustainability
and
reducing
the
load
on
the
environment
.
The
MLIT
’s
early
“
housing
construction
five-year
program
”
,
which
was
based
on
the
mass
housing
supply
plan
,
focused
on
improving
the
residential
infrastructure
and
physical
maintenance
by
considering
the
indicators
of
housing
quality
,
including
the
number
of
houses
available
for
rent
,
number
of
housing
units
,
and
spatial
size
of
a
house
.
Over
the
years
,
the
MLIT
has
evolved
to
include
qualitative
indices
of
residential
stability
,
such
as
a
living
environment
level
that
reflects
the
different
needs
and
lifestyles
of
residents
.
</p>
<p>
Overall
,
these
indicators
,
which
were
developed
by
international
organizations
,
are
globally
applicable
,
and
they
focus
on
residential
welfare
to
maintain
public
health
and
on
physical
and
non-physical
neighborhood
and
housing
conditions
.
The
indicators
are
strongly
related
to
the
four
concepts
of
the
residential
environment
:
(
1
)
The
safety
of
the
residential
environment
,
(
2
)
convenience
of
the
residential
service
,
(
3
)
comfort
of
living
,
and
(
4
)
sense
of
community
(
Table
2
)
.
Most
discussions
of
the
residential
environment
highlight
safety
(
such
as
safety
from
natural
disasters
and
criminal
activities
)
not
only
as
one
of
the
most
important
aspects
of
residential
satisfaction
,
but
also
as
a
particularly
crucial
aspect
of
policies
for
the
management
of
healthy
built
environments
.
Further
,
greater
convenience
implies
improvements
in
the
accessibility
of
basic
facilities
necessary
for
living
or
the
satisfaction
of
people
’s
minimum
economic
needs
,
whereas
comfort
refers
to
the
provision
of
aesthetic
and
leisure
quality
beyond
minimum
living
conditions
.
The
sense
of
community
is
a
social
value
that
brings
together
the
members
of
a
social
system
.
The
higher
the
sense
of
community
,
the
stronger
the
tendency
of
people
to
settle
in
one
place
.
