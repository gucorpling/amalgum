Why
are
you
running
for
political
office
,
why
at
the
federal
level
,
why
this
party
,
and
why
in
this
riding
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
I
am
running
for
political
office
because
I
feel
that
it
is
time
to
change
the
way
we
do
politics
at
the
federal
level
.
We
need
a
bold
,
courageous
vision
for
the
future
of
our
country
,
one
that
rises
above
party
politics
and
speaks
to
all
Canadians
.
</p>
<p>
I
am
running
in
Haldimand-Norfolk
because
my
family
's
roots
in
this
riding
go
back
five
generations
and
nearly
150
years
.
I
grew
up
here
,
and
continue
to
call
Simcoe
my
home
.
I
have
spent
the
last
twenty
years
giving
a
voice
to
people
,
families
and
communities
facing
challenges
,
helping
them
take
hold
of
opportunities
and
grow
strong
.
</p>
<p>
Now
I
want
to
stand
up
for
Haldimand-Norfolk
in
Ottawa
and
represent
its
priorities
.
We
need
leadership
in
Haldimand-Norfolk
that
works
for
all
citizens
,
finding
common
ground
and
seizing
every
opportunity
for
advancement
of
our
families
,
communities
and
our
economy
.

Previous
to
this
campaign
,
have
you
been
politically
involved
?
How
will
you
apply
your
previous
work/volunteer/life
experience
to
serving
your
constituents
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
Political
involvement
has
been
an
important
part
of
my
professional
career
.
After
completing
my
studies
at
McMaster
and
Oxford
universities
I
found
myself
drawn
to
humanitarian
work
as
a
doctor
in
some
of
the
world
's
most
troubled
war
zones
.
Upon
returning
to
Canada
I
spent
three
years
in
federal
government
as
the
Senior
Advisor
to
Foreign
Minister
Lloyd
Axworthy
.
I
now
practice
medicine
and
serve
as
President
of
War
Child
,
a
leading
Canadian
charity
helping
children
in
war
zones
.
I
have
spent
the
last
twenty
years
advocating
for
people
,
families
and
communities
.
This
experience
has
prepared
me
to
give
a
voice
to
the
people
of
Haldimand-Norfolk
in
Ottawa
.

As
you
campaign
around
your
riding
,
it
's
likely
that
some
issues
are
mentioned
more
often
by
voters
,
than
other
issues
.
What
would
you
say
are
the
three
hottest
topics
this
election
,
in
your
riding
?
What
would
you
and
your
party
do
to
address
these
issues
?
