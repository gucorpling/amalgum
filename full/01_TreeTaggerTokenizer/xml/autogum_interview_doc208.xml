DS

Can
a
person
who
has
no
experience
really
just
jump
into
it
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">
<hi rend="bold">
Veronica
:
</hi>
</hi>
No.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
So
I
guess
someone
with
some
experience
,
because
a
person
with
no
experience
would
probably
fail
utterly
,
right
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">
<hi rend="bold">
Veronica
:
</hi>
</hi>
Well
,
no
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Jada
:
</hi>
It
depends
,
here
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">
<hi rend="bold">
Veronica
:
</hi>
</hi>
A
lot
of
the
time
men
like
new
fresh
faces
,
so
she
’ll
get
picked
for
a
session
regardless
of
her
experience
level
.
It
’s
not
all
about
your
expertise
.
A
lot
of
time
they
just
want
someone
who
looks
a
certain
way
.
It
’s
very
visual
for
certain
people
.
So
,
if
you
are
a
black
woman
with
a
big
ass
and
that
’s
what
they
came
here
for
in
looking
for
someone
to
dominate
them
.

DS
:
That
was
one
of
the
things
Jada
and
I
were
talking
about
earlier
:
if
someone
comes
in
and
says
,
“
Treat
me
like
I
’m
a
dirty
Jew
”
or
“
Treat
me
like
I
’m
a
bad
slave
”
is
it
difficult
for
you
to
bring
yourself
to
that
level
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">
<hi rend="bold">
Veronica
:
</hi>
</hi>
Yeah
,
I
had
a
guy
who
wanted
me
to
treat
him
like
a
slave
and
call
him
a
nigger
,
and
stuff
like
that
.
It
was
difficult
for
me
but
I
got
over
it
.
I
had
to
step
back
and
look
at
it
as
someone
’s
fetish
and
whenever
someone
tries
to
get
me
to
do
something
that
is
a
little
psychological
and
walks
the
line
between
being
abused
or
not
,
I
do
n’t
try
to
judge
their
method
for
dealing
with
it
.
I
mean
,
that
’s
the
way
he
is
trying
to
deal
with
this
,
and
there
’s
no
research
saying
it
is
bad
for
him
to
explore
that
,
or
that
it
’s
good
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
You
intellectualize
it
.
So
you
were
able
to
treat
him
like
a
slave
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">
<hi rend="bold">
Veronica
:
</hi>
</hi>
Oh
yes
,
I
made
him
pick
cotton
off
the
floor…stuff
like
that
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Jada
:
</hi>
I
remember
you
telling
me
about
that
!
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">
<hi rend="bold">
Veronica
:
</hi>
</hi>
Yeah

</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
You
made
him
pick
cotton
off
the
floor
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">
<hi rend="bold">
Veronica
:
</hi>
</hi>
Yeah
,
he
was
fun
and
he
was
so
appreciative
,
and
it
really
got
me
past
my
hang-up
.
That
was
one
psychological
hurdle
I
overcame
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Jada
:
</hi>
A
lot
of
times
they
know
you
may
feel
uncomfortable
with
it
and
they
’ll
understand
.
Some
of
them
will
know
you
wo
n’t
like
it
but
that
you
’ll
try
to
do
it
anyway
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
What
if
someone
wanted
to
treat
you
that
way
?
If
you
were
Jewish
…
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">
<hi rend="bold">
Veronica
:
</hi>
</hi>
I
can
separate
myself
from
that
enough
and
see
it
as
a
game
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Jada
:
</hi>
Yeah
,
I
’d
say
the
same
thing
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Jada
:
</hi>
It
’s
not
reality
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
What
is
your
ethnicity

Jada
?
