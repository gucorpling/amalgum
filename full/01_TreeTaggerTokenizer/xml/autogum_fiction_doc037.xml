A
Merry
Evening
with
a
Distant
Relative
</head>
<p>
I
was
not
so
unreasonable
as
to
be
prejudiced
against
the
duke
’s
keeper
because
he
disliked
my
complexion
;
and
if
I
had
been
,
his
most
civil
and
obliging
conduct
(
as
it
seemed
to
me
to
be
)
next
morning
would
have
disarmed
me
.
Hearing
that
I
was
bound
for
Strelsau
,
he
came
to
see
me
while
I
was
breakfasting
,
and
told
me
that
a
sister
of
his
who
had
married
a
well-to-do
tradesman
and
lived
in
the
capital
,
had
invited
him
to
occupy
a
room
in
her
house
.
He
had
gladly
accepted
,
but
now
found
that
his
duties
would
not
permit
of
his
absence
.
He
begged
therefore
that
,
if
such
humble
(
though
,
as
he
added
,
clean
and
comfortable
)
lodgings
would
satisfy
me
,
I
would
take
his
place
.
He
pledged
his
sister
’s
acquiescence
,
and
urged
the
inconvenience
and
crowding
to
which
I
should
be
subject
in
my
journeys
to
and
from
Strelsau
the
next
day
.
I
accepted
his
offer
without
a
moment
’s
hesitation
,
and
he
went
off
to
telegraph
to
his
sister
,
while
I
packed
up
and
prepared
to
take
the
next
train
.
But
I
still
hankered
after
the
forest
and
the
hunting-lodge
,
and
when
my
little
maid
told
me
that
I
could
,
by
walking
ten
miles
or
so
through
the
forest
,
hit
the
railway
at
a
roadside
station
,
I
decided
to
send
my
luggage
direct
to
the
address
which
Johann
had
given
,
take
my
walk
,
and
follow
to
Strelsau
myself
.
Johann
had
gone
off
and
was
not
aware
of
the
change
in
my
plans
;
but
,
as
its
only
effect
was
to
delay
my
arrival
at
his
sister
’s
for
a
few
hours
,
there
was
no
reason
for
troubling
to
inform
him
of
it
.
Doubtless
the
good
lady
would
waste
no
anxiety
on
my
account
.
</p>
<p>
I
took
an
early
luncheon
,
and
,
having
bidden
my
kind
entertainers
farewell
,
promising
to
return
to
them
on
my
way
home
,
I
set
out
to
climb
the
hill
that
led
to
the
Castle
,
and
thence
to
the
forest
of
Zenda
.
Half
an
hour
’s
leisurely
walking
brought
me
to
the
Castle
.
It
had
been
a
fortress
in
old
days
,
and
the
ancient
keep
was
still
in
good
preservation
and
very
imposing
.
Behind
it
stood
another
portion
of
the
original
castle
,
and
behind
that
again
,
and
separated
from
it
by
a
deep
and
broad
moat
,
which
ran
all
round
the
old
buildings
,
was
a
handsome
modern
chateau
,
erected
by
the
last
king
,
and
now
forming
the
country
residence
of
the
Duke
of
Strelsau
.
The
old
and
the
new
portions
were
connected
by
a
drawbridge
,
and
this
indirect
mode
of
access
formed
the
only
passage
between
the
old
building
and
the
outer
world
;
but
leading
to
the
modern
chateau
there
was
a
broad
and
handsome
avenue
.
It
was
an
ideal
residence
:
when
“
Black
Michael
”
desired
company
,
he
could
dwell
in
his
chateau
;
if
a
fit
of
misanthropy
seized
him
,
he
had
merely
to
cross
the
bridge
and
draw
it
up
after
him
(
it
ran
on
rollers
)
,
and
nothing
short
of
a
regiment
and
a
train
of
artillery
could
fetch
him
out
.
I
went
on
my
way
,
glad
that
poor
Black
Michael
,
though
he
could
not
have
the
throne
or
the
princess
,
had
,
at
least
,
as
fine
a
residence
as
any
prince
in
Europe
.
</p>
<p>
Soon
I
entered
the
forest
,
and
walked
on
for
an
hour
or
more
in
its
cool
sombre
shade
.
The
great
trees
enlaced
with
one
another
over
my
head
,
and
the
sunshine
stole
through
in
patches
as
bright
as
diamonds
,
and
hardly
bigger
.
I
was
enchanted
with
the
place
,
and
,
finding
a
felled
tree-trunk
,
propped
my
back
against
it
,
and
stretching
my
legs
out
gave
myself
up
to
undisturbed
contemplation
of
the
solemn
beauty
of
the
woods
and
to
the
comfort
of
a
good
cigar
.
And
when
the
cigar
was
finished
and
I
had
(
I
suppose
)
inhaled
as
much
beauty
as
I
could
,
I
went
off
into
the
most
delightful
sleep
,
regardless
of
my
train
to
Strelsau
and
of
the
fast-waning
afternoon
.
To
remember
a
train
in
such
a
spot
would
have
been
rank
sacrilege
.
Instead
of
that
,
I
fell
to
dreaming
that
I
was
married
to
the
Princess
Flavia
and
dwelt
in
the
Castle
of
Zenda
,
and
beguiled
whole
days
with
my
love
in
the
glades
of
the
forest
--
which
made
a
very
pleasant
dream
.
In
fact
,
I
was
just
impressing
a
fervent
kiss
on
the
charming
lips
of
the
princess
,
when
I
heard
(
and
the
voice
seemed
at
first
a
part
of
the
dream
)
someone
exclaim
,
in
rough
strident
tones
.
</p>
<p>
“
Why
,
the
devil
’s
in
it
!
Shave
him
,
and
he
’d
be
the
King
!
”
</p>
<p>
The
idea
seemed
whimsical
enough
for
a
dream
:
by
the
sacrifice
of
my
heavy
moustache
and
carefully
pointed
imperial
,
I
was
to
be
transformed
into
a
monarch
!
I
was
about
to
kiss
the
princess
again
,
when
I
arrived
(
very
reluctantly
)
at
the
conclusion
that
I
was
awake
.
</p>
<p>
I
opened
my
eyes
,
and
found
two
men
regarding
me
with
much
curiosity
.
Both
wore
shooting
costumes
and
carried
guns
.
One
was
rather
short
and
very
stoutly
built
,
with
a
big
bullet-shaped
head
,
a
bristly
grey
moustache
,
and
small
pale-blue
eyes
,
a
trifle
bloodshot
.
The
other
was
a
slender
young
fellow
,
of
middle
height
,
dark
in
complexion
,
and
bearing
himself
with
grace
and
distinction
.
I
set
the
one
down
as
an
old
soldier
:
the
other
for
a
gentleman
accustomed
to
move
in
good
society
,
but
not
unused
to
military
life
either
.
It
turned
out
afterwards
that
my
guess
was
a
good
one
.
