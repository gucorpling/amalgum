I

when
gay
revolution
or
gay
rights
...
I
do
n't
know
how
it
happened
or
when
it
happened
,
but
it
was
a
parallel
movement
that
happened
at
the
same
time
I
was
alive
.
What
's
the
difference
?
It
makes
no
difference

But
it
is
close
enough
.
It
's
the
total
of
both
.
That
's
my
ancestry
.
My
father
was
born
there
,
in
fact
.
He
was
the
only
person
from
his
family
that
came
to
the
United
States
and
he
did
so
in
1920
.

Do
you
ever
pay
any
attention
to
Italian
politics
and
the
happenings
with
the

?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
GT
:
</hi>
I
pay
attention
to
it
when
it
's
in
the
headlines
.
I
read
the
papers
.
But
do
I
pay
attention
to
the
point
of
caring
?
No.
I
do
n't
know
that
the
Italians
much
care
about
politics
.
They
capitalize
on
it
.
They
exploit
it
.
I
think
it
's
a
country
of
family
influences
.
Families
matter
so
much
there
.
They
've
had
a
mistrust
of
government
ever
since
the
fall
of
Rome
.
I
mean
they
're
really
clans
.
Just
a
bunch
of
clans
.
Little
cliquish
people
,
even
now
.
Even
now
,
with
transportation
and
communications
pervasive
.
It
used
to
be
they
were
stuck
in
the
hills
and
they
did
n't
have
any
means
of
getting
from
one
part
of
the
mountain
to
the
other
so
they
were
insular
.
Their
dialect
was
held
firm
.
Now
,
it
's
different
,
but
it
's
still
not
a
country
that
's
a
unified
country
.
I
mean
Italy
is
called
a
nation
,
but
...
.

They
ca

</hi>
They
ca
n't
do
anything
.
But
on
the
other
hand
they
live
damn
well
.
There
's
a
kind
of
underground
economy
that
's
been
there
,
probably
for
centuries
.
The
surface
tells
you
one
thing
.
The
statistics
tells
you
this
,
this
,
this
.
But
underneath
,
there
's
a
core
management
this
kind
of
internal
management
of
mercenary
affairs
,
or
family
connections
,
or
ways
of
gaining
what
is
known
on
the
surface
,
but
underneath
there
's
a
whole
mysterious
way
of
prosperity
in
Italy
that
is
n't
shown
.
It
's
very
interesting
.
You
find
the
news
reports
or
the
books
that
are
out
saying
one
thing
.
I
do
n't
exactly
ever
see
it
and
I
've
traveled
a
lot
.
I
have
n't
traveled
very
much
in
the
last
ten
years
in
Europe
.
