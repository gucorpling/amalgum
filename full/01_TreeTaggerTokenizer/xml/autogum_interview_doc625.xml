Over
the
past
few
months
,
the
Modern
Whig
Party
has
been
steadily
increasing
in
membership
.
Around
this
time
last
year
,
the
MWP
had
under
5,000
members
.
Today
,
that
number
has
grown
to
nearly
30,000
.
In
your
opinion
,
what
is
the
reason
for
the
MWP
's
sudden
and
rapid
increase
and
popularity
?
Do
you
expect
it
to
continue
growing
at
this
pace
?

As
the
word
continues
to
get
out
about
our
organization
,
we
do
expect
the
Modern
Whig
Party
to
maintain
its
steady
growth
.
A
number
of
print
and
broadcast
media
outlets
have
even
gone
so
far
as
to
proclaim
that
the
Modern
Whig
Party
is
&quot;
potentially
viable
,
&quot;
and
&quot;
makes
sense
.
&quot;
Another
outlet
stated
that
this
organization
is
the
&quot;
fastest
growing
political
movement
in
the
nation
.
&quot;
Perhaps
the
main
reason
we
continue
to
gain
traction
is
that
these
media
outlets
are
recognizing
that
the
Modern
Whig
Party
is
attractive
to
moderate
Democrats
,
independents
and
disenchanted
Republicans
.
At
the
same
time
,
we
are
building
this
organization
realistically
,
methodically
and
gradually
in
an
effort
to
get
this
right
.

How
exactly
does
the
Modern
Whig
Party
differ
from
America
's
two
largest
political
parties
;
the
Republican
and
Democratic
?

One
important
difference
between
the
Modern
Whig
Party
and
the
other
two
parties
is
that
we
look
beyond
partisan
rivalry
and
will
absolutely
support
a
candidate
or
elected
official
from
a
different
party
if
that
person
subscribes
to
a
doctrine
of
common
sense
and
rational
solutions
rather
than
ideology
.
We
realize
that
most
people
are
not
limited
to
one
distinct
ideology
and
instead
pick
and
choose
based
on
specific
issues
.

Is
your
party
running
any
candidates
for
federal
or
statewide
office
in
the
2010
midterm
elections
?

Our
strategy
is
to
refrain
from
trotting
out
as
many
candidates
as
possible
just
to
lose
.
Instead
,
we
are
diverting
our
resources
and
focus
to
a
relatively
small
group
of
initial
candidates
who
bring
quality
and
viability
to
the
table
.
We
are
continuing
the
vetting
process
for
our
potential
candidates
.
So
far
,
we
have
two
announced
candidates
running
for
office
.
A
well-qualified
candidate
named
Gene
Baldassari
is
running
for
the
New
Jersey
State
Assembly
in
the
14th
District
.
That
election
is
November
2009
.
In
addition
,
Paul
McKain
is
running
for
Congress
in
Florida
's
2nd
Congressional
District
.
Paul
McKain
is
a
prominent
entrepreneur
,
retired
firefighter
and
recognized
child-safety
advocate
who
brings
a
wealth
of
down-to-earth
experience
and
qualifications
.

Currently
,
are
there
any
elected
officials
in
the
United
States
that
are
members
of
the
Modern
Whig
Party

<p>
<hi rend="bold">

We
have
some
prominent
members
who
have
signed
onto
this
organization
to
include
military
generals
,
former
GOP
county/state
officials
and
current/former
elected
officials
on
the
local
level
.
However
,
we
do
not
have
any
elected
officials
on
the
Whig
ticket
as
we
still
are
a
newly
constituted
political
organization
.
In
fact
,
many
of
our
members
remain
on
the
GOP
and
Democratic
rolls
,
which
again
,
is
something
that
we
have
no
problems
with
as
we
continue
to
build
.
