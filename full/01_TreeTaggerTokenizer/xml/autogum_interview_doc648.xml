You
've
been
working
at
Y&amp;R
eleven
years
across
two
separate
stints
.
That
kind
of
tenure
in
any
job
is
a
long
time
.
What
made
you
stick
with
it
as
long
as
you
have
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Michelle
Stafford
</hi>
:
Because
it
's
fun
!
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Mike
Halterman
</hi>
:
Do
you
think
Phyllis
and
Nicholas
have
a
fighting
chance
,
or
will
Phyllis
be
doomed
to
losing
the
men
she
loves
,
like
with
Danny
and
Jack
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Michelle
Stafford
</hi>
:
I
think
that
it
's
a
soap
opera
and
nobody
ever
stays
happy
for
a
long
long
time
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Mike
Halterman
</hi>
:
Phyllis
had
a
lot
of
foils
and
enemies
in
the
series
,
like
Christine
,
Drucilla
,
and
Diane
.
Which
one
of
those
women
do
you
think
is
Phyllis
's
epic
foil
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Michelle
Stafford
</hi>
:
Christine
by
far
.
She
really
really
really
gets
under
Phyllis
'
skin
.
The
other
two
women
are
bad
themselves
,
so
they
do
n't
get
under
her
skin
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Mike
Halterman
</hi>
:
You
've
won
two
Emmy
Awards
,
both
from
separate
and
distinct
parts
in
your
story
.
Out
of
the
work
which
got
you
both
Emmy
Awards
,
which
do
you
feel
was
your
strongest
body
of
work
,
the
one
you
received
on
your
first
stint
,
or
the
one
you
got
for
your
current
stint
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Michelle
Stafford
</hi>
:
Because
the
Emmys
are
judged
by
submitting
two
shows
,
I
ca
n't
honestly
answer
that
question
.
The
way
Emmys
are
judged
are
on
two
shows
from
that
year
.
And
you
win
if
you
have
two
strong
shows
,
which
is
really
luck
.
A
lot
of
luck
,
some
talent
,
but
a
lot
of
luck
.
You
hope
those
two
shows
mix
well
together
.
That
's
luck
too
.
I
had
other
years
where
I
had
more
of
a
storyline
written
for
me
and
did
n't
win
.
So
it
's
really
based
on
if
you
're
lucky
enough
to
get
two
shows
that
really
stand
out
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Mike
Halterman
</hi>
:
Do
you
think
Y&amp;R
should
make
more
use
of
umbrella
storylines
,
like
the
recent
&quot;
Out
of
the
Ashes
&quot;
event
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Michelle
Stafford
</hi>
:
I
'm
a
big
fan
of
character
driven
storylines
.
That
's
why
I
was
a
big
fan
of
the
Nick/Phyllis
affair
;
that
was
very
much
a
character
driven
storyline
and
ratings
really
peaked
at
that
time
because
everyone
was
interested
in
seeing
the
fallout
.
I
think
that
any
actor
on
daytime
is
going
to
answer
that
question
the
same
way
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Mike
Halterman
</hi>
:
Some
of
your
fans
are
new
to
the
show
,
and
others
have
watched
since
you
first
appeared
in
1994
,
and
others
have
watched
since
the
show
first
started
.
What
would
you
like
to
say
as
an
end
note
to
all
of
your
fans
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Michelle
Stafford
</hi>
:
Thank
you
for
watching
!
I
hope
we
've
entertained
you
all
.
When
I
watched
the
daytime
shows
when
I
was
younger
I
used
to
be
highly
entertained
.
I
hope
you
're
as
entertained
as
I
was
.
