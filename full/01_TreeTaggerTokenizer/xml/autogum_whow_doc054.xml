the
Bobby
Pin
</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
The
most
common
and
known
method
of
opening
locked
car
is
the
use
of
Bobby
pins
or
paper
clips
.
When
using
a
paper-clip
,
you
have
to
open
up
both
its
ends
so
there
are
2
prongs
just
like
Bobby
pin
.
Now
insert
it
inside
the
lock
and
keep
moving
upwards
and
downwards
.
The
movement
of
barrels
should
be
continuous
as
you
are
making
an
effort
to
simulate
the
turning
of
key
inside
car
door
lock
.
With
the
right
combination
,
the
lock
will
be
turned
and
the
door
will
be
opened
.

<p>
This
is
an
easy
trick
,
but
requires
time
to
find
that
one
magic
combination
which
will
lead
to
the
opening
of
a
door
.
You
must
be
patient
if
you
are
using
this
method
.
