How
Mr.
Ralph
Nickleby
provided
for
his
Niece
and
Sister-in-Law
</head>
<p>
On
the
second
morning
after
the
departure
of
Nicholas
for
Yorkshire
,
Kate
Nickleby
sat
in
a
very
faded
chair
raised
upon
a
very
dusty
throne
in
Miss
La
Creevy
’s
room
,
giving
that
lady
a
sitting
for
the
portrait
upon
which
she
was
engaged
;
and
towards
the
full
perfection
of
which
,
Miss
La
Creevy
had
had
the
street-door
case
brought
upstairs
,
in
order
that
she
might
be
the
better
able
to
infuse
into
the
counterfeit
countenance
of
Miss
Nickleby
,
a
bright
salmon
flesh-tint
which
she
had
originally
hit
upon
while
executing
the
miniature
of
a
young
officer
therein
contained
,
and
which
bright
salmon
flesh-tint
was
considered
,
by
Miss
La
Creevy
’s
chief
friends
and
patrons
,
to
be
quite
a
novelty
in
art
:
as
indeed
it
was
.
</p>
<p>
‘
I
think
I
have
caught
it
now
,
’
said
Miss
La
Creevy
.
‘
The
very
shade
!
This
will
be
the
sweetest
portrait
I
have
ever
done
,
certainly
.
’
</p>
<p>
‘
It
will
be
your
genius
that
makes
it
so
,
then
,
I
am
sure
,
’
replied
Kate
,
smiling
.
</p>
<p>
‘
No
,
no
,
I
wo
n’t
allow
that
,
my
dear
,
’
rejoined
Miss
La
Creevy
.
‘
It
’s
a
very
nice
subject
--
a
very
nice
subject
,
indeed
--
though
,
of
course
,
something
depends
upon
the
mode
of
treatment
.
’
</p>
<p>
‘
And
not
a
little
,
’
observed
Kate
.
</p>
<p>
‘
Why
,
my
dear
,
you
are
right
there
,
’
said
Miss
La
Creevy
,
‘
in
the
main
you
are
right
there
;
though
I
do
n’t
allow
that
it
is
of
such
very
great
importance
in
the
present
case
.
Ah
!
The
difficulties
of
Art
,
my
dear
,
are
great
.
’
</p>
<p>
‘
They
must
be
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
’
said
Kate
,
humouring
her
good-natured
little
friend
.
</p>
<p>
‘
They
are
beyond
anything
you
can
form
the
faintest
conception
of
,
’
replied
Miss
La
Creevy
.
‘
What
with
bringing
out
eyes
with
all
one
’s
power
,
and
keeping
down
noses
with
all
one
’s
force
,
and
adding
to
heads
,
and
taking
away
teeth
altogether
,
you
have
no
idea
of
the
trouble
one
little
miniature
is
.
’
</p>
<p>
‘
The
remuneration
can
scarcely
repay
you
,
’
said
Kate
.
</p>
<p>
‘
Why
,
it
does
not
,
and
that
’s
the
truth
,
’
answered
Miss
La
Creevy
;
‘
and
then
people
are
so
dissatisfied
and
unreasonable
,
that
,
nine
times
out
of
ten
,
there
’s
no
pleasure
in
painting
them
.
Sometimes
they
say
,
“
Oh
,
how
very
serious
you
have
made
me
look
,
Miss
La
Creevy
!
”
and
at
others
,
“
La
,
Miss
La
Creevy
,
how
very
smirking
!
”
when
the
very
essence
of
a
good
portrait
is
,
that
it
must
be
either
serious
or
smirking
,
or
it
’s
no
portrait
at
all
.
’
</p>
<p>
‘
Indeed
!
’
said
Kate
,
laughing
.
</p>
<p>
‘
Certainly
,
my
dear
;
because
the
sitters
are
always
either
the
one
or
the
other
,
’
replied
Miss
La
Creevy
.
‘
Look
at
the
Royal
Academy
!
All
those
beautiful
shiny
portraits
of
gentlemen
in
black
velvet
waistcoats
,
with
their
fists
doubled
up
on
round
tables
,
or
marble
slabs
,
are
serious
,
you
know
;
and
all
the
ladies
who
are
playing
with
little
parasols
,
or
little
dogs
,
or
little
children
--
it
’s
the
same
rule
in
art
,
only
varying
the
objects
--
are
smirking
.
In
fact
,
’
said
Miss
La
Creevy
,
sinking
her
voice
to
a
confidential
whisper
,
‘
there
are
only
two
styles
of
portrait
painting
;
the
serious
and
the
smirk
;
and
we
always
use
the
serious
for
professional
people
(
except
actors
sometimes
)
,
and
the
smirk
for
private
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
do
n’t
care
so
much
about
looking
clever
.
’
</p>
<p>
Kate
seemed
highly
amused
by
this
information
,
and
Miss
La
Creevy
went
on
painting
and
talking
,
with
immovable
complacency
.
</p>
<p>
‘
What
a
number
of
officers
you
seem
to
paint
!
’
said
Kate
,
availing
herself
of
a
pause
in
the
discourse
,
and
glancing
round
the
room
.
</p>
<p>
‘
Number
of
what
,
child
?
’
inquired
Miss
La
Creevy
,
looking
up
from
her
work
.
‘
Character
portraits
,
oh
yes
--
they
’re
not
real
military
men
,
you
know
.
’
</p>
<p>
‘
No
!
’
</p>
<p>
‘
Bless
your
heart
,
of
course
not
;
only
clerks
and
that
,
who
hire
a
uniform
coat
to
be
painted
in
,
and
send
it
here
in
a
carpet
bag
.
Some
artists
,
’
said
Miss
La
Creevy
,
‘
keep
a
red
coat
,
and
charge
seven-and-sixpence
extra
for
hire
and
carmine
;
but
I
do
n’t
do
that
myself
,
for
I
do
n’t
consider
it
legitimate
.
’
</p>
<p>
Drawing
herself
up
,
as
though
she
plumed
herself
greatly
upon
not
resorting
to
these
lures
to
catch
sitters
,
Miss
La
Creevy
applied
herself
,
more
intently
,
to
her
task
:
only
raising
her
head
occasionally
,
to
look
with
unspeakable
satisfaction
at
some
touch
she
had
just
put
in
:
and
now
and
then
giving
Miss
Nickleby
to
understand
what
particular
feature
she
was
at
work
upon
,
at
the
moment
;
‘
not
,
’
she
expressly
observed
,
‘
that
you
should
make
it
up
for
painting
,
my
dear
,
but
because
it
’s
our
custom
sometimes
to
tell
sitters
what
part
we
are
upon
,
in
order
that
if
there
’s
any
particular
expression
they
want
introduced
,
they
may
throw
it
in
,
at
the
time
,
you
know
.
’
</p>
<p>
‘
And
when
,
’
said
Miss
La
Creevy
,
after
a
long
silence
,
to
wit
,
an
interval
of
full
a
minute
and
a
half
,
‘
when
do
you
expect
to
see
your
uncle
again
?
’
</p>
<p>
‘
I
scarcely
know
;
I
had
expected
to
have
seen
him
before
now
,
’
replied
Kate
.
‘
Soon
I
hope
,
for
this
state
of
uncertainty
is
worse
than
anything
.
’
</p>
<p>
‘
I
suppose
he
has
money
,
has
n’t
he
?
’
inquired
Miss
La
Creevy
.
</p>
<p>
‘
He
is
very
rich
,
I
have
heard
,
’
rejoined
Kate
.
‘
I
do
n’t
know
that
he
is
,
but
I
believe
so
.
’
</p>
<p>
‘
Ah
,
you
may
depend
upon
it
he
is
,
or
he
would
n’t
be
so
surly
,
’
remarked
Miss
La
Creevy
,
who
was
an
odd
little
mixture
of
shrewdness
and
simplicity
.
‘
When
a
man
’s
a
bear
,
he
is
generally
pretty
independent
.
