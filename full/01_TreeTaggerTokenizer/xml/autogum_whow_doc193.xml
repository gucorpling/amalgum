Consider
if
this
is
right
for
your
child
.
this
parenting
style
will
work
for
children
that
are
cooperative
and
do
n't
cause
much
trouble
.
on
the
other
hand
a
child
that
tends
to
be
quite
stubborn
and
is
defiant
wo
n't
benefit
from
it
.

Focus
on
positive
reinforcement
.
because
you
wo
n't
be
punishing
your
child
you
need
to
focus
on
praising
and
encouraging
good
behaviours
as
much
as
possible
.
even
the
small
things
matter
like
getting
up
on
time
or
putting
away
their
toys
without
being
asked
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
There
is
no
such
thing
as
praising
your
child
too
much
,
this
wo
n't
spoil
them
</item>
<item>
Make
sure
to
use
descriptive
praise
,
instead
of
saying
&quot;
good
boy
&quot;
say
&quot;
i
really
liked
how
you
did
your
homework
without
being
asked
it
really
helps
me
out

Reward
your
child
for
good
behaviours
.
Every
so
often
,
give
your
child
a
reward
such
as
a
small
new
toy
or
a
trip
to
the
pool
for
good
behaviour
.
Make
sure
to
explain
why
they
are
getting
the
reward
,
for
example
&quot;
I
thought
we
could
go
to
the
movies
tonight
because
of
how
nice
you
were
to
your
brother
all
week
&quot;

Ignore
bad
behaviours
.
If
your
child
misbehaves
,
do
not
give
them
the
attention
they
are
acting
out
for
until
they
stop
.
Afterwards
say
something
short
and
quick
such
as
&quot;
Thank
you
for
stopping
&quot;
,
then
change
the
subject
to
something
else
so
you
can
get
on
with
the
day
.
<list type="unordered">

You
ca
n't
ignore
behaviours
like
violence
and

Scold
worse
behaviours
.
It
's
important
to
criticise
the
behaviour
,
not
the
child
,
so
instead
of
saying
&quot;
bad
girl
&quot;
,
say
&quot;
I
do
n't
like
your
behaviour
,
please
stop
&quot;
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Keep
in
mind
that
this
is
n't
exactly
punishing
them
,
it
is
just
asking
them
to
stop
their
bad
behaviour
.
Punishing
would
be
grounding
them
or
taking
away
their
screen
time
.

Make
sure
your
home
is
judgement-free
and
listens
to
everyone
's
opinion
;
this
includes
your
child
's
opinion
.
Never
judge
your
child
for
their
behaviour
and
always
listen
to
their
opinion
.
They
deserve
a
say
in
how
things
work
.
This
does
n't
mean
they
get
to
dictate
everything
,
but
they
have
an
influence
on
the
final
decision
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
For
example
,
if
a
the
child
wants
to
go
to
the
park
but
the
mum
does
n't
want
to
drive
there
then
they
could
settle
on
a
park
that
is
closer
to
their
home
.

Make
sure
to
support
your
child
and
ask
what
's
wrong
when
they
feel
down
.
If
you
notice
a
change
in
their
behaviour
this
could
be
due
to
something
else
that
's
happening
in
their
life
.
Ask
how
school
was
everyday
(
to
make
sure
nothing
bad
happened
)
and
let
your
child
know
they
can
always
come
and
talk
to
you
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Be
warned
that
if
you
judge
your
child
's
actions
,
even
if
they
were
wrong
,
your
child
can
shut
down
and
stop
talking
to
you
.

Tips

<list type="unordered">
<item>
Sometimes
just
asking
your
child
politely
to
do
something
instead
of
commanding
them
to
will
make
them
more
willing
to
do
it
.
</item>
<item>
Consider
hiring
a
counsellor
if
your
child
's
behaviour
or
emotions
get
too
out
of
hand
.
</item>
<item>
A
child
that
feels
loved
and
listened
to
will
be
more
likely
to
cooperate
and
have
good
behavior
.
</item>
<item>
Encourage
your
child
to
do
things
to
help
around
the
house
-
but
do
n't
force
them
.
If
they
do
help
,
reward
them
.
</item>
<item>
Let
children
learn
from
their
actions
,
for
example
if
they
do
n't
wash
their
uniform
before
school
they
will
have
to
wear
a
dirty
uniform
to
school
,
or
if
they
stay
up
late
they
will
be
tired
the
next
morning
.

Warnings
</head>
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Never
ever
hit
a
child
-
this
is
physical
abuse
and
will
severely
affect
your
child
,
especially
if
you
hit
them
often
.
</item>
<item>
Do
n't
say
mean
things
to
your
child
or
make
fun
of
them
.
It
can
lower
their
self
esteem
and
can
be
considered
emotional
and
verbal
abuse
.
