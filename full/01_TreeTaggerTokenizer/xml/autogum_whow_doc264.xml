Test
a
Business
Continuity
Plan
</head>
<p>
A
plan
is
as
good
as
its
implementation
.
If
we
do
not
execute
the
plan
,
the
very
purpose
of
the
plan
is
defeated
.
In
case
of
a
business
continuity
plan
,
there
is
a
twist
in
the
tale
.
This
is
because
a
Business
Continuity
Plan
comes
into
use
only
when
a
situation
calls
for
it
.
Otherwise
,
it
remains
a
plan
.
So
,
it
is
important
to
test
the
plan
at
regular
intervals
to
make
sure
that
it
serves
the
purpose
.
The
testing
is
also
an
indication
of
the
emergency
preparedness
.

In
case
you
want
the
testing
to
reveal
the
gaps
,
then
you
may
skip
the
above
step

However
,
in
order
to
get
the
most
out
of
the
testing
exercise
,
it
is
always
better
to
ensure
that
the
plan
is
updated
.
For
instance
,
telephone
numbers
might
have
undergone
a
change
or
there
could
be
people
movements
.

<item>
Having
updated
the
plan
,
the
next
step
is
to
plan
the
testing
itself
.
<figure rend="Survive High School Step 13 Version 2.jpg">

</item>
<item>
Write
out
the
clear
objective
of
the
testing
plan
along
with
details
about
who
all
are
required
to
be
part
of
the
testing
exercise
,
what
is
their
role
,
type
of
testing
exercise
that
you
are
envisaging
,
what
are
the
expected
outcomes
.
<figure rend="Write-a-Blog-Post-Step-12.jpg">

<item>
Having
done
the
above
,
decide
if
you
want
to
opt
for
a
desktop
exercise
(
where
you
simulate
a
real
life
scenario
in
a
meeting
hall
or
a
conference
room
)
or
you
would
like
to
do
it
on
a
real
time
basis
.
<figure rend="Write-a-Blog-Post-Step-3-Version-2.jpg">

<item>
For
the
testing
exercise
,
it
is
also
crucial
to
inform
all
the
stakeholders
well
in
advance
so
that
they
are
prepared
.
<figure rend="Succeed-in-Network-Marketing-Step-10-Version-3.jpg">

<item>
Keep
the
top
management
team
informed
so
that
employees
take
the
testing
plan
with
all
the
seriousness
that
it
deserves
.

Communicate
the
venue
in
advance
along
with
the
date
and
ensure
that
there
are
no
last
minute
cancellations
.
Testing
a
Business
Continuity
Plan
is
serious
business
that
ca
n't
be
delegated
lower
down
the
line
.
<figure rend="Raise-Money-Online-Step-11-Version-2.jpg">

Be
mentally
prepared
for
the
challenges
-
indifferent
responses
,
last
minute
cancellations
etc
and
focus
on
the
broader
goals
.
<figure rend="Develop-Critical-Thinking-Skills-Step-16-Version-3.jpg">

It
is
advisable
to
have
one
or
two
sponsors
for
this
exercise
-
like
the
Marketing
director
or
Operations
director
or
HR
director
who
can
add
value
and
positional
influence
to
the
testing
exercise
.

Generally
the
duration
of
the
testing
exercise
depends
on
a
number
of
factors
but
in
general
,
you
can
have
a
1-day
session
for
a
desktop
testing
exercise
.
<figure rend="Prepare-a-Power-of-Attorney-Step-2-Version-3.jpg">

<item>
It
is
advisable
to
have
the
testing
exercise
off-site
but
often
due
to
cost
factors
and
logistical
constraints
,
the
testing
is
done
at
the
relevant
location
.

3-days
prior
to
the
testing
date
,
send

executive
summary

the
testing
plan

all
stake
holders
.

On
the

by
clarifying
the
objectives
clearly
in
the
opening
session
.

<item>
Explain
to
the
audience
that
this
is
neither
a
fact
finding
mission
or
a
fault
finding
mission
but
an
attempt
to
ensure
that
the
business
continuity
plan
is
fit
for
purpose
.
<figure rend="Develop-a-Relationship-With-a-Customer-Step-8-Version-3.jpg">

<item>
Have
one
resource
dedicated
for
capturing
the
data
on
a
spread
sheet
live
when
the
testing
is
in
progress
.
<figure rend="Do-a-Background-Check-Step-6-Version-2.jpg">

Let
there
be
one
more

who
documents
the
proceedings
in
minute
details
.
(
this
is
not
a
stenographer/typist

as
most
people
seem
to
believe
)
.

Please
note
that
documentation
is
not

important

all
minor
details
need
to
be
documented

Following
the
completion
of
the
testing
plan
,
it
is
important
to
give
a
break
and
request
all
to
reassemble
after
30
minutes
.
During
this
period
,
capture
the
key
lessons
from
the
exercise
.

spending

time

address

group

share
their
thoughts

provide
assurance

the
feedback
will
be

more
effectively

<figure rend="File-Bankruptcy-in-the-United-States-Step-7-Version-4.jpg">

Post
testing
,
communicate
the
gaps
to
the
group
via
Email
and
also
inform
them
about
how
these
gaps
have
been
used
to
update
the
plan
.
<figure rend="Obtain-a-Copy-of-Your-Birth-Certificate-in-Ohio-Step-14.jpg">

Update
the
plan
,
archive
the
earlier
versions
and
communicate
the
new
plan
to
all
stakeholders
with
the
revision
number
and
date
.

Do

feedback

it
!
)
<figure rend="Negotiate-an-Offer-Step-1-Version-2.jpg">

<item>
It
may
be
worthwhile
to
do
a
random
check
on
the
next
period
for
testing
the
plan
(
perhaps
after
6
months
)
and
also
if
we
can
do
a
real
time
simulation
.
For
example
allow
operations
at
a
site
to
come
to
a
grinding
halt
by
way
of
artificially
created
hazard
and
then
work
at
testing
the
plan
.
This
will
need
buy-in
from
the
top
team
.
