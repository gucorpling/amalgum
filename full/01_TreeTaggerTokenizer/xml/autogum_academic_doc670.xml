Discussion
</head>
<p>
Renewed
focus
on
functional
and
quality
of
life
outcomes
after
surgery
for
DCM
in
adults
has
come
from
rigorous
scrutiny
of
the
results
of
several
large-scale
studies
in
the
last
decade
.
The
traditional
doctrine
of
the
use
of
surgery
to
‘
arrest
clinical
progression
’
has
been
replaced
with
a
more
modern
approach
with
decompressive
surgery
used
as
a
means
to
provide
both
functional
and
quality
of
life
improvement
.
The
assessment
of
quality
of
life
metrics
has
become
particularly
important
in
the
examination
of
patients
with
mild
functional
impairment
(
or
asymptomatic
cord
compression
)
,
and
is
the
focus
of
a
number
of
studies
.
Careful
evaluation
has
discovered
a
number
of
predictors
of
clinical
outcomes
from
surgery
for
DCM
,
including
baseline
severity
of
impairment
,
duration
of
symptoms
,
presence
of
systemic
or
psychological
co-morbidities
,
obesity
,
and
of
course
age
.
With
simple
univariate
analysis
of
outcome
measures
,
many
studies
have
reported
worse
functional
and
QOL
outcomes
with
increasing
age
after
surgery
for
DCM
.
However
,
elderly
patients
often
present
with
increased
duration
and
worse
severity
of
symptoms
,
with
an
increased
incidence
of
co-morbidities
.
Many
elderly
patients
also
present
a
high
,
sometimes
unacceptable
,
surgical
risk
profile
that
makes
decisions
regarding
surgical
management
less
appropriate
.
DCM
is
a
disease
that
can
cause
a
significant
amount
of
potentially
reversible
or
preventable
neurological
disability
in
the
elderly
population
,
and
therefore
concerted
efforts
should
be
made
to
improve
decision-making
strategies
for
this
patient
group
.
</p>
<p>
The
results
of
the
current
study
demonstrate
a
number
of
important
conclusions
,
some
of
which
have
not
been
described
in
previous
literature
.
Firstly
,
even
when
matched
for
co-morbidities
,
duration
of
symptoms
,
sex
,
smoking
status
and
severity
of
functional
impairment
,
younger
adults
report
significantly
worse
effects
on
their
baseline
physical
and
mental
quality
of
life
scores
compared
to
the
older
aged
cohort
.
This
could
be
explained
through
2
potential
mechanisms
.
Firstly
,
as
the
younger
cohort
were
of
working
age
,
the
psychological
impact
of
DCM
may
be
greater
if
employment
security
is
perceived
to
be
threatened
.
Secondly
,
the
elderly
patients
demonstrate
psychological
resilience
or
adaptations/support
that
mean
the
symptoms
of
DCM
have
a
less
pronounced
effect
on
their
quality
of
life
.
This
is
an
interesting
concept
,
and
is
an
important
consideration
for
clinicians
managing
elderly
DCM
patients
.
</p>
<p>
All
patients
showed
improved
functional
impairment
scores
after
2
years
(
see
Table
2
)
.
Taking
the
older
cohort
in
isolation
,
this
is
good
evidence
that
surgery
is
an
effective
modality
to
produce
functional
improvements
in
elderly
DCM
patients
.
This
is
an
important
stand-alone
conclusion
from
this
study
.
When
the
change
from
baseline
scores
at
2
years
is
calculated
,
it
becomes
evident
that
the
functional
improvement
seen
after
surgery
is
of
a
greater
magnitude
in
younger
patients
compared
to
the
older
cohort
.
This
conclusion
is
similar
to
those
described
from
previous
univariate
analyses
in
prior
studies
.
Suggested
mechanisms
for
this
discrepancy
include
the
fact
that
elderly
patients
often
present
with
increased
duration
of
symptoms
at
diagnosis
,
often
have
difficulty
accessing
specialist
assessment
and
imaging
,
and
also
have
less
neurological
plasticity
or
reserve
compared
to
younger
adults
.
The
level
of
disability
as
measured
by
the
NDI
was
improved
significantly
by
surgery
for
all
patients
,
but
the
order
of
magnitude
was
similar
for
both
age
groups
(
<hi rend="italic">
p
</hi>
=
0.094
)
.
</p>
<p>
All
patients
demonstrated
improved
SF-36
PCS
and
MCS
from
baseline
at
the
2-year
interval
,
with
the
exception
of
the
MCS
scores
in
the
elderly
group
.
Both
PCS
and
MCS
metrics
echoed
the
functional
improvement
in
that
the
younger
cohort
had
a
significantly
greater
degree
of
improvement
from
baseline
compared
to
the
older
cohort
(
<hi rend="italic">
p
</hi>
&lt;
0.001
,
<hi rend="italic">
p
</hi>
=
0.007
)
.
This
provides
good
evidence
that
surgery
leads
to
increased
physical
and
mental
perception
of
quality
of
life
outcomes
in
all
patients
undergoing
surgery
for
DCM
.
It
appears
that
older
patients
’
mental
perception
of
quality
of
life
remains
stable
throughout
the
treatment
period
,
despite
having
a
worse
functional
improvement
,
and
less
magnitude
of
quality
of
life
improvement
overall
.
This
study
is
the
first
to
report
this
difference
in
quality
of
life
measures
between
younger
and
older
aged
cohorts
and
has
potentially
large
implications
on
pre-surgical
assessment
and
counselling
in
older
patients
with
DCM
.
However
,
age-related
effects
on
health
perception
have
been
found
to
influence
the
SF-36
score
,
and
the
contribution
from
the
perception
of
physical
effects
often
misses
a
number
of
important
determinants
of
overall
quality
of
life
in
older
persons
.
For
these
reasons
,
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
focus
of
quality
of
life
determinants
in
the
elderly
should
be
weighted
toward
mental
components
rather
than
the
physical
.
This
also
raises
certain
questions
about
the
efficacy
of
functional
assessment
measures
for
DCM
in
the
elderly
,
but
this
was
beyond
the
scope
of
the
current
study
.
