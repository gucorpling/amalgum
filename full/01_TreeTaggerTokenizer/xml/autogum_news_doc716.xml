Tyler
,
Texas
is
a
city
located
about
70
miles
north
of
Wells
.
The
Tyler
minister
explained
to
<hi rend="italic">
Wikinews
</hi>
,
he
and
several
of
his
church
members
were
distributing
food
and
water
to
homeless
citizens
in
downtown
Tyler
when
they
were
accosted
by
members
of
the
group
.
He
described
the
individuals
as
appearing
&quot;
[
...
]
very
robotic
,
kind
of
disengaged
and
had
very
big
eyes
.
&quot;
The
Church
of
Wells
'
group
's
leader
became
&quot;
very
agitated
&quot;
and
yelled
at
the
minister
and
his
parishioners
.
The
minister
said
he
recognized
the
Church
of
Wells
members
from
recent
news
coverage
.
Elaborating
on
the
encounter
,
he
recalled
,
&quot;
At
one
time
,
I
happened
to
call
him
'
brother
'
.
He
replied
,
&quot;
Do
n't
call
me
brother
.
I
do
n't
think
you
and
I
serve
the
same
Christ
.
&quot;
He
reported
the
Church
of
Wells
leader
also
insulted
one
of
the
other
church
's
volunteers
,
stating
,
&quot;
Look
at
you
.
You
look
just
like
the
world
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
minister
reported
the
Church
of
Wells
members
even
followed
his
group
on
foot
for
about
two
city
blocks
,
and
began
yelling
and
hurling
insults
at
them
when
they
arrived
at
the
city
's
square
plaza
.
When
asked
if
he
believes
the
Church
of
Wells
to
be
a
cult
,
the
minister
replied
,
&quot;
The
way
they
were
yelling
and
the
leader
seemingly
believed
that
our
church
member
absolutely
had
to
share
his
testimony
aloud
with
him
,
specifically
him
,
that
's
why
I
can
say
with
comfort
that
this
group
is
a
cult
.
A
cult
is
controlling
and
exclusive
.
All
the
women
dressed
the
same
.
He
resorted
to
name
calling
.
He
called
me
a
blasphemer
,
he
called
me
a
wolf
in
sheep
's
clothing
.
Often
,
when
someone
begins
to
feel
as
if
they
're
losing
traction
on
an
argument
,
they
'll
often
shift
over
into
name
calling
.
&quot;
The
minister
continued
,
&quot;
As
we
were
about
to
leave
,
[
the
Church
of
Wells
group
leader
]
said
,
'
Prophets
of
God
are
not
to
be
mocked
.
'
I
said
,
'
Brother
,
there
are
no
more
prophets
.
It
ended
with
Jesus
.
Yes
,
there
are
preachers
and
ministers
,
but
the
prophets
have
ended
.
'
I
believe
the
man
thinks
he
is
a
prophet
.
