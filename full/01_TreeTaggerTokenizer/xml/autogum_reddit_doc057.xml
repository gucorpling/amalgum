<sp who="#moonchildkarma">
<p>
I
am
originally
from
the
midwest
.
I
just
finished
my
freshman
year
of
college
at
a
great
school
in
Southern
California
.
During
my
freshman
year
,
I
met
an
older
boy
.
We
started
dating
.
He
convinced
me
that
rather
than
going
home
,
I
should
find
an
internship
and
stay
in
California
this
summer
.
I
did
exactly
that
.
I
found
a
wonderful
,
welling
paying
internship
in
my
career
field
.
Then
,
I
found
a
part
time
job
as
a
hostess
at
a
high
dining
restaurant
as
well
.
After
going
home
for
two
weeks
,
I
just
moved
into
my
apartment
across
the
street
from
his
fraternity
two
days
ago
.
Him
and
I
shared
a
storage
unit
since
he
’s
also
from
the
midwest
,
so
my
mom
and
I
made
trips
to
to
get
my
things
.
It
took
us
awhile
.
I
saw
my
boyfriend
,
spent
the
night
,
had
sex
,
caught
up
,
etc.
Everything
seemed
fine
.
Yesterday
,
my
mom
flew
home
back
to
the
midwest
.
That
night
,
I
go
over
to
my
boyfriends
fraternity
because
it
’s
the
president
’s
birthday
.
I
get
decently
drunk
,
but
still
perfectly
functioning
.
He
disappears
for
a
bit
.
I
text
him
and
ask
him
where
he
’s
gone
,
he
says
fortnite
.
He
comes
back
,
gets
me
,
and
we
go
to
his
room
.
Now
,
this
is
where
things
go
awry
.
I
,
the
perfect
girlfriend
,
am
wearing
lingerie
.
I
paid
60
dollars
for
a
brazilian
while
I
was
at
home
.
I
want
to
he
sex
with
my
boyfriend
I
had
n’t
seen
for
three
weeks
.
As
I
try
to
initiate
something
,
he
hesitates
.
I
can
tell
he
does
n’t
want
to
do
this
.
I
finally
convince
him
to
tell
me
what
’s
going
on
.
He
says
he
’s
tired
,
he
does
n’t
want
to
.
I
say
okay
.
However
,
I
feel
terrible
.
I
felt
like
I
was
forcing
myself
on
to
him
?
Has
he
felt
this
way
before
?
Am
I
really
such
a
wh*re
that
my
own
boyfriend
does
n’t
want
to
have
sex
with
me
?
I
felt
disgusting
about
myself
.
My
mind
was
racing
with
what
went
wrong
.
I
get
in
bed
and
begin
to
cry
.
He
comes
up
and
I
apologize
profusely
.
I
felt
terrible
about
making
him
do
something
he
did
n’t
want
to
,
but
at
the
same
time
,
why
would
n’t
he
want
to
have
sex
with
his
girlfriend
when
it
had
been
so
long
?
I
tell
him
I
just
want
him
to
be
honest
.
He
tells
me
he
does
n’t
want
to
have
sex
with
me
because
he
is
n’t
feeling
it
anymore
.
He
wants
to
break
up
.
I
immediately
say
,
if
you
want
to
break
up
,
we
’re
breaking
up
.
I
think
I
felt
my
heart
physically
shatter
in
my
chest
.
As
we
go
back
and
forth
,
I
try
to
understand
.
He
says
he
does
n’t
feel
like
he
’s
productive
or
getting
things
done
anymore
.
I
have
done
nothing
wrong
,
I
am
a
great
girlfriend
he
says
.
This
part
,
confused
the
fuck
out
of
me
.
I
am
beautiful
,
smart
,
and
funny
.
I
have
two
jobs
this
summer
.
He
does
n’t
have
a
single
one
yet
.
He
swears
he
has
an
internship
,
but
he
has
n’t
started
it
.
He
’s
been
spending
his
days
reading
and
going
to
the
pool
.
How
the
FUCK
am
I
what
’s
holding
him
back
from
success
?
Eventually
,
I
leave
.
I
walk
home
shaking
,
crying
,
and
in
the
dark
alleyway
alone
.
On
this
walk
,
I
realized
.
I
do
n’t
have
any
friends
or
family
here
this
summer
.
The
only
person
I
had
has
just
told
me
they
do
n’t
want
to
be
with
me
anymore
,
even
though
I
did
nothing
wrong
.
I
feel
so
helpless
,
Reddit
.
I
have
struggled
with
depression
in
the
past
and
I
am
very
afraid
I
am
going
to
crash
and
burn
due
to
loneliness
this
summer
.
I
’ll
be
living
alone
all
summer
.
I
have
jobs
,
but
they
’re
working
mostly
with
older
adults
,
not
anyway
I
could
make
friends
.
What
am
I
going
to
do
?
Today
is
the
first
day
of
my
internship
and
I
’ve
been
fighting
tears
all
morning
.
He
knew
I
started
today
too
,
what
a
nice
guy
.
TL
;
DR
Boyfriend
convinced
me
to
stay
,
then
dumps
me
.
Now
,
I
’m
alone
in
San
Diego
for
the
summer
.
I
have
no
friends
to
help
me
through
this
.
</p>

<sp who="#PTWA">
<p>
this
might
be
hard
to
feel
right
now
BUT
I
can
tell
you
from
experience
that
when
I
had
to
go
through
some
of
my
most
painful
months
without
a
support
system
,
I
found
myself
on
the
other
side
so
much
stronger
the
next
time
I
went
through
something
painful
.
That
is
n’t
to
say
we
all
have
to
be
macho
and
stoic
and
suffer
alone
,
or
that
one
ca
n’t
grow
stronger
when
supported
...
but
I
just
noticed
something
different
about
myself
after
that
period
.
I
guess
part
of
it
was
pride
that
I
had
managed
to
drag
myself
out
of
it
,
and
more
confidence
because
I
had
been
forced
to
learn
that
I
<hi rend="bold">
could
</hi>
handle
alone
something
that
I
thought
was
going
to
break
me
.
Even
if
I
never
am
in
that
position
again
,
it
makes
me
feel
stronger
and
more
competent
now
to
know
I
have
proven
I
can
do
it
.

If
you
tend
toward
depression
,
make
sure
you
do
n’t
let
that
little
demon
inside
turn
his
rejection
into
a
moratorium
on
your
entire
self
worth
.
If
your
depression
is
like
that
,
watch
out
!
!
Do
n’t
believe
that
internal
voice
.
I
have
found
the
best
thing
I
can
do
for
myself
when
a
painful
situation
threatens
to
trigger
a
deeper
depression
is
just
to
try
to
stick
to
positive
routines
(
good
sleep
,
exercise
,
sunshine
,
decent
food
,
staying
tidy
and
organized
)
.
</p>
<p>
You
are
in
such
a
good
position
to
have
worked
out
the
internship
and
a
place
to
live
.
I
think
you
’re
going
to
be
fine
,
so
if
an
internet
stranger
can
help
you
feel
that
,
I
hope
you
do
!
