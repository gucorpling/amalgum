Anonymous
distributed
flyers
and
informed
passers-by
about
Scientology
.
In
a
speech
,
they
called
for
a
dialogue
with
Scientology
members
,
and
said
they
were
concerned
for
the
parishioners
'
well-being
:
</p>
“
To
the
Scientologists
who
fear
us
:
You
have
nothing
to
fear
from
our
peaceful
protests
.
We
are
here
because
we
care
about
you
.
We
demonstrate
only
against
the
abuses
of
the
Church
management
and
we
stand
by
your
individual
freedom
of
religion

Once
more
,
protests
took
place
outside
of
both
the
Queen
Victoria
Scientology
Headquarters
and
the
Tottenham
Court
Road
Dianetics
centre
.
The
additional
time
available
for
protesters
in
the
aftermath
of
a
rushed
February
10th
protest
allowed
the
many
of
Anonymous
to
expand
their
protest
to
include
even
more
outreach
towards
members
of
the
public
,
with
Anonymous
members
handing
out
free
cake
,
sweets
and
other
confectionery
along
with
leaflets
and
stickers
to
passers-by
.
</p>
<p>
Signage
was
loud
and
varied
,
proclaiming
a
variety
of
messages
to
the
public
and
Scientologists
.
Many
of
the
signs
declared
amusing
yet
pointed
comments
,
with
others
making
more
serious
jabs
at
the
Church
of
Scientology
.
