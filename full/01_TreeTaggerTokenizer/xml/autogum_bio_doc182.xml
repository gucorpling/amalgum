Roderick
Edward
Maclean
</hi>
(
c.1854
–
8
June
1921
)
was
a
Scotsman
who
attempted
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassinate">
assassinate
</ref>
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Victoria">
Queen
Victoria
</ref>
on
2
March
1882
,
at
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windsor,_Berkshire">
Windsor
,
England
</ref>
,
with
a
pistol
.
This
was
the
last
of
eight
attempts
by
separate
people
to
kill
or
assault
Victoria
over
a
period
of
four
decades
.
Maclean
's
motive
was
purportedly
a
curt
reply
to
some
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetry">
poetry
</ref>
that
he
had
mailed
to
the
Queen
.

The
attempted
murder
followed
the
arrival
of
the
Royal
train
,
conveying
the
Queen
,
Princess
Beatrice
and
the
Court
from
Windsor
.
Queen
Victoria
had
just
walked
across
the
platform
of
Windsor
station
to
a
carriage
in
waiting
when
Maclean
,
who
was
standing
at
the
entrance
of
the
station
yard
among
a
number
of
spectators
,
deliberately
fired
a
revolver
at
her
.
The
shot
missed
,
and
Maclean
was
seized
by
Chief
Superintendent
Hayes
,
of
the
Borough
Police
,
and
the
weapon
wrenched
from
his
grasp
by
someone
in
the
crowd
.

Other
accounts
state
that
the
revolver
was
a
toy
and
that
his
aim
was
disrupted
by
an
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eton_college">
Eton
</ref>
schoolboy
:
</p>
<p>
The
weapon
was
a
mere
toy
,
and
the
life
the
beloved
monarch
was
not
seriously
endangered
.
A
number
of
Eton
boys
were
round
the
station
at
the
time
,
and
one
of
them
rushed
forward
and
struck
Maclean
with
his
umbrella
,
disconcerting
his
aim
—
which
was
unlikely
enough
,
in
any
case
,
to
have
been
accurate
.
The
boy
in
question
,
Gordon
Wilson
,
was
called
to
the
Castle
by
her
Majesty
and
thanked
for
his
promptitude
.
He
was
the
son
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Wilson_(Portsmouth_MP)">
Sir
Samuel
Wilson
</ref>
,
the
Australian
wool
magnate
,
who
introduced
salmon
into
the
Australian
rivers
and
afterwards
sat
in
Parliament
for
a
short
time
for
Portsmouth
.
Gordon
Wilson
married
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Wilson_(war_correspondent)">
Lady
Sarah
Spencer-Churchill
</ref>
,
a
sister
of
Lord
Randolph
and
Lady
Wimborne
.
He
was
killed
in
the
early
days
of
the
war
.
The
wretched
lunatic
,
therefore
,
survived
all
the
other
chief
actors
in
his
poor
little
drama
,
paying
dearly
for
his
brief
notoriety
.
He
had
,
however
,
the
distinction
of
undergoing
trial
for
high
treason
.

At
his
trial
,
Dr.
Charles
Vernon
Hitchins
testified
that
MacLean
had
been
certified
insane
in
June
1880
,
two
years
before
the
attempted
assassination
,
and
he
had
been
sent
to
Somerset
Lunatic
Asylum
.
He
was
living
14
,
Wadham
Street
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weston-super-Mare">
Weston-super-Mare
</ref>
.
Dr.
Hitchins
stated
that
Maclean
was
complaining
of
headaches
and
believed
that
all
the
people
in
England
are
against
him
,
and
he
felt
he
must
injure
someone
because
they
are
conspiring
to
deceive
him
.
He
had
also
sent
letters
to
his
sister
in
1880
,
Caroline
Maclean
,
stating
that
,
&quot;
If
I
cannot
commit
a
murder
one
way
,
I
will
another
way
,
and
all
can
add
is
,
if
there
is
more
difficulty
,
there
may
be
more
victims
.
&quot;
Multiple
doctors
also
testified
that
Maclean
was
insane
and
&quot;
did
not
believe
he
was
capable
of
appreciating
the
nature
or
quality
of
any
act
which
he
might
commit
.

Tried
for
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_treason">
high
treason
</ref>
on
20
April
,
the
Scotsman
was
found
&quot;
not
guilty
,
but
insane
&quot;
by
a
jury
after
five
minutes
'
deliberation
,
overseen
by
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Coleridge,_1st_Baron_Coleridge">
Lord
Chief
Justice
Coleridge

.
and
he
lived
out
his
remaining
days
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadmoor_Hospital">
Broadmoor
Asylum
</ref>
.
The
verdict
prompted
the
Queen
to
ask
for
a
change
in
English
law
so
that
those
implicated
in
cases
with
similar
outcomes
would
be
considered
as
&quot;
guilty
,
but
insane
&quot;
;
this
led
