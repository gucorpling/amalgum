Safety
Analysis
Framework
for
Complex
Electromechanical
Equipment
System
Based
on
STAMP
</head>
<p>
STAMP
treats
safety
as
a
control
problem
,
and
the
focus
of
system
safety
is
changed
from
preventing
failures
in
implementing
safety
constraints
.
It
still
contains
component
failures
,
but
it
extends
the
concept
of
accidental
causes
to
include
component
interactions
.
It
contains
three
main
concepts
:
safety
constraints
,
hierarchical
control
structures
,
and
process
models
.
The
most
basic
concept
in
STAMP
is
not
an
event
but
a
constraint
.
The
main
causes
of
safety
issues
in
the
new
theory
are
component
failures
,
system
external
disturbances
,
interactions
between
components
,
and
component
behaviors
that
lead
to
dangerous
system
states
.

Principles
of
STAMP
</head>
<p>
The
safety
of
a
complex
system
is
more
than
component
failure
or
reliability
decline
.
In
STAMP
,
safety
is
an
emergent
or
system
property
,
rather
than
a
component
property
.
In
system
theory
,
complex
systems
are
viewed
as
a
hierarchy
of
organizational
levels
.
A
hierarchical
multilevel
model
of
stakeholders
is
posited
in
STAMP
,
like
the
model
of
Rasmussen
,
but
more
expanded
.
Another
basic
concept
in
STAMP
is
safety
constraints
.
In
system
theory
,
safety
can
be
regarded
as
an
emergent
which
is
originated
from
interactions
between
components
.
The
method
of
controlling
the
emergent
is
to
impose
constraints
on
the
behavior
of
the
components
and
the
interactions
between
the
components
.
Meanwhile
,
due
to
the
constraint
property
of
hierarchical
structure
,
the
accidents
will
happen
if
the
higher
layers
cannot
provide
enough
constraints
or
the
lower
layers
violate
the
safety
constraints
when
the
high-level
constraints
control
the
behavior
of
the
lower
layers
.
With
the
development
of
the
equipment
toward
automation
and
intelligent
,
the
system
becomes
more
and
more
complex
,
and
the
difficulty
in
identifying
and
executing
safety
constraints
in
design
and
operation
has
been
increased
.
<figure>
Figure

</figure>
shows
a
general
socio-technical
system
control
structure
from
STAMP
,
which
does
not
represent
any
particular
system
.
Each
node
in
the
graph
is
a
human
or
machine
component
in
a
socio-technical
system
.
Connecting
lines
show
control
actions
used
to
enforce
safety
constraints
on
the
system
and
feedback
that
provides
information
to
the
controlling
entity
.
</p>
<p>
Besides
constraints
and
hierarchical
models
,
a
third
basic
concept
in
STAMP
is
that
of
process
models
.
The
process
model
is
an
important
part
of
the
control
theory
.
A
typical
process
model
consists
of
the
controller
that
issued
the
command
and
the
controlled
object
that
provided
the
feedback
(
controlled
process
)
,
which
is
shown
in
<figure>
Figure
4
</figure>
.
Usually
,
the
controller
contains
process
model
and
control
algorithm
.
When
the
controller
sends
a
command
to
controlled
process
,
the
corresponding
feedback
which
is
generated
by
controlled
process
will
be
sent
to
controller
to
form
a
complete
controlled
process
.
Component
interaction
accidents
can
often
be
interpreted
as
process
model
errors
.
When
the
controller
â€™s
process
model
does
not
match
the
controlled
system
or
the
controller
issues
an
unsafe
command
,
an
accident
will
also
happen
.

Based
on
three
basic
concepts
of
STAMP
,
the
basic
casual
factors
of
a
standard
control
loop
under
the
STAMP
framework

concluded

Comparison
between
FTA
,
FMECA
,
HAZOP
,
and
STAMP
</head>
<p>
Traditional
risk
analysis
theory
considers
hazards
as
the
result
of
the
action
of
a
series
of
events
.
The
considered
events
usually
involve
several
types
of
component
failures
or
human
errors
,
mainly
adopting
the
forward
sequence
method
(
such
as
failure
mode
and
impact
analysis
)
or
the
backward
sequence
method
(
Such
as
the
fault
tree
directly
describes
the
linear
relationship
between
the
failure
and
the
influencing
factors
and
is
suitable
for
analyzing
the
hazard
caused
by
the
failure
of
a
physical
component
or
a
simple
system
.
)
Three
hazard
analysis
techniques
are
suggested
in
the
functional
safety
standard
(
ISO26262
)
:
fault
tree
analysis
(
FTA
)
,
failure
modes
and
effects
analysis
(
FMEA
)
,
and
hazard
and
operability
(
HAZOP
)
analysis
.
Table

summaries
and
compares
three
general
hazard
analysis
techniques
with
STAMP
.
</p>
<p>
FTA
,
FMECA
,
and
HAZOP
are
proposed
before
the
1980s
in
which
industrial
automation
and
intelligence
are
still
not
highly
dependent
.
Only
giant
companies
and
some
research
institutes
like
the
nuclear
industry
,
aerospace
,
and
universities
have
enough
human
and
material
resources
to
carry
out
relevant
technology
research
.
Although
some
detail
can
be
found
by
these
three
methods
,
the
limitation
of
methods
shown
in
Table
2
is
clear
.
These
traditional
safety
analysis
methods
based
on
the
event
chain
model
are
unable
to
do
as
much
as
they
can
when
dealing
with
computer-oriented
automated
control
system
.
However
,
due
to
the
particularity
understanding
of
safety
in
STAMP
,
the
connotation
of
safety
has
been
substantially
improved
from
the
introduction
of
concepts
such
as
hierarchical
models
,
process
models
,
and
safety
constraints
.

System-Therotical
Process
Analysis
(
STPA
)
</head>
<p>
STPA
is
a
new
hazard
analysis
technique
based
on
system
safety
theory
.
According
to
the
above-mentioned
description
,
an
accident
is
defined
as
the
result
of
a
complex
process
in
which
the
system
behavior
goes
against
the
safety
constraints
.
The
main
steps
of
STPA
can
be
shown
as
follows
:
</p>
<p>
Step
1
:
Identify
improper
control
actions
of
the
system
that
may
cause
danger
,
</p>
<p>
Step
2
:
Determine
how
potential
hazard
controls
may
occur
in
step
1
.
