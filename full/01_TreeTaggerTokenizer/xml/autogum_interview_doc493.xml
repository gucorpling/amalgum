Food
deliveries
from
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National%20Union%20of%20Rail,%20Maritime%20and%20Transport%20Workers">
RMT
</ref>
were
allowed
into
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestas">
Vestas

plant
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport,%20England">

</ref>
,
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/England">

</ref>
yesterday
,
but
were
cut
off
by
Vestas
management
this
afternoon
.
</p>
<p>
Protesters
at
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle%20of%20Wight">
Isle
of
Wight
</ref>
factory
celebrated
the
delivery
of
supermarket
bags
filed
with
groceries
,
which
entered
with
a
police
escort
.
This
morning
,
the
sixteen
remaining
occupiers
were
told
to
prepare
a
list
of
items
for
future
deliveries
.
But
,
according
to
&quot;
Mark
&quot;
,
an
occupier
in
the
Vestas
plant
,
this
afternoon
Vestas
management
reversed
their
decision
,
terming
the
August
1
food
delivery
a
one-time
&quot;
goodwill
gesture
&quot;
and
saying
food
would
no
longer
be
allowed
in
.
The
food
delivery
followed
a
formal
complaint
by
the
RMT
that
denying
the
occupiers
food
was
a
violation
of
their
human
rights
.
The
people
inside
the
factory
have
been
conducting
their
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sit-in">
occupation
</ref>
since
July
20
,
in
protest
against
the
closure
of
the
factory
,
which
produces
wind
turbine
blades
for
the
generation
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wind%20power">
wind
power
</ref>
,
and
the
loss
of
625
jobs
in
the
Isle
of
Wight
and
nearby
areas
.
</p>
<p>
Mark
went
on
to
praise
the
&quot;
brave
people
&quot;
who
have
circumvented
the
security
ring
around
the
plant
in
order
to
get
food
and
other
items
to
the
occupiers
.
An
electric
kettle
thrown
at
the
end
of
a
rope
up
to
the
occupiers
is
said
to
be
working
well
.
Mark
also
noted
that
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louise%20Christian">
Louise
Christian
</ref>
,
a
prominent
British
human
rights
lawyer
,
is
now
representing
the
Vestas
occupiers
.
</p>
<p>
While
the
number
of
occupiers
at
the
Vestas
plant
—
originally
nearly
thirty
,
now
only
sixteen
—
have
dwindled
,
Mark
says
the
ones
who
remain
are
&quot;
very
determined
&quot;
and
furthermore
hold
no
ill
will
toward
their
co-workers
who
have
left
the
occupation
.
In
particular
,
the
occupiers
offered
sympathy
for
Luke
Paxton
,
who
they
say
left
the
occupation
due
to
a
combination
of
personal
issues
and
malnutrition
brought
on
by
the
deprivation
of
food
.
Paxton
,
Mark
said
,
has
the
remaining
occupiers
'
&quot;
full
support
&quot;
and
continues
to
campaign
for
the
Vestas
workers
.
</p>
<p>
Mark
also
clarified
the
origins
of
the
occupation
.
In
contrast
to
claims
that
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green%20socialism">
green
socialist
</ref>
group
Workers
'
Climate
Action
were
behind
the
occupation
,
Mark
presented
a
more
nuanced
picture
:
the
Vestas
workers
'
initial
contacts
were
with
veterans
of
the
occupation
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visteon">
Visteon
</ref>
'
s
auto
parts
plants
,
with
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance%20for%20Workers'%20Liberty">
AWL
</ref>
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist%20Workers%20Party%20(Britain)">
SWP
</ref>
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist%20Party%20(England%20and%20Wales)">
Socialist
Party
</ref>
becoming
involved
later
with
&quot;
quite
a
big
involvement
&quot;
from
all
groups
.
Members
of
Workers
'
Climate
Action
attended
Vestas
workers
'
meetings
and
gave
their
opinions
,
but
,
Mark
says
,
a
committee
organised
by
the
workers
and
composed
of
workers
was
making
all
the
decisions
.
</p>
<hi rend="bold">
We
have
Polish
workers
with
us
.
They
're
our
friends
.
</hi>
<p>
Mark
also
strongly
rejected
the
support
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidarity%20 – %20The%20Union%20for%20British%20Workers">
Solidarity
</ref>
,
a
&quot;
nationalist
trade
union
&quot;
closely
associated
with
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British%20National%20Party">
BNP
</ref>
.
In
a
July
24
statement
,
Solidarity
backed
the
Vestas
workers
,
with
union
executive
member
David
Kerr
saying
&quot;
We
are
behind
the
Vestas
workers
100
per
cent
.
British
jobs
must
be
protected
.
&quot;
Mark
,
in
reply
,
told
<hi rend="italic">
Wikinews
</hi>
:
&quot;
We
do
not
want
their
support
...
they
go
against
a
lot
of
the
things
people
believe
in
here
.
We
have
Polish
workers
with
us
.
They
're
our
friends
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Most
of
the
Vestas
occupiers
remain
independent
of
trade
unions
,
with
only
three
of
the
sixteen
people
inside
being
members
of
any
union
.
</p>
<p>
Mark
closed
with
a
message
of
solidarity
with
the
occupiers
of
two

,
whose
employees
began
a
sit-in
at
their
offices
on
Friday
after
the
announcement
of
surprise
closures
.
&quot;
We
fully
support
what
you
're
doing

Do
n't
back
down
...
do
not
be
pushed
around
,
do
not
be
intimidated
&quot;
.
</p>
<p>
The
Vestas
occupiers
have
also
exchanged
messages
of
solidarity
with
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SsangYong%20Motor%20Company">

</ref>
in

.
Workers
at
SsangYong
have
been
occupying
their
factory
since
May
22
in
protest
against
a
36
%
cut
in
employees
there
.
</p>
<p>
The
occupation
continues
accompanied
by
a
warning
of
increased
union
unrest
in
Britain
.
Neil
O'Brien
of

<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy%20Exchange">

told
<hi rend="italic">
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily%20Telegraph">
The
Daily
Telegraph
</ref>
</hi>
that
,
while
labour
unrest
had
increased
,
the
current
state
of
affairs
is
&quot;
nothing
compared
to
what
is
going
to
happen
once
the
brakes
are
slammed
on
public
spending
