'
s
capital
.
With
more
than
700,000
inhabitants
,
and
1.6
million
in
the
metropolitan
area
,
it
is
Spain
's
fourth
city
,
dominating
southern
Spain
.
With
heritage
from
the
Arabs
and
from
the
Age
of
Discovery
,
as
well
as
the
<hi rend="italic">
flamenco
</hi>
scene
,
Seville
is
a
diverse
destination
.
</p>
<head>
Understand

<p>
The
smooth
,
slow
Guadalquivir
River
flows
through
Seville
,
known
as
<hi rend="italic">
Betis
</hi>
by
the
Romans
and
as
<hi rend="italic">
Betik
Wahd-Al-Khabir
</hi>
by
the
Arabs
.
Since
it
is
hard
to
navigate
upstream
from
Seville
,
the
cereal-producing
region
starts
here
,
and
Seville
has
been
a
busy
port
from
Roman
times
,
under
Muslim
rule
,
and
exploding
during
the
Age
of
Discovery
.
As
the
monopoly
was
broken
and
<ref target="C%C3%A1diz">
Cádiz
</ref>
largely
took
Seville
's
place
,
the
city
entered
a
period
of
relative
decline
.
</p>
<p>
In
the
19th
century
Seville
gained
a
reputation
for
its
architecture
and
culture
and
was
a
stop
along
the
Romantic
&quot;
<ref target="Grand%20Tour">
Grand
Tour
</ref>
&quot;
of
Europe
.
Seville
has
built
on
its
tourism
industry
since
,
playing
host
to
the
International
Exposition
in
1992
,
which
spurred
the
construction
of
a
new
airport
,
a
new
train
station
,
a
bullet
train
link
to
Madrid
,
new
bridges
and
improvements
to
the
main
boulevards
.
Tourist
facilities
are
top-notch
and
the
city
is
buzzing
with
festivals
,
color
and
a
thriving
nightlife
scene
.

Sevilla
International

</hi>
(

is
about
25
minutes
drive
from

<p>
A

service
<ref target="http://www.tussam.es/index.php%3Fid%3D432">

hall
during
most
of
the
day
(
though
with
longer
gaps
from
13:00
-
16:00
)
and
costs
€

Taxis
are
always
available
next

,

the
day
and
€
25
after
22:00
and
on
weekends/holidays
.
Much
controversy
has
been
stirred
by
some
taxi
drivers
trying
to
overcharge
tourists
,
so
be
careful
to
pay
no
more
than
this
if
you
are
traveling
into
the
city
.
Other
destinations
outside
Seville
obviously
cost
more
and
are
metered
.
Tips
are
<hi rend="italic">
not
</hi>
necessary
,
though
€
1
-
2
for
polite
,
helpful
service
is
appreciated
.
Speed
limits
seem
to
be
considered
as
kind
of
minimum
speed
by
most
taxi
drivers
.

This

nearby
city

and
is
used
by
discount
airlines
such
as
Ryanair
(
from

)
.
The
communication
between
Jerez

is
good
,
as
it
is
connected
by
bus

train
.
It

also
possible
to
go
by
taxi

On

Completed
in

Has

<p>
Driving
is
also
always
an
option
for
long
distance
travel
in
Spain
,
but
is
n't
as
convenient
or
as
useful
once
in
town
.
Public
transportation
works
fine
in
the
city
,
and
most
of
the
main
tourist
points
are
located
in
a
walk
distance
,
so
it
is
recommended
finding
a
lodging
with
a
garage
or
else
researching
the
area
for
parking
places
before
the
trip
.
</p>
<p>
Driving
in
the
old
city
is
tricky
but
possible
.
There
is
a
45-minute
limit
on
cars
entering
the
old
city
M
-
Sa
08:00
and
22:00
.
It
is
enforced
by
license
plate
scanners
placed
at
entrances
to
the
old
city
.
There
is
a
€
200
fine
for
exceeding
this
limit
.
Your
rental
company
will
be
sure
to
tack
on
its
€
50
processing
charge
,
not
to
mention
the
late
fees
that
will
accumulate
due
to
the
time
it
till
take
to
receive
the
citation
in
your
home
country
.
</p>
<p>
There
is
very
cheap
parking
available
across
the
street
from
Av.
de
Málaga
,
12
.
The
lot
is
unguarded
and
if
there
is
not
agent
in
the
booth
then
the
entrance
to
the
lot
is
free
of
charge
.
Do
not
give
money
to
the
panhandlers
loitering
outside
pretending
they
are
lot
attendants
.
If
they
have
not
receipt
to
give
you
then
it
s
a
scam
.
Be
sure
leave
absolutely
nothing
in
the
car
.
Seville
in
general
is
known
for
car
break-ins
.
</p>
<p>
Another
very
common
option
is
using
carpooling
such
as
BlaBlaCar
,
a
safe
transportation
method
used
by
many
locals
.
</p>
<head>
By
bus
</head>
<p>
The
Spanish
bus
service
is
amazingly
punctual
and
comfortable
with
most
having
air-con
and
a
toilet
.
Getting
to
Seville
from
other
cities
in
Spain
can
sometimes
be
only
minimally
longer
than
train
(
but
much
cheaper
)
.
Check
out
your
options
first
with
the
helpful
Information
desk
you
will
find
inside
any
terminal
.
The
buses
run
regularly
to/from
most
major
cities
,
departing
either
from
the
near
the
river
,
or
the
near
the
University/Santa
Cruz
.
Sometimes
the
queue
for
buying
ticket
from
the
ticket
office
on
a
busy
day
might
take
up
to
20
minutes
or
more
.
