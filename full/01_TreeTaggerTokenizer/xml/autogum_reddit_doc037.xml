After
watching
the
A&amp;E
special
I
'm
honestly
considering
turning
in
a
Disassociation
letter
.
</head>
<sp who="#Teal2289">
<p>
I
'm
very
torn
to
play
by
their
rules
and
'
disassociate
'
or
not
.
As
much
as
it
would
hurt
me
to
do
so
,
I
feel
like
it
would
make
a
stand
out
point
to
my
family
that
would
hopefully
make
more
of
them
question
things
.
<hi rend="bold">
Pretty
long
post
incoming
,
sorry
about
that
.
Just
needed
somewhere
to
put
my
thoughts
in
writing
.
</hi>
Most
of
my
family
,
and
extended
family
due
to
my
PIMI
pioneer
wife
,
know
that
I
have
stopped
attending
meetings
and
no
longer
participate
in
service
.
However
,
most
of
them
have
continued
to
'
associate
'
with
me
.
They
all
know
i
'm
a
stand
out
individual
that
takes
care
of
my
family
and
friends
alike
and
am
not
a
'
sinner
'
by
typical
standards
.
Before
my
transitioning
to
POMO
I
was
considered
exemplary
in
nearly
all
ways
.
Good
service
time
,
never
missed
meetings
,
even
talked
some
smack
on
the
'
spiritually
weak
'
and
made
sure
to
myself
and
my
family
were
all
exemplary
individuals
.
Since
unofficially
'
quitting
'
the
organization
a
few
of
them
have
tried
asking
me
what
it
is
that
made
me
want
to
leave
.
The
only
thing
holding
me
back
is
losing
all
of
my
family
and
close
friends
(
'
Only
thing
'
...
.
makes
it
sound
like
something
small
)
.
I
'm
trying
to
weigh
the
pro
's
and
con
's
of
if
I
am
in
a
better
situation
by
white
knuckling
through
all
the
JW
talk
around
me
from
my
family
,
or
just
publicly
stating
my
position
via
DA
and
letting
them
make
a
choice
in
regards
to
how
our
relationship
will
turn
out
after
.
Being
married
to
a
PIMI
pioneer
has
been
challenging
.
My
wife
and
I
have
very
different
takes
on
life
in
general
now
.
We
have
virtually
no
common
ground
in
regards
to
priorities
,
interests
,
and
day
to
day
activities
.
Most
days
I
feel
she
is
n't
even
happy
being
stuck
in
a
relationship
with
me
.
She
wants
kids
,
as
do
I
,
however
I
do
not
want
to
have
kids
that
she
would
fight
to
raise
a
JW
so
I
continually
tell
her
that
I
do
not
want
kids
.
My
wife
also
suffers
from
a
form
of
PTSD
(
surprise
surprise
)
as
a
result
of
her
upbringing
and
some
abuse
that
happened
to
her
(
yet
again
,
no
surprise
)
that
causes
her
to
have
extreme
anxiety
.
Each
day
is
a
challenge
due
to
the
fact
that
it
often
feels
like
I
am
married
to
a
adult
whom
is
mentally
trapped
with
a
kids
mind
whom
I
need
to
take
care
of
.
I
want
the
freedom
that
a
DA
letter
would
provide
,
but
I
struggle
with
losing
my
friends
and
family
.
I
'll
turn
30
this
year
which
means
I
have
plenty
of
time
to
turn
my
life
around
for
the
better
.
Going
POMO
was
already
the
best
choice
I
've
made
in
life
.
Time
to
buckle
down
and
make
another
choice
.

Edit

:
Further
thoughts
thanks
to
some
of
you
wonderful
peoples
comments
:
I
want
to
be
happy
.
I
want
my
wife
to
be
happy
,
even
if
that
means
her
not
being
with
me
.
After
all
,
would
you
want
to
be
shackled
to
someone
who
is
just
going
through
the
motions
of
professing
love
,
when
internally
they
truly
want
something
different
?
I
feel
it
would
be
better
to
set
both
persons
free
.
Unfortunately
that
choice
would
be
up
to
me
as
a
PIMI
JW
views
divorce
as
a
sin
.
So
due
to
that
it
would
be
my
sacrifice
to
make
.
By
being
awake
,
the
key
to
that
shackle
is
in
my
hands
,
and
it
is
my
choice
to
make
.
And
as
difficult
as
it
may
be
to
make
that
choice
if
it
were
to
come
to
it
,
if
both
myself
and
my
wife
are
happier
in
the
long
run
by
living
separate
lives
,
then
it
may
be
for
the
best
.
If
that
is
the
case
I
end
up
making
,
I
would
DA
before
divorcing
so
that
at
least
I
can
leave
on
my
terms
,
and
not
theirs
by
DF'ing
me
for
getting
a
divorce
.

I
’m
in
the
same
place
.
While
I
am
clearly
and
openly
at
odds
with
the
teachings
I
have
n’t
cut
the
final
cord
because
my
parents
watch
my
kids
.
But
I
can
say
that
my
youngest
starts
Kindergarten
this
year
and
I
am
getting
a
pretty
big
promotion
.
As
soon
as
I
can
afford
before
after
care
or
a
Nanny
for
after
school
I
’m
doing
it
.
I
need
to
feel
and
know
that
part
of
my
life
is
behind
me
.
But
I
will
loose
almost
all
of
my
family
.
It
’s
hard
.
