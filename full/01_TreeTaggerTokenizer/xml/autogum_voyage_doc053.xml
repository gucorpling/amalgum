<p>
Many
people
combine
the
Kuranda
Scenic
railway
and
the
skyrail
,
travelling
to
Kuranda
on
one
and
returning
on
the
other
.
From
the
scenery
point
of
view
,
take
the
railway
first
in
the
morning
and
after
that
make
the
Skyrail
trip
-
take
your
time
to
stop
and
look
around
in
the
<ref target="http://www.rainforest.com.au">
Rainforestation
</ref>
on
the
way
back
to
the
coast
.
After
arriving
at
the
coast
side
(
great
views
)
,
you
have
the
opportunity
to
visit
the
Tjapukai
village
to
learn
something
about
the
Aboriginal
culture
.
You
can
book
both
directions
through
either
service
,
but
if
you
are
booking
late
,
you
may
have
to
book
separately
as
they
allocate
each
other
a
limited
number
of
seats
.
</p>
<p>
Combining
the
two
is
more
expensive
,
both
in
terms
of
time
and
money
.
They
both
offer
significant
discounts
for
taking
their
service
both
ways
,
and
only
small
discounts
for
combining
the
two
.
In
addition
getting
from
the
Skyrail
base
station
back
to
Cairns
station
is
another
logistical
hassle
,
or
additional
cost
if
you
pay
for
the
transfers
.
</p>
<p>
If
you
want
to
do
the
round
trip
with
the
Skyrail
and
the
train
and
do
n't
feel
like
coordinating
with
local
buses
,
there
are
a
number
of
tour
companies
that
package
that
journey
for
you
,
including
tickets
and
transfers
.
</p>
<p>
If
you
are
travelling
up
to
Kuranda
with
luggage
,
bear
in
mind
that
neither
the
Skyrail
nor
the
railway
cater
for
large
amounts
of
luggage
.
The
Skyrail
will
not
carry
any
luggage
at
all
,
and
the
amount
is
strictly
limited
to
what
will
fit
in
the
luggage
space
in
the
passenger
compartment
on
the
train
.
There
is
no
problem
with
prams
and
daypacks
,
but
neither
of
these
methods
of
transport
may
be
suitable
if
you
are
doing
more
than
a
day
trip
to
Kuranda
.

Get

<p>
Kuranda
is
a
small
village
,
although
somewhat
hilly
.
Walking
about
1km
will
take
you
from
one
end
of
town
to
the
other
.
Do
n't
count
on
being
able
to
walk
quickly
,
as
the
streets
tend
to
be
packed
with
people
.
