Introduction

<p>
Recent
advances
in
car
design
have
been
driven
,
in
part
,
by
the
dynamic
development
of
electric
drives
.
The
most
promising
advance
in
this
respect
seems
to
be
the
permanent
magnet
synchronous
motor
(
PMSM
)
due
to
its
low
weight
,
small
size
,
high
efficiency
,
and
high
torque
.
Electric
motors
with
permanent
magnets
NdFeB
simplify
the
motor
structure
.
The
motor
stator
is
usually
similar
to
the
stator
of
induction
motors
and
the
rotor
contains
permanent
magnets
.
The
magnets
and
the
armature
winding
are
positioned
so
that
the
electromotive
force
(
EMF
)
generated
as
a
result
of
rotation
is
sinusoidal
.
A
characteristic
feature
of
PMSM
motors
is
a
wide
range
of
speed
control
.
Permanent
magnet
motors
lack
commutators
,
so
the
weight
of
the
drive
design
is
significantly
transferred
toward
the
electronic
control
of
the
electric
motor
.
Motors
with
permanent
magnets
demonstrate
high
efficiency
,
high
torque
,
and
low
weight
,
all
of
which
are
highly
important
for
vehicle
design
.

In
order
to
obtain
a
smooth
regulation
of
the
rotational
speed
of
the
drive
system
with
a
PMSM
,
the
angle
of
the
motor
shaft
must
be
measured
correctly
.
Errors
in
the
measurement
of
the
shaft
angle
cause
unstable
operation
of
the
motor
,
jerking
,
or
excessive
current
consumption
,
which
can
even
damage
the
PMSM
.
Therefore
,
it
is
very
important
that
the
position
measured
by
the
encoder
is
correct
.
Unfortunately
,
the
encoder
works
in
conditions
of
strong
interference
,
which
means
the
central
unit
must
check
and
correct
the
measured
position
by
the
encoder
at
all
times
.
This
allows
for
smooth
speed
control
and
stable
operation
of
the
PMSM
.
Detection
of
information
loss
error
for
the
incremental
encoder
was
presented
in
.
There
are
also
methods
of
sensor
less
control
of
the
PMSM
,
but
due
to
the
high
precision
of
the
control
,
the
article
focused
on
the
control
system
using
an
absolute
encoder
.
In
conventional
position
sensorless
permanent
magnet
(
PM
)
machine
drives
,
the
rotor
position
is
obtained
from
the
phase-locked
loop
(
PLL
)
with
the
regulation
of
spatial
signal
in
estimated
back
electromotive
force
(
EMF
)
voltages
.
Due
to
the
sinusoidal
distribution
of
back-EMF
voltages
,
a
small-signal
approximation
is
assumed
in
the
PLL
in
order
to
estimate
the
position
.
In
the
sensorless
control
method
,
the
stator
current
is
measured
to
estimate
the
speed
of
the
motor
.
When
the
PMSM
sensorless
control
is
used
in
an
electric
vehicle
,
it
sometimes
causes
another
problem
.
When
the
motor
is
running
in
steady
state
and
is
suddenly
given
a
large
load
that
has
reverse
torque
direction
,
a
problem
will
arise
.
Therefore
,
an
original
method
was
proposed
that
obtained
good
results
when
the
PMSM
is
operating
in
such
adverse
conditions
.
