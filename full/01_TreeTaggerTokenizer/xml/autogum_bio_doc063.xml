In
late

artist
Ken

created
an
18
foot
tall
wooden
fork
sculpture
,
painted
to
look
like
metal
,
and
installed
it
in
Pasadena
,
California
where
Pasadena
Avenue
and
St.
Johns
Avenue
fork
in
honor
of
Bob
Stane
's
75th
birthday
.
Because
the
fork
was
installed
illegally
it
was
taken
down
on
June
10
,
2010
.
After
proper
permits
were
obtained
,
the
city
returned
the
fork
sculpture
on
October
21
,
2011
.
This
time
it
was
set
back
a
bit
more
on
the
island
in
order
to
give
room
for
people
to
get
out
and
take
pictures
.
A
ceremony
was
held
at
the
time
the
fork
was
re-installed
.
