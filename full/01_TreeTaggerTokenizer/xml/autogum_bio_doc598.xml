Bonet
de
Lattes
</hi>
was
a
Jewish
physician
and
astrologer
.
He
is
known
chiefly
as
the
inventor
of
an
astronomical
ring-dial
by
means
of
which
solar
and
stellar
altitudes
can
be
measured
and
the
time
determined
with
great
precision
by
night
as
well
as
by
day
.
He
lived
in
the
latter
part
of
the
fifteenth
century
and
the
beginning
of
the
sixteenth
.

<p>
Originally
from
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provence">
Provence
</ref>
,
and
belonging
to
a
family
that
had
its
origin
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattes,_Hérault">
Lattes
</ref>
near
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montpellier">
Montpellier
</ref>
,
he
was
forced
to
leave
Provence
when
the
Jews
were
expelled
from
that
land
and
settled
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpentras">
Carpentras
</ref>
.
From
there
,
he
went
to
Rome
,
where
he
became
physician
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Alexander_VI">
Pope

,
and
later
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Leo_X">
Pope

</ref>
.
</p>
<p>
At
this
time
he
became
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbi">
rabbi
</ref>
of
the
Jewish
community
,
to
which
he
was
able
to
render
much
assistance
.
He
married
the
daughter
of
the
physician

</p>
<p>
Bonet
described
the
use
of
his
instrument
in
a
treatise
written
in
Carpentras
,
the
full
title
of
which
is
:

,
and
was
dedicated
to
Pope
Alexander

.
At
the
end
,
Bonet
craves
pardon
for
his
bad
Latin
,
on
the
score
of
being
a
Hebrew
.
The
treatise
was
republished

Editions
were
also

.
Two
editions
appeared
later
at

,
in

and

.
In
bad
Latin
,
Bonet
wrote
a
treatise
entitled
<hi rend="italic">
Prognosticum
,
</hi>
published
at
Rome
in
1498
,
and
dedicated

A

,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bovillus">
Charles
Bovillus
</ref>
(
1470
–
1553
)
,
relates
in
the
preface
to
his
<hi rend="italic">
Dialogi
de
Trinitate
</hi>
that
he
met
Bonet
de
Lates
in
the
Roman
ghetto
in
1507
,
and
went
to
his
house
in
order
to
see
the
ring
that
he
had
invented
.
The
top
part
of
the
house
was
a
synagogue
containing
the
ark
,
hidden
by
a
curtain
,
and
books
,
lamps
,
and
praying-scarfs
.
Here
,
also
,
Bonet
's
thirty-two-year-old
son
was
discovered
deeply
immersed
in
the
study
of
philosophy
.
Toward
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
,
in
dredging
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Tiber">
River
Tiber
</ref>
,
a
long
marble
slab
was
found
with
an
inscription
,
which
had
probably
been
affixed
to
this
house
of
Bonet
's
.
Bovillus
refers
,
also
,
to
a
lengthy
theological
argument
that
he
had
with
Bonet
,
and
he
seems
to
imply
that
the
son
was
in
the
end
convinced
of
the
truth
of
the
Christian
faith
.
</p>
<p>
It
is
evidence
of
the
position
held
by
Bonet
at
the
papal
court
that
on
13
October
1513
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuchlin">
Reuchlin
</ref>
begged
him
to
use
his
influence
in
order
that
the
examination
of
the
<hi rend="italic">
Augenspiegel
</hi>
should
not
be
given
into
the
hands
of
a
commission
made
up
of
strangers
,
at
all
events
not
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Order">
Dominicans
</ref>
.
Further
,
Bonet
's
intercession
seems
to
have
been
successful
.
</p>
<p>
Bonet
is
known
to
have
had
two
sons
.
One
,
Joseph
,
continued
to
remain
in
the
papal
favor
;
the
other
,
Immanuel
,
was
also
in
the
service
of
the
pope
,
from
whom
he
received
a
regular
salary
.
