THE
MILLENNIUM
FULCRUM
EDITION
,
1988
</head>
<p>
A
man
stood
upon
a
railroad
bridge
in
northern
Alabama
,
looking
down
into
the
swift
water
twenty
feet
below
.
The
man
's
hands
were
behind
his
back
,
the
wrists
bound
with
a
cord
.
A
rope
closely
encircled
his
neck
.
It
was
attached
to
a
stout
cross-timber
above
his
head
and
the
slack
fell
to
the
level
of
his
knees
.
Some
loose
boards
laid
upon
the
ties
supporting
the
rails
of
the
railway
supplied
a
footing
for
him
and
his
executioners
--
two
private
soldiers
of
the
Federal
army
,
directed
by
a
sergeant
who
in
civil
life
may
have
been
a
deputy
sheriff
.
At
a
short
remove
upon
the
same
temporary
platform
was
an
officer
in
the
uniform
of
his
rank
,
armed
.
He
was
a
captain
.
A
sentinel
at
each
end
of
the
bridge
stood
with
his
rifle
in
the
position
known
as
&quot;
support
,
&quot;
that
is
to
say
,
vertical
in
front
of
the
left
shoulder
,
the
hammer
resting
on
the
forearm
thrown
straight
across
the
chest
--
a
formal
and
unnatural
position
,
enforcing
an
erect
carriage
of
the
body
.
It
did
not
appear
to
be
the
duty
of
these
two
men
to
know
what
was
occurring
at
the
center
of
the
bridge
;
they
merely
blockaded
the
two
ends
of
the
foot
planking
that
traversed
it
.
</p>
<p>
Beyond
one
of
the
sentinels
nobody
was
in
sight
;
the
railroad
ran
straight
away
into
a
forest
for
a
hundred
yards
,
then
,
curving
,
was
lost
to
view
.
Doubtless
there
was
an
outpost
farther
along
.
The
other
bank
of
the
stream
was
open
ground
--
a
gentle
slope
topped
with
a
stockade
of
vertical
tree
trunks
,
loopholed
for
rifles
,
with
a
single
embrasure
through
which
protruded
the
muzzle
of
a
brass
cannon
commanding
the
bridge
.
Midway
up
the
slope
between
the
bridge
and
fort
were
the
spectators
--
a
single
company
of
infantry
in
line
,
at
&quot;
parade
rest
,
&quot;
the
butts
of
their
rifles
on
the
ground
,
the
barrels
inclining
slightly
backward
against
the
right
shoulder
,
the
hands
crossed
upon
the
stock
.
A
lieutenant
stood
at
the
right
of
the
line
,
the
point
of
his
sword
upon
the
ground
,
his
left
hand
resting
upon
his
right
.
Excepting
the
group
of
four
at
the
center
of
the
bridge
,
not
a
man
moved
.
The
company
faced
the
bridge
,
staring
stonily
,
motionless
.
The
sentinels
,
facing
the
banks
of
the
stream
,
might
have
been
statues
to
adorn
the
bridge
.
The
captain
stood
with
folded
arms
,
silent
,
observing
the
work
of
his
subordinates
,
but
making
no
sign
.
Death
is
a
dignitary
who
when
he
comes
announced
is
to
be
received
with
formal
manifestations
of
respect
,
even
by
those
most
familiar
with
him
.
In
the
code
of
military
etiquette
silence
and
fixity
are
forms
of
deference
.
</p>
<p>
The
man
who
was
engaged
in
being
hanged
was
apparently
about
thirty-five
years
of
age
.
He
was
a
civilian
,
if
one
might
judge
from
his
habit
,
which
was
that
of
a
planter
.
His
features
were
good
--
a
straight
nose
,
firm
mouth
,
broad
forehead
,
from
which
his
long
,
dark
hair
was
combed
straight
back
,
falling
behind
his
ears
to
the
collar
of
his
well
fitting
frock
coat
.
He
wore
a
moustache
and
pointed
beard
,
but
no
whiskers
;
his
eyes
were
large
and
dark
gray
,
and
had
a
kindly
expression
which
one
would
hardly
have
expected
in
one
whose
neck
was
in
the
hemp
.
Evidently
this
was
no
vulgar
assassin
.
The
liberal
military
code
makes
provision
for
hanging
many
kinds
of
persons
,
and
gentlemen
are
not
excluded
.
</p>
<p>
The
preparations
being
complete
,
the
two
private
soldiers
stepped
aside
and
each
drew
away
the
plank
upon
which
he
had
been
standing
.
The
sergeant
turned
to
the
captain
,
saluted
and
placed
himself
immediately
behind
that
officer
,
who
in
turn
moved
apart
one
pace
.
These
movements
left
the
condemned
man
and
the
sergeant
standing
on
the
two
ends
of
the
same
plank
,
which
spanned
three
of
the
cross-ties
of
the
bridge
.
The
end
upon
which
the
civilian
stood
almost
,
but
not
quite
,
reached
a
fourth
.
This
plank
had
been
held
in
place
by
the
weight
of
the
captain
;
it
was
now
held
by
that
of
the
sergeant
.
At
a
signal
from
the
former
the
latter
would
step
aside
,
the
plank
would
tilt
and
the
condemned
man
go
down
between
two
ties
.
The
arrangement
commended
itself
to
his
judgement
as
simple
and
effective
.
His
face
had
not
been
covered
nor
his
eyes
bandaged
.
He
looked
a
moment
at
his
&quot;
unsteadfast
footing
,
&quot;
then
let
his
gaze
wander
to
the
swirling
water
of
the
stream
racing
madly
beneath
his
feet
.
A
piece
of
dancing
driftwood
caught
his
attention
and
his
eyes
followed
it
down
the
current
.
How
slowly
it
appeared
to
move
!
What
a
sluggish
stream
!
</p>
<p>
He
closed
his
eyes
in
order
to
fix
his
last
thoughts
upon
his
wife
and
children
.
The
water
,
touched
to
gold
by
the
early
sun
,
the
brooding
mists
under
the
banks
at
some
distance
down
the
stream
,
the
fort
,
the
soldiers
,
the
piece
of
drift
--
all
had
distracted
him
.
And
now
he
became
conscious
of
a
new
disturbance
.
Striking
through
the
thought
of
his
dear
ones
was
sound
which
he
could
neither
ignore
nor
understand
,
a
sharp
,
distinct
,
metallic
percussion
like
the
stroke
of
a
blacksmith
's
hammer
upon
the
anvil
;
it
had
the
same
ringing
quality
.
He
wondered
what
it
was
,
and
whether
immeasurably
distant
or
near
by
--
it
seemed
both
.
Its
recurrence
was
regular
,
but
as
slow
as
the
tolling
of
a
death
knell
.
He
awaited
each
new
stroke
with
impatience
and
--
he
knew
not
why
--
apprehension
.
The
intervals
of
silence
grew
progressively
longer
;
the
delays
became
maddening
.
With
their
greater
infrequency
the
sounds
increased
in
strength
and
sharpness
.
They
hurt
his
ear
like
the
thrust
of
a
knife
;
he
feared
he
would
shriek
.
What
he
heard
was
the
ticking
of
his
watch
.
