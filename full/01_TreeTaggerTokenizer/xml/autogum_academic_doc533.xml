Introduction
</head>
<p>
The
energy
efficiency
of
buildings
is
the
foremost
characteristic
of
a
sustainable
built
environment
,
and
one
that
can
also
affect
the
thermal
comfort
of
users
.
In
order
to
improve
buildings
in
this
respect
,
various
analyses
can
be
carried
out
.
The
importance
of
the
analyses
is
particularly
evident
in
the
introduction
of
new
technologies
that
need
to
be
evaluated
for
their
general
performance
and
energy
efficiency
in
different
integration
concepts
.
Such
technical
assessments
can
be
achieved
by
performing
different
kinds
of
tests
and
measurements
.
The
latter
are
particularly
successful
when
combined
with
real-case
demonstrations
.
On
the
other
hand
,
modeling
by
means
of
various
mathematical
tools
is
also
a
powerful
technique
for
evaluating
the
impact
of
new
technologies
on
thermal
comfort
and
energy
use
.
However
,
the
most
effective
method
is
certainly
to
combine
the
two
approaches
in
a
so-called
empirical
validation
,
since
this
enables
the
calibration
of
the
model
and
the
validation
procedure
,
and
consequently
enables
improvements
in
technology
and
design
.
</p>
<p>
Building
analyses
are
often
implemented
through
dynamic
simulation
programs
that
model
parts
or
all
of
a
building
.
However
,
creating
a
reliable
simulation
model
equipped
with
relevant
data
is
essential
for
the
results
.
Additionally
,
occupants
’
activities
and
other
events
can
influence
the
indoor
temperature
,
and
thus
can
have
an
important
influence
on
the
operation
of
heating
and
cooling
systems
and
consequently
the
energy
use
.
Actually
,
one
of
the
most
relevant
gaps
that
was
identified
by
researchers
was
the
difference
between
the
real
energy
performance
in
a
building
and
the
performance
predicted
at
the
design
stage
,
which
is
mainly
due
to
occupant
behavior
.
But
,
what
levels
of
frequency
,
intensity
and
duration
for
such
events
are
crucial
for
the
system
,
and
should
they
be
included
in
the
model
?
While
it
is
clear
that
none
of
these
events
can
be
predicted
with
great
accuracy
,
some
of
them
can
be
among
the
causes
of
the
huge
discrepancy
between
the
predicted
and
the
real
energy
use
in
buildings
.
</p>
<p>
One
of
the
powerful
tools
for
performing
dynamic
simulations
is
TRNSYS
,
which
is
a
commonly
used
software
for
analyzing
the
energy
efficiency
and
thermal
comfort
of
large
models
,
e.
g.
,
buildings
or
building
elements
under
unsteady-state
conditions
.
The
program
can
also
be
used
for
dynamic
simulations
of
buildings
equipped
with
radiant
systems
.
In
a
few
older
studies
involving
TRNSYS
computer
simulations
of
a
typical
office
floor
equipped
with
a
radiant
cooling
system
,
it
has
already
been
established
that
occupant
behavior
can
have
an
important
influence
on
the
cooling
needs
and
the
thermal
comfort
.
Similar
conclusions
have
been
made
in
investigations
of
the
possible
influence
of
occupant
behavior
on
a
building
’s
performance
and
the
thermal
comfort
in
conventionally
heated
buildings
:
compared
to
the
design
strategy
used
in
the
model
,
the
measured
energy
demand
can
be
twice
as
high
and
the
thermal
comfort
much
lower
.
By
means
of
simulations
on
the
model
,
which
was
calibrated
using
measured
in-situ
data
,
Tian
demonstrated
that
certain
limitations
of
the
measured
data
can
contribute
significantly
to
the
observed
discrepancies
between
the
measured
and
simulated
results
.
In
a
case
study
,
research
on
the
German
net-zero-energy-building
Ascione
demonstrated
a
performance
gap
between
the
expected
and
the
measured
electrical
energy
performance
,
especially
for
heating
,
lighting
,
ventilation
,
auxiliaries
and
equipment
.
According
to
his
research
,
the
reasons
for
that
are
related
to
the
pattern
of
use
of
the
buildings
and
to
the
occupants
’
behaviors
.
In
fact
,
a
much
higher
energy
demand
,
2.7
times
the
expected
request
,
has
been
found
for
heating
(
including
DHW
production
,
which
has
a
very
low
impact
)
,
while
those
for
ventilation
,
lighting
and
equipment
are
much
lower
,
about
−36
%
,
−33
%
and
−14
%
.
According
to
D’Oca
,
energy-usage
simulations
in
models
of
dwellings
in
which
the
occupants
’
window
opening
and
heating
set-point
adjustments
are
set
by
probabilistic
functions
(
inferred
from
field
measurements
)
,
were
up
to
61
%
higher
than
when
the
control
system
was
simulated
in
a
deterministic
way
using
fixed
schedules
.
