Build
a
Better
Reputation
Online
</head>
<p>
When
we
want
to
learn
more
about
another
person
,
the
first
place
we
turn
is
to
Google
.
Every
day
,
over
100
million
names
are
searched
on
Google
.
Did
you
know
most
HR
professionals
and
recruiters
are
required
to
Google
potential
employees
during
the
hiring
decision
process
?
If
you
want
to
improve
your
reputation
online
in
order
to
build
a
personal
&quot;
brand
&quot;
,
start
with
step
one
,
below
.

Steps
</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Secure
a
website
with
yourname.com
.
Your
domain
name
is
critical
for
your
personal
brand
and
to
make
it
easier
to
establish
your
website
.
The
domain
name
can
be
purchased
from
your
preferred
registrar
,
but
,
to
be
effective
,
it
should
be
made
up
of
your
full
name
and
have
the
“
.
com
”
extension
if
available
.
If
the
.
com
version
is
not
available
,
there
are
other
extensions
available
that
will
work
.
Regardless
of
the
extension
you
choose
,
the
important
takeaway
is
to
include
your
full
name
.
Your
website
should
include
some
important
information
that
will
help
the
search
engines
and
your
visitors
learn
more
about
you
.
At
the
very
least
,
you
should
provide
:
<list type="unordered">
<item>
A
detailed
biography
of
yourself
</item>
<item>
An
explanation
of
what
people
can
expect
from
working
with
you
</item>
<item>
Links
to
your
social
media
profiles
</item>
<item>
Blog
that
's
updated
regularly

Create
and
optimize
personal
profiles
on
all
the
major
social
platforms
.
It
often
seems
like
there
’s
a
new
social
media
platform
that
“
all
the
cool
kids
are
using
”
every
other
day
.
Before
you
start
jumping
into
the
latest
thing
,
though
,
make
sure
that
you
are
fully
established
on
the
major
platforms
.
This
means
you
should
create
and
optimize
a
profile
on
Facebook
,
Pinterest
,
Twitter
,
Tumblr
,
Instagram
,
and
Google+
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Optimize
your
profile
by
always
using
your
full
name
on
each
profile
,
and
take
the
time
to
fill
out
the
profile
on
each
of
these
platforms
in
entirety
.
Always
add
a
link
back
to
your
website
within
the
profile
section
of
the
social
profile
.
Links
on
social
media
are
often
considered
higher-quality
links
because
social
sites
have
a
high
web
authority
from
the
get-go
.
Even
if
your
Facebook
page
is
new
,
it
’s
likely
to
rank
high
in
the
search
results
.
It
may
sound
obvious
,
but
make
sure
that
you
include
a
working
link
to
your
website
in
your
content
as
well
as
every
social
profile
you
have
.
In
addition
to
increasing
traffic
to
your
site
,
it
’s
also
highly
valuable
for
link
building
.

Blog
with
fresh
content
.
Google
loves
fresh
,
relevant
content
,
and
a
simple
blog
that
you
update
regularly
constantly
freshens
up
your
site
and
gives
your
visitors
a
reason
to
keep
coming
back
.
A
blog
is
a
great
place
to
share
your
personal
experiences
in
leadership
,
mentoring
,
entrepreneurial
success
,
or
challenges
you
have
overcome
.
Each
individual
blog
post
does
n’t
have
to
be
long
,
but
it
should
be
relevant
and
provide
some
engaging
information
.

The
most
important
part
of
blogging
,
though
,
is
consistency
.
If
you
keep
to
a
regular
blogging
schedule
,
both
the
search
engines
and
your
visitors
will
know
when
to
expect
something
new
–
and
they
’ll
show
up
to
check
it
out
.
Once
you
create
this
content
,
you
can
then
inform
all
your
followers
about
it
by
sharing
it
on
your
social
media
networks
.
This
helps
promote
your
blog
while
simultaneously
increasing
your
social
presence

much
will

blogging

a
chance
to
share
your
expertise

others
in
the
industry
.
Many
websites
are
always
looking
for
new
content
,
new
angles
,
and
new
writers
.
You

reach
out

write
a
blog

important
questions

shares
some
of

unique
experiences

opportunities

leadership
blogs
,

other
relevant
categories
where
you
can
develop
a
strong
presence
and
new
relationships
with
industry
insiders

it
’s
appropriate
,

link
back
to
relevant
pages
on
your
own
website
,
which
will
help
with
your
Google
rankings
and
increase
traffic

These
six
steps
are
not
meant
to
live
in
isolation
.
They
are
tied
very
closely
together
and
rely
on
each
other
to
produce
the
best
results
.
A
holistic
approach
that
combines
quality
websites
,
active
social
presence
,
and
a
flow
of
new
,
relevant
content
will
build
a
much
stronger
foundation
that
will
secure
more
spaces
on
the
front
page
of
the
search
results
.
Your
social
media
will
send
visitors
to
your
website
.
Your
website
will
host
important
content
and
engaging
blogs
.
Your
blogs
and
social
media
presence
can
build
your
reputation
so
other
websites
will
want
to
have
you
write
for
them
.
All
of
these
efforts
can
produce
links
that
tie
back
to
your
website
and
other
positive
properties
.
Each
of
these
steps
plays
an
important
role
in
establishing
an
online
reputation
.
As
you
take
a
more
comprehensive
approach
,
it
will
be
much
easier
to
maintain
your
search
engine
standings
.
