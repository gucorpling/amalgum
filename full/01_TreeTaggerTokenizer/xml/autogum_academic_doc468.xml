Introduction
</head>
<p>
Antibiotics
are
medicines
that
fight
bacterial
infections
.
They
can
save
lives
if
they
are
used
correctly
,
but
nowadays
antibiotic
resistance
has
become
a
real
problem
.
Infections
by
resistant
microorganisms
do
not
respond
to
treatment
,
so
the
duration
of
the
disease
is
prolonged
,
and
the
risk
of
death
increases
.
Moreover
,
if
the
treatment
fails
or
if
the
response
to
treatment
is
slow
,
the
patient
is
contagious
for
longer
,
which
increases
the
likelihood
of
resistant
microorganisms
being
transmitted
to
other
people
.
</p>
<p>
The
emergence
of
antibiotic
resistance
is
a
natural
biological
phenomenon
,
and
even
though
numerous
factors
have
been
identified
as
the
cause
of
this
,
such
as
clustering
and
overcrowding
or
increased
elderly
population
,
one
of
the
most
important
factors
is
the
inadequate
use
of
antibiotics
,
a
very
worrying
situation
especially
for
healthcare
professionals
with
high
rate
of
antibiotic
prescription
such
as
primary
care
dentists
.
According
to
the
World
Health
Organization
(
WHO
)
,
inadequate
use
of
antibiotics
includes
the
prescription
of
inappropriate
antibiotics
for
a
brief
time
,
in
low
or
insufficient
doses
and/or
for
diseases
for
which
they
are
not
indicated
;
likewise
,
excessive
therapeutic
dosage
regimens
are
also
considered
inadequate
uses
of
antibiotics
.
In
the
specific
case
of
Spain
,
the
consumption
of
antibiotics
for
outpatients
is
above
the
European
average
,
and
in
hospitals
their
prescription
is
increasing
.
</p>
<p>
The
inadequate
use
of
antibiotics
can
be
encouraged
by
self-medication
,
by
the
implementation
of
permissive
policies
in
terms
of
regulation
of
the
use
of
these
drugs
,
by
the
relationship
between
the
healthcare
professional
and
the
patient
or
by
the
knowledge
and
attitudes
that
one
has
towards
them
.
Regarding
the
latter
,
while
it
is
true
that
a
poor
knowledge
or
negative
attitude
towards
antibiotics
leads
inevitably
to
bad
clinical
practice
,
practical
skills
are
not
always
a
reflection
of
knowledge
,
a
situation
known
as
“
theory
–
practice
gap
”
.
</p>
<p>
To
date
,
the
studies
which
have
evaluated
the
training
that
healthcare
students
have
about
infectious
diseases
,
antimicrobial
resistance
and
safe
use
of
antibiotics
have
been
mainly
carried
out
in
students
of
medicine
and
pharmacy
,
besides
students
from
other
disciplines
such
as
dentistry
.
However
,
taking
into
account
that
the
control
of
antibiotic
resistance
requires
a
multidisciplinary
approach
,
and
that
nursing
staff
play
a
key
role
in
the
rational
use
of
antibiotics
,
as
teachers
of
patients
,
and
as
future
drug
prescribers
in
our
country
,
the
training
of
nurses
could
have
an
important
impact
in
reducing
the
incidence
of
antibiotic
resistance
.
Thus
,
the
objective
of
this
paper
has
been
to
determine
the
nursing
students
’
knowledge
and
awareness
of
antibiotic
use
,
resistance
and
stewardship
.
