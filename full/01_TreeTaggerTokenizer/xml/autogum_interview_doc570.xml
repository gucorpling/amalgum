Q
:
</hi>
Much
of
Brampton
's
existing
council
is
quite
seasoned
in
the
civic
political
process
.
What
could
you
bring
to
the
table
as
a
&quot;
rookie
&quot;
,
above
and
beyond
the
current
roster
of
councillors
?

A
:
</hi>
The
one
thing
that
I
would
do
differently
from
the
incumbent
is
to
make
sure
that
I
involve
the
community
in
the
decision
making
process
and
educate
them
about
municipal
services
.
Wards
2
and
6
where
I
am
a
candidate
have
the
biggest
influx
of
immigrants
in
Brampton
.
I
had
a
chance
to
meet
most
of
them
over
the
summer
and
they
know
very
little
about
the
city
they
live
in
.
Therefore
,
they
presume
that
all
is
fine
and
that
everything
will
fall
in
place
.
As
a
councilor
in
wards
2
and
6
,
my
role
would
be
to
educate
the
community
so
that
they
can
become
more
pro-active
in
helping
us
deliver
the
services
that
are
most
suitable
for
them
.
Most
people
were
also
quick
to
point
out
that
it
was
the
first
time
anyone
from
the
municipal
government
had
actually
knocked
at
their
door
.
If
elected
,
I
would
make
sure
to
close
that
gap
which
currently
exists
between
the
majority
of
the
residence
of
wards
2
and
6
and
there
councilor
.
I
believe
to
closing
this
gap
requires
a
fresh
pair
of
eyes
and
that
is
what
I
intend
to
bring
to
the
table
as
an
elected
councilor
.

Q

</hi>
The
Rose
Theatre
recently
launched
.
What
are
your
thoughts
on
this
facility
?
Have
you
had
a
chance
to
tour
it
yet
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
A
:
</hi>
The
Rose
Theatre
is
a
magnificent
building
and
it
's
a
step
in
the
right
direction
.
Brampton
Downtown
needs
several
other
projects
that
would
attract
business
and
improve
the
general
profile
of
the
city
.
So
often
,
residents
of
Brampton
have
to
commute
to
Toronto
if
they
want
to
catch
a
good
show
and
have
a
relaxing
evening
.
If
we
can
offer
that
right
here
in
Brampton
,
then
we
can
keep
the
dollars
within
the
local
economy
creating
Jobs
.

Q
:
</hi>
The
province
has
strongly
encouraged
the
development
of
high-density
residences
near
the
downtown
.
Do
these
buildings
fit
in
with
your
vision
of
the
downtown
?
How
much
say
should
other
levels
of
government
have
in
urban
planning
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
A
:
</hi>
All
levels
of
government
have
to
work
together
as
the
same
taxpayer
funds
them
all
.
I
believe
that
high-density
residents
in
the
downtown
location
make
sense
given
the
proximity
to
the
transit
routes
planned
for
the
future
.
This
would
also
bring
more
business
in
an
area
that
really
needs
rejuvenation
.

Q
:
</hi>
How
do
you
feel
about
Brampton
's
rate
of
expansion
?
Council
recently
capped
the
annual
amount
of
new
development
;
do
you
agree
completely
with
this
decision
,
would
you
have
slowed
development
even
further
,
or
not
have
imposed
a
cap
at
all
?
