Forensic
investigators
blamed
the
explosion
,
which
also
injured
127
,
in
the
city
's
Spice
Bazaar
on
an
inadvertent
gas
leak
.
Selek
was
arrested
two
days
after
the
explosion
.
She
spent
two
years
in
prison
but
has
been
acquitted
at
each
of
three
trials
.
Following
exonerations
in
2006
and
2008
she
headed
to
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Europe">
Europe
</ref>
.
</p>
<p>
Initially
travelling
to
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Germany">

</ref>
,
Selek
,
now
43
,
then
headed
to
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/France">
France
</ref>
.
She
is
a
researcher
at
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University%20of%20Lyon">
University
of
Lyon
</ref>
.
She
resides
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strasbourg">
Strasbourg
</ref>
and
is
involved
with
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Feminism">
feminist
</ref>
activism
.
Selek
specialises
in
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdish%20people">
Kurdish
people
</ref>
.
</p>
<p>
In
addition
to
the
bombing
,
Selek
was
accused
of
aiding
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Kurdistan_Workers'_Party">
Kurdistan
Workers
'
Party
</ref>
(

)
militancy
.
She
has
been
free
since
the
2000
publication
of
a
report
rejecting
the
bombing
claim
in
favour
of
a
gas
leak
.
</p>
<p>
Another
acquittal
came
in
2011
.
That
was
set
aside
the
following
year
and
in
January
2013
a
conviction
was
substituted
with
a
life
sentence
.
The
sentence
followed
a
conviction
in
which
chief
judge
Vedat
Yılmazabdurrahmanoğlu
indicated
he
did
not
accept
the
evidence
proved
a
bombing
but
was
outvoted
by
two
fellow
judges
.
</p>
<p>
That
sentence
was
cancelled
in
June
this
year
by
the
Supreme
Court
of
Appeals
.
A
warrant
for
her
arrest
was
cancelled
in
October
.
Turkey
had
previously
sought
extradition
from
France
.

<p>
Selek
has
also
refused
to
identify
to
police
rebels
met
in
the
course
of
research
.
Defence
lawyer
Akın
Atalay
had
submitted
the
evidence
did
not
prove
a
bombing
had
occurred
,
and
that
the
repeated
prosecutions
violate
Turkish
and
international
fair
trial
standards
prohibiting

.
He
was
countered
by
Istanbul
public
prosecutor
Yılmaz
Kıstı
who
earlier
this
month
sought
a
new
life
sentence
in
the
case
.
</p>
<p>
The
case
has
attracted
supporters
of
Selek
in
Turkey
and
France
.
They
claim
the
prosecution
is
politically
motivated
to
prevent
her
from
conducting
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sociology">
sociological
</ref>
research
.
At
the
start
of
the
appeal
in
April
this
year
Turkish
and
French
protestors
gathered
outside
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Çağlayan,%20Kağıthane">
Çağlayan
</ref>
Courthouse
,
waving
banners
demanding
&quot;
Justice
for
Pinar
Selek
&quot;
.
</p>
<p>
Protestors
were
there
on
December
5
when
the
request
for
a
new
life
sentence
was
made
.
&quot;
We
have
been
waiting
in

courtrooms
for
sixteen
years

,
activist
Füsun
Demirel
told
journalists
at
the
protest
.
&quot;
Pınar
has
resisted
this
ruthlessness
,
this
injustice
,
by
trying
to
live
as
fully
as
she
can
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Also
acquitted
yesterday
was
Abdulmecit
Ozturk
.
The
court
said
there
was
no
&quot;
exact
and
convincing
&quot;
evidence
against
the
pair
.
Selek
has
indicated
a
desire
to
return
to
Turkey
with
her
name
cleared
.
&quot;
We
will
be
standing
guard
on
her
behalf
until
she
returns
here
