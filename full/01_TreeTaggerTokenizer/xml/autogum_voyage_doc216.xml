Benghazi
</head>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Benghazi
</hi>
is
the
second
largest
city
in
<ref target="Libya">
Libya
</ref>
,
with
a
population
of
647.000
.
</p>
<head>
Understand
</head>
<p>
The
people
of
Benghazi
are
incredibly
friendly
.
However
,
very
few
people
speak
any
English
and
,
because
of
the
writing
style
(
which
is
written
right
to
left
in
Arabic
)
,
it
can
be
almost
impossible
to
recognize
any
public
signs
if
you
do
n’t
know
how
to
speak
or
read
Arabic
.
Most
things
can
,
however
,
be
sorted
out
with
a
bit
of
pointing
and
hand
waving
.
</p>
<p>
The
dress
code
is
not
as
liberal
as
in
Tripoli
,
and
women
should
keep
themselves
covered
-
not
because
there
would
be
trouble
,
but
just
out
of
respect
.
However
,
locals
do
not
expect
non-Muslim
visitors
to
thoroughly
comply
with
their
customs
.
</p>
<p>
People
in
Tripoli
like
a
good
argument
and
may
shout
at
one
another
,
but
this
is
not
an
indication
of
any
trouble
.
Even
if
it
sounds
harsh
to
you
,
if
you
understand
Arabic
,
you
will
find
out
it
is
generally
nothing
of
any
consequence
.
</p>
<p>
If
you
travel
on
a
tourist
visa
,
you
must
get
the
hotel
staff
to
have
your
passport
stamped
or
visit
the
local
police
station
to
register
where
you
are
staying
and
get
a
stamp
in
your
passport
-
otherwise
,
you
will
not
find
it
easy
to
leave
the
country
.
</p>
<p>
If
you
wish
to
drive
out
of
the
city
and
visit
the
ruins
or
other
sites
of
interest
,
you
can
get
a
local
guide
,
but
you
will
need
a
permit
from
the
local
tourist
office
before
you
may
leave
the
city
.

Benina
Airport
</hi>
(
BEN
Arabic
:
مطار
بنينة
الدولي
)
(
is
located
20
km
from
city
centre
)
.
The
airport
operations
are
seemingly
chaotic
,
with
handwritten
boarding
passes
and
luggage
tags
and
very
little
information
available
.
</item>
</list>
<p>
Delays
are
quite
frequent
and
flights
may
be
suspended
,
cancelled
or
delayed
at
any
time
.
</p>
<p>
The
airport
toilet
facilities
are
awful
,
there
are
few
,
if
any
,
public
toilets
,
and
most
restaurants
do
not
have
them
either
,
so
you
may
have
to
wait
until
you
get
to
the
hotel
or
onto
the
aircraft
.
</p>
<head>
Taxis
</head>
<p>
Taxis
in
Libya
are
interesting
.
They
are
either
minibuses
that
travel
round
a
predefined
route
or
black
and
white
cars
(
dead
pandas
)
with
taxi
signs
.
Stick
with
the
cars
...
Taxi
travel
is
very
cheap
,
but
the
vehicles
are
generally
in
a
bad
state
of
repair
.
Try
to
sit
in
the
back
as
the
journeys
can
be
somewhat
exciting
when
in
the
passenger
seat
,
when
drivers
tend
to
turn
across
traffic
lanes
.
Judging
by
the
number
of
dents
on
the
sides
of
the
cars
,
the
drivers
do
not
always
make
this
maneuver
successfully
.
</p>
<p>
Taxi
vehicles
often
lack
parts
that
Westerners
tend
to
take
for
granted
--
such
as
indicators
,
headlights
,
bumpers
,
working
brakes
and
wheel
nuts
.
</p>
<p>
The
taxi
drivers
are
like
most
European
taxi
drivers
.
They
enjoy
sharing
their
opinions
with
you
,
even
if
you
ca
n't
understand
them
-
but
,
as
with
most
of
the
people
in
Benghazi
,
they
are
friendly
,
and
they
do
try
to
make
you
feel
welcome
.

Benghazi
Cathedral
</hi>
.
Constructed
during
the
1930s
in
a
neo-classical
style
,
the
Benghazi
Cathedral
used
to
be
one
of
the
largest
churches
in
the
whole
of
North
Africa
.
It
fell
into
disuse
during
the
1960s
but
has
recently
been
renovated

This
museum
is
the
palace
from
which
King
Idris
declared
independence
from
Italy
in
1951
.
In
the
front

it

Currency
</head>
<p>
Shops
accept
only
local
currency
,
which
can
be
exchanged
at
the
larger
hotels
in
the
mornings
or
after
3PM
.
Ask
for
Tibesti
Hotel
,
a
big
hotel
,
with
grass
on
the
slopes
around
it
.
It
has
a
<hi rend="italic">
bureau
de
change
</hi>
and
two
cashpoint
machines
,
which
accept
Visa
and
Maestro/Cirrus
.
</p>
<p>
Credit
cards
are
not
generally
accepted
,
so
nobody
will
say
'
that
will
do
nicely
'
.
(
very
limited
number
of
shops
accept
them
)
</p>
<head>
Shopping
</head>
<p>
For
those
who
are
looking
for
famous
brands
,
then
go
to
Dubai
Street
,
where
most
of
the
international
brands
,
such
as
Benetton
,
Nike
,
Celio
,
Addidas
,
Puma
,
Max
Mara
,
and
many
more
are
available
.
</p>
<p>
As
there
are
very
few
tourists
in
Benghazi
,
there
is
very
little
to
buy
other
than
normal
goods
.
So
,
it
's
easy
to
get
a
fridge
,
an
aircon
unit
,
a
mobile
phone
,
Mars
bars
,
or
Coke
,
but
very
little
to
buy
as
a
souvenir
.
A
sheesh
?
Pipe
is
a
good
bet
-
these
are
about
18
Libyan
dinars
for
a
24-inch
high
pipe
.
For
traditional
souvenirs
,
the
best
place
will
be
Sok
el
Jered
.
</p>
<head>
Eat
</head>
<p>
Anything
.
</p>
<p>
There
is
nothing
that
is
n't
acceptable
to
the
western
palate
-
the
food
can
be
quite
spicy
,
although
not
excessively
so
.
</p>
<p>
Traditional
Libyan
fare
appears
to
be
couscous
,
kebabs
,
spicey
potatoes
,
salads
,
and
nothing
that
you
would
n't
find
in
London
.
</p>
<p>
There
are
a
number
of
good
restaurants
.
Although
very
basic
by
western
standards
,
they
do
produce
good
meals
.
Round
the
back
of
the
Tibesti
Hotel
there
are
some
good
Turkish
restaurants
;
most
of
their
food
is
very
edible
,
and
the
prices
are
very
reasonable
.
</p>
<p>
Generally
,
service
is
very
slow
,
so
leave
a
good
amount
of
time
to
have
a
meal
.
There
are
kebab
takeaways
if
you
are
in
a
hurry
,
but
in
a
hotel
you
can
wait
30
minutes
to
get
a
waiter
to
take
your
order
or
bring
you
a
menu
.
To
save
time
it
is
often
easier
to
pay
for
your
meal/drinks
as
they
are
served
,
before
saving
the
half-hour
wait
to
get
a
bill
.
</p>
<p>
The
food
is
generally
served
a
little
cooler
than
you
expect
-
it
is
generally
warm
rather
than
hot
,
and
the
chips
are
worth
avoiding
as
they
tend
to
be
rubbery
.
</p>
<head>
Drink
</head>
<p>
Alcohol
is
not
allowed
in
Libya
.
The
best
things
to
drink
are
:
</p>
<p>
Coffee
,
although
they
do
seem
to
want
to
give
you
Nescafe
,
as
they
think
it
's
pretty
cool
;
but
just
about
everywhere
you
can
get
cappuccino
or
Arabian
coffee
,
which
are
pretty
good
.
</p>
<p>
The
mango
juice
is
good
and
very
thick
.
</p>
<p>
Coke
,
Lilt
,
and
7Up
cans
are
popular
,
as
well
as
the
lemon
and
mint
teas
.
</p>
<p>
Alcohol-free
beer
is
widely
available
(
Becks
)
,
as
is
'
Spitz
'
,
which
tastes
like
campari
or
cough
mixture
.
If
you
really
want
alcohol
,
wine
is
available
from
butcher
's
shops
,
but
it
's
expensive
(
whisky
is
about
USD
100
per
bottle
)
.
It
is
said
that
the
penalty
for
being
caught
drunk
or
with
alcohol
is
to
be
driven
back
to
your
hotel
room
by
the
police
.
While
this
sounds
safer
than
riding
the
local
taxis
,
such
approach
is
not
recommended
.
