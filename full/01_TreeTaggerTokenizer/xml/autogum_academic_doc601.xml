Introduction
</head>
<p>
Despite
the
recognized
health
benefits
of
physical
activity
(
PA
)
,
a
majority
of
children
do
not
meet
the
recommended
physical
activity
(
PA
)
level
.
Children
who
are
inactive
at
age
5
years
tend
to
remain
inactive
throughout
childhood
and
adolescence
.
Recent
longitudinal
studies
have
reported
that
PA
behavior
tracks
at
a
moderate
level
from
age
1
to
3
years
,
or
age
1
to
5
years
.
Collectively
,
these
findings
suggest
that
PA
behaviors
could
be
established
at
a
very
young
age
and
sustained
over
time
.
Recognizing
the
emerging
need
to
assess
PA
behavior
among
very
young
children
,
studies
have
begun
to
investigate
wearable
sensor-measured
PA
levels
among
toddlers
aged
1
and
2
years
.

<p>
Accelerometers
are
widely
accepted
as
the
best
practice
for
objectively
measuring
regular
PA
among
children
.
In
particular
,
ActiGraph
accelerometers
(
Pensacola
,
FL
,
USA
)
are
the
most
commonly
used
research-grade
accelerometers
.
The
ActiGraph
accelerometers
are
relatively
small
and
light
devices
(
e.
g.
,
4.6
cm
×
3.3
cm
×
1.5
cm
and
19
g
for
the
wGT3X-BT
model
)
.
Several
aspects
of
the
device
have
been
shown
to
be
acceptable
,
such
as
its
size
,
weight
,
and
its
ability
to
be
worn
on
a
hip
and
a
wrist
,
by
attaching
it
to
a
waist
belt
,
a
waist
clip
,
or
a
wrist
band
,
for
several
days
,
among
preschoolers
and
older
children
.
However
,
this
same
level
of
feasibility
cannot
be
assumed
for
toddlers
,
given
that
their
bodies
are
significantly
smaller
and
their
daily
life
activity
patterns
are
uniquely
different
(
e.
g.
,
naps
and
frequent
clothes/diaper
changes
)
from
older
children
.
Only
a
few
studies
have
examined
the
feasibility
of
using
ActiGraph
accelerometers
among
toddlers
.
These
studies
reported
that
the
use
of
a
hip-worn
accelerometer
is
feasible
among
toddlers
.
A
paper
by
Johansson
et
al.
reported
the
successful
completion
(
89
%
of
the
sample
)
of
a
wrist-worn
accelerometer
assessment
among
toddlers
,
although
it
did
not
explicitly
assess
feasibility
.
The
placement
of
the
accelerometer
(
e.
g.
,
hip
or
wrist
)
is
a
key
methodological
issue
that
has
important
implications
not
only
for
data
processing
algorithms
,
but
also
for
adherence
to
the
monitoring
protocol
.
Although
hip-
and
wrist-worn
accelerometers
are
both
feasible
for
use
in
older
children
,
wrist
placement
has
shown
higher
compliance
than
hip-placement
,
while
hip-worn
accelerometer
data
have
shown
higher
accuracy
in
estimating
PA
than
wrist-worn
accelerometer
data
.
However
,
to
our
knowledge
,
no
studies
have
yet
reported
on
a
comparison
of
the
feasibility
between
hip
and
wrist
placement
among
toddlers
.
The
aims
of
this
study
were
to
examine
the
feasibility
of
using
hip
vs.
wrist-worn
ActiGraph
accelerometers
and
to
report
accelerometer-derived
PA
metrics
among
toddlers
.
