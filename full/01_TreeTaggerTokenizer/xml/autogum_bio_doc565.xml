<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy">
Italy
</ref>
and
was
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrara">
Ferrara
</ref>
in
August
1460
.
He
had
been
attending
the
lectures
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guarino_da_Verona">
Guarino
da
Verona
</ref>
on
rhetoric
at
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrara">
Ferrara
</ref>
.
His
teacher
Guarino
died
at
the
end
of
1460
and
this
may
be
why
Gunthorpe
moved
on
.
In
January
1462
Gunthorpe
was
formally
taken
into
papal
service
.
Pope
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pius_II">
Pius
II
</ref>
examined
Gunthorpe
for
fitness
,
and
appointed
him
as
a
papal
chaplain
and
minor
penitentiary
in
St
Peter
's
Basilica
and
in
the
Papal
Curia
.
From
1460-1465
,
Gunthorpe
went
through
a
period
of
post-graduate
study
in
Italy
,
where
he
perfected
his
Latin
rhetorical
style
.
He
also
learned
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece">
Greek
</ref>
and
presumably
Italian
,
and
gained
experience
in
the
international
arena
of
the
papal
court
.

</head>
<p>
Gunthorpe
returned
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England">
England
</ref>
in
1465
and
became
intimately
integrated
into
the
religious
,
diplomatic
,
financial
,
and
political
life
of
the
court
and
government
of
Edward
IV
.
Gunthorpe
's
involvement
in
Anglo-Castilian
diplomacy
concluded
in
1470
when
he
was
one
of
the
ambassadors
commissioned
on
14
March
by
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Edward_IV">
King
Edward
IV
</ref>
to
embark
upon
an
ultimately
fruitless
effort
to
persuade
Enrique
IV
against
the
repudiation
of
the
treaty
between
their
kingdoms
.
Gunthorpe
was
in
the
royal
household
as
a
king
's
chaplain
by
the
summer
of
1466

the
king
's
almoner
,
the
person
who
had
charge
of
the
king
's
charities
from
gifts
of
money
to
the
distribution
of
surplus
food
from
the
king
's
table
;
the
office
can
be
traced
back
at
least
to
the
twelfth
century
.
John
Gunthorpe
was
the
first
person
on
record
to
have
been
called
‘
King
's
High
Almoner
’
.
He
was
also
a
warden
.
</p>
<p>
In
1472
,
Gunthorpe
became
a
monk
at
St.
Stephen
's
chapel
and
remained
a
monk
of
St.
Stephen
's
for
the
rest
of
his
life
.
He
was
also
a
monk
of
many
other
chapels
.
However
,
even
though
he
was
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monk">
monk
</ref>
at
all
of
these
chapels
,
his
place
of
residence
was
with
the
king
.
In
1476
he
became
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_of_the_Chapel_Royal">
dean
of

,
with

Later
life
</head>
<p>
On
10
November
1481
a
group
of
nine
men
,
among
whom
Gunthorpe
was
named
first
,
obtained
a
royal
licence
to
found
and
endow
a
guild
in
the
parish
church
of
St
Mary
in
North
Somercotes
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincolnshire">

</ref>
.
On
9
April
1483
,
Gunthorpe
's
patron
and
benefactor
King
Edward
IV
died
at
Westminster
Palace
.
On
10
May
Gunthorpe
was
appointed
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Privy_Seal">
Keeper
of
the
Privy
Seal
</ref>
under
the
authority
of
Richard
of
Gloucester
.
Richard
had
formally
been
named
protector
two
days
before
and
as
King
Richard
III
he
reappointed
Gunthorpe
on
27
June
The
appointment
was
reiterated
on
6
July
,
the
day
of
Richard
's
magnificent
coronation
ceremony
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_Abbey">
Westminster
Abbey
</ref>
.
John
was
the
only
keeper
of
the
Privy
seal
to
serve
Richard
III
.
He
was
not
seen
as
a
very
smart
choice
of
keeper
since
he
was
the
former
secretary
of
Queen
Elizabeth
,
and
Richard
was
fearful
of
a
Woodville
faction
in
1483
.
</p>
<p>
While
serving
as
Keeper
of
the
Privy
Seal
,
Gunthorpe
served
his
king
in
Anglo-Scottish
diplomacy
by
truce-making
in
Scotland
,
and
extension
of
a
truce
with
Francis
II
,
Duke
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittany">
Brittany
</ref>
;
he
also
helped
work
out
a
truce
with
the
Tudor
family
in
Brittany
in
October
1483
,
which
was
extended
to
1492

Why
picked
?
</head>
<p>
Gunthorpe
's
geographical
origins
might
have
recommended
him
to
Richard
in
1483
and
Gunthorpe
was
a
learned
man
.
But
it
is
the
perennial
enigma
of
Richard
III
that
brings
attention
to
Gunthorpe
.
In
1485
,
Richard
gave
Gunthorpe
a
present
-
the

In
the
last

royal
service
,
and
moved
smoothly
in
the
highest
circles
