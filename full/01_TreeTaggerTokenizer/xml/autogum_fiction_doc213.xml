CHANGES
AT
FORLORN
RIVER
</head>
<p>
THE
first
of
March
saw
the
federal
occupation
of
the
garrison
at
Casita
.
After
a
short
,
decisive
engagement
the
rebels
were
dispersed
into
small
bands
and
driven
eastward
along
the
boundary
line
toward
Nogales
.
</p>
<p>
It
was
the
destiny
of
Forlorn
River
,
however
,
never
to
return
to
the
slow
,
sleepy
tenor
of
its
former
existence
.
Belding
's
predictions
came
true
.
That
straggling
line
of
home-seekers
was
but
a
forerunner
of
the
real
invasion
of
Altar
Valley
.
Refugees
from
Mexico
and
from
Casita
spread
the
word
that
water
and
wood
and
grass
and
land
were
to
be
had
at
Forlorn
River
;
and
as
if
by
magic
the
white
tents
and
red
adobe
houses
sprang
up
to
glisten
in
the
sun
.
</p>
<p>
Belding
was
happier
than
he
had
been
for
a
long
time
.
He
believed
that
evil
days
for
Forlorn
River
,
along
with
the
apathy
and
lack
of
enterprise
,
were
in
the
past
.
He
hired
a
couple
of
trustworthy
Mexicans
to
ride
the
boundary
line
,
and
he
settled
down
to
think
of
ranching
and
irrigation
and
mining
projects
.
Every
morning
he
expected
to
receive
some
word
form
Sonoyta
or
Yuma
,
telling
him
that
Yaqui
had
guided
his
party
safely
across
the
desert
.
</p>
<p>
Belding
was
simple-minded
,
a
man
more
inclined
to
action
than
reflection
.
When
the
complexities
of
life
hemmed
him
in
,
he
groped
his
way
out
,
never
quite
understanding
.
His
wife
had
always
been
a
mystery
to
him
.
Nell
was
sunshine
most
of
the
time
,
but
,
like
the
sun-dominated
desert
,
she
was
subject
to
strange
changes
,
wilful
,
stormy
,
sudden
.
It
was
enough
for
Belding
now
to
find
his
wife
in
a
lighter
,
happier
mood
,
and
to
see
Nell
dreamily
turning
a
ring
round
and
round
the
third
finger
of
her
left
hand
and
watching
the
west
.
Every
day
both
mother
and
daughter
appeared
farther
removed
from
the
past
darkly
threatening
days
.
Belding
was
hearty
in
his
affections
,
but
undemonstrative
.
If
there
was
any
sentiment
in
his
make-up
it
had
an
outlet
in
his
memory
of
Blanco
Diablo
and
a
longing
to
see
him
.
Often
Belding
stopped
his
work
to
gaze
out
over
the
desert
toward
the
west
.
When
he
thought
of
his
rangers
and
Thorne
and
Mercedes
he
certainly
never
forgot
his
horse
.
He
wondered
if
Diablo
was
running
,
walking
,
resting
;
if
Yaqui
was
finding
water
and
grass
.
</p>
<p>
In
March
,
with
the
short
desert
winter
over
,
the
days
began
to
grow
warm
.
The
noon
hours
were
hot
,
and
seemed
to
give
promise
of
the
white
summer
blaze
and
blasting
furnace
wind
soon
to
come
.
No
word
was
received
from
the
rangers
.
But
this
caused
Belding
no
concern
,
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
women
folk
considered
no
news
good
news
.
</p>
<p>
Among
the
many
changes
coming
to
pass
in
Forlorn
River
were
the
installing
of
post-office
service
and
the
building
of
a
mescal
drinking-house
.
Belding
had
worked
hard
for
the
post
office
,
but
he
did
not
like
the
idea
of
a
saloon
for
Forlorn
River
.
Still
,
that
was
an
inevitable
evil
.
The
Mexicans
would
have
mescal
.
Belding
had
kept
the
little
border
hamlet
free
of
an
establishment
for
distillation
of
the
fiery
cactus
drink
.
A
good
many
Americans
drifted
into
Forlorn
River
--
miners
,
cowboys
,
prospectors
,
outlaws
,
and
others
of
nondescript
character
;
and
these
men
,
of
course
,
made
the
saloon
,
which
was
also
an
inn
,
their
headquarters
.
Belding
,
with
Carter
and
other
old
residents
,
saw
the
need
of
a
sheriff
for
Forlorn
River
.
</p>
<p>
One
morning
early
in
this
spring
month
,
while
Belding
was
on
his
way
from
the
house
to
the
corrals
,
he
saw
Nell
running
Blanco
Jose
down
the
road
at
a
gait
that
amazed
him
.
She
did
not
take
the
turn
of
the
road
to
come
in
by
the
gate
.
She
put
Jose
at
a
four-foot
wire
fence
,
and
came
clattering
into
the
yard
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Nell
must
have
another
tantrum
,
&quot;
said
Belding
.
&quot;
She
's
long
past
due
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Blanco
Jose
,
like
the
other
white
horses
,
was
big
of
frame
and
heavy
,
and
thunder
rolled
from
under
his
great
hoofs
.
Nell
pulled
him
up
,
and
as
he
pounded
and
slid
to
a
halt
in
a
cloud
of
dust
she
swung
lightly
down
.
</p>
<p>
It
did
not
take
more
than
half
an
eye
for
Belding
to
see
that
she
was
furious
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Nell
,
what
's
come
off
now
?
&quot;
asked
Belding
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
'm
not
going
to
tell
you
,
&quot;
she
replied
,
and
started
away
,
leading
Jose
toward
the
corral
.
</p>
<p>
Belding
leisurely
followed
.
She
went
into
the
corral
,
removed
Jose
's
bridle
,
and
led
him
to
the
watering-trough
.
Belding
came
up
,
and
without
saying
anything
began
to
unbuckle
Jose
's
saddle
girths
.
But
he
ventured
a
look
at
Nell
.
The
red
had
gone
from
her
face
,
and
he
was
surprised
to
see
her
eyes
brimming
with
tears
.
Most
assuredly
this
was
not
one
of
Nell
's
tantrums
.
While
taking
off
Jose
's
saddle
and
hanging
it
in
the
shed
Belding
pondered
in
his
slow
way
.
When
he
came
back
to
the
corral
Nell
had
her
face
against
the
bars
,
and
she
was
crying
.
He
slipped
a
big
arm
around
her
and
waited
.
Although
it
was
not
often
expressed
,
there
was
a
strong
attachment
between
them
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Dad
,
I
do
n't
want
you
to
think
me
a
--
a
baby
any
more
,
&quot;
she
said
.
&quot;
I
've
been
insulted
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
With
a
specific
fact
to
make
clear
thought
in
Belding
's
mind
he
was
never
slow
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
knew
something
unusual
had
come
off
.
I
guess
you
'd
better
tell
me
.
