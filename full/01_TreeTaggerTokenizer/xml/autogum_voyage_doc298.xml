Pensacola
</ref>
</hi>
is
a
historic
beach
city
in
northwest
<ref target="Florida">
Florida
</ref>
,
in
the
<ref target="United%20States%20of%20America">
United
States
of
America
</ref>
.
It
is
in
Escambia
County
,
Florida
's
westernmost
county
,
at
the
tip
of
the
&quot;
panhandle
&quot;
.
The
city
is
home
to
the
Pensacola
Naval
Air
Station
,
the
National
Museum
of
Naval
Aviation
and
many
historic
districts
that
skirt
the
downtown
area
.
Surrounded
on
three
sides
by
water
,
the
Pensacola
area
is
full
of
history
,
shipwrecks
,
beaches
and
spectacular
vistas
.

Pensacola
should
not
be

History

<p>
Pensacola
has
the
nickname
<hi rend="bold">
&quot;
The
City
of
Five
Flags
.
&quot;
</hi>
Only
the
Pensacola
Chamber
of
Commerce
actually
<hi rend="italic">
uses
</hi>
that
name
,
but
it
's
a
convenient
short-handed
way
of
describing
the
city
's
history
.
Over
the
past
450
years
,
Pensacola
has
been
owned
by
five
nations
:
Spain
,
France
,
the
United
Kingdom
,
the
United
States
,
and
the
Confederate
States
.
It
was
also
inhabited
by
various
Native
American
tribes
,
but
sloganeers
never
seem
to
include
them
.
</p>
<p>
When
the
<hi rend="bold">
Panzacola
Indians
</hi>
arrived
in
Pensacola
thousands
of
years
ago
,
they
found
old
growth
pine
forests
,
thicketed
with
massive
pine
trees
so
large
,
it
would
take
two
or
three
men
to
wrap
your
arms
around
the
trunk
.
These
trees
provided
so
much
shade
that
there
was
almost
no
undergrowth
on
the
forest
floor
,
and
traveling
through
the
woods
was
easy
.
Since
there
is
n't
much
food
to
be
found
in
pine
forests
,
the
tribes
tended
to
live
near
the
water
,
where
fishing
was
plentiful
.
Not
much
is
known
about
these
early
inhabitants
of
the
area
:
they
left
few
artifacts
behind
,
and
all
of
the
tribes
that
lived
in
Pensacola
prior
to
European
colonization
have
gone
extinct
.
</p>
<p>
European
colonization
began
with
the
<hi rend="bold">
Spanish
:
</hi>
Juan
Ponce
de
León
(
of
Fountain
of
Youth
fame
)
sighted
the
area
first
,
and
later
Spanish
explorers
were
excited
by
the
well-protected
,
deep
water
bay
.
They
recommended
settlement
,
and
in
1559
,
<hi rend="bold">
Tristán
de
Luna
y
Arellano
</hi>
arrived
at
the
bay
and
founded
the
first
European
settlement
in
the
United
States
.
He
named
it
...
<hi rend="italic">
Puerto
de
Santa
Maria
.
</hi>
It
failed
miserably
.
He
sent
his
men
on
worthless
scouting
missions
into
the
desolate
pine
forests
,
lost
all
of
his
ships
in
a
hurricane
(
with
the
supplies
still
on
board
!
)
,
and
was
so
incapable
and
uninspiring
that
his
men
mutinied
.
He
lived
,
thanks
to
the
intervention
of
Catholic
missionaries
in
the
town
,
but
once
Spanish
ships
arrived
a
few
months
later
,
the
remaining
Spaniards
quickly
abandoned
the
settlement
.
</p>
<p>
Spain
did
n't
return
until
1698
.
They
had
rediscovered
the
bay
five
years
earlier
during
a
mapping
expedition
.
Since
the
bay
was
still
a
tempting
harbor
,
and
there
were
many
old
growth
pines
at
the
nearby
Blackwater
River
that
would
be
perfect
for
shipbuilding
,
Spain
decided
to
resettle
the
bay
.
This
time
,
the
settlement
was
named
<hi rend="italic">
Bahía
Santa
María
de
Filipina
.
</hi>
Still
not
Pensacola
!
However
,
the
name
'
Panzacola
'
was
written
on
explorer
's
maps
for
the
area
,
and
the
name
was
starting
to
gain
informal
use
.
The
settlement
was
poor
,
small
,
populated
mostly
by
prisoners
,
and
suffered
many
setbacks
.
</p>
<p>
In
1719
,
<hi rend="bold">
France
,
</hi>
led
by
the
governor
of
French
Louisiana
captured
Pensacola
from
the
Spanish
at
the
outset
of
the
War
of
the
Quadruple
Alliance
.
There
was
almost
no
resistance
from
Pensacola
:
no
one
had
bothered
to
tell
the
Pensacolians
that
they
were
at
war
!
The
befuddled
city
greeted
the
French
with
open
arms
,
expecting
the
ships
from
Mobile
to
trade
supplies
,
not
bullets
.
After
taking
control
,
they
did
n't
do
much
with
the
city
.
The
French
burned
Pensacola
during
their
retreat
in
1722
,
and
the
Spanish
resumed
control
of
the
(
pillaged
,
charred
)
city
...
</p>
<p>
Until
1763
,
when
<hi rend="bold">
Great
Britain
</hi>
won
Florida
from
the
Spanish
as
a
concession
following
the
French
and
Indian
War/Seven
Years
'
War
.
In
exchange
,
Spain
was
allowed
to
keep
Cuba
,
and
was
also
given
Louisiana
as
a
gift
from
the
French
,
in
exchange
for
their
help
during
the
war
.
Not
a
bad
trade
.
Great
Britain
was
proud
of
its
new
city
,
and
they
put
a
lot
of
effort
into
improvement
.
It
was
declared
the
capital
of
the
new
colony
of
British
West
Florida
,
and
they
built
most
of
the
streets
in
downtown
Pensacola
that
are
still
used
today
.
</p>
<p>
This
period
of
British
prosperity
did
n't
last
too
long
though
,
because
in
1781
,
<hi rend="bold">
Spain
</hi>
recaptured
Pensacola
,
along
with
the
rest
of
Florida
,
as
an
ally
of
the
United
States
in
the
American
Revolutionary
War
.
Bernardo
de
Gálvez
,
the
general
of
Spanish
Louisiana
,
was
instrumental
in
winning
the
city
during
the
Battle
of
Pensacola
.
When
the
Spanish
fleet
commander
lost
a
ship
and
refused
to
send
any
more
into
Pensacola
Bay
,
Gálvez
used
his
powers
as
governor
to
commandeer
one
of
the
ships
from
Louisiana
and
personally
sailed
it
into
the
harbor
,
under
constant
cannon
fire
from
the
British
.
The
other
ships
in
the
fleet
soon
followed
,
somewhat
emasculated
,
one
imagines
.
With
Florida
now
in
Spanish
control
,
Spain
controlled
all
of
the
Gulf
Coast
,
and
parts
of
the
Mississippi
River
,
which
resulted
in
a
lot
of
discontent
among
United
States
settlers
in
the
south
.
They
wanted
water
access
,
and
their
agitation
for
a
seaport
eventually
inspire
a
young
general
named
Andrew
Jackson
.
</p>
<p>
In
1821
,
Jackson
finally
succeeded
in
capturing
Pensacola
,
and
Florida
,
for
the
fourth
and
final
time
:
it
was
now
owned
by
<hi rend="bold">
the
United
States
of
America
.
</hi>
The
Adams-Onís
Treaty
made
the
acquisition
official
,
giving
Pensacola
and
all
of
Spanish
Florida
to
the
Americans
.
This
was
a
boon
for
Mississippi
and
Alabama
,
which
finally
gained
access
to
the
sea
.
It
was
n't
so
great
for
General
Jackson
,
who
was
made
Governor
of
Florida
,
a
job
he
hated
,
and
later
quit
.
By
this
time
,
Pensacola
had
become
the
largest
city
in
Florida
,
and
was
one
of
the
most
important
ports
on
the
Gulf
Coast
.
In
1845
the
territory
became
the
27th
United
State
.
The
United
States
invested
a
lot
in
Florida
,
building
forts
here
,
increasing
a
military
presence
.
They
built
shipyards
,
which
a
hundred
years
later
would
become
Naval
Air
Station
(
NAS
)
Pensacola
.
</p>
<p>
In
1861
Florida
seceded
from
the
United
States
to
join
the
<hi rend="bold">
Confederate
States
of
America
</hi>
.
For
four
years
,
Florida
fought
with
the
South
as
part
of
the
American
Civil
War
.
Contrary
to
initial
expectations
,
this
war
did
not
end
well
for
the
South
.
Even
worse
for
Pensacola
,
the
Confederacy
single-handedly
destroyed
the
city
's
economy
.
Confederate
Colonel
John
Beard
,
afraid
that
Union
troops
would
capture
Pensacola
,
ordered
his
men
to
&quot;
destroy
every
foot
of
lumber
,
all
saw-mills
,
boats
,
etc.
,
&quot;
along
with
anything
else
that
may
be
of
use
to
&quot;
the
enemy
.
&quot;
The
city
's
economy
never
fully
recovered
.
</p>
<p>
Pensacola
<hi rend="bold">
rejoined
the
United
States
</hi>
in
1865
,
beginning
a
long
decline
for
the
city
.
The
lumber
industry
began
to
rebuild
,
but
by
the
1930s
,
every
old-growth
tree
in
northwest
Florida
had
been
cut
down
,
leaving
nothing
but
small
,
newly
planted
pines
.
Pensacola
Bay
,
the
entire
reason
for
the
city
's
existence
,
was
unable
to
accommodate
modern
ships
,
which
required
deeper
water
.
The
city
council
declined
to
dredge
the
bay
to
make
the
water
deeper
,
and
the
harbor
declined
to
near
nothingness
.
Most
of
the
shipping
moved
to
<ref target="Mobile">
Mobile
</ref>
,
Alabama
.
</p>
<p>
Today
,
the
military
is
a
driving
force
in
Pensacola
's
economy
.
The
Pensacola
shipyards
were
re-purposed
,
and
became
the
first
naval
air
station
in
the
United
States
in
1913
.
NAS
Pensacola
is
home
to
the
Blue
Angels
and
the
National
Museum
of
Naval
Aviation
.
All
naval
aviators
are
,
at
some
point
in
their
career
,
trained
at
NAS
Pensacola
.
The
base
employs
more
than
23,000
people
.
