<p>
It
was
rather
less
than
a
week
after
that
walk
that
Capes
came
and
sat
down
beside
Ann
Veronica
for
their
customary
talk
in
the
lunch
hour
.
He
took
a
handful
of
almonds
and
raisins
that
she
held
out
to
him
--
for
both
these
young
people
had
given
up
the
practice
of
going
out
for
luncheon
--
and
kept
her
hand
for
a
moment
to
kiss
her
finger-tips
.
He
did
not
speak
for
a
moment
.
</p>
<p>
“
Well
?
”
she
said
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
say
!
”
he
said
,
without
any
movement
.
“
Let
’s
go
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Go
!
”
She
did
not
understand
him
at
first
,
and
then
her
heart
began
to
beat
very
rapidly
.
</p>
<p>
“
Stop
this
--
this
humbugging
,
”
he
explained
.
“
It
’s
like
the
Picture
and
the
Bust
.
I
ca
n’t
stand
it
.
Let
’s
go
.
Go
off
and
live
together
--
until
we
can
marry
.
Dare
you
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Do
you
mean
NOW
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
At
the
end
of
the
session
.
It
’s
the
only
clean
way
for
us
.
Are
you
prepared
to
do
it
?
”
</p>
<p>
Her
hands
clenched
.
“
Yes
,
”
she
said
,
very
faintly
.
And
then
:
“
Of
course
!
Always
.
It
is
what
I
have
wanted
,
what
I
have
meant
all
along
.
”
</p>
<p>
She
stared
before
her
,
trying
to
keep
back
a
rush
of
tears
.
</p>
<p>
Capes
kept
obstinately
stiff
,
and
spoke
between
his
teeth
.
</p>
<p>
“
There
’s
endless
reasons
,
no
doubt
,
why
we
should
n’t
,
”
he
said
.
“
Endless
.
It
’s
wrong
in
the
eyes
of
most
people
.
For
many
of
them
it
will
smirch
us
forever
...
.
You
DO
understand
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Who
cares
for
most
people
?
”
she
said
,
not
looking
at
him
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
do
.
It
means
social
isolation
--
struggle
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
If
you
dare
--
I
dare
,
”
said
Ann
Veronica
.
“
I
was
never
so
clear
in
all
my
life
as
I
have
been
in
this
business
.
”
She
lifted
steadfast
eyes
to
him
.
“
Dare
!
”
she
said
.
The
tears
were
welling
over
now
,
but
her
voice
was
steady
.
“
You
’re
not
a
man
for
me
--
not
one
of
a
sex
,
I
mean
.
You
’re
just
a
particular
being
with
nothing
else
in
the
world
to
class
with
you
.
You
are
just
necessary
to
life
for
me
.
I
’ve
never
met
any
one
like
you
.
To
have
you
is
all
important
.
Nothing
else
weighs
against
it
.
Morals
only
begin
when
that
is
settled
.
I
sha’
n’t
care
a
rap
if
we
can
never
marry
.
I
’m
not
a
bit
afraid
of
anything
--
scandal
,
difficulty
,
struggle
...
.
I
rather
want
them
.
I
do
want
them
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
You
’ll
get
them
,
”
he
said
.
“
This
means
a
plunge
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Are
you
afraid
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Only
for
you
!
Most
of
my
income
will
vanish
.
Even
unbelieving
biological
demonstrators
must
respect
decorum
;
and
besides
,
you
see
--
you
were
a
student
.
We
shall
have
--
hardly
any
money
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
do
n’t
care
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Hardship
and
danger
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
With
you
!
”
</p>
<p>
“
And
as
for
your
people
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
They
do
n’t
count
.
That
is
the
dreadful
truth
.
This
--
all
this
swamps
them
.
They
do
n’t
count
,
and
I
do
n’t
care
.
”
</p>
<p>
Capes
suddenly
abandoned
his
attitude
of
meditative
restraint
.
“
By
Jove
!
”
he
broke
out
,
“
one
tries
to
take
a
serious
,
sober
view
.
I
do
n’t
quite
know
why
.
But
this
is
a
great
lark
,
Ann
Veronica
!
This
turns
life
into
a
glorious
adventure
!
”
</p>
<p>
“
Ah
!
”
she
cried
in
triumph
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
shall
have
to
give
up
biology
,
anyhow
.
I
’ve
always
had
a
sneaking
desire
for
the
writing-trade
.
That
is
what
I
must
do
.
I
can
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Of
course
you
can
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
And
biology
was
beginning
to
bore
me
a
bit
.
One
research
is
very
like
another
...
.
Latterly
I
’ve
been
doing
things
...
.
Creative
work
appeals
to
me
wonderfully
.
Things
seem
to
come
rather
easily
...
.
But
that
,
and
that
sort
of
thing
,
is
just
a
day-dream
.
For
a
time
I
must
do
journalism
and
work
hard
...
.
What
is
n’t
a
day-dream
is
this
:
that
you
and
I
are
going
to
put
an
end
to
flummery
--
and
go
!
”
</p>
<p>
“
Go
!
”
said
Ann
Veronica
,
clenching
her
hands
.
</p>
<p>
“
For
better
or
worse
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
For
richer
or
poorer
.
”
</p>
<p>
She
could
not
go
on
,
for
she
was
laughing
and
crying
at
the
same
time
.
“
We
were
bound
to
do
this
when
you
kissed
me
,
”
she
sobbed
through
her
tears
.
“
We
have
been
all
this
time
--
Only
your
queer
code
of
honor
--
Honor
!
Once
you
begin
with
love
you
have
to
see
it
through
.

CHAPTER
THE
FIFTEENTH
</head>
<head>
THE
LAST
DAYS
AT
HOME
</head>
<head>
Part
1
</head>
<p>
They
decided
to
go
to
Switzerland
at
the
session
’s
end
.
“
We
’ll
clean
up
everything
tidy
,
”
said
Capes
...
.
</p>
<p>
For
her
pride
’s
sake
,
and
to
save
herself
from
long
day-dreams
and
an
unappeasable
longing
for
her
lover
,
Ann
Veronica
worked
hard
at
her
biology
during
those
closing
weeks
.
She
was
,
as
Capes
had
said
,
a
hard
young
woman
.
She
was
keenly
resolved
to
do
well
in
the
school
examination
,
and
not
to
be
drowned
in
the
seas
of
emotion
that
threatened
to
submerge
her
intellectual
being
.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless
,
she
could
not
prevent
a
rising
excitement
as
the
dawn
of
the
new
life
drew
near
to
her
--
a
thrilling
of
the
nerves
,
a
secret
and
delicious
exaltation
above
the
common
circumstances
of
existence
.
Sometimes
her
straying
mind
would
become
astonishingly
active
--
embroidering
bright
and
decorative
things
that
she
could
say
to
Capes
;
sometimes
it
passed
into
a
state
of
passive
acquiescence
,
into
a
radiant
,
formless
,
golden
joy
.
She
was
aware
of
people
--
her
aunt
,
her
father
,
her
fellow-students
,
friends
,
and
neighbors
--
moving
about
outside
this
glowing
secret
,
very
much
as
an
actor
is
aware
of
the
dim
audience
beyond
the
barrier
of
the
footlights
.
They
might
applaud
,
or
object
,
or
interfere
,
but
the
drama
was
her
very
own
.
She
was
going
through
with
that
,
anyhow
.
</p>
<p>
The
feeling
of
last
days
grew
stronger
with
her
as
their
number
diminished
.
She
went
about
the
familiar
home
with
a
clearer
and
clearer
sense
of
inevitable
conclusions
.
She
became
exceptionally
considerate
and
affectionate
with
her
father
and
aunt
,
and
more
and
more
concerned
about
the
coming
catastrophe
that
she
was
about
to
precipitate
upon
them
.
Her
aunt
had
a
once
exasperating
habit
of
interrupting
her
work
with
demands
for
small
household
services
,
but
now
Ann
Veronica
rendered
them
with
a
queer
readiness
of
anticipatory
propitiation
.
She
was
greatly
exercised
by
the
problem
of
confiding
in
the
Widgetts
;
they
were
dears
,
and
she
talked
away
two
evenings
with
Constance
without
broaching
the
topic
;
she
made
some
vague
intimations
in
letters
to
Miss
Miniver
that
Miss
Miniver
failed
to
mark
.
But
she
did
not
bother
her
head
very
much
about
her
relations
with
these
sympathizers
.
