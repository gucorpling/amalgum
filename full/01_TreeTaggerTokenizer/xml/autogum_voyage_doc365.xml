Melbourne/Inner
north
</head>
<p>
Melbourne
's
<hi rend="bold">
inner
north
</hi>
is
a
vibrant
and
diverse
area
,
home
to
a
number
of
cultural
and
social
icons
of
<ref target="Melbourne">
Melbourne
</ref>
.
It
is
famed
for
the
popular
Lygon
Street
Italian
district
,
while
next
door
lies
the
University
of
Melbourne
,
the
best
university
in
Australia
by
many
rankings
.
Numerous
backpackers
subside
in
the
residential
and
cosmopolitan
area
of
North
Melbourne
,
just
outside
the
city
centre
.
Major
tourist
attractions
such
as
the
Melbourne
Museum
,
Royal
Exhibition
Building
and
Melbourne
Zoo
are
in
the
district
.
Much
of
the
area
is
covered
by
parks
,
including
the
huge
Royal
Park
in
the
north
,
the
UNESCO-listed
Carlton
Gardens
and
popular
Princes
Park
.
</p>
<p>
The
area
is
bounded
by
Brunswick
Road
in
the
north
,
Victoria
Street
in
the
south
,
Nicholson
Street
in
the
east
and
the
CityLink
freeway
in

<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Carlton
</hi>
is
the
largest
part
of
the
district
,
and
the
traditional
home
of
Melbourne
's
many
Italian
residents
,
most
of
whom
settled
in
the
city
in
the
wake
of
the
Second
World
War
.
The
area
's
epicentre
is
restaurant-lined
Lygon
Street
.
Besides
dozens
of
Italian
restaurants
and
pizzerias
to
choose
from
,
the
street
is
also
home
to
countless
cafés
,
making
Carlton
somewhat
of
a
pilgrimage
destination
for
Melbourne
's
caffeine
addicts
.
Interspersed
amongst
these
eateries
are
theatres
,
museums
and
numerous
sellers
of
fresh
food
produce
,
which
have
ensured
the
street
remains
one
of
Melbourne
's
most
lively
places
.
Melbourne
Museum
occupies
a
huge
post-modern
complex
in
the
otherwise
tranquil
Carlton
Gardens
,
which
along
with
the
beautiful
Royal
Exhibition
Building
forms
one
of
only
two
of
Australia
's
cultural
<ref target="UNESCO">
UNESCO
</ref>
World
Heritage
sites
.
</p>
<p>
A
large
part
of
the
inner
north
forms
the
city
's
University
district
,
housing
the
world-renowned
and
prestigious
University
of
Melbourne
in
<hi rend="bold">
Parkville
</hi>
.
The
large
student
population
enjoys
the
university
's
wide
variety
of
architecture
,
ranging
from
grand
old
colleges
from
the
1800s
to
ultramodern
structures
of
glass
and
steel
.
Parkville
's
north
is
covered
by
the
massive
expanse
that
is
Royal
Park
,
which
offers
a
peaceful
spot
for
a
picnic
in
an
otherwise
busy
city
.
Melbourne
Zoo
resides
within
the
park
,
housing
hundreds
of
species
from
Australia
and
around
the
world
in
generous
enclosures
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
North
Melbourne
</hi>
is
another
cosmopolitan
locality
,
which
is
still
finding
its
feet
as
one
of
Melbourne
's
cultural
hotspots
.
Mostly
a
residential
area
of
wide
,
grassy
avenues
,
it
is
the
site
of
an
old
town
hall
,
an

strip
of
cafés
and
hidden
bars
and
a
variety
of
budget
and

some
of
them
part

,
which
runs

<p>
Due
to
the
high
student
population
,
cycling
is
a
very
popular
mode
of
transport
,
which
has
pressured
the
government
to
provide
the
appropriate
infrastructure
.
A
segregated
cycleway
runs
along
Swanston
Street
from
the
City
Centre
to
the

Rathdowne
St
,
Arden
St
,
Flemington
Rd
and

Although
it
is
legal
to
ride
on
any
road
,
Lygon

Grattan
Streets
are
generally
unsuited
