Dispose
of
Bacon
Grease
</head>
<p>
Bacon
—
one
of
the
most
delicious
foods
in
the
universe
—
has
a
catch
:
you
should
n't
pour
the
grease
down
the
sink
drain
,
as
depositing
bacon
grease
into
any
part
of
your
plumbing
system
can
lead
to
malfunctioning
pipes
and
even
sewage
backup
disasters
.
So
,
once
you
've
prepared
your
mouth-watering
strips
of
meat
,
what
do
you
do
with
the
pesky
grease
that
's
left
in
the
pan
?
It
's
simple
:
throw
your
bacon
grease
away
in
the
trash
,
re-use
the
grease
to
prepare
another
tasty
treat
,
or
try
cooking
your
bacon
in
the
oven
to
avoid
the
problem
altogether
.

burn
through
your
trash
bag

shatter
a
glass
jar

pour
the
hot
grease
into
the

The
amount
of
grease
you
're
dealing
with
will
determine
your
method
of
removal
.
If
there
is
a
small
amount
of
grease
to
dispose
of
,
use
a
paper
towel
to
wipe
it
out
of
the
pan

in
the
trash

try
to
use
a
container
that
would
not
otherwise
be
recyclable

If
you
do
n't
have
a
container

part
with

scrape
the
grease

the
trash
with
a
rubber
spatula

conclude
by
washing
the
dish

If
you
know
you
're
going
to
be
eating
a
lot
of
bacon
and
tossing
the
grease

think
ahead

Save

make
a

towel
soaked
with
a

amount
of
bacon
grease
can

in
the
trash

or
in
your
compost

A
disposable
container
filled
with
bacon
grease
can

a

Bacon
grease
can
cause
dangerous
burns
.
For
optimal
safety
,
be
sure
to
let
bacon
grease
cool
in
the
pan
before
attempting
to
transfer
it
into
another
container
or
handle
it
in
any
way
.
If
you
must
dispose
of
the
grease
immediately
,
do
so
with
extreme
caution
.
</item>
<item>
Pouring
bacon
grease
down
the
sink
or
flushing
it
in
the
toilet
is
damaging
for
your
pipes
,
and
it
can
cause
sewer
backups
for
yourself
and
others
.
Just
do
n't
do
it
.

<item>
Adding
small
amounts
of
grease
to
your
compost
should
not
have
adverse
effects
.
However
,
if
you
add
large
quantities
of
grease
to
your
compost
,
it
is
probable
that
your
compost
pile
will
become
anaerobic
and
will
therefore
take
much
longer
to
decompose
(
it
will
also
smell
worse
)
