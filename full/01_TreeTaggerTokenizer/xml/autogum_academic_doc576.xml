Electromagnetic
Properties
of
the
SPLD
Ice-Layer
</head>
<p>
The
SPLD
is
predominantly
composed
by
“
dirty
ice
”
that
is
a
mixture
of
water
ice
with
a
variable
volume
fraction
of
dust
.
For
radar
data
interpretation
,
it
is
suitable
to
consider
the
microscopically
complex
mixture
as
macroscopically
homogeneous
and
characterized
by
an
effective
dielectric
permittivity
.
Several
dielectric
models
have
been
proposed
to
estimate
the
permittivity
of
mixtures
from
the
known
dielectric
properties
and
volume
content
of
the
phases
.
In
order
to
explore
different
scenarios
for
the
composition
of
the
SPLD
,
the
dielectric
permittivity
of
pure
water
ice
and
dirty
ice
(
with
different
silicate
dust
volume
fractions
)
is
reported
below
in
terms
of
real
part
of
permittivity
ε
’
and
attenuation
factor
α
,
estimated
using
the
following
formula
:
inversion
procedure
to
retrieve
the
basal
permittivity
(

)
where
is
the
complex
relative
permittivity

Pure
Water
Iice
</head>
<p>
The
dielectric
properties
of
pure
water
ice
have
been
intensively
measured
in
laboratory
over
a
wide
range
of
temperatures
and
frequencies
;
however
,
the
lack
of
a
standard
procedure
in
sample
preparation
and
measuring
methodology
raises
some
questions
about
the
reliability
of
the
experimental
data
.
Indeed
,
the
dielectric
measurements
of
pure
water
ice
are
affected
by
cooling
procedure
,
aging
,
dislocation
,
cracks
and
fractures
,
gas
bubbles
and
inclusions
,
chemical
impurities
,
vacancies
and
other
lattice
imperfections
.
Since
literature
data
are
heterogeneous
in
terms
of
temperature
intervals
and
frequency
ranges
,
the
complex
permittivity
of
pure
water
ice
is
here
assumed
according
to
the
data
provided
by
Kawada
.

Dirty
Ice
</head>
<p>
The
real
and
imaginary
part
of
the
dielectric
permittivity
for
dirty
ice
have
been
retrieved
for
four
different
values
of
silicate
volume
fraction
(
5,10
,
15
and
20
%
)
considering
the
medium
as
a
two-phase
mixture
(
ice/silicate
)
.
The
Maxwell
Garnett
mixing
rule
has
been
applied
to
determine
the
effective
dielectric
properties
of
the
mixtures
:
the
host
medium
is
considered
as
pure
water
ice
and
the
inclusions
are
Martian
meteorite
dust
.

reports
the
attenuation
at
4
MHz
as
a
function
of
temperature
for
dust
,
pure
water
ice
and
dirty
ice
,
evaluated
at
four
different
volume
fractions
(
5
,
10
,
15
and
20
%
)
.
The
pure
water
ice
shows
a
typical
exponential
decay
with
temperature
,
whereas
no
temperature
dependence
is
exhibited
by
the
dust
.
The
behaviour
of
dirty
ice
is
intermediate
between
the
trends
of
water
ice
and
dust
.

Table

reports
the
values
of
the
real
part
of
the
permittivity
of
the
ice
layer
for
the
same
conditions
given
in
<figure>
Figure
2
</figure>
.
It
is
worth
noting
that
the
presence
of
the
dust
in
the
water
ice
also
introduces
a
small
variation
in
the
real
part
of
the
dielectric
permittivity
(
ranging
from
3.1
to
3.9
)
.
These
values
(
permittivity
and
attenuation
)
have
been
used
in
the
inverse
model
to
retrieve
the
basal
material
permittivity
.
