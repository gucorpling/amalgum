Hospital
for
Surgery
</head>
<p>
Finding
the
right
hospital
for
surgery
can
be
a
complicated
task
.
You
should
first
consult
with
your
primary
care
doctor
and
your
insurance
provider
to
determine
which
surgeons
and
facilities
will
meet
your
needs
.
Then
you
should
review
the
different
hospitals
,
looking
at
patient
reviews
and
examining
data
on
things
like
success
and
complication
rates
.
Finally
,
you
should
consult
with
different
surgeons
and
talk
with
them
about
the
procedure
and
if
there
are
any
alternative
treatments
.

Talk
with
your
doctor
.
The
first
step
in
finding
a
surgeon
and
location
for
your
operation
is
talking
with
your
primary
care
provider
.
You
may
need
your
primary
care
doctor
to
write
you
a
referral
to
a
surgeon
.
They
will
likely
recommend
surgeons
and
hospitals
that
they
have
worked
with
in
the
past
.
Often
,
your
choice
of
surgeon
will
determine
your
choice
of
hospital
.

When

are
talking
to
your
doctor
,
ask
things
like
“
Who
would
you
recommend
as
a
surgeon
?
”
and
“
What
hospital
do

”

Check
with
your
insurer
.
After
you
consult
your
doctor
,
you
should
contact
your
insurer
.
Unless
you
are
willing
to
pay
out-of-pocket
for
the
surgery
,
you
will
need
to
make
sure
that
any
surgeon
and
you
go
to
is
in-network
.
Depending
on
the
surgery
,
an
out-of-network
operation
may
end
up
costing
you
thousands
of
dollars
.

Look

hospitals
that

expertise
in
treating
your
condition

To
get
the
best
care
,
you
will
want
to
go
to
a
hospital
that
has
a
reputation
for
treating
your
condition
.
General
hospitals
are
great
for
routine
operations
like
hernias
or
gallbladder
surgery
.
However
,
you
may
need
a
specialty
hospital
if
you
need
something
like
heart
bypass
or
reconstructive
surgery
.
Talk
with
your
primary
care
provider
and
your
insurer
to
find
the
facility
that
meets
your
needs
and
is
affordable
.

Think
about
location

Depending
on
where
you
live

you
might
need
to
travel
for
your
surgery
.
This
could
be
because
where
you
live
does
not
have
the
facilities
or
the
staff
to
perform
your
procedure
.
You
might
also
travel
in
order
to
have
your
surgery
done
by
a
renowned
surgeon
at
a
particular
facility
.
However
,
you
might
also
choose
to
stay
local
in
order
to
have
your
family
and
friends
near
.
Think
about
what
your
expectations
are
for
the
surgery
and
whether
or
not
you
are
willing
to
travel
for
it
.

Review
their
credentials
.
Look
for
a
surgeon
that
has
the
necessary
training
to
perform
the
operation
you
need
.
You
want
a
specialist
certified
by
the
American
Board
of
Medical
Specialties
.
This
tells
you
that
they
received
a
degree
from
a
qualified
medical
school
,
completed
their
residency
,
is
licensed
by
a
state
medical
board
,
and
passed
at
least
on
ABMS
exam
.
You
can
check
the
qualifications
of
your
doctor
by
going
to

.
<figure rend="Become-a-Petite-Model-Step-5.jpg">

<item>
Look
for
red
flags
.
Check
with
your
state
medical
board
to
see
if
your
surgeon
has
had
any
malpractice
claims
or
disciplinary
actions
.
Although
most
surgeons
are
sued
once
or
twice
,
a
specialist
who
has
been
sued
multiple
times
may
be
problematic
.
In
addition
,
multiple
disciplinary
actions
may
be
an
indication
of
substance
abuse
or
a
behavioral
issue
.

Meet
with
the
surgeon
.
Once
you
have
narrowed
down
your
options
,
you
should
schedule
some
consultations
with
various
surgeons
.
Talk
with
them
about
their
success
and
complication
rates
when
performing
your
operation
,
and
ask
them
how
many
of
this
type
of
procedure
they
have
performed
.
You
should
also
talk
with
them
about
their
attitudes
on
an
alternative
to
surgery
.
Finally
,
it
is
important
to
get
a
feel
for
whether
you
trust
this
person
.
Listen
to
your
gut
and
determine
if
you
are
comfortable
with
this
person
potentially
having
your
life
in
their
hands
.
