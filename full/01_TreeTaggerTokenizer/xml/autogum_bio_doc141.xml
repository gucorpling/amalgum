Much
of
her
work
surrounds
the
concepts
of
death
,
rebirth
and
the
duality
of
the
sexes
(
an
area
which
she
has
much
to
comment
on
as
one
of
the
few
famous

When
Vexta
moved
from
her
home
town
of
Sydney
to
Melbourne
in
the
mid-2000s
,
she
was
exposed
to
much
of
the
thriving
underbelly
of
the
local
stencil
culture
,
which
had
been
gaining
notoriety
for
close
to
a
decade
.
Studying
and
working
alongside
infamous
stencil
artists
such
as

and
spraying
her
own
stencils
.

Her
colourful
,
neon-drenched
images
of
fallen
figures
with
feathered
wings
and
her
iconic
kissing
skeletons
took
over
Melbourne
's
streets
and
cemented
her
place
within
the
burgeoning
scene
,
of
which
she
is
now
a
main
figure
.

Her
work
has
been
purchased
by
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Gallery_of_Australia">

was
prominently
featured
in
the

,
&quot;

Vexta
's
motivation
for
stencil
art
is
both
artistic
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socio-political">
socio-political
</ref>
.
She
has
been
documented
as
saying
:
</p>
<p>
&quot;
As
an
artist
you
take
whatever
it
is
you
have
around
you
to
construct
this
thing
that
's
important
but
perhaps
ca
n't
be
expressed
in
language
.
My
paintings
examine
these
intangible
aspects
of
our
lives
such
as
dreams
and
transient
states
;
the
world
around
us
and
our
place
in
it
.

Her
main
aim
in
her
work
is
to
connect
with
the
public
on
an
emotional
level
:
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
want
to
find
and
capture
what
it
is
that
makes
us
human
,
the
soul
of
the
individual
that
is
at
once
personal
but
at
the
same
time
deeply
universal
.

Vexta
has
an
interest
in
creating
geometric
triangle
shapes
which
she
has
likened
to
sub-atomic
particles
that
makes
up
all
matter
.
She
likes
to
leave
a
small
amount
of
blank
space
in
her
street
art
so
the
viewer
can
apply
their
own
viewpoint
to
the
work
of
art
.

She
creates
works
of
art
through
a
psychedelic
lens
often
juxtaposing
humans
and
animals
exploring
themes
of
life/death
,
physics
,
cosmology
and
the
feminine
culture
.
