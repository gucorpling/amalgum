Chapter
III
</head>
<p>
Polly
and
Bingo
always
made
the
audience
“
sit
up
”
when
they
swept
into
the
ring
.
She
was
so
young
,
so
gaily
clad
,
so
light
and
joyous
in
all
her
poses
.
She
seemed
scarcely
to
touch
the
back
of
the
white
horse
,
as
they
dashed
round
the
ring
in
the
glare
of
the
tent
lights
.
The
other
performers
went
through
their
work
mechanically
while
Polly
rode
,
for
they
knew
the
audience
was
watching
her
only
.
</p>
<p>
As
for
Polly
,
her
work
had
never
lost
its
first
interest
.
Jim
may
have
been
right
when
he
said
that
the
spirit
of
the
dead
mother
had
got
into
her
;
but
it
must
have
been
an
unsatisfied
spirit
,
unable
to
fulfil
its
ambition
in
the
body
that
once
held
it
,
for
it
sometimes
played
strange
pranks
with
Polly
.
To-night
,
her
eyes
shone
and
her
lips
were
parted
in
anticipation
,
as
she
leaped
lightly
over
the
many
coloured
streamers
of
the
wheel
of
silken
ribbons
held
by
Barker
in
the
centre
of
the
ring
,
and
by
Toby
and
the
“
tumblers
”
on
the
edge
of
the
bank
.
</p>
<p>
With
each
change
of
her
act
,
the
audience
cheered
and
frantically
applauded
.
The
band
played
faster
;
Bingo
's
pace
increased
;
the
end
of
her
turn
was
coming
.
The
“
tumblers
”
arranged
themselves
around
the
ring
with
paper
hoops
;
Bingo
was
fairly
racing
.
She
went
through
the
first
hoop
with
a
crash
of
tearing
paper
and
cheers
from
the
audience
.
</p>
<p>
“
Heigh
,
Bingo
!
”
she
shouted
,
as
she
bent
her
knees
to
make
ready
for
the
final
leap
.
</p>
<p>
Bingo
's
neck
was
stretched
.
He
had
never
gone
so
fast
before
.
Barker
looked
uneasy
.
Toby
forgot
to
go
on
with
his
accustomed
tricks
.
Jim
watched
anxiously
from
the
entrance
.
</p>
<p>
The
paper
of
one
hoop
was
still
left
unbroken
.
The
attendant
turned
his
eyes
to
glance
at
the
oncoming
girl
;
the
hoop
shifted
slightly
in
his
clumsy
hand
as
Polly
leapt
straight
up
from
Bingo
's
back
,
trusting
to
her
first
calculation
.
Her
forehead
struck
the
edge
of
the
hoop
.
She
clutched
wildly
at
the
air
.
Bingo
galloped
on
,
and
she
fell
to
the
ground
,
striking
her
head
against
the
iron-bound
stake
at
the
edge
of
the
ring
.
</p>
<p>
Everything
stopped
.
There
was
a
gasp
of
horror
;
the
musicians
dropped
their
instruments
;
Bingo
halted
and
looked
back
uneasily
;
she
lay
unconscious
and
seemingly
lifeless
.
</p>
<p>
A
great
cry
went
up
in
the
tent
.
Panic-stricken
,
men
,
women
and
children
began
to
clamber
down
from
their
seats
,
while
others
nearest
the
ground
attempted
to
jump
into
the
ring
.
Barker
,
still
grasping
his
long
whip
,
rushed
to
the
girl
's
side
,
and
shouted
wildly
to
Toby
:
</p>
<p>
“
Say
something
,
you
.
Get
'
em
back
!
”
</p>
<p>
Old
Toby
turned
his
white
face
to
the
crowd
,
his
features
worked
convulsively
,
but
he
could
not
speak
.
His
grief
was
so
grotesque
,
that
the
few
who
saw
him
laughed
hysterically
.
He
could
not
even
go
to
Polly
,
his
feet
seemed
pinned
to
the
earth
.
</p>
<p>
Jim
rushed
into
the
tent
at
the
first
cry
of
the
audience
.
He
lifted
the
limp
form
tenderly
,
and
kneeling
in
the
ring
held
her
bruised
head
in
his
hands
.
</p>
<p>
“
Ca
n't
you
get
a
doctor
!
”
he
shouted
desperately
to
Barker
.
</p>
<p>
“
Here
's
the
doctor
!
”
some
one
called
;
and
a
stranger
came
toward
them
.
He
bent
over
the
seemingly
lifeless
form
,
his
fingers
on
the
tiny
wrist
,
his
ear
to
the
heart
.
</p>
<p>
“
Well
,
sir
?
”
Jim
faltered
,
for
he
had
caught
the
puzzled
look
in
the
doctor
's
eyes
as
his
deft
hand
pressed
the
cruelly
wounded
head
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
ca
n't
tell
just
yet
,
”
said
the
doctor
.
“
She
must
be
taken
away
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Where
can
we
take
her
?
”
asked
Jim
,
a
look
of
terror
in
his
great
,
troubled
eyes
.
</p>
<p>
“
The
parsonage
is
the
nearest
house
,
”
said
the
doctor
.
“
I
am
sure
the
pastor
will
be
glad
to
have
her
there
until
we
can
find
out
how
badly
she
is
hurt
.
”
</p>
<p>
In
an
instant
Barker
was
back
in
the
centre
of
the
ring
.
He
announced
that
Polly
's
injuries
were
slight
,
called
the
attention
of
the
audience
to
the
wonderful
concert
to
take
place
,
and
bade
them
make
ready
for
the
thrilling
chariot
race
which
would
end
the
show
.
</p>
<p>
Jim
,
blind
with
despair
,
lifted
the
light
burden
and
staggered
out
of
the
tent
,
while
the
band
played
furiously
and
the
people
fell
back
into
their
seats
.
The
Roman
chariots
thundered
and
clattered
around
the
outside
of
the
ring
,
the
audience
cheered
the
winner
of
the
race
,
and
for
the
moment
Polly
was
forgotten
.

Chapter
IV
</head>
<p>
THE
blare
of
the
circus
band
had
been
a
sore
temptation
to
Mandy
Jones
all
afternoon
and
evening
.
Again
and
again
it
had
dragged
her
from
her
work
to
the
study
window
,
from
which
she
could
see
the
wonders
so
tantalisingly
near
.
Mandy
was
housekeeper
for
the
Rev.
John
Douglas
,
but
the
unwashed
supper
dishes
did
not
trouble
her
,
as
she
watched
the
lumbering
elephants
,
the
restless
lions
,
the
long-necked
giraffes
and
the
striped
zebras
,
that
came
and
went
in
the
nearby
circus
lot
.
And
yet
,
in
spite
of
her
own
curiosity
,
she
could
not
forgive
her
vagrant
“
worse
half
,
”
Hasty
,
who
had
been
lured
from
duty
early
in
the
day
.
She
had
once
dubbed
him
Hasty
,
in
a
spirit
of
derision
,
and
the
name
had
clung
to
him
.
The
sarcasm
seemed
doubly
appropriate
to-night
,
for
he
had
been
away
since
ten
that
morning
,
and
it
was
now
past
nine
.
