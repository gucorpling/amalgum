Introduction
</head>
<p>
Inverse
scattering
problems
often
involve
identifying
the
specific
characteristics
(
for
example
,
location
,
geometry
,
or
material
properties
)
of
an
unknown
target
from
scattered
or
far-field
data
.
Such
problems
are
of
great
practical
importance
in
fields
such
as
mathematics
,
physics
,
engineering
,
and
biomedical
science
.
However
,
due
to
their
inherent
nonlinearity
and
ill-posedness
,
they
remain
challenging
.
Related
work
can
be
found
in
and
references
therein
.
Attempts
to
address
these
types
of
problems
have
led
to
a
search
for
fast
and
effective
identification
techniques
,
and
various
approaches
have
been
developed
.
Those
include
the
MUltiple
SIgnal
Classification
(
MUSIC
)
algorithm
[
11,12,13,14,15
]
,
the
linear
and
direct
sampling
methods
,
and
topological
derivatives
[
27,28,29,30,31
]
.
We
also
refer
to
various
non-iterative
imaging
techniques
.
</p>
<p>
Kirchhoff
and
subspace
migration
are
also
well-known
non-iterative
techniques
for
finding
location/shape
of
unknown
inhomogeneities
,
and
they
have
been
applied
to
a
variety
of
problems
(
see
[
38,39,40,41,42,43
]
,
for
instance
)
.
Several
studies
have
confirmed
that
they
are
fast
,
stable
,
and
effective
methods
for
finding
various
kinds
of
defects
without
<hi rend="italic">
a
priori
</hi>
information
of
unknown
targets
.
However
,
most
of
these
researches
was
performed
for
homogeneous
background
media
,
and
further
research
is
still
needed
on
the
imaging
performance
of
Kirchhoff
and
subspace
migrations
when
the
unknown
targets
are
surrounded
by
random
scatterers
or
embedded
in
an
inhomogeneous
medium
.
Notice
that
for
subspace
migration
,
some
studies
have
considered
inverse
scattering
problems
in
random
media
,
random
scatterers
,
and
mathematical
theory
for
detecting
point-like
scatterers
with
random
noise
.
However
,
Kirchhoff
migration-based
imaging
in
random
media
and
related
mathematical
theory
has
not
been
considered
yet
.

<p>
In
this
paper
,
we
consider
Kirchhoff
migration
for
localizing
small
electromagnetic
anomalies
surrounded
by
small
random
scatterers
.
We
carefully
analyze
its
imaging
functions
by
discovering
a
relationship
with
the
Bessel
function
of
the
first
kind
of
order
zero
and
one
.
This
enables
us
to
discuss
its
various
properties
and
compare
the
imaging
performance
with
subspace
migration
.
The
analysis
is
based
on
the
structure
of
the
singular
vectors
associated
with
non-zero
singular
values
of
so-called
multi-static
response
(
MSR
)
matrix
and
asymptotic
expansion
formula
in
the
presence
of
small
electromagnetic
defects
.
</p>
<p>
This
paper
is
organized
as
follows
:
In
Section
2
,
we
introduce
the
two-dimensional
direct
scattering
problem
and
asymptotic
expansion
formula
that
holds
in
the
presence
of
small
inhomogeneities
surrounded
by
random
scatterers
.
In
Section
3
,
we
introduce
the
imaging
function
of
Kirchhoff
migration
and
its
mathematical
structure
by
establishing
a
relationship
with
Bessel
function
of
order
zero
and
one
.
On
the
basis
of
analyzed
structure
,
we
discuss
its
intrinsic
properties
for
several
cases
of
anomalies
and
random
scatterers
,
and
compare
the
imaging
performance
with
subspace
migration
.
In
Section
4
,
we
present
some
numerical
simulation
results
to
support
the
analytical
discussion
.
We
apply
various
non-iterative
techniques
for
imaging
of
several
extended
targets
completely
hidden
in
an
inhomogeneous
medium
and
discuss
their
imaging
performances
in
Section
5
.
Finally
,
we
present
our
conclusion
in
Section
6
.
