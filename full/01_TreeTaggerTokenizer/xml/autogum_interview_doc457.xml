I
was
a
<hi rend="italic">
Top
Model
</hi>
fiend
in
the
first
couple
of
cycles
it
was
on
the
air
.
I
loved
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaya%20DaCosta">
Yaya

because
she
was
the
educated

If

could
quickly
summarize
your
experience
on
the
show
,
how
would
you
describe
it

It
was
an
absolutely
memorable
experience
that
I
would
n't
change
for
anything
in
the
world
.
Not
too
many
people
can
they
say
that
they
've
been
a
participant
on
a
television
series
that
has
literally
changed
the
face
of
popular
culture
in
America
and
in
countries
worldwide

What

I
think
everyone
was
really
excited
for
me
.
I
think
their
general
sentiments
are
that
it
's
cool
to
see
someone
that
you
know
inside
and
out
be
put
on
display
for
the
whole
world
to
see
.
I
know
there
were
times
where
I
would
make
certain
faces
or
have
certain
reactions
and
they
would
always
say
,
&quot;
I
know
exactly
what
you
were
thinking
.

<hi rend="bold">

What
were
some
of

specific
pros
and
cons
as

result
of
entering
this
contest
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
WC
:
</hi>
On
the
pro
side
,
I
would
have
to
say
that
the
exposure
is
incredible
.
I
could
n't
imagine
how
I
would
have
been
propelled
into
the
industry
so
quickly
if
I
had
n't
been
on
the
show
.
On
the
con
side
,
I
'm
not
exactly
sure
what
the
show
's
impression
is
on
the
fashion
industry
.
I
try
to
always
remain
positive
,
though
.
I
,
personally
,
have
definitely
used
the
show
to
my
advantage
as
best
I
know
how
.

I
said
before
that
ANTM
has
changed
the
face
of
popular
culture
in
America
and
beyond
and
I
'll
say
it
again
.
We
're
living
in
a
&quot;
Top
Model
Era
.
&quot;
Every
girl
,
woman
,
boy
and
man
wants
to
be
a
model
now
.
But
everyone
cannot
be
a
model
.
Modeling
is
not
just
an
&quot;
easy
&quot;
way
to
bring
in
the
big
bucks
.
It
takes
hard
work
,
dedication
,
some
hustle
,
and
it
's
not
meant
for
everyone
.
I
kind
of
feel
like
ANTM
is
selling
a
false
dream
for
a
lot
of
folks
out
there
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
MH
:
</hi>
Do
you
think
that
in
some
way
the
show
can
lead
to
girls
developing
an
obsession
with
how
they
look
,
their
weight
,
etc
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
WC
:
</hi>
I
have
to
say
no
on
this
one
.
I
applaud
the
show
for
their
consistent
efforts
to
try
to
show
their
viewers
that
beauty
comes
in
all
shapes
,
forms
,
sizes
,
colors
,
and
creeds
.
I
think
that
it
has
actually
had
a
profoundly
positive
effect
on
the
folks
who
watch
.
I
ca
n't
tell
you
how
many
people
stop
me
on
the
street
or
e-mail
me
just
to
thank
me
for
being
a
role
model
and
showing
the
world
that
very
thing
.
