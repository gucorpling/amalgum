Fidel
Castro
's

condition
is
&quot;
satisfactory
&quot;
following
surgery
last
Monday
for
intestinal
bleeding
according
to
Cuban
vice-premier
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos%20Lage">
Carlos
Lage

and
Cuba
's
health
minister
José
Ramón
Balaguer
who
adds
that
it
will
not
be
long
before
the
Cuban
leader
returns
to
work
.
On
Saturday
,
Cuban
parliamentary
speaker
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricardo%20Alcaron">
Ricardo
Alcaron

told
CNN
's
Spanish
service
that
Castro
&quot;
remains
in
stable
condition
&quot;
and
is
&quot;
resting
in
order
to
recover
as
quickly
as
possible
&quot;
.

<p>
Lage
,
who
is
in

for
the
opening
of
that
country
's
constitutional
convention
,
said
that
Castro
sends
the
Bolivian
people
&quot;
fraternal
greetings
&quot;
according
to
Cuban
press
agency
<hi rend="italic">
Prensa
Latina

.
Lage
denied
reports
that
Castro
has
stomach
cancer
and
said
that
the
ailing
leader
had
&quot;
been
made
well
by
the
operation
and
is
recuperating
favourably
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Venezualan
president
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Hugo_Chavez">
Hugo
Chavez
</ref>
sent
his
good
wishes
during
his
weekly
broadcast
saying
&quot;
Fidel
Castro
,
a
hug
for
you
,
friend
and
comrade
and
I
know
you
are
getting
better
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
We
have
reliable
information
of
your
quick
and
notable
recuperation
&quot;
said
Chavez
on
Castro
's
condition
.
In
a
telephone
conversation
with
Bolivian
leader
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eva%20Morales">
Eva
Morales
</ref>
later
in
the
broadcast
,
Chavez
said
of
the
Cuban
leader
&quot;
this
morning
I
learned
that
he
's
very
well
,
that
he
is
already
getting
out
of
bed
,
he
's
talking
more
than
he
should
—
because
he
talks
a
lot
,
you
know
.
He
has
sent
us
greetings

<p>
Castro
,
who
turns
80
later
this
month
,
temporarily
transferred
power
to
his
75
year-old
brother
,

Castro

,
prior
to
his
surgery
,
leading
to
widespread
speculation
in
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_States">
United
States
</ref>
that
he
is
dying
or
dead
.
</p>
<p>
No
pictures
of
Castro
have
been
released
since
his
surgery
was
announced
last
Monday
fuelling
speculation
around
the
world
about
his
condition
.
Acting
Cuban
leader
Raul
Castro
has
also
not
been
seen
in
public
in
the
past
week
.
</p>
<p>
The
island
's
government
has
increased
security
due
to
fears
of
a
US
attack
during
Castro
's
illness
.
US
Secretary
of
State
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Condoleezza_Rice">
Condoleezza
Rice
</ref>
told
NBC
News
&quot;
The
notion
that
somehow
the
United
States
is
going
to
invade
Cuba
,
because
there
are
troubles
in
Cuba
,
is
simply
far-fetched
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Until
temporarily
relinquishing
power
to
his
brother
last
week
,
Fidel
Castro
had
led
the
country
