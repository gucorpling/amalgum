Building
Overview
,
Current
HVAC
system
</head>
<p>
The
building
under
study
is
mostly
office
spaces
.
Building
construction
was
completed
in
1976
.
The
current
HVAC
system
was
commissioned
that
same
year
.
The
building
has
six
floors
with
a
basement
.
Windows
are
very
limited
with
only
two
small
windows
per
floor
and
at
the
front
entrance
.
The
area
distribution
of
the
seven
floors
is
given
in
Table
1
.
</p>
<p>
The
current
HVAC
system
is
a
DFDD
with
electric
heating
and
has
multiple
maintenance
issues
.
A
DFDD
has
two
supply
ducts
running
to
each
conditioned
space
.
One
duct
supplies
cold
air
and
the
other
supplies
warm
air
.
Air
from
both
ducts
is
blended
in
a
mixing
box
to
provide
air
at
a
desired
temperature
to
the
conditioned
space
.
A
generic
diagram
of
a
DFDD
system
is
shown
in
<figure>
Figure

</figure>
.
The
building
has
thermostats
,
which
are
not
programmable
.
The
orientation
of
the
building
entrance
is
south
.
The
building
has
an
addition
on
the
east
side
,
which
has
a
new
HVAC
system
.
For
modeling
purposes
,
however
,
only
the
original
building
with
DFDD
is
considered
.
The
zones
of
the
old
building
and
the
addition
are
separate
.
</p>
<p>
Dual-duct
systems
,
in
general
,
require
more
ductwork
and
dampers
,
and
therefore
occupy
more
space
.
One
of
the
most
problematic
issues
with
dual-duct
systems
is
that
a
volume
of
air
much
larger
than
that
required
by
the
building
,
must
be
cooled
,
heated
,
and
circulated
.
DFDD
systems
tend
to
be
noisier
since
the
noise
and
vibration
associated
with
the
air
passing
over
the
mixing
dampers
are
directly
above
the
conditioned
space
.
In
addition
,
the
dampers
in
dual-duct
mixing
boxes
frequently
leak
,
even
when
they
are
supposed
to
be
fully
closed
.
During
cooling
operation
,
the
leakage
of
the
warm
duct
increases
the
required
energy
for
conditioning
the
space
.
The
leakage
is
a
function
of
construction
quality
and
of
the
duct
static
pressure
.
Leakage
ratios
vary
between
roughly
3
percent
and
20
percent
,
which
is
higher
than
single-duct
systems
.
</p>
<p>
Because
health
professionals
are
present
around
the
clock
,
the
building
is
set
to
be
always
occupied
in
all
design
considerations
.
To
have
a
comparative
study
of
this
building
with
similar
buildings
across
the
US
,
the
electric
energy
utilization
index
(
EUI
)
for
the
building
was
calculated
using
ENERGY
STAR
Portfolio
Manager
.
The
ENERGY
STAR
score
of
the
building
was
found
to
be
39
.
The
site
electric
EUI
was
found
to
be
133.4
kBtu/ft2
,
while
the
US
average
with
similar
office
occupancy
and
conditions
is
44.4
kBtu/ft2
.
Thus
,
the
energy
consumption
of
the
building
was
very
high
,
indicating
a
need
to
lower
the
energy
consumption
.

the
average
local
area
utility
prices
used
for
analysis
.
