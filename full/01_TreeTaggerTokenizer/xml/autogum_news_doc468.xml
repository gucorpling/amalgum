<p>
Celtic
headed
into
this
match
knowing
a
goal
would
send
them
into
the
group
stages
.
</p>
<p>
Celtic
started
well
when
Jan
Vennegoor
of
Hesselink
shouldered
Shunsuke
Nakamura
's
cross
over
the
bar
after
ten
minutes
.
If
the
Dutchman
had
've
been
more
precise
Celtic
could
've
controlled
the
game
from
the
start
.
Five
minutes
later
Scott
McDonald
played
a
one-two
with
Vennegoor
of
Hesselink
who
played
a
good
short
ball
back
which
fell
right
for
McDonald
's
left
foot
but
he
agonisingly
hit
wide
.
It
was
n't
all
Celtic
though
.
Spartak
Moscow
counter-attacked
brilliantly
and
nearly
scored
17
minuted
in
.
Artur
Boruc
made
a
last-ditch
save
and
Lee
Naylor
cleared
after
Vladimir
Bystrov
cut
the
ball
back
to
Dmitri
Torbinsky
just
outside
the
box
.
Just
60
seconds
later
Aiden
McGeady
hit
a
good
shot
wide
of
the
Moscow
goal
.
Then
25
minutes
in
,
the
referee
made
the
worst
decision
of
the
match
.
Welliton
,
the
Brazilian
striker
,
shot
straight
at
Artur
Boruc
and
the
ball
bounced
off
him
and
hit
Gary
Caldwell
's
grounded
hand
.
The
referee
gave
the
penalty
.
There
was
nowhere
for
Caldwell
to
go
and
the
penalty
should
not
have
been
given
.
However
Pavlyuchenko
's
penalty
hit
the
post
.
2
minutes
later
Celtic
showed
no
signs
of
giving
up
.
Scott
McDonald
scored
his
first
Celtic
goal
after
Massimo
Donati
's
shot
deflected
off
a
defender
and
fell
for
McDonald
on
his
stronger
right
foot
.
He
slotted
it
straight
past
the
keeper
to
give
Celtic
a
1-0
lead
.
35
minutes
into
the
match
,
Bystrov
,
who
'd
been
causing
Celtic
,
mainly
Lee
Naylor
,
many
problems
,
sprinted
past
Lee
Naylor
again
and
if
it
was
n't
for
captain
Stephen
McManus
blocking
the
shot
,
it
could
've
been
1-1
.
Just
before
half
time
Spartak
scored
from
a
corner
after
scrappy
Celtic
defending
.
Vennegoor
of
Hesselink
and
Mark
Wilson
could
n't
clear
the
ball
and
Pavlyuchenko
,
who
missed
a
penalty
earlier
,
controlled
and
slotted
the
ball
past
a
very
angry
Artur
Boruc
.
In
first
half
stoppage
time
,
Bystrov
powered
down
the
left
wing
and
Naylor
gave
away
another
corner
,
luckily
though
the
referee
blew
his
whistle
.
But
that
did
n't
stop
Artur
Boruc
from
going
over
to
Lee
Naylor
and
shouting
at
him
.
Lee
Naylor
hit
back
and
if
it
was
n't
for
Caldwell
and
McGeady
breaking
it
up
they
could
've
both
been
sent
off
.
</p>
<p>
The
second
half
started
as
lively
as
the
first
.
Vennegoor
of
Hesselink
was
being
held
in
the
box
in
the
51st
minute
but
no
penalty
was
given
.
The
next
big
chance
was
when
the
ball
fell
for
Vennegoor
of
Hesselink
in
the
65th
minute
,
he
turned
and
dragged
a
point-blank
shot
wide
.
From
the
77th
minute
onwards
the
game
started
to
open
up
with
McDonald
and
Vennegoor
of
Hesselink
having
two
great
chances
before
Nakamura
had
three
chances
in
two
minutes
.
In
the
84th
minute
Nakamura
had
a
chance
to
score
a
free-kick
after
Vennegoor
of
Hesselink
was
taken
down
by
Martin
Stranzl
,
21
yards
out
from
goal
.
Stranzl
was
then
sent
off
by
the
referee
and
Spartak
Moscow
were
left
with
ten
men
for
the
remainder
of
the
match
.
Unfortunately
Nakamura
's
free-kick
hit
McDonald
as
it
made
it
's
way
toward
the
goal
.
Celtic
and
Spartak
both
had
chances
before
the
full
time
whistle
went
.
</p>
<p>
Celtic
were
very
attacking
from
the
start
of
extra
time
.
The
man
advantage
seemed
to
be
helping
Celtic
as
McDonald
and
Vennegoor
of
Hesselink
both
missed
good
chances
in
the
first
five
minutes
.
In
the
99th
minute
Aiden
McGeady
made
a
good
run
down
the
right
wing
to
find
nobody
in
the
box
.
Forced
to
make
a
shot
,
it
ended
it
up
going
off
for
a
throw
in
.
Just
before
extra
time
half
time
Derek
Riordan
,
who
replaced
McGeady
,
picked
up
the
ball
and
slammed
a
brilliant
shot
just
a
yard
wide
on
his
European
début
.
Five
minutes
into
the
second
half
of
extra
time
,
Maksym
Kalynychenko
hit
a
superb
shot
which
Boruc
got
a
vital
touch
to
.
The
ball
then
went
straight
down
to
the
Spartak
box
but
Vennegoor
of
Hesselink
could
only
hit
into
Stipe
Pletikosa
's
hands
.
In
the
24th
minute
,
Celtic
were
gifted
a
penalty
after
Scott
Brown
's
power
shot
struck
Radoslav
Kováč
's
arm
.
Vennegoor
smashed
the
penalty
into
the
bar
.
Six
minutes
later
the
referee
blew
the
whistle
.
The
match
was
going
to
penalties
.
