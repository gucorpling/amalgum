Contributions

to
Vectorial
Capacity
</head>
<p>
Recent
publications
have
explicitly
noted
a
lapse
in
knowledge
on
several
facets
of
vector
ecology
,
such
as
the
relationships
between
environmental
factors
and
disease
ecology
,
vector-host
interactions
and
virus
ecology
,
and
a
disparity
in
findings
that
precipitation
positively
or
negatively
correlates
to
human
infection
with
WNV
.
It
is
becoming
apparent
that
the
net
difference
in
vectorial
capacity
must
be
determined
by
understanding
both
the
ecological
effects
and
altered
biological
components
of
the
vector
.
An
improved
understanding
of
how
environmental
effects
,
heat
,
cold
,
and
dehydration
directly
affect
mosquito
physiology
should
be
emphasized
in
future
research
.
Specific
attention
should
be
placed
on
understanding
the
underlying
components
that
are
associated
with
stress
response
and
compensatory
mechanisms
that
prompt
biological
responses
.

Blood
Feeding
and
Water
Content
Regulation
Influence
Disease
Transmission
Dynamics
</head>
<p>
Blood
feeding
dynamics
are
complex
,
but
,
simply
put
,
they
are
driven
by
reproduction
,
hunger
,
nutritional
status
,
and
water
content
regulation
.
Rapid
dehydration
prompts
similar
expression
patterns
to
that
of
thermal
stress
,
but
slower
dehydration
results
in
altered
trehalose
synthesis
in
other
fly
systems
,
which
is
a
major
blood
sugar
in
flies
,
and
it
is
known
for
its
desiccation-resistant
properties
.
Interestingly
,
dehydration
prompts
an
increase
in
trehalose
breakdown
in
<hi rend="italic">
C.
pipiens
</hi>
,
which
corresponds
to
a
predicted
increase
in
WNV
transmission
.
Likewise
,
we
see
a
reduction
in
the
trehalose
transporter
<hi rend="italic">
Ag
</hi>
TreT1
in
<hi rend="italic">
An
.
gambiae
</hi>
due
to
desiccation
or
heat
exposure
,
which
results
in
a
decreased
infection
of
the
midgut
with
oocysts
of
the
parasite
<hi rend="italic">
Plasmodium
falciparum
</hi>
.
These
findings
indicate
three
themes
:
(

)
desiccation
similarly
affects
gene
regulation
in
prominent
representative
vectors
from
both
the
Culicinae
and
Anophelinae
subfamilies
,
(

)
the
outcome
of
realized
infection
with
arthropod-borne
disease
is
partially
dependent
upon
the
metrics
by
which
infectivity
is
determined
,
and
(

)
ecological
consequences
of
the
underdeveloped
and
sometimes
confounding
interactions
between
dehydration
,
disease
infection
,
and
heat
exposure
dynamics
must
be
addressed
.

Mosquito
Humidity
Sensing
is
Influenced
by
Hydration
Status
and
Likely
Contributes
to
altered
Pathogen
Transmission
</head>
<p>
Dry
heat
has
been
attributed
to
the
activation
of
mosquitoes
,
but
moist-heat
has
been
implicated
in
increased
probing
behavior
.
As
the
time
devoid
of
water
increases
,
mosquitoes
discriminate
less
on
the
source
of
a
bloodmeal
,
and
,
once
a
host
is
found
,
the
feeding
rates
of
mosquitoes
in
higher
temperatures
likewise
increases
.
Interestingly
,
dehydration
phenotypes
may
drive
sensing
that
is
associated
with
humidity
and
perspiring
hosts
,
both
of
which
have
been
suggested
as
important
host
cues
.
Although
humidity
sensing
in
insects
,
outside
of
<hi rend="italic">
Drosophila
</hi>
,
is
under
researched
,
important
candidate
genes
within
the
mosquito
2La
inversion
polymorphism
have
been
identified
.
These
genes
include
an
ionotropic
glutamate
receptor
,
which
is
similar
to
some
<hi rend="italic">
D.
melanogaster
</hi>
ionotropic
receptors
that
have
been
implicated
in
hygro-
or
thermo-sensation
(
such
as
IR25a
,
IR40a
,
or
IR93a
)
;
and
,
a
heat
shock
protein
(
Hsp90
)
that
has
also
been
implicated
in
increased
desiccation
tolerance
in
<hi rend="italic">
C.
pipiens
</hi>
.
As
many
conserved
chemosensory
genes
exist
in
insects
,
hygrosensation
receptor
candidates
may
also
be
conserved
.
For
example
,
an
odorant
binding
protein
(
Obp59a
)
contributed
to
humidity-sensing
in
<hi rend="italic">
Drosophila
</hi>
and
it
was
proposed
as
a
candidate
for
disease
control
methods
as
well
as
a
proxy
for
climate
change
progress
in
mosquitoes
.
Associations
between
humidity
sensing
,
host-preference
,
and
disease
transmission
in
mosquitoes
are
severely
wanting
,
but
recent
studies
indicate
new
focus
in
the
area
.

Alternative
Perspectives
:
Utilizing
Environmental
Stressors
as
a
Proxy
for
Behavioral
and
Biological
Adaptation
to
Insecticide
Resistance
</head>
<p>
Stressors
,
such
as
dehydration
,
starvation
,
temperature
,
infection
status
,
and
insecticide
exposure
,
can
contribute
to
compensatory
alterations
in
factors
,
such
as
feeding
behavior
,
survival
,
vectorial
capacity
,
fecundity
,
longevity
,
and
activity
.
Theoretically
,
these
stressors
(
disregarding
insecticide
exposure
)
have
acted
upon
mosquitoes
for
over
150
million
years
,
in
such
time
,
mosquitoes
have
become
exceptionally
efficient
vectors
for
a
plethora
of
pathogens
.
Mosquitoes
still
possess
the
ability
to
establish
insecticide
resistance
and
persist
although
mosquito
control
methods
have
existed
for
less
than
a
millionth
of
that
time
.
It
may
be
—
through
inherent
susceptibilities
,
recurrent
exposure
,
and
conserved
responses
to
stressors
—
that
mosquitoes
have
developed
an
exceptional
ability
to
adapt
and
overcome
stress
.
These
adaptive
abilities
are
of
great
concern
regarding
insecticide
application
,
but
also
provide
a
unique
opportunity
to
study
how
mosquitoes
respond
to
a
relatively
new
stressor
in
reference
to
preexisting
stressors
.
</p>
<p>
Over
time
,
the
selective
pressures
for
resistance
that
are
prompted
by
pesticide
administration
begin
to
place
the
success
of
control
programs
at
risk
,
where
more
than
half
of
the
malaria
vectors
have
already
developed
pyrethroid
resistance
in
less
than
a
single
decade
.
In
one
such
scenario
,
the
LT50
for
<hi rend="italic">
An
.
gambiae
</hi>
that
was
treated
with
deltamethrin
increased
by
2.6-fold
in
just
over
four
months
.
By
researching
both
insecticide
and
conserved
stress
responses
in
mosquitoes
,
novel
strategies
regarding
stressor
combinations
and
underlying
genetic
components
may
be
elucidated
.
Regardless
of
the
stressor
,
be
it
insecticidal
or
environmental
,
responses
should
be
comprehensively
researched
and
directly
compared
to
one
another
.
