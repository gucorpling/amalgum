Prune
Ferns
</head>
<p>
Ferns
are
relatively
easy
to
prune
.
You
can
prune
them
in
early
spring
before
the
new
growth
begins
,
or
even
when
the
new
growth
comes
in
.
If
you
want
to
create
a
shape
,
you
can
trim
around
the
edges
of
the
plant
.
When
growing
ferns
indoors
,
just
be
sure
to
cut
off
dead
or
dried
fronds
when
they
appear
.

Check
the
pruning
information
for
your
specific
plant
.
Some
ferns
,
such
as
the
Giant
Chain
Fern
,
do
not
do
well
with
spring
pruning
.
It
's
best
to
let
the
old
foliage
die
out
by
itself
in
mid-summer
.
If
you
do
n't
,
you
can
cause
damage
to
the
plant
.

Cut
back
the
old
foliage
early
in
the
spring
to
make
pruning
easier
.
It
's
easiest
to
cut
back
the
fern
in
the
spring
before
the
new
leaves
emerge
.
You
should
be
able
to
see
the
tightly
rolled
fiddleheads
,
also
known
as
crosiers
,
in
a
crown
on
the
plant
.
Cut
the
foliage
just
above
the
crown
with
a
sharp
pair
of
gardening
shears
.

The
old
foliage
will
likely
not
look
as
pretty
as
new
foliage
in
the
height
of
summer
.

Trim
the
dead
branches
after
the
new
growth
comes
in
.
Alternatively
,
you
can
wait
until
the
new
growth
comes
in
to
cut
off
the
old
fronds
.
It
's
best
to
do
this
early
in
the
season
.
Shear
off
the
dead
fronds
near
the
crown
to
make
your
plant
healthier
and
prettier
.
<figure rend="Prune Ferns Step 3.jpg">

<item>
You
can
also
cut
out
any
older
fronds
that
are
n't
dead
yet
but
look
a
little
bedraggled
.

Cut
the
outer
edges
of
the
fronds
to
create
a
desired
shape
.
If
you
do
n't
like
the
way
your
fern
is
shaped
,
simply
trim
the
outer
edges
until
it
's
to
your
liking
.
Use
sharp
scissors
or
kitchen
shears
to
do
the
trimming
.
<figure rend="Prune Ferns Step 4.jpg">

It
's
best
to
only
trim
the
outer
edges
after
you
've
removed
yellowing
or
dead
fronds
.
</item>
<item>
Keep
in
mind
that
the
tips
turn
brown
if
you
clip
off
the
edges
.

Trim
a
transplanted
fern
by
half
to
help
it
thrive
.
When
you
move
a
fern
,
it
may
need
some
help
getting
settled
in
its
new
location
.
Cut
back
all
the
fronds
by
half
,
reducing
the
water
your
fern
needs
to
support
itself
.
<figure rend="Prune Ferns Step 5.jpg">

This
technique
lets
the
plant
focus
more
attention
on
getting
its
roots
settled
.
</item>
<item>
Do
n't
worry
.
Once
the
plant
is
settled
,
it
will
grow
back
.

Avoid
pruning
right
before
winter
.
It
can
be
tempting
to
cut
off
dead
or
dying
fronds
at
the
beginning
of
winter
.
However
,
those
fronds
help
protect
the
root
crown
throughout
the
winter
.

In
other
words
,
leaving
the
old
fronds
in
place
can
help
your
fern
survive
through
the
cold
of
winter
and
return
in
the
spring
.

Cut
off
dead
fronds
as
they
appear
.
Use
a
sharp
pair
of
scissors
to
cut
the
fronds
.
Dead
fronds
will
be
brown
or
black
.
Cut
them
near
the
base
of
the
frond
,
just
above
the
joint
.
You
can
use
a
sharp
pair
of
scissors
or
a
small
pair
of
garden
shears
.
<figure rend="Prune Ferns Step 7.jpg">

Remove
any
fronds
infected
with
scales
.
Scales
are
tiny
insects
that
attack
your
plants
.
They
are
small
,
reddish
brown
,
and
flat
.
<figure rend="Prune Ferns Step 8.jpg">

<list type="unordered">
<item>
When
scales
attack
the
plant
,
the
leaves
will
likely
turn
yellow
and
may
weaken
.
Look
for
scales
on
the
underside
of
leaves
along
the
vein
or
on
the
stems
.
</item>
<item>
Scales
can
spread
,
so
remove
any
fronds
you
see
with
shears
or
scissors
.
If
you
have
a
bad
infestation
,
you
may
need
to
throw
out
the
houseplant
so
the
scales
do
n't
spread
to
other
houseplants
.
</item>
<item>
Outdoor
ferns
also
get
scales
,
but
you
should
try
controlling
them
with
oil-based
spray
pesticides
instead
of
pruning
.

Chop
the
root
runners
that
hang
over
the
side
of
the
pot
.
Some
ferns
will
get
&quot;
runners
,
&quot;
sort
of
like
a
strawberry
plant
,
except
these
are
part
of
the
plant
's
root
system
.
These
will
be
brown
and
woody
.
Chop
them
near
the
soil
in
the
pot
with
shears
or
scissors
to
increase
the
health
of
your
plant
.

These
runners
are
draining
energy
from
your
plant
.
By
cutting
them
,
you
're
letting
your
plant
focus
on
other
vital
areas
.

<item>
Cut
back
to
the
base
if
desired
.
If
you
are
not
liking
the
look
of
your
plant
at
all
,
you
can
cut
it
down
to
just
above
the
crown
,
much
as
you
do
with
an
outdoor
fern
.
Use
sharp
,
clean
scissors
to
cut
off
the
fronds
.

The
fern
will

from
the
crown
,
if
you
let
it
remain
