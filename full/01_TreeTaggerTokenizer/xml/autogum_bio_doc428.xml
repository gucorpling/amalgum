<p>
In
1595
Bownde
published
the
first
edition
of
his
treatise
on
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Sabbath">
Sabbath
</ref>
.
In
it
he
maintained
that
the
seventh
part
of
our
time
ought
to
be
devoted
to
the
service
of
God
;
that
Christians
are
bound
to
rest
on
the

as
much
as
the
Jews
were
on
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_Sabbath">
Mosaical
Sabbath
</ref>
.
He
contended
that
Sabbath
was
profaned
by
interludes
,
May-games
,
morris
dances
,
shooting
,
bowling
,
and
similar
sports
;
and
he
would
not
allow
any
feasting
on
that
day
,
though
an
exception
was
made
in
favour
of
'
noblemen
and
great
personages
'

The
observance
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord's_Day">
Lord
's
Day
</ref>
became
a
question
between
the
high-church
party
and
the
puritans
,
an
early
disagreement
on
doctrine
.
The
Sabbatarian
question
was
noticed
by
the
bishops
,
and
they
cited
several
ministers
before
the
ecclesiastical
courts
for
preaching
it
.
But
the
strict
Sabbatarian
doctrine
spread
