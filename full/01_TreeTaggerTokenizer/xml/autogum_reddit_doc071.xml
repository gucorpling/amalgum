Autistic
people
must
feel
really
shitty
about
how
some
parents
would
rather
risk
spreading
deadly
illnesses
into
the
population
than
have
a
child
like
them

I
do
n't
disagree
but
how
is
this
not
a
political
post
?
Every
time
I
post
something
remotely
related
to
issues
considered
politicized
it
is

On
the
spectrum
.
Those
of
us
who
are
alive
and
well
get
a
lot
of
contempt
from
them
too
.
</p>
<p>
You
poor
dear
,
oh
you
must
suffer
all
the
time
.
Your
poor
parents
.
</p>
<p>
Have
you
tried
bleach
enemas
?
</p>
<p>
Well
that
's
what
your
parents
get
for
vaccinating
.
</p>
<p>
And
the
ones
that
pretend
you
're
not
there
,
even
at
social
engagements
.
Sometimes
they
mean
well
.
The
TV
told
then
we
need
to
be
left
alone
,
or
that
they
ca
n't
banter
with
us
because
it
hurts
our
feelings
.
I
've
dedicated
my
life
to
being
able
to
banter
,
because
the
alternative
is
deep
social
isolation
.
But
a
lot
of
time
they
've
just
been
told
you
're
autistic
and
that
makes
you
dirty
somehow
.
My
girlfriend
was
hesitant
for
ages
to
tell
people
that
I
was
on
the
spectrum
in
case
they
thought
she
was
,
what
's
the
word
for
this
,
a
short
bus
snatcher
?
In
cases
like
mine
,
people
ca
n't
even
tell
an
adult
is
in
the
spectrum
unless
someone
mentions
it
.

**Tl

dr
:
For
the
hundredth
time
I
'm
not
doing
that
to
my
intestines
Jenny
,
I
'm
a
functioning
adult

We
do
n't
vaccinate
but
not
because
we
are
worried
about
autism
.
I
personally
believe
there
is
no
link
to
autism
and
vaccines
,
and
any
perceived
link
comes
from
a
broadening
of
the
medical
definition
of
autism
.

What
even
led
to
autism
have
such
a
massive
massive
stigma
that
it
became
this
whole
movement
driven
by
lies
?
Like
I
get
that
it
can
be
hard
to
be
a
parent
to
an
autistic
child
,
but
there
are
a
number
of
other
conditions
that
are
also
difficult
to
deal
with
.
Why
is
autism
such
a
bogeyman
to
anti-vaxxer
white
suburban
moms
and
how
did
it
get
this
point
?

Am
Autistic
,
ca
n't
confirm
.
To
me
,
and
I
'd
guess
plenty
of
others
on
the
spectrum
,
it
's
just
infuriating
that
so
many
people
do
n't
know
what
they
're
talking
about
when
it
comes
to
vaccines
OR
Autism
.
Does
n't
make
me
feel
bad
about
myself
at
all
,
it
is
unfortunate
that
people
are
uninformed
but
I
believe
that
awareness
of
the
Spectrum
overall
is
becoming
WAY
more
prevalent
.
