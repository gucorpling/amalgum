Ramsgate
forms
part
of
the
Isle
of
Thanet
and
is
closely
associated
with
its
neighbouring
towns
of
<ref target="Broadstairs">
Broadstairs
</ref>
and
<ref target="Margate">
Margate
</ref>
.
The
town
's
heyday
was
the
Regency
and
Victorian
eras
when
the
well-heeled
would
holiday
in
the
town
,
savouring
its
genteel
culture
.
Nowadays
the
town
remains
a
popular
destination
and
has
much
to
offer
visitors
.
</p>
<p>
Ramsgate
exists
in
an
area
that
has
been
crucial
to
British
history
.
Just
down
the
road
at
Richborough
is
the
site
of
the
Claudian
Invasion
of
43
AD
and
evidence
of
Roman
settlement
in
Ramsgate
was
found
as
recently
as
the
nineteenth
century
.
Viking
chieftains
Hengist
and
Horsa
landed
at
Ebbsfleet
in
Pegwell
Bay
in
449
AD
and
were
given
the
Isle
of
Thanet
by
Vortigern
as
thanks
for
their
help
in
the
first
stages
of
the
Anglo-Saxon
invasion
of
Britain
.
In
597
AD
,
St
Augustine
landed
at
Ebbsfleet
on
his
mission
to
convert
Britain
to
Christianity
and
later
became
the
first
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
.
</p>
<p>
In
1483
,
Ramsgate
was
adopted
as
a
limb
of
Sandwich
and
by
association
,
a
member
of
the
Cinque
Ports
Confederation
.
Ramsgate
developed
as
a
result
of
growing
trade
and
prosperity
in
the
17th
century
.
Throughout
the
18th
century
many
elegant
Georgian
townhouses
,
Nelson
and
Wellington
Crescents
on
the
east
and
west
cliffs
,
and
many
small
squares
were
built
.
Ramsgate
was
a
fashionable
place
to
stay
in
Regency
times
and
became
the
haunt
of
many
writers
,
artists
and
philanthropists
.
</p>
<p>
A
harbour
was
built
in
the
town
was
as
a
result
of
the
1703
Great
Storm
.
It
was
n't
until
King
George
IV
used
the
town
as
his
departure
point
for
a
trip
to
Hanover
in
1821
that
the
'
Royal
'
title
was
bestowed
,
after
the
King
became
so
impressed
by
his
welcome
to
the
town
.
During
the
Napoleonic
Wars
,
Ramsgate
was
a
garrison
town
with
thousands
of
troops
going
back
and
forth
to
various
battles
.
In
both
the
world
wars
,
Ramsgate
was
one
of
the
first
places
in
Britain
to
be
bombed
by
the
Germans
.
During
the
1940
Dunkirk
Evacuation
,
the
town
acted
as
the
central
port
for
the
rescue
of
the
troops
from
France
.
</p>
<p>
Ramsgate
's
harbour
is
still
a
working
one
with
the
advent
of
the
Thanet
Wind
Farm
.
It
still
has
a
small
fishing
community
,
busy
slipways
and
a
port
offering
cross-channel
ferry
routes
to
the
continent
.
Ramsgate
's
heyday
has
long
since
passed
,
in
common
with
many
seaside
towns
,
but
it
has
a
rich
history
,
stunning
views
and
architecture
,
and
a
vibrant
cafe
culture
that
surprises
many
who
visit
the
town
.

</p>
<p>
Both
routes
will
take
around
2-2Â½
hours
to
reach
Ramsgate
.
While
there
are
occasional
direct
services
,
on
the
North

mainline
most
services
comprise
an
8-carriage
train
and
separate
at
Faversham
to

two

travels

down
to
<ref target="Canterbury%20%28England%29">

Likewise
,
8-
and
12-carriage
trains
separate
at
Ashford
International
and
most
visitors
to
Ramsgate
choose
the
Canterbury
West
route
.
If
you
find
yourself
on
the
longer
coastal
Dover
route
(
usually
marked

you
will

eventually
arrive
in

In

The
Royal
Harbour
</hi>
.
The
town
of
Ramsgate
has
the
only
designated
Royal
Harbour
in
the
whole
of
the
United
Kingdom
.
The
harbour
dates
back
to
the
18th
century
and
was
given
its
royal
status
by
King
George
IV
in
1821
when
he
received
a
rapturous
reception
by
the
townspeople
after
he
chose
the
port
as
his
point
of
departure
and
return
for
a
trip
to
his
native
Hanover
with
the
Royal
Yacht
Squadron
.
An
obelisk
commemorating
the
King
's
trip
stands
near
the
Maritime
Museum
.
The
construction
of
the
harbour
began
in
1749
and
was
completed
in
1850
after
several
different
stages
of
development
.
Some
aspects
of
the
harbour
were
the
work
of
John
Shaw
and
his
son
,
John
Shaw
Jnr
,
most
prominent
among
these
being
the
lighthouse
on
the
western
harbour
arm
.
The
harbour
was
an
important
embarkation
point
during
the
Napoleonic
Wars
and
played
a
vital
role
during
the
1940
Dunkirk
Evacuations
:
it
was
from
here
and
Dover
that
many
of
the
&quot;
Little
Ships
&quot;
plied
their
way
across
the
English
Channel
to
help
rescue
the
stranded
Allied
forces
from
the
beaches
at
Dunkirk
in
the
face
of
the
oncoming
Nazi
hordes
;
in
the
harbour
stands
a
memorial
to
the
event
and
moored
at
the
nearby
George
IV
memorial
pontoon
is
the
<hi rend="italic">
MY
Sundowner
</hi>
,
one
of
the
&quot;
Little
Ships
&quot;
that
was
once
owned
by
the
2nd
Officer
of
the
<hi rend="italic">
Titanic
</hi>
,
Charles
Lightoller
.
Today
,
the
harbour
has
one
of
the
most
vibrant
yacting
marinas
on
the
south
coast
and
,
thanks
to
the
nearby
offshore
Thanet
Wind
Farm
,
remains
a
working
harbour
.
An
extension
to
the
harbour
allows
cross-channel
ferries
to
berth
at
Ramsgate
and
LD
Lines
(
cars
only
)
TransEuropa
Ferries
(
predominantly
freight
)
run
services
to
Oostende
in
Belgium

<item>
<hi rend="bold">
The
Maritime
Museum
</hi>
.
Dominant
over
much
of
the
harbour
is
the
characteristic
Maritime
Museum
.
Built
in
1817
by
Benjamin
Wyatt
and
George
Louch
,
the
building
was
built
as
the
harbour
clock
house
.
In
the
1980s
,
it
was
turned
into
the
town
's
maritime
museum
,
containing
four
galleries
examining
the
maritime
history
of
the
local
area
as
well
as
describing
the
development
of
the
eponymous
harbour
.
Also
featured
are
many
artefacts
from
the
various
shipwrecks
of
the
treacherous
Goodwin
Sands
.
The
building
is
also
the
site
of
the
unique
Ramsgate
Meridian
,
where
the
town
's
own
Mean
Time
was
calculated
as
being
5
minutes

41
seconds
ahead
of

The
Smeaton
Dry
Dock
</hi>
.
Another
point
of
interest
around
the
harbour
is
the
Smeaton
Dry
Dock
.
A
pioneer
of
civil
engineering
,
John
Smeaton
was
asked
to
design
a
dry
dock
for
the
harbour
and
work
started
in
the
mid-1780s
.
The
building
of
the
dock
was
to
be
Smeaton
's
last
project
;
he
was
to
die
in
the
post
of

Awarded

Tunnels
</hi>

As
the

approached
,
Ramsgate
Borough
Council
embarked
on
ambitious
but
controversial
plans
to
create
a
network
of
Deep
Shelter
tunnels
linking
to
a
former
Railway
Tunnel
which
would
provide
shelter
for
60,000
people
.
Despite
resistance
from
government
the
plan
was
given
the
go-ahead
and
the
network
was
formally
opened
by
the
Duke
of
Kent
on
1
June
1939
.
The
tunnels
are
again
open
to
the
public

You
