has

</ref>
.
The
U.N.
chief
is
recently
back
from
Africa
where
he
attended
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African%20Union">
African
Union
</ref>
summit
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia">

</ref>
and
met
with

in

.
</p>
<p>
On
rebel
efforts
to
overthrow
the
government
in
Chad
in
recent
days
,
the
secretary-general
welcomed
an
African
Union
initiative
to
have
the
leaders
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya">
Libya
</ref>
and
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic%20Republic%20of%20Congo">
Democratic
Republic
of
Congo
</ref>
mediate
the
crisis
.
He
says
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United%20Nations">
United
Nations
</ref>
will
do
its
utmost
to
help
resolve
the
crisis
,
urging
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security%20Council">
Security
Council
</ref>
to
act
swiftly
to
help
bring
an
end
to
the
violence
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
It
has
devastating
consequences
not
only
for
the
people
of
Chad
and
Darfurian
refugees
seeking
shelter
there
,
but
also
for
Darfur
itself
,
&quot;
said
Ban
.
</p>
<p>
Mr.
Ban
told
reporters
the
situation
in
the
neighboring
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darfur">
Darfur
</ref>
region
of
Sudan
is
no
less
troubling
.
He
says
the
deployment
of
the
AU-U.N
.
peacekeeping
force
,
known
as
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNAMID">
UNAMID
</ref>
,
must
be
sped
up
and
urged
member
states
to
properly
equip
the
troops
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
UNAMID
still
lacks
required
aviation
and
ground
transportation
-
chiefly
helicopters
.
Additional
troops
will
not
make
up
for
this
shortfall
,
&quot;
said
Ban
.
&quot;
Those
countries
that
called
for
intervention
in
Darfur
are
under
special
obligation
to
deliver
on
their
promises
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
While
at
the
AU
summit
,
Mr.
Ban
says
he
discussed
some
of
the
outstanding
issues
affecting
the
deployment
with
Sudanese
President
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar%20al-Bashir">
Omar
al-Bashir
</ref>
,
and
he
expects
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status%20of%20Forces%20Agreement">
Status
of
Forces
Agreement
</ref>
(
SOFA
)
to
be
signed
this
week
.
But
Mr.
Ban
remained
vague
on
whether
some
of
the
agreement
's
sticking
points
-
such
as
night
flights
,
land
agreements
,
and
advance
notice
of
U.N.
movements
-
had
been
settled
.
</p>
<p>
On
Kenya
,
Mr.
Ban
says
he
has
been
deeply
engaged
in
the
post-election
crisis
and
told
political
leaders
during
his
visit
there
that
they
bear
particular
responsibility
for
the
future
of
Kenya
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
stressed
to
all
the
Kenyan
leaders
the
need
to
stop
the
unacceptable
violence
and
killings
,
and
to
resolve
their
differences
through
dialogue
and
democratic
process
.
I
also
appealed
to
all
the
political
leaders
to
think
beyond
their
individual
interests
or
party
lines
and
to
look
to
the
future
of
Kenya
as
one
country
,
&quot;
he
said
.
</p>
<p>
Mr.
Ban
also
met
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nairobi">
Nairobi
</ref>
with
his
U.N.
predecessor
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kofi%20Annan">
Kofi
Annan
</ref>
,
who
is
leading
the
panel
of
eminent
Africans
trying
to
mediate
the
crisis
,
and
said
they
discussed
his
roadmap
for
the
talks
.
</p>
<p>
Security
of
U.N.
personnel
in
Africa
and
elsewhere
has
been
high
on
the
secretary-general
's
agenda
,
especially
in
the
wake
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December%2011,%202007%20Algiers%20bombings">
December
bombing
</ref>
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria">
Algeria
</ref>
that
killed
17
staff
members
.
Mr.
Ban
announced
that
he
is
naming
diplomat
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakhdar%20Brahimi">
Lakhdar
Brahimi
</ref>
to
chair
an
independent
panel
on
safety
and
security
of
U.N.
personnel
and
premises
.
Brahimi
is
an
Algerian
,
but
Mr.
Ban
says
he
has
no
concerns
about
his
fairness
or
objectivity
in
heading
up
the
panel
.
