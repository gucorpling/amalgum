Keep
an
Astronomy
Observing
Log
</head>
<p>
From
the
time
humans
have
observed
the
night
sky
,
they
have
kept
records
of
their
observations
in
various
forms
:
stone
,
clay
tablets
,
papyrus
,
parchment
,
tapestries
,
and
paper
.
These
observation
logs
have
led
to
scientific
discoveries
,
such
as
Edmond
Halley
's
discovery
that
comets
are
solar
system
objects
with
their
own
orbits
;
and
cultural
practices
,
such
as
the
12-year
cycle
of
the
Chinese
zodiac
,
inspired
in
part
by
the
orbital
period
of
the
planet
Jupiter
.
Keeping
a
log
of
your
astronomical
observations
can
help
you
distinguish
objects
,
much
as
Charles
Messier
's
catalog
helped
him
distinguish
nebulae
,
star
clusters
,
and
galaxies
from
the
comets
that
interested
him
,
and
provide
a
written
record
you
can
use
to
corroborate
or
refute
weather
forecasts
and
to
recall
memorable
observations
,
such
as
meteor
showers
and
auroras
.
Following
our
steps
and
suggestions
on
how
to
keep
an
astronomy
observing
log
of
your
own
.

Choose
a
record
keeping
medium
that
works
for
you
.
You
can
keep
an
observing
log
either
on
paper
or
on
computer
.
A
paper
log
is
easier
to
take
into
the
field
with
you
than
is
a
laptop
computer
,
although
you
may
find
it
easier
to
keep
records
on
a
computer
than
in
printed
form
.
Computer-based
astronomy
record
keeping
programs
offer
the
options
of
pre-printed
log
forms
and
the
ability
to
generate
reports
,
as
well
as
an
astronomical
database
that
can
help
you
identify
objects
and
the
ability
to
search
your
own
records
to
track
the
positions
of
planets
and
comets
over
time
.

You
may
want
to
use
several
methods
,
such
as
a
small
notebook
you
carry
into
the
field
on
which
you
make
notes
,
which
you
transcribe
to
either
a
larger
notebook
or
binder
or
onto
a
computer
.
</item>
<item>
Some
amateur
astronomers
like
to
include
sketches
with
their
notes
.
If
you
're
one
of
them
,
you
'll
need
to
have
a
hard
surface
under
your
note-taking
paper
,
such
as
a
small
clipboard
.
</item>
<item>
Several
websites
offer
pre-printed
astronomy
log
forms
you
can
use
to
record
your
observations
on
.
One
such
site
is
that
run
by
the
American
Association
of
Amateur
Astronomers
(

Record
your
observations
in
your
astronomy
log
as
soon
as
you
can
.
The
sooner
you
can
commit
your
observation
to
print
or
computer
,
the
more
accurate
your
records
will
be-�not
to
mention
that
you
may
forget
to
do
so
entirely
if
you
wait
too
long
.
This
is
where
taking
a
simple
notepad
into
the
field
with
you
may
help
.

Record
all
the
information
appropriate
to
your
observation
.
This

of
the
following
:

<list type="unordered">
<item>
The
day
and
date
of
your
observation
session
.
You
can
record
the

in
either
American
format
(
month
,
day
,
year
)
or
European/military
format
(
day
,
month
,
year
)
,
although
you
may
want
to
write
out
or
use
the
abbreviation

to
avoid
confusion
on
the
part
of
others
who
may
read
your
observing
log
.

times
your
observing
session
began
and
ended

Time
should
be
expressed
in
Universal

apparent
field
of
view
,
and
any

note
how
images
compare
with
and
without
the
filter
.
</item>
<item>
What
you
were
observing
,
including
a
detailed
physical
description
and/or

Include
an
estimate
of
the
object
's
size
based
on
the
angular
field
of
view
of
your
telescope
's
eyepiece
.
If
the
object
is
a
comet
,
name
the
constellation
the
comet
appears
in
and
the
constellations
you
searched
to
find
it
.
If
the
object
is
a
star
cluster
,
include
a
count

how
many
stars
you
can

.
If

</item>
<item>

moonlight
,
which
can
affect
how
well
you

.
You
can
also
include

you
can
see
directly
overhead
(
transparency
)
and
the
approximate
arc-second
diameter
of
star
images
(
seeing

.
</item>
<item>
The
local
weather
conditions
,
including
the
percentage
of
cloud
cover
,
and
any
mist
,

</item>
<item>
You
can
also
include
non-astronomical
observations
such
as
the
presence
of
wildlife
or
sources
of
light
or
other
pollution
that
hamper
your
ability
to
see
the
sky
.
If
you
're
sharing
your
observing
session
with
other
amateur
astronomers
,
you
may
want
to
include
their
names
and
notes
on
their
equipment
for
posterity
.
You
can
also
include
personal
thoughts

You
may
want
to
develop
a
code
for
recording
your
observations
,
such
as
&quot;
CH
&quot;
to
indicate
you
were
hunting
for
comets
during
an
observing
session
.
If
you
do
,
include
a
translation
key
for
anyone
else
who
might
read
your
records
.
</item>
<item>
Consider
using
a
headband
or
neckband
light
when
doing
your
astronomical
observations
so
that
you
have
both
hands
free
to
write
notes
or
make
a
sketch
in
your
observing
log
.
You
can
place
a
red
cellophane
filter
over
the
lens
,
and
there
are
headband
lights
available
with
switch
controls
to
display
either
a
red
or
a
white
light
.

In
addition
to
providing
a
source
of
freeware
astronomy
observing
log
programs
,
the
Internet
also
features
sites
where
you
can
post
your
astronomical
observations
for
other
astronomers
to
share
.
Some
,
such
as
AstronomyLog.com
let
you
post
your
observations
for
free
and
,
for
a
fee
,
will
help
you
track
your
progress
in
whatever
observing
program
you
're
taking
part
in
.

<item>
Consider
taking
part
in
an
observing
program
.
Local
astronomy
clubs
and
national
organizations
such
as
the
American
Association
of
Amateur
Astronomers
have
observing
programs
for
amateur
astronomers
ranging
from
the
novice
to
the
advanced
level
,
the
best
known
being
to
observe
all
104
objects
in
the
Messier
catalog
.
Taking
part
in
such
a
program
may
motivate
you
to
keep
your
observing
log
regularly
,
and
when
you
complete
the
program
,
the
sponsoring
organization
will
present
you
with
a
certificate
of
achievement
.
