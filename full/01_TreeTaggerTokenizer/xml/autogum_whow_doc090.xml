Intersperse
work
with
downtime
by
working
for
a
few
moments
followed
by
IMing
,
Facebooking
,
Googling
,
or
whatever
it
is
you
feel
like
doing
.
This

Write
a
wikiHow
article
on
something
you
know
about
.
It
looks
like
work
,
and
takes
a
good
amount
of
typing
to
do
.
It
's
a
perfect
cover
,
but
wo
n't
impress
your
boss
if
you
're
being
paid
to
do
tasks
.

If
you
're
at
home
with
a
laptop
then
try
sitting
with
your
back
to
a
wall
.
That
way
no
one
can
see
what
you
're
doing
.
Do
a
lot
of
typing
that
looks
productive
.

If

a
library

public
place

it
may
be
a
good
idea
to
strategically
place
open
books
,
folders
,
or
papers
on
and
around
your
desk
or
table
.
Be
sure
to
turn
the
pages
once
in
a
while

pretend
to
read
them
,
to
increase
believability
.

web
browser

it
's
simple
to
do
anything
you
want
in

tab
while

Or
,
try
installing
a
remote
access
software
such
as
LogMeIn
on
your
computer
,
which
is
accessible
by
browser
,
so
you
can
access
your

do

anywhere

Play

's
more
fun
than
just
sitting
there

avoid
it
if
you
can

you
off

Do
n't
spend

breaks
you

need
.
