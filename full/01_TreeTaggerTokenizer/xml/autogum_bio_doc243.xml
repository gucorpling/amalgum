and
the
only
female
to

She
was
the

the

though
she
may
have
been
of
higher
social
rank
than
him
because
of
her
matrilineal
descent

After
a
vacancy
in
the
Tu'i

title
,
she
used
her
status
to
designated
herself
successor
,
reigning
on
Tongatapu
for
slightly
less
than
one
year
starting
in
perhaps
1792
before
being
forcibly
deposed
by
her
distant
relative
Tuku’aho

Tupoumoheofo
retreated
to
retirement
in

northern
Tongan

of

In
the
late
18th
century
,
Tupoumoheofo
may
have
been
the
highest-ranking
person
in

due
to
her
matrilineal

Her

was
Tamaha

the
sacred
eldest
daughter
of
the

eldest
sister
,
and
thus
the
person
holding
the
highest
rank
in
Tonga(van

”
.
She
also
earned
high
status
through
her
patrilineal
descent
as
her
father
was
Tupoulahi
,
the
7th
Kanokupolu
.

<p>
Tupoumoheofo
was
a
sister
of
Tu’ihalafatai

In
the

,
Tupoumoheofo
married
Tu’i
Tonga
Paulaho
,
the
36th
Tu'i
Tonga
,
as
principal
wife
(
the
moheofo

,
whom
she
is
often
considered
to
have
helped
in

1791

several

Fuanunuiava
,
the
future
38th
Tu’i

is
often
said
also
to
be
a
son
of
this
marriage
and
that
obtaining
him
his
future
title
was
one
of
Tupoumoheofo
’s
main
goals
.
A
genealogy
collected
by
Neil
Gunson
suggests
,
however
,
that
Fuanunuiava
was
not
Tupoumoheofo
’s
son
but
instead
Paulaho
’s
son
from
his
secondary
wife
,
Fokonofo(202

and
therefore
Tupoumoheofo
would
have
little
reason
to
push
him
into

The

of

<p>
There
is
some
disagreement
over
when
Paulaho
was
murdered
–
whether
it
was
1784
or
a
decade
later
.

He
most
likely
died
in
1791
or
1792
,
just
before
Tupoumoheofo
claimed
the
title
of
Tu’i
Kanokupolu

In
an
interview
by
a
Spanish
sailor
years
later
,
Tupoumoheofo
claimed
to
have
been
a
leading
participant
in
an
alliance
of
the
Tu’i
Kanokupolu
lineage
that
,
“
set
out
from
Tonga
with
some
20
large
canoes
,
putting
into
the
ports
of
Annamoka
[
Nomuka
]
and
Happai
[
Ha’apai
]
.
They
passed
to
Vavao
[
Vava’u
]
where
Paulajo
[
Paulaho
]
,
as
the
head
of
his
people
,
received
them
.
There
was
a
clash
which
ended
with
the
death
of
the
latter
at
the
hands
of
Vuna

these
two
leaders
fought

hand

This
put
her
in
alliance
with
Mumui
,
who
,
though
later
her
challenger
,
was
a
relative
of
the
Tu’i
Kanokupolu
line

The
result
was
to
completely
debase

power

Around

Tupoumoheofo

did
the
unexpected
by
naming
herself

She
,
“

This

ascension

More

Legacy
and
sources
</head>
<p>
Most
of
the
primary
sources
about
Tupoumoheofo
come
from
Europeans
who
often
had
conflicting
accounts
,
descriptions
,
timelines
,
and
biases
.
The
absence
of
consensus
makes
her
a
controversial
figure
.
Many
of
these
historiographers
were
guests
of
Tupoumoheofo
’s
enemies
,
who
eventually
gained
power
and
defeated
her
;
the
descendants
of
these
enemies
are
Tonga
’s
current
royal
family
.
These
sources
tend
to
perceive
her
negatively
as
an
egregious
usurper
of
power
.
She
is
also
often
accused
of
using
her
power
to
implant
her
supposed
son
Fuanunuiava
as
the
Tu’i
Tonga
.
Recent
scholarship
,
however
,
claims
her
actions
were
within
historical
precedent
and
acceptable
to
her
social
rank
.
There
is
also
some
evidence
that
suggests
that
Fuanunuiava
was
not
in
fact
her
son
.
</p>
<p>
There
is
agreement
that
at
the
close
of
the
18th
century
the
old
order
that
divided
responsibilities
between
the
Tu’i
Tonga
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuʻi_Haʻatakalaua">
Tu'i
Ha'atakalaua
</ref>
,
and
Tu'i
Kanokupolu
chiefly
lines
dissolved
,
and
that
the
Tu’i
Kanokupolu
line
(
controlled
by
the
Tupou
family
)
eclipsed
the
others
.
Tupoumoheofo
’s
actions
,
and
those
of
her
immediate
successors
,
are
best
understood
as
an
attempt
to
consolidate
power
during
this
chaotic
time
.
