is
perplexed
.

U.S.

a
Republican
whose
politics
—
he
is
against

marriage
for
gay
people
</ref>
,
he
is
against
abortion
,
and
he
has
a
clean
image
in
a
party
tainted
by
scandal
—
should
speak
favorably
to
the
party
's
base
.
But
it
has
not
.
&quot;
I
'm
baffled
by
that
myself

&quot;
We
have
n't
been
able
to
raise
money
.
&quot;
<p>
A
recent
poll
in
Iowa
has
put
him
in
eighth
place
,
with
2
%
supporting
his
campaign
.
&quot;
If
we
do
n't
finish
fourth
or
better
in
Iowa
...
we
'll
pull
out
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Senator
Brownback
's
relationship
with
God
infuses
almost
every
answer
you
find
below
.
Although
he
does
n't
feel
&quot;
competent
&quot;
to
explain
why
God
would
dislike
gays
,
he
does
feel
strongly
that
allowing
two
men
or
two
women
to
enter
into
the
union
of
marriage
will
destroy
it
for
heterosexuals
.
Pointing
to
the
research
of
Stanley
Kurtz
at
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoover%20Institution">
Hoover
Institution
</ref>
,
Brownback
asserts
that
Northern
Europeans
have
&quot;
taken
the
sacredness
out
of
the
institution
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
In
the
interview
,
Senator
Brownback
discusses
the
tug-and-pull
that
befalls
him
when
his
constituents
show
up
at
his
office
and
say
,
&quot;
Look
,
I
'm
a
conservative
,
but
we
need
this
bridge
,
we
need
this
subsidy
,
we
need
this
hospital
.
”
Brownback
feels
this
spending
system
needs
to
be
changed
;
however
,
when
it
comes
to
energy
policy
,
Brownback
is
there
for
his
constituents
.
David
Shankbone
asked
the
Kansas
Senator
,
a
supporter
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cellulosic%20ethanol">
cellulosic
ethanol
</ref>
,
why
he
does
n't
support
the
lowering
of
tariffs
on
sugar
since
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sugar%20ethanol">
sugar
ethanol
</ref>
delivers
8
times
the
energy
output
of
cellulosic
ethanol
.
Brazil
,
in
particular
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol%20fuel%20in%20Brazil">
has
become
energy
independent
</ref>
because
of
its
sugar
ethanol
program
.
It
's
cheaper
to
produce
,
and
there
is
vastly
more
bang
for
the
buck
in
sugar
fuel
than
in
corn
fuel
;
an
entire
country
no
longer
needs
to
import
oil
because
of
it
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sucrose#Trade_and_economics">
Federal
tariffs
</ref>
currently
make
sugar
ethanol
too
expensive
in
the
United
States
.
&quot;
You
're
going
to
kill
the
ethanol
industry
here
just
as
it
gets
going
,
&quot;
was
Senator
Brownback
's
response
.
However
,
there
is
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol%20fuel%20in%20the%20United%20States">
debate
over
whether
the
process
</ref>
to
make
corn
ethanol
uses
more
energy
than
the
ethanol
itself
produces
.
