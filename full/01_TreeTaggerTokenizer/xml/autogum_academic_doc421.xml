Twenty-six
(

crustose
calicioids
reported
here
occur
in
Tanzania
,
most
of
them
in
mountain
cloud
forests
,
but
some
lowland
species
have
also
been
included
to
make
the
list
of
crustose
calicioids
of
Tanzania
complete
.
Most
species
belong
to
<hi rend="italic">

Habitats
of
Cloud
Forest
Crustose
Calicioids
</head>
<p>
Calicioids
have
been
shown
to
occur
mainly
in
undisturbed
forests
with
a
long
forest
continuity
,
and
they
have
frequently
been
used
as
bioindicators
of
habitats
with
high
species
diversity
and
as
indicators
of
“
key
habitats
”
.
In
addition
,
many
are
included
in
Red
lists
of
several
countries
.
In
Tanzania
this
pattern
is
also
clearly
discernable
and
calicioids
mainly
occur
in
mountain
cloud
forests
(
middle
and
upper
forest
zones
)
and
their
niches
are
found
on
the
bark
of
old
trees
and
on
lignum
.

Distribution
of
Tanzanian
Cloud
Forest
Crustose
Calicioids
</head>
<p>
Most
of
the
Tanzanian
crustose
calicioids
belong
to
a
group
of
species
with
wide
distributions
in
cool
areas
of
both
hemispheres
and
occasional
occurrence
in
high
mountains
of
low
latitudes
.
Consequently
,
they
form
an
important
biota
in
mountain
cloud
forests
and
deserve
attention
in
the
context
of
preserving
biodiversity
and
developing
conservation
policies
.
The
wider
distribution
of
Tanzanian
cloud
forest
calicioids
may
be
detailed
on
several
levels
.
On
the
most
general
level
two
patterns
may
be
discerned
:
</p>
<head>
4.2.1
.
Species
with
a
Main
Distribution
in
Cool
Temperate
Areas
—
“
Temperate
Species
”
</head>
<p>
Many
of
the
species
are
widely
distributed
,
with
high
frequencies
in
temperate
to
cool
temperature
areas
of
both
hemispheres
,
as
well
as
at
high
altitudes
in
mountains
at
lower
latitudes
.
Thus
several
are
,
apart
from
on
the
high
mountains
of
Africa
,
also
found
along
the
Andes
,
but
at
low
latitudes
only
in
its
high
mountains
,
e.
g.
,
in
Equador
and
Venezuela
.
Similarly
,
some
of
these
species
occur
in
high
altitudes
along
the
Himalaya
and
its
continuation
to
the
Tasman
Belt
,
e.
g.
,
in
Papua-New
Guinea
.

and
<hi rend="italic">
C.

Tibell
,
are
representatives
of
this
group
.
</p>
<p>
In
Africa
occurrences
of
this
“
cool
temperate
element
”
are
found
from
the
Atlas
,
at
high
altitudes
of
the
African
volcanoes
and
the
East
Arch
Mountains
down
to
lower
altitudes
in
Southern
Africa
.
Some
of
these
distributions
nowadays
appear
very
disjunct
,
but
dispersal
might
have
happened
during
Ice
Age
temperature
depressions
and
associated
widening
of
areas
with
temperate
forests
over
large
parts
of
Africa
in
connection
with
the
quaternary
glaciations
.
