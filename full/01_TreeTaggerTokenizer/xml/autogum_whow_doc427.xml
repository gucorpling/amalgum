If

for
ideas

quote

If
you
're
not
religious
or
do
n't
want
to
do
a
religious-sounding
blessing
,
look
up
some
other
kinds
of
quotes
,
especially
poetry
.
Even
songs
.
These
can
be
inspirational
even
if
you
choose
to
write
your
own
blessing
.

Compose
the
words
of
the
blessing
.
You
can
write
them
down
or
memorize
them
,
but
make
sure
you
know
what
you
're
going
to
say
before
you
say
it
.
Just
as
with
a
toast
or
a
speech
,
you
do
n't
want
to
spoil
it
by
forgetting
the
words
or
stumbling
.
Keep
it
concise
:
it
should
n't
take
more
than
two
minutes
to
say
the
whole
thing
,
and
preferably
less
time
than
that
.

sort
you
like

up

rituals
,
rites
and
superstitions
to
get
some
ideas
.
Start
with
traditions
from
your
own
ancestry
or
ethnicity
.

To
bless
a
person
,
place
your
hand
on
his
or
her
head
.
Traditionally
the
right
hand
,
which
in
most
people
is
stronger
,
is
the
best
one
to
use
.
If
touching
is
unacceptable
,
hold
your
hand
above
the
person
.
