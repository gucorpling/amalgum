<p>
On
December
22
,
1607
a
Dutch
fleet
of
the
Company
of
the
East
Indies
set
sail
from
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texel">
Texel
</ref>
to
attack
the
Portuguese
fleet
and
forts
in
the
East
.
The
fleet
consisted
of
13
vessels
,
225
artillery
pieces
and
more
than
2,800
men
.
It
was
under
the
command
of
Admiral
Pierre
Willemsz
.
,
with
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/François_de_Wittert">
François
de
Wittert
</ref>
as
vice-admiral
.
The
fleet
fought
with
the
Portuguese
in

Mozambique
</ref>
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumatra">

(
present-day

.
Here
on
May
22
,
1609
the
admiral
and
some
of
his
officers
were
killed
in
an
attack
by
the
natives
,
and
Wittert
assumed
command
.
</p>
<p>
Thereafter
Wittert
sailed
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila">
Manila
</ref>
to
attack
the
Spanish
there
.
(
Spain
and

,
and
thus

)
Wittert
besieged
Manila
for
five
months
,
beginning
in
1609
.
However
,
on
April
24
or
April
25
,
1610
,
while
supervising
the
unloading
of
junks
,
Wittert
was
surprised
by
at
least
12
Spanish
ships
.
His
flagship
,
the
<hi rend="italic">
Amsterdam
</hi>
,
was
captured
after
a
lengthy
fight
,
and
the
admiral
was
killed
.
Two
ships
apparently
escaped
,
but
the
Spanish
killed
at
least
85
Dutch
and
took
120
or
more
prisoners
.

<p>
Also
during
the
first
part
of
Governor

,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Vazquez_de_Mercado">

Expeditions
to
the
Moluccas
</head>
<p>
De
Silva
sent
an
unsuccessful
expedition
against
the
Dutch
in
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moluccas">
Moluccas
</ref>
in
1611
,
although
the
expedition
did
take
Sabougo
on
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilolo">
Gilolo
</ref>
and
establish
a
fort
there
.
De
Silva
intended
to
secure
Portuguese
help
to
expel
the
Dutch
from
the
area
once
and
for
all
.
To
this
end
in
1612
he
dispatched
the
former
governor
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternate">
Ternate
</ref>
,
Cristobal
de
Azcueta
to
Portuguese
India
to
make
plans
with
the
viceroy
there
for
a
joint
assault
.
However
Azcueta
and
the
entire
expedition
were
lost
in
a
shipwreck
between
Manila
and
Macao
.
</p>
<p>
De
Silva
tried
again
,
this
time
sending
two
Jesuit
emissaries
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goa">
Goa
</ref>
.
They
arrived
in
1615
and
reached
an
agreement
with
the
Portuguese
viceroy
that
he
would
contribute
four
large
galleons
,
to
be
sent
to
Malacca
.
This
information
was
received
in
Manila
,
where
a
large
Spanish
fleet
was
already
prepared
,
in
July
1615
.
In
order
to
obtain
the
artillery
for
this
expedition
de
Silva
had
weakened
the
defenses
of
Manila
,
with
grave
risks
in
the
event
of
an
attack
on
the
city
by
the
Dutch
.
</p>
<p>
There
was
no
news
of
the
arrival
of
the
Portuguese
galleons
,
but
against
the
advice
of
many
of
his
subordinates
,
Governor
de
Silva
sailed
for
Malacca
on
February
9
,
1616
.
He
commanded
ten
galleons
,
four
galleys
and
various
smaller
vessels
.
The
flagship
was
the
1,700-ton
<hi rend="italic">
San
Marcos
</hi>
.
The
fleet
carried
5,000
men
,
both
soldiers
and
sailors
,
including
nearly
2,000
Spaniards
and
a
unit
of
Japanese
infantry
,
which
numbered
at
500
.
It
also
carried
300
artillery
pieces
and
6
Jesuits
.
It
was
the
largest
European
armada
yet
seen
in
the
region
.
</p>
<p>
The
fleet
sailed
for
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strait_of_Malacca">
Strait
of
Malacca
</ref>
,
with
the
intention
of
uniting
with
the
expected
Portuguese
armada
and
then
attacking
the
Dutch
factory
on
Java
and
thereafter
the
Dutch
bases
on
the
islands
of
the
Moluccas
.
But
the
Portuguese
fleet
had
already
been
attacked
by
the
Dutch
near
Malacca
and
completely
destroyed
.
In
order
to
avoid
their
capture
,
the
Portuguese
had
burned
their
big
galleons
.
</p>
<p>
The
Spanish
fleet
entered
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strait_of_Singapore">
Strait
of
Singapore
</ref>
on
February
25
,
1616
.
From
there
Governor
de
Silva
sent
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Gutierrez_Paramo">
Juan
Gutierrez
Paramo
</ref>
with
part
of
the
fleet
to
reinforce
Ternate
(
in
the
Moluccas
)
.
</p>
<p>
But
the
governor
was
in
poor
health
.
He
had
earlier
asked
several
times
to
be
relieved
of
office
for
health
reasons
.
Now
his
health
deteriorated
further
,
and
on
April
19
,
1616
,
he
died
in
Malacca
.
The
whole
Spanish
enterprise
had
to
be
abandoned
,
with
nothing
accomplished
against
the
Dutch
.
</p>
<p>
The
armada
returned
to
Manila
on
June
1
,
1616
,
<hi rend="italic">
sin
gente
</hi>
(
without
people
)
.
Although
they
had
not
faced
combat
,
many
men
had
died
of
fevers
and
other
illnesses
that
struck
the
fleet
in
Malacca
and
the
Strait
of
Singapore
.
</p>
<p>
Critics
of
the
governor
,
both
among
his
contemporaries
and
later
historians
,
have
claimed
that
had
he
sailed
directly
to
the
Moluccas
rather
than
to
Malacca
,
he
very
possibly
could
have
dislodged
the
undermanned
Dutch
from
the
archipelago
.
