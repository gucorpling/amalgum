THEY
had
four
hours
in
New
York
between
trains
.
The
one
thing
Babbitt
wished
to
see
was
the
Pennsylvania
Hotel
,
which
had
been
built
since
his
last
visit
.
He
stared
up
at
it
,
muttering
,
“
Twenty-two
hundred
rooms
and
twenty-two
hundred
baths
!
That
's
got
everything
in
the
world
beat
.
Lord
,
their
turnover
must
be
--
well
,
suppose
price
of
rooms
is
four
to
eight
dollars
a
day
,
and
I
suppose
maybe
some
ten
and
--
four
times
twenty-two
hundred-say
six
times
twenty-two
hundred
--
well
,
anyway
,
with
restaurants
and
everything
,
say
summers
between
eight
and
fifteen
thousand
a
day
.
Every
day
!
I
never
thought
I
'd
see
a
thing
like
that
!
Some
town
!
Of
course
the
average
fellow
in
Zenith
has
got
more
Individual
Initiative
than
the
fourflushers
here
,
but
I
got
to
hand
it
to
New
York
.
Yes
,
sir
,
town
,
you
're
all
right
--
some
ways
.
Well
,
old
Paulski
,
I
guess
we
've
seen
everything
that
's
worth
while
.
How
'll
we
kill
the
rest
of
the
time
?
Movie
?
”
</p>
<p>
But
Paul
desired
to
see
a
liner
.
“
Always
wanted
to
go
to
Europe
--
and
,
by
thunder
,
I
will
,
too
,
some
day
before
I
past
out
,
”
he
sighed
.
</p>
<p>
From
a
rough
wharf
on
the
North
River
they
stared
at
the
stern
of
the
Aquitania
and
her
stacks
and
wireless
antenna
lifted
above
the
dock-house
which
shut
her
in
.
</p>
<p>
“
By
golly
,
”
Babbitt
droned
,
“
would
n't
be
so
bad
to
go
over
to
the
Old
Country
and
take
a
squint
at
all
these
ruins
,
and
the
place
where
Shakespeare
was
born
.
And
think
of
being
able
to
order
a
drink
whenever
you
wanted
one
!
Just
range
up
to
a
bar
and
holler
out
loud
,
'
Gimme
a
cocktail
,
and
darn
the
police
!
'
Not
bad
at
all
.
What
juh
like
to
see
,
over
there
,
Paulibus
?
”
</p>
<p>
Paul
did
not
answer
.
Babbitt
turned
.
Paul
was
standing
with
clenched
fists
,
head
drooping
,
staring
at
the
liner
as
in
terror
.
His
thin
body
,
seen
against
the
summer-glaring
planks
of
the
wharf
,
was
childishly
meager
.
</p>
<p>
Again
,
“
What
would
you
hit
for
on
the
other
side
,
Paul
?
”
</p>
<p>
Scowling
at
the
steamer
,
his
breast
heaving
,
Paul
whispered
,
“
Oh
,
my
God
!
”
While
Babbitt
watched
him
anxiously
he
snapped
,
“
Come
on
,
let
's
get
out
of
this
,
”
and
hastened
down
the
wharf
,
not
looking
back
.
</p>
<p>
“
That
's
funny
,
”
considered
Babbitt
.
“
The
boy
did
n't
care
for
seeing
the
ocean
boats
after
all
.
I
thought
he
'd
be
interested
in
'
em
.
”
</p>

<p>
Though
he
exulted
,
and
made
sage
speculations
about
locomotive
horse-power
,
as
their
train
climbed
the
Maine
mountain-ridge
and
from
the
summit
he
looked
down
the
shining
way
among
the
pines
;
though
he
remarked
,
“
Well
,
by
golly
!
”
when
he
discovered
that
the
station
at
Katadumcook
,
the
end
of
the
line
,
was
an
aged
freight-car
;
Babbitt
's
moment
of
impassioned
release
came
when
they
sat
on
a
tiny
wharf
on
Lake
Sunasquam
,
awaiting
the
launch
from
the
hotel
.
A
raft
had
floated
down
the
lake
;
between
the
logs
and
the
shore
,
the
water
was
transparent
,
thin-looking
,
flashing
with
minnows
.
A
guide
in
black
felt
hat
with
trout-flies
in
the
band
,
and
flannel
shirt
of
a
peculiarly
daring
blue
,
sat
on
a
log
and
whittled
and
was
silent
.
A
dog
,
a
good
country
dog
,
black
and
woolly
gray
,
a
dog
rich
in
leisure
and
in
meditation
,
scratched
and
grunted
and
slept
.
The
thick
sunlight
was
lavish
on
the
bright
water
,
on
the
rim
of
gold-green
balsam
boughs
,
the
silver
birches
and
tropic
ferns
,
and
across
the
lake
it
burned
on
the
sturdy
shoulders
of
the
mountains
.
Over
everything
was
a
holy
peace
.
</p>
<p>
Silent
,
they
loafed
on
the
edge
of
the
wharf
,
swinging
their
legs
above
the
water
.
The
immense
tenderness
of
the
place
sank
into
Babbitt
,
and
he
murmured
,
“
I
'd
just
like
to
sit
here
--
the
rest
of
my
life
--
and
whittle
--
and
sit
.
And
never
hear
a
typewriter
.
Or
Stan
Graff
fussing
in
the
'
phone
.
Or
Rone
and
Ted
scrapping
.
Just
sit
.
Gosh
!
”
</p>
<p>
He
patted
Paul
's
shoulder
.
“
How
does
it
strike
you
,
old
snoozer
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Oh
,
it
's
darn
good
,
Georgie
.
There
's
something
sort
of
eternal
about
it
.
”
</p>
<p>
For
once
,
Babbitt
understood
him
.
</p>

</head>
<p>
Their
launch
rounded
the
bend
;
at
the
head
of
the
lake
,
under
a
mountain
slope
,
they
saw
the
little
central
dining-shack
of
their
hotel
and
the
crescent
of
squat
log
cottages
which
served
as
bedrooms
.
They
landed
,
and
endured
the
critical
examination
of
the
habitues
who
had
been
at
the
hotel
for
a
whole
week
.
In
their
cottage
,
with
its
high
stone
fireplace
,
they
hastened
,
as
Babbitt
expressed
it
,
to
“
get
into
some
regular
he-togs
.
”
They
came
out
;
Paul
in
an
old
gray
suit
and
soft
white
shirt
;
Babbitt
in
khaki
shirt
and
vast
and
flapping
khaki
trousers
.
It
was
excessively
new
khaki
;
his
rimless
spectacles
belonged
to
a
city
office
;
and
his
face
was
not
tanned
but
a
city
pink
.
He
made
a
discordant
noise
in
the
place
.
But
with
infinite
satisfaction
he
slapped
his
legs
and
crowed
,
“
Say
,
this
is
getting
back
home
,
eh
?
”
</p>
<p>
They
stood
on
the
wharf
before
the
hotel
.
He
winked
at
Paul
and
drew
from
his
back
pocket
a
plug
of
chewing-tobacco
,
a
vulgarism
forbidden
in
the
Babbitt
home
.
He
took
a
chew
,
beaming
and
wagging
his
head
as
he
tugged
at
it
.
“
Um
!
Um
!
Maybe
I
have
n't
been
hungry
for
a
wad
of
eating-tobacco
!
Have
some
?
”
</p>
<p>
They
looked
at
each
other
in
a
grin
of
understanding
.
Paul
took
the
plug
,
gnawed
at
it
.
They
stood
quiet
,
their
jaws
working
.
They
solemnly
spat
,
one
after
the
other
,
into
the
placid
water
.
They
stretched
voluptuously
,
with
lifted
arms
and
arched
backs
.
From
beyond
the
mountains
came
the
shuffling
sound
of
a
far-off
train
.
A
trout
leaped
,
and
fell
back
in
a
silver
circle
.
They
sighed
together
.
