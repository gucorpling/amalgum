Save
Your
Self
from
the
Hell
</head>
<p>
Many
people
living
on
this
planet
do
n't
care
about
the
afterlife
although
their
Religion
tells
them
sinners
will
be
damned
in
Hell
.

Steps

<head>
Choosing
Your
Belief
</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Think
about
your
current
belief
.
Have
you
ever
thought
about
your
current
belief
?
Is
there
evidence
to
prove
your
belief
?
You
must
think
more
about
what
you
believe
and
if
your
belief
is
backed
by
evidence
,
logic
and
reason
.
Keep
in
mind
that
many
Religious
leaders
will
lie
to
you
and
prevent
you
from
thinking
for
yourself
.

Focus
on
this
life
,
rather
than
what
happens
after
it
.
Do
n't
fear
the
reaction
of
the
people
around
you
.
If
you
have
to
live
in
another
place
to
follow
the
belief
you
're
certain
it
's
right
then
change
it
!
Put
in
mind
that
your
unlimited
life
depends
on
your
belief
.

Choose
a
new
belief
.
If
you
thought
about
your
belief
,
compared
it
to
other
religions
and
found
it
was
wrong
or
found
that
there
was
better
believes
then
you
should
follow
it
!

Learn
what
sins
are
deemed
as
&quot;
Unforgivable
&quot;
in
different
religions
,
so
that
you
may
try
to
avoid
them
,
should
you
ultimately
choose
a
particular
faith
.
Eg
:
In
Christianity
,
Blasphemy
against
the
Holy
Spirit
is
unforgivable
;
In
Islam
,
worshipping
idols
is
unforgivable
;
In
Judaism
,
taking
the
Lord
's
Name
in
vain
is
unforgivable
.

Warnings

<list type="unordered">
<item>
Do
not
let
people
prevent
you
from
thinking
rationally
and
if
it
precedes
logic
and
evidence
then
it
is
not
right
.

Do
n't
be
from
people
who
do
n't
believe
anything
or
who
do
n't
care
about
what
will
happen
after
their
death
or
who
say
simply
:
after
I
die
I
will
know
what
should
happen
to
me
!
Our
god
created
us
to
care
about
our
unlimited
life
and
gave
us
a
mind
to
think
about
our
final
destination
.
</item>
<item>
Stay
away
from
beliefs
that
teach
you
to
blindly
follow
and
not
question
their
guidelines
.
If
it
teaches
intolerance
towards
anyone
because
of
their
Gender
,
Sexuality
,
Race
,
Disability
or
anything
else
it
is
not
a
thing
to
advocate
or
follow
.
