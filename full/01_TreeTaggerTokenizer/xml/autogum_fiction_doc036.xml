CHAPTER
VIII
</head>
<p>
The
last
rehearsal
was
over
,
a
tedious
dress
rehearsal
which
had
lasted
all
day
and
exhausted
the
patience
of
every
one
who
had
to
do
with
it
.
When
Hilda
had
dressed
for
the
street
and
came
out
of
her
dressing-room
,
she
found
Hugh
MacConnell
waiting
for
her
in
the
corridor
.
</p>
<p>
“
The
fog
’s
thicker
than
ever
,
Hilda
.
There
have
been
a
great
many
accidents
to-day
.
It
’s
positively
unsafe
for
you
to
be
out
alone
.
Will
you
let
me
take
you
home
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
How
good
of
you
,
Mac
.
If
you
are
going
with
me
,
I
think
I
’d
rather
walk
.
I
’ve
had
no
exercise
to-day
,
and
all
this
has
made
me
nervous
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
should
n’t
wonder
,
”
said
MacConnell
dryly
.
Hilda
pulled
down
her
veil
and
they
stepped
out
into
the
thick
brown
wash
that
submerged
St.
Martin
’s
Lane
.
MacConnell
took
her
hand
and
tucked
it
snugly
under
his
arm
.
“
I
’m
sorry
I
was
such
a
savage
.
I
hope
you
did
n’t
think
I
made
an
ass
of
myself
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Not
a
bit
of
it
.
I
do
n’t
wonder
you
were
peppery
.
Those
things
are
awfully
trying
.
How
do
you
think
it
’s
going
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Magnificently
.
That
’s
why
I
got
so
stirred
up
.
We
are
going
to
hear
from
this
,
both
of
us
.
And
that
reminds
me
;
I
’ve
got
news
for
you
.
They
are
going
to
begin
repairs
on
the
theatre
about
the
middle
of
March
,
and
we
are
to
run
over
to
New
York
for
six
weeks
.
Bennett
told
me
yesterday
that
it
was
decided
.
”
</p>
<p>
Hilda
looked
up
delightedly
at
the
tall
gray
figure
beside
her
.
He
was
the
only
thing
she
could
see
,
for
they
were
moving
through
a
dense
opaqueness
,
as
if
they
were
walking
at
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
.
</p>
<p>
“
Oh
,
Mac
,
how
glad
I
am
!
And
they
love
your
things
over
there
,
do
n’t
they
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Shall
you
be
glad
for
--
any
other
reason
,
Hilda
?
”
</p>
<p>
MacConnell
put
his
hand
in
front
of
her
to
ward
off
some
dark
object
.
It
proved
to
be
only
a
lamp-post
,
and
they
beat
in
farther
from
the
edge
of
the
pavement
.
</p>
<p>
“
What
do
you
mean
,
Mac
?
”
Hilda
asked
nervously
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
was
just
thinking
there
might
be
people
over
there
you
’d
be
glad
to
see
,
”
he
brought
out
awkwardly
.
Hilda
said
nothing
,
and
as
they
walked
on
MacConnell
spoke
again
,
apologetically
:
“
I
hope
you
do
n’t
mind
my
knowing
about
it
,
Hilda
.
Do
n’t
stiffen
up
like
that
.
No
one
else
knows
,
and
I
did
n’t
try
to
find
out
anything
.
I
felt
it
,
even
before
I
knew
who
he
was
.
I
knew
there
was
somebody
,
and
that
it
was
n’t
I.
”
</p>
<p>
They
crossed
Oxford
Street
in
silence
,
feeling
their
way
.
The
busses
had
stopped
running
and
the
cab-drivers
were
leading
their
horses
.
When
they
reached
the
other
side
,
MacConnell
said
suddenly
,
“
I
hope
you
are
happy
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Terribly
,
dangerously
happy
,
Mac
,
”
--
Hilda
spoke
quietly
,
pressing
the
rough
sleeve
of
his
greatcoat
with
her
gloved
hand
.
</p>
<p>
“
You
’ve
always
thought
me
too
old
for
you
,
Hilda
,
--
oh
,
of
course
you
’ve
never
said
just
that
,
--
and
here
this
fellow
is
not
more
than
eight
years
younger
than
I.
I
’ve
always
felt
that
if
I
could
get
out
of
my
old
case
I
might
win
you
yet
.
It
’s
a
fine
,
brave
youth
I
carry
inside
me
,
only
he
’ll
never
be
seen
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Nonsense
,
Mac
.
That
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
.
It
’s
because
you
seem
too
close
to
me
,
too
much
my
own
kind
.
It
would
be
like
marrying
Cousin
Mike
,
almost
.
I
really
tried
to
care
as
you
wanted
me
to
,
away
back
in
the
beginning
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Well
,
here
we
are
,
turning
out
of
the
Square
.
You
are
not
angry
with
me
,
Hilda
?
Thank
you
for
this
walk
,
my
dear
.
Go
in
and
get
dry
things
on
at
once
.
You
’ll
be
having
a
great
night
to-morrow
.
”
</p>
<p>
She
put
out
her
hand
.
“
Thank
you
,
Mac
,
for
everything
.
Good-night
.
”
</p>
<p>
MacConnell
trudged
off
through
the
fog
,
and
she
went
slowly
upstairs
.
Her
slippers
and
dressing
gown
were
waiting
for
her
before
the
fire
.
“
I
shall
certainly
see
him
in
New
York
.
He
will
see
by
the
papers
that
we
are
coming
.
Perhaps
he
knows
it
already
,
”
Hilda
kept
thinking
as
she
undressed
.
“
Perhaps
he
will
be
at
the
dock
.
No
,
scarcely
that
;
but
I
may
meet
him
in
the
street
even
before
he
comes
to
see
me
.
”
Marie
placed
the
tea-table
by
the
fire
and
brought
Hilda
her
letters
.
She
looked
them
over
,
and
started
as
she
came
to
one
in
a
handwriting
that
she
did
not
often
see
;
Alexander
had
written
to
her
only
twice
before
,
and
he
did
not
allow
her
to
write
to
him
at
all
.
“
Thank
you
,
Marie
.
You
may
go
now
.
”
</p>
<p>
Hilda
sat
down
by
the
table
with
the
letter
in
her
hand
,
still
unopened
.
She
looked
at
it
intently
,
turned
it
over
,
and
felt
its
thickness
with
her
fingers
.
She
believed
that
she
sometimes
had
a
kind
of
second-sight
about
letters
,
and
could
tell
before
she
read
them
whether
they
brought
good
or
evil
tidings
.
She
put
this
one
down
on
the
table
in
front
of
her
while
she
poured
her
tea
.
At
last
,
with
a
little
shiver
of
expectancy
,
she
tore
open
the
envelope
and
read
:
--
</p>
<p>
Boston
,
February
--
</p>
<p>
MY
DEAR
HILDA
:
--
</p>
<p>
It
is
after
twelve
o’clock
.
Every
one
else
is
in
bed
and
I
am
sitting
alone
in
my
study
.
I
have
been
happier
in
this
room
than
anywhere
else
in
the
world
.
Happiness
like
that
makes
one
insolent
.
I
used
to
think
these
four
walls
could
stand
against
anything
.
And
now
I
scarcely
know
myself
here
.
Now
I
know
that
no
one
can
build
his
security
upon
the
nobleness
of
another
person
.
Two
people
,
when
they
love
each
other
,
grow
alike
in
their
tastes
and
habits
and
pride
,
but
their
moral
natures
(
whatever
we
may
mean
by
that
canting
expression
)
are
never
welded
.
The
base
one
goes
on
being
base
,
and
the
noble
one
noble
,
to
the
end
.
</p>
