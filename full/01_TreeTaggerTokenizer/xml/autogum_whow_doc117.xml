VPN
</head>
<p>
For
a
VPN
is
the
newer
way
to
hide
data
online
,
the
Incognito
tab
,
cannot
hide
data
from
your
router
,
but
a
VPN
such
as
Tor
can
.
They
are
also
connected
to
the
dark
web
sites
,
so
are
made
to
be
anonymous
.

It
's
best
to
be
alone
when
searching
something
you
do
n't
want
your
parents
seeing
.

Use
your
instinct
-
it
's
better
to
be
safe
than
sorry
when
it
comes
to
things
like

A
Windows
7
is
the
best
computer
for
this
because
the
internet
tabs
do
not
show
a
preview
of
the
description
of
websites
.
If
there
is
one
in
your
house
,
use
it
.
</item>
<item>
If
you
're
technically
minded
,
then
you
can
use
a
proxy
website
which
will
retrieve
the
packet
data
from
another
server
,
not
your
internet
service
provider
,
this
will
hide
it
from
any
parent
controls
installed
on
the
router
or
family
safety
program
.
You
could
also
use
a
Free
VPN
service
which
will
divert
all
internet
logs
to
another
server
.
</item>
<item>
Do
n't
use
Google
,
use
DuckDuckGo
instead
,
because
Google
keeps
a
log
of
what
you
searched
for
that
you
ca
n't
erase
,
but
DuckDuckGo
does
not
.

Warnings

<list type="unordered">
<item>
If
your
parents
find
out
,
you
may
lose
computer
privileges
or
have
parental
controls
turned
on
and
block
the
sites
they
do
n't
want
you
on
.
</item>
<item>
Your
parents
do
everything
for
your
own
good
.
It
is
better
to
obey
them
and
not
to
disobey
.
They
are
much
more
experienced
and
probably
wo
n't
allow
anything
which
could
harm
their
children
.
