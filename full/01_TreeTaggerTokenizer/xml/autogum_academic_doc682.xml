Concluding
Remarks
</head>
<p>
In
this
study
,
we
investigated
how
environmentally
friendly
UAV
delivery
service
is
compared
to
GV
delivery
service
.
To
perform
such
a
comparison
,
we
first
obtained
an
optimal
delivery
schedule
that
minimized
the
total
travelling
distance
for
each
service
.
Since
there
are
different
levels
of
fuel
and
loadable
capacity
restrictions
for
the
UAV
and
GV
delivery
services
,
delivery
routes
for
the
two
services
are
also
different
.
UAVs
need
more
fuel
replenishments
and
have
a
lower
weight
capacity
,
which
causes
more
hops
than
GVs
.
We
present
a
new
mathematical
model
to
obtain
an
optimal
delivery
schedule
for
each
delivery
service
under
such
restrictions
.
Based
on
the
optimal
delivery
information
obtained
,
CO2
emissions
of
the
UAV-alone
and
GV-alone
delivery
systems
are
computed
.
The
case
study
found
that
the
GV-alone
delivery
generated
at
least
683
times
more
CO2
than
the
UAV-alone
delivery
in
all
ranges
of
the
GV
speeds
tested
.

We
stress
the
implications
and
limitations
of
this
study
.
The
presentations
in
this
study
answer
the
following
question
:
How
many
UAVs
are
environmentally
friendly
if
the
UAV
delivery
system
is
implemented
in
the
logistics
industry
.
Since
UAVs
,
compared
to
GVs
,
have
different
limitations
and
restrictions
for
delivering
goods
,
the
question
must
be
addressed
from
the
understanding
of
different
characteristics
of
UAVs
and
GVs
,
and
their
resultant
delivery
schemes
.
The
two-phase
methodology
proposed
in
this
study
is
needed
to
provide
different
routes
for
the
two
different
types
of
vehicles
and
to
analyze
their
sustainability
in
terms
of
the
CO2
emissions
of
their
travels
.
We
believe
the
methodology
and
the
results
of
this
study
provide
a
guideline
to
further
investigate
the
true
sustainability
of
UAV
logistic
services
and
facilitate
the
use
of
UAVs
for
delivery
services
.
There
are
,
however
,
two
limitations
in
this
study
.
First
,
we
focused
on
CO2
emissions
only
during
the
vehicle
’s
travel
.
It
is
easy
to
think
that
manufacturing
and
disposal
processes
of
vehicles
(
including
batteries
)
also
cause
greenhouse
gas
(
GHG
)
emissions
.
Second
,
this
study
postulates
a
specific
scenario
that
uses
stationary
depots
and
one
type
of
vehicle
(
UAVs
or
GVs
)
in
each
delivery
system
.
It
is
possible
and
natural
to
mix
the
two
types
of
vehicles
in
one
delivery
system
.
Those
limitations
of
this
study
are
expected
to
be
overcome
by
future
research
.
</p>
<p>
We
contemplate
future
research
based
on
the
limitations
of
this
research
.
First
,
it
may
be
possible
to
additionally
consider
greenhouse
gas
(
GHG
)
emissions
during
manufacturing
and
disposal
processes
of
UAVs
and
GVs
.
Stolaroff
et
al.
presented
the
life
cycle
GHG
emissions
represented
by
CO2-equivelent
per
package
delivered
by
UAVs
and
GVs
.
They
consider
CO2-equivelent
emissions
during
all
stages
of
a
vehicle
’s
life
cycle
,
but
do
not
consider
the
distance
a
vehicle
should
travel
for
each
service
.
Since
the
battery
life
of
a
UAV
is
much
shorter
than
the
engine
life
of
a
GV
and
the
travelling
distance
of
a
UAV
is
longer
than
that
of
a
GV
,
the
dominance
of
UAV
over
GV
CO2
emissions
can
be
possibly
weakened
under
the
lifecycle
assessment
(
LCA
)
.
Second
,
this
sustainability
analysis
of
the
UAV
delivery
service
can
be
applied
to
various
types
of
logistic
services
.
With
respect
to
vehicle
types
,
there
is
a
UAV-GV
combined
logistic
service
.
With
respect
to
depot
mobility
,
there
exist
movable
depots
that
are
different
from
stationary
depots
postulated
in
this
study
.
Since
various
types
of
logistic
systems
with
UAVs
are
being
developed
and
tested
,
we
believe
that
the
sustainability
analysis
of
those
systems
is
also
required
.
Even
though
there
is
a
lack
of
the
sustainable
VRP
literature
so
far
,
this
paper
may
serve
as
a
guideline
that
triggers
research
activities
on
the
topic
.
