Is
the
current
North
Korean
threat
to
Guam
and
other
United
States
holdings
in
the
Pacific
one
which
is
treated
as
a
credible
threat
of
potential
nuclear
action
by
the
Guamanian
and
United
States
government
?
</p>
<hi rend="bold">

:
Threats
from
a
location
such
as
North
Korea
should
always
be
taken
seriously
,
but
to
be
frank
,
if
North
Korea
wanted
to
attack
the
United
States
,
there
are
far
higher
priority
targets
than
Guam
.
Also
,
if
North
Korea
is
considering
an
attack
,
it
is
much
more
likely
in
the
form
of
cyber
or
special
operations
disruptions
,
rather
than
nuclear
strikes
.
Once
a
nation
uses
nuclear
weapons
,
they
lose
the
value
of
the
weapon
.
It
is
the
threat
the
weapon
holds
that
expresses
power
,
not
using
it
.

Has
the
current
North
Korean
threat
to
Guam
impacted
the
daily
lives
of
people
living
on
Guam
?
Do
the
locals
take
it
seriously
?
</p>
<hi rend="bold">
RM
</hi>
:
In
my
own
assessment
of
the
social
effects
of
this
rhetoric
,
the
people
of
Guam
use
a
pragmatic
approach
based
around
typhoon
preparation
.
We
prepare
of
course
,
but
to
be
frank
,
the
North
Korean
sabre-rattling
last
week
was
drowned
out
by
small
children
on
easter
egg
hunts
and
holiday
barbeques
with
beer
.
In
the
Marianas
Variety
April
1
edition
,
the
threat
was
lampooned
by
the
editors
.
This
parody
could
readily
sum
up
the
effects
of
the
North
Korean
threats
.

Is
there
potentially
economic
consequences
for
Guam
as
a
result
of
this
in
terms
of
tourism
dollars
or
the
United
States
military
presence
changing
?
</p>
<hi rend="bold">
RM
</hi>
:
Our
main
tourism
markets
are
Japan
and
Korea
,
both
of
which
are
under
the
same
guns
,
no
pun
intended
.
Therefore
,
it
will
not
likely
affect
our
tourism
.
The
US
military
presence
is
a
form
of
stable
tourism-like
dollars
and
the
effect
of
the
military
build
up
is
best
expressed
in
those
terms
.

In
terms
of
Guam
,
how
does
this
latest
situation
differ
from
past
situations
where
North
Korea
has
engaged
in
saber
rattling
?
</p>
<hi rend="bold">
RM
</hi>
:
The
difference
this
time
is
that
North
Korea
claim
to
have
or
might
have
missles
that
can
reach
Guam
.

What
do
you
think
will
likely
happen
regarding
North
Korea
in
the
coming
weeks
and
months
?
</p>
<hi rend="bold">
RM
</hi>
:
Usually
,
North
Korea
engages
in
this
sort
of
behavior
when
it
feels
that
the
international
community
is
ignoring
it
.
Therefore
,
this
rhetoric
will
likely
ratchet
down
once
China
tells
them
to
back
off
.
This
is
a
common
pattern
in
the
past
.
This
bad
behavior
affects
China
more
than
the
United
States
.

What
do
you
think
of
the
how
the
current
situation
with
North
Korea
has
evolved
to
date
?
</p>
<hi rend="bold">
RM
</hi>
:
The
problem
with
this
current
rhetoric
is
that
the
movie
&quot;
Olympus
has
Fallen
,
&quot;
which
describes
a
North
Korean
action
in
Washington
DC
.
The
real
threat
from
North
Korea
is
the
unconventional
warfare
techniques
that
they
can
use
on
US
soil
,
not
convention
or
nuclear
threats
.
Disrupting
basic
power
,
water
,
medical
or
transportation
services
is
a
far
greater
threat
than
a
nuclear
threat
.
