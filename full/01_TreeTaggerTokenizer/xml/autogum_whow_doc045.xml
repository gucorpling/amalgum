Remove
a
Wrap
from
a
Car
</head>
<p>
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Apply_Vinyl_Wrap">
Vinyl
car
wraps
</ref>
can
help
promote
a
business
by
displaying
logos
and
branding
on
your
vehicle
,
but
they
wear
out
over
time
and
may
need
to
be
replaced
.
If
you
have
an
old
vinyl
wrap
that
’s
cracked
or
damaged
,
you
can
easily
remove
it
yourself
with
only
a
few
simple
tools
.
There
may
be
adhesive
residue
after
you
get
the
wrap
off
your
vehicle
,
but
it
’s
easy
to
clean
off
.
When
you
’re
finished
,
your
vehicle
will
look
new
and
ready
for
another
wrap
!

Peeling
off
the
Wrap
</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Work
in
a
shaded
area
out
of
direct
sunlight
.
Working
in
the
sun
could
make
the
adhesive
bond
to
your
vehicle
’s
body
and
makes
it
more
difficult
to
remove
.
Work
inside
a
garage
if
you
can
,
or
wait
until
there
’s
an
overcast
day
to
remove
your
wrap
.

Avoid
removing
the
wrap
in
cold
temperatures
since
the
vinyl
will
rip
in
smaller
pieces
and
leave
residue
.

Lift
the
edges
of
the
wrap
with
a
plastic
scraper
.
Find
the
edges
of
your
wrap
along
the
seams
in
your
vehicle
body
,
such
as
around
the
doors
,
hood
,
and
trunk
.
Try
to
peel
the
edge
slightly
with
your
fingernail
to
get
started
.
If
you
ca
n’t
lift
the
edge
with
your
fingernails
,
slide
a
plastic
scraper
along
the
edge
to
start
peeling
it
back
.

You
can
buy
plastic
scrapers
at
vehicle
detailing
shops
or
from
a
hardware
store
.
</item>
<item>
Do
n’t
use
any
metal
razor
blades
to
peel
the
edges
or
else
you
could
damage
the
vehicle
body
underneath
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Heat
the
wrap
near
the
edges
with
a
heat
gun
.
Hold
the
heat
gun
away
from
your
vehicle
as
you
use
it
.
Move
the
heat
gun
back
and
forth
to
distribute
the
heat
evenly
,
so
the
adhesive
sticks
to
the
wrap
instead
of
your
vehicle
.
As
you
heat
it
,
tug
at
the
edge
of
the
wrap
to
see
if
it
removes
easily
.

You
can

<item>
Do
n’t
heat
any
areas
where
the
vinyl
is
covering
chrome
.
</item>
<item>
Only
heat
the
wrap
enough
so
you
can
still
comfortably
hold
it
without
wearing
gloves
.

Pull
the
wrap
off
at
a
15-
to
20-degree
angle
from
the
vehicle
.
Slide
both
of
your
thumbs
underneath
the
edge
of
your
wrap
and
spread
your
fingers
out
on
top
of
it
.
Lift
the
wrap
so
it
’s
at
a
15-degree
angle
to
the
vehicle
’s
body
and
slowly
pull
up
the
wrap
.
Do
your
best
to
keep
your
wrap
in
a
single
piece
as
you
remove
it
so
it
’s
easier
to
take
off
.

Avoid
peeling
the
wrap
off
at
a
90-degree
angle
since
it
will
cause
the
adhesive
to
stick
on
your
vehicle
.

Reheat
the
wrap
if
it
gets
difficult
to
remove
.
When
the
wrap
cools
down
,
the
adhesive
will
stick
to
your
vehicle
’s
body
again
and
make
it
more
difficult
to
peel
off
.
Use
your
heat
gun
near
the
edge
you
’re
peeling
to
reheat
the
adhesive
.
Heat
the
wrap
evenly
so
all
of
the
adhesive
lifts
as
you
pull
off
the
wrap
.

Look
for
a

Put
the
adhesive
remover
