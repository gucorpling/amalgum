and
the
Israeli
Foreign
Ministry
to
review
Israel

an

The

On
Thursday
,
the
fifth
day
of
the
junket
,
David
Saranga
of
the
foreign
ministry
was
able
to
arrange
an
exclusive
interview
for
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/User:David_Shankbone">

.
For
over
an
hour
they
spoke
about
Iranian
politics
,
whether
Israel
is
in
danger
of
being
side-lined
in
Middle
Eastern
importance
because
of
Arab
oil
wealth
,
and
his
thoughts
against
those
who
say
Israeli
culture
is
in
a
state
of
decay
.

<hi rend="bold">
The
only
crime
I
committed
was
to
be
a
little
bit
ahead
of
time
.
And
if
this
is
the
reason
for
being
controversial
,
maybe
the
reason
is
better
than
the
result
.

<p>
Shimon
Peres
spent
his
early
days
on
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kibbutz">
kibbutz
</ref>
,
a
bygone
socialist
era
of
Israel
.
In
1953
,
at
the
age
of
29
,
Peres
became
the
youngest
ever
Director
General
of
the
Ministry
of
Defense
.
Forty
years
later
it
was
Peres
who
secretly
gave
the
green
light
for
dialogue
with
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yassir%20Arafat">
Yassir
Arafat
</ref>
,
of
the
verboten
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine%20Liberation%20Organization">
Palestine
Liberation
Organization
</ref>
.
It
was
still
official
Israeli
policy
to
not
speak
with
the
PLO
.
Peres
shares
a
Nobel
Peace
Prize
with
Yitzak
Rabin
and
Arafat
for
orchestrating
what
eventually
became
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo%20Accords">
Oslo
Accords
</ref>
.
The
&quot;
roadmap
&quot;
that
came
out
of
Oslo
remains
the
official
Israeli
(
and
American
)
policy
for
peace
in
the
Palestinian
conflict
.
Although
the
majority
of
Israeli
people
supported
the
plans
,
land
for
peace
was
met
with
a
small
but
fiery
resistance
in
Israel
.
For
negotiating
with
Arafat
,
former
Prime
Minister
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin%20Netanyahu">
Benjamin

shouted
at

</ref>
!
&quot;
a
reference
to
Hitler
's
British
appeaser
.
It
was
during
this
time
of
heated
exchanges
in
the
1990s
that
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitzhak%20Rabin">
Yitzhak
Rabin
</ref>
was
assassinated
by
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yigal%20Amir">

,
a
Jew
who
thought
it
against
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halakha">

to
give
up
land
given
by
God
(

)
.
</p>
<p>
Peres
is
the
elder
statesman
of
Israeli
politics
,
but
he
remembers
that
he
has
not
always
been
as
popular
as
he
is
today
.
&quot;
Popularity
is
like
perfume
:
nice
to
smell
,
dangerous
to
drink
,
&quot;
said
Peres
.
&quot;
You
do
n’t
drink
it
.
&quot;
The
search
for
popularity
,
he
goes
on
to
say
,
will
kill
a
person
who
has
an
idea
against
the
status
quo
.
