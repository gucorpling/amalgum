Introduction
</head>
<p>
Metabolic
syndrome
(
MetS
)
is
a
cluster
of
disorders
,
including
insulin
resistance/hyperglycemia
,
visceral
adiposity
[
identified
by
large
waistline
(
WL
)
or
being
overweight
]
,
atherogenic
dyslipidemia
(
e.
g.
,
raised
triglycerides
(
TG
)
or
reduced
high-density
lipoprotein
(
HDL
)
)
,
and
endothelial
dysfunction
(
characterized
by
elevated
blood
pressures
)
.
MetS
significantly
influences
the
development
and
deterioration
of
numerous
diseases
and
is
a
crucial
predictor
of
cardiovascular
diseases
.
Fortunately
,
numerous
modifiable
risk
factors
and
corresponding
practical
intervention
strategies
regarding
MetS
were
proposed
,
and
hence
,
it
is
vital
to
identify
the
high-risk
individuals
nowadays
to
prevent
the
incidence
and
deterioration
of
metabolic
derangement
and
its
associated
diseases
.
Nevertheless
,
the
conventional
procedures
for
the
confirmation
of
MetS
have
depended
on
blood
assays
,
which
largely
lead
to
a
resistive
mentality
toward
the
procedures
and
are
therefore
nonconducive
to
long-term
follow-up
.
Therefore
,
there
is
a
high
probability
of
the
MetS
population
being
under-identified
,
especially
those
without
an
obese
body
shape
.
Consequently
,
there
is
a
medical
need
for
an
easy
,
fast
,
and
non-invasive
method
for
MetS
screening
.

FibroScan
is
an
ultrasound-based
device
equipped
with
the
naval
patented
technology
—
Vibration-Controlled
Transient
Elastography
(
VCTETM
)
—
that
was
originally
developed
to
assess
the
level
of
liver
fibrosis
and
cirrhosis
by
using
a
liver
stiffness
score
(
the
E
score
)
.
Based
on
the
transformation
function
of
media
stiffness
and
wave
transmission
velocity
,
the
E
score
is
calculated
using
a
series
of
elastograms
,
which
are
simulated
graphics
of
mathematical
function
of
the
time
and
depth
of
at
least
10
shots
of
shear
waves
propagating
through
liver
parenchyma
transmitted
using
the
probes
mounted
on
the
device
.
The
multiple-shot
shear
wave
and
elastogram
transformation
are
implemented
with
controlled
vibration
,
energy
,
and
algorithms
on
the
identical
volume
of
liver
tissue
to
ensure
measurement
reliability
.
The
controlled
attenuation
parameter
(
CAP
)
score
,
denoting
the
liver
steatosis
,
was
embedded
in
instruments
marketed
after
2013
.
The
score
is
derived
from
the
amplitude
attenuations
of
ultrasonic
waves
detected
simultaneously
from
the
E
score
measurement
.
Owing
to
its
merits
of
being
noninvasive
,
safe
,
rapid
(
approximately
5
–
10
min
for
application
)
,
and
the
high-reproducibility
of
its
automatically
quantitative
assessment
outputs
among
operators
,
numerous
studies
have
evaluated
the
performance
of
FibroScan
in
detecting
chronic
hepatitis
and
various
other
liver
disorders
.
In
addition
to
bedside
inspection
in
hospitalized
patients
,
the
virtue
of
its
portability
was
also
manifested
in
population
outreach
screening
.
In
a
street-based
screening
for
hepatitis
C
virus
(
HCV
)
infection
in
drug
users
,
the
maneuver
was
excellently
accepted
by
the
target
population
.
Various
studies
have
reported
the
liver
steatosis
grading
cut-off
points
of
CAP
score
in
patients
with
different
liver
disorders
with
satisfactory
accuracy
.
Overall
,
FibroScan
has
a
multitude
of
merits
,
such
as
being
noninvasive
,
safe
,
fast
,
convenient
,
portable
,
and
highly
accurate
in
the
assessment
of
liver
stiffness
and
steatosis
.

A
previous
study
found
that
the
grades
based
on
abdominal
ultrasonography
gave
accurate
information
regarding
liver
steatosis
and
MetS
in
nonalcoholic
,
healthy
people
.
Moreover
,
considering
the
frequent
coexistence
and
common
pathological
mechanisms
of
MetS
and
hepatopathy
,
such
as
steatohepatitis
,
liver
inflammation
,
or
the
nonalcoholic
fatty
liver
disease
(
NAFLD
)
,
it
was
proposed
that
liver
steatosis
,
especially
NAFLD
,
could
be
a
hepatic
manifestation
of
MetS
.
Therefore
,
the
FibroScan
is
investigated
to
be
an
option
for
the
frontline
screening
of
MetS
in
participants
of
a
self-paid
health
examination
in
Taiwan
.
To
the
best
of
our
knowledge
,
this
is
the
first
study
to
explore
the
utility
of
FibroScan
in
identifying
people
from
the
general
population
who
have
physical
status
and
disorders
that
fulfill
the
MetS
criteria
.
A
subsequent
objective
was
to
explore
its
feasibility
and
reliability
in
screening
for
MetS
without
performing
any
simultaneous
invasive
procedures
,
such
as
blood
assays
.
