In
late
May
to
early
June
of
2008
,
news
broke
that
a
previously
undiscovered
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/indigenous%20peoples">
indigenous
</ref>
tribe
had
been
found
near
the
border
between
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Brazil">
Brazil
</ref>
and
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Peru">
Peru
</ref>
.
Worldwide
media
was
quick
to
publish
the
story
and
the
accompanying
photographs
taken
by
José
Carlos
Meirelles
.
The
photos
showed
people
in
full
body
paint
aiming
bows
at
the
overhead
aircraft
from
which
the
pictures
were
taken
.

the
story

as
well
.

<p>
In
its
Sunday
edition
,
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_Kingdom">
British
</ref>
newspaper
<hi rend="italic">
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Observer">

had
a
story
called
&quot;
Secret
of
the
'
lost
'
tribe
that
was
n't
&quot;
which
was
about
this
&quot;
discovery
&quot;
and
revealed
that
the
tribe
had
in
fact
been
known
to
scientists
,
including
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundação%20Nacional%20do%20Índio">
Fundação

Índio

(
FUNAI

protection
agency
for

interests

After
this
revelation
,
media
newswires
branded
the
original
story
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hoax">
hoax
</ref>
.
These
hoax
claims
spread
nearly
as
quickly
as
the
original
story
.
Rapidly
,
news
sites
even
claimed
that
the
photos
were
fake
.
The
true
story
,
however
,
is
more
complicated
than
that
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">
The
Observer
'
</hi>
s
article
featured
an
interview
with
José
Carlos
Meirelles
,
one
of
a
handful
so-called
<hi rend="italic">
sertanistas
</hi>
that
work
for
the
FUNAI
.
These
are
field
agents
that
map
the
areas
of
uncontacted
indigenous
peoples
,
so
that
their
habitat
can
be
protected
.
He
admitted
that
his
desire
to
protect
these
tribes
had
caused
him
to
overstep
his
mission
.
</p>
<p>
When
given
the
use
of
an
aircraft
to
seek
out
new
tribes
,
Meirelles
instead
flew
over
an
area
where
he
knew
a
tribe
had
been
observed
decades
ago
.
Ultimately
,
he
was
hoping
to
prove
that
FUNAI
's
policy
of
not
contacting
the
tribes
they
observe
is
better
for
the
tribes
.
With
this
flight
he
hoped
to
find
evidence
that
the
tribe
,
discovered
long
ago
,
was
better
off
for
not
being
contacted
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
When
I
saw
them
painted
red
,
I
was
satisfied
,
I
was
happy
,
&quot;
he
said
.
&quot;
Because
painted
red
means
they
are
ready
for
war
,
which
to
me
says
they
are
happy
and
healthy
defending
their
territory
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
photos
are
of
a
real
tribe
,
long
known
to
Meirelles
and
other
scientists
within
FUNAI
,
but
protected
under
Brazilian
law
.
</p>
<p>
Meirelles
says
he
has
no
regrets
,
because
he
just
wanted
to
prove
these
kind
of
tribes
exist
and
deserve
protection
.
He
said
that
Peruvian
President
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan%20García">
Alan
García
</ref>
had
claimed
that
these
tribes
were
imaginary
and
that
he
needed
to
prove
they
existed
.
In
doing
so
,
he
violated
FUNAI
policies
by
flying
over
their
area
and
taking
pictures
.
Both
are
prohibited
.
Meirelles
claims
he
will
protect
the
exact
location
of
the
tribe
's
territory
,
even
if
tortured
.

<p>
Former
president
of
FUNAI
,
Sydney
Possuelo
,
agreed
that
the
publication
of
the
photos
was
necessary
to
quell
the
doubt
about
the
very
existence
such
uncontacted
indigenous
peoples
.
</p>
<p>
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival%20International">
Survival
International
</ref>
,
a
human
rights
organisation
formed
in
1969
that
campaigns
for
the
rights
of
indigenous
tribal
and
uncontacted
peoples
,
admits
complicity
in
the
distribution
of
the
original
story
.
Survival
International
was
instrumental
in
getting
the
original
story
international
attention
.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless
,
Survival
International
said
it
did
not
mislead
media
because
it
never
described
the
tribe
as
&quot;
lost
&quot;
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
These
Indians
are
in
a
reserve
expressly
set
aside
for
the
protection
of
uncontacted
tribes
:
they
were
hardly
'
unknown
'
,
&quot;
said
Stephen
Corry
,
director
of
Survival
International
in
a
statement
.
&quot;
What
is
,
and
remains
,
true
,
is
that
so
far
as
is
known
these
Indians
have
no
peaceful
contact
with
outsiders
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Some
of
the
media
got
very
carried
away
and
started
talking
about
undiscovered
tribes
,
&quot;
explains
Fiona
Watson
of
Survival
International
.
&quot;
There
was
this
interpretation
that
this
was
a
completely
new
tribe
,
completely
undiscovered
,
without
bothering
to
check
with
sources
...
Neither
the
Brazilian
government
nor
Survival
has
ever
used
that
word
,
and
'
uncontacted
'
means
they
do
n't
have
any
contact
with
outsiders
.
