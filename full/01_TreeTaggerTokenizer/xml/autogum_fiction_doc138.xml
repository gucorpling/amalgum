The
Hungry
Man
was
Fed
</head>
<p>
Young
Van
Bibber
broke
one
of
his
rules
of
life
one
day
and
came
down-town
.
This
unusual
journey
into
the
marts
of
trade
and
finance
was
in
response
to
a
call
from
his
lawyer
,
who
wanted
his
signature
to
some
papers
.
It
was
five
years
since
Van
Bibber
had
been
south
of
the
north
side
of
Washington
Square
,
except
as
a
transient
traveller
to
the
ferries
on
the
elevated
road
.
And
as
he
walked
through
the
City
Hall
Square
he
looked
about
him
at
the
new
buildings
in
the
air
,
and
the
bustle
and
confusion
of
the
streets
,
with
as
much
interest
as
a
lately
arrived
immigrant
.
</p>
<p>
He
rather
enjoyed
the
novelty
of
the
situation
,
and
after
he
had
completed
his
business
at
the
lawyer
's
office
he
tried
to
stroll
along
lower
Broadway
as
he
did
on
the
Avenue
.
</p>
<p>
But
people
bumped
against
him
,
and
carts
and
drays
tried
to
run
him
down
when
he
crossed
the
side
streets
,
and
those
young
men
whom
he
knew
seemed
to
be
in
a
great
hurry
,
and
expressed
such
amused
surprise
at
seeing
him
that
he
felt
very
much
out
of
place
indeed
.
And
so
he
decided
to
get
back
to
his
club
window
and
its
quiet
as
soon
as
possible
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Hello
,
Van
Bibber
,
&quot;
said
one
of
the
young
men
who
were
speeding
by
,
&quot;
what
brings
you
here
?
Have
you
lost
your
way
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
think
I
have
,
&quot;
said
Van
Bibber
.
&quot;
If
you
'll
kindly
tell
me
how
I
can
get
back
to
civilization
again
,
be
obliged
to
you
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Take
the
elevated
from
Park
Place
,
&quot;
said
his
friend
from
over
his
shoulder
,
as
he
nodded
and
dived
into
the
crowd
.
</p>
<p>
The
visitor
from
up-town
had
not
a
very
distinct
idea
as
to
where
Park
Place
was
,
but
he
struck
off
Broadway
and
followed
the
line
of
the
elevated
road
along
Church
Street
.
It
was
at
the
corner
of
Vesey
Street
that
a
miserable-looking
,
dirty
,
and
red-eyed
object
stood
still
in
his
tracks
and
begged
Van
Bibber
for
a
few
cents
to
buy
food
.
&quot;
I
've
come
all
the
way
from
Chicago
,
&quot;
said
the
Object
,
&quot;
and
I
have
n't
tasted
food
for
twenty-four
hours
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Van
Bibber
drew
away
as
though
the
Object
had
a
contagious
disease
in
his
rags
,
and
handed
him
a
quarter
without
waiting
to
receive
the
man
's
blessing
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Poor
devil
!
&quot;
said
Van
Bibber
.
&quot;
Fancy
going
without
dinner
all
day
!
&quot;
He
could
not
fancy
this
,
though
he
tried
,
and
the
impossibility
of
it
impressed
him
so
much
that
he
amiably
determined
to
go
back
and
hunt
up
the
Object
and
give
him
more
money
.
Van
Bibber
's
ideas
of
a
dinner
were
rather
exalted
.
He
did
not
know
of
places
where
a
quarter
was
good
for
a
&quot;
square
meal
,
&quot;
including
&quot;
one
roast
,
three
vegetables
,
and
pie
.
&quot;
He
hardly
considered
a
quarter
a
sufficiently
large
tip
for
the
waiter
who
served
the
dinner
,
and
decidedly
not
enough
for
the
dinner
itself
.
He
did
not
see
his
man
at
first
,
and
when
he
did
the
man
did
not
see
him
.
Van
Bibber
watched
him
stop
three
gentlemen
,
two
of
whom
gave
him
some
money
,
and
then
the
Object
approached
Van
Bibber
and
repeated
his
sad
tale
in
a
monotone
.
He
evidently
did
not
recognize
Van
Bibber
,
and
the
clubman
gave
him
a
half-dollar
and
walked
away
,
feeling
that
the
man
must
surely
have
enough
by
this
time
with
which
to
get
something
to
eat
,
if
only
a
luncheon
.
</p>
<p>
This
retracing
of
his
footsteps
had
confused
Van
Bibber
,
and
he
made
a
complete
circuit
of
the
block
before
he
discovered
that
he
had
lost
his
bearings
.
He
was
standing
just
where
he
had
started
,
and
gazing
along
the
line
of
the
elevated
road
,
looking
for
a
station
,
when
the
familiar
accents
of
the
Object
again
saluted
him
.
</p>
<p>
When
Van
Bibber
faced
him
the
beggar
looked
uneasy
.
He
was
not
sure
whether
or
not
he
had
approached
this
particular
gentleman
before
,
but
Van
Bibber
conceived
an
idea
of
much
subtlety
,
and
deceived
the
Object
by
again
putting
his
hand
in
his
pocket
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Nothing
to
eat
for
twenty-four
hours
!
Dear
me
!
&quot;
drawled
the
clubman
,
sympathetically
.
&quot;
Have
n't
you
any
money
,
either
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Not
a
cent
,
&quot;
groaned
the
Object
,
&quot;
an
'
I
'm
just
faint
for
food
,
sir
.
S
'
help
me
.
I
hate
to
beg
,
sir
.
It
is
n't
the
money
I
want
,
it
's
jest
food
.
I
'm
starvin
'
,
sir
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Well
,
&quot;
said
Van
Bibber
,
suddenly
,
&quot;
if
it
is
just
something
to
eat
you
want
,
come
in
here
with
me
and
I
'll
give
you
your
breakfast
.
&quot;
But
the
man
held
back
and
began
to
whine
and
complain
that
they
would
n't
let
the
likes
of
him
in
such
a
fine
place
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Oh
,
yes
,
they
will
,
&quot;
said
Van
Bibber
,
glancing
at
the
bill
of
fare
in
front
of
the
place
.
&quot;
It
seems
to
be
extremely
cheap
.
Beefsteak
fifteen
cents
,
for
instance
.
Go
in
,
&quot;
he
added
,
and
there
was
something
in
his
tone
which
made
the
Object
move
ungraciously
into
the
eating-house
.
</p>
<p>
It
was
a
very
queer
place
,
Van
Bibber
thought
,
and
the
people
stared
very
hard
at
him
and
his
gloves
and
the
gardenia
in
his
coat
and
at
the
tramp
accompanying
him
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
You
ai
n't
going
to
eat
two
breakfasts
,
are
yer
?
&quot;
asked
one
of
the
very
tough-looking
waiters
of
the
Object
.
The
Object
looked
uneasy
,
and
Van
Bibber
,
who
stood
beside
his
chair
,
smiled
in
triumph
.
