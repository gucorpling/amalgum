Discussion
</head>
<p>
During
the
drug
design
process
,
to
assess
the
potential
druggability
of
a
compound
as
a
new
starting
point
,
some
initial
rules
like
drug-likeness
(
as
defined
by
Lipinski
and
colleagues
in
1997
)
,
lead-likeness
(
as
defined
by
Oprea
)
and
known
drug
space
,
are
usually
applied
.
In
general
,
the
rules
to
characterise/filter
compound
collections
are
based
upon
physicochemical
parameters
,
e.
g.
,
logP
,
logS
,
MW
,
TPSA
,
MR
,
RotN
,
HBA
and
HBD
,
among
others
.
As
a
result
,
it
would
be
interesting
to
assess
how
proteasome
inhibitors
are
positioned
with
respect
to
the
typically
expected
“
drug-like
”
chemical
space
.
</p>
<p>
To
do
so
,
we
performed
a
comprehensive
analysis
of
the
680
small-molecules
proteasome
inhibitors
dataset
spanning
a
large
range
of
activity
(
0.08
nM
&lt;
IC50
≤
150,000
nM
)
.
This
entailed
looking
at
chemical
space
distribution
,
scaffold
similarity
and
the
extraction
of
chemical
rules
with
machine
learning
,
using
either
direct
structural
information
(
scaffolds
and
Morgan
fingerprints
)
or
being
based
on
21
general
molecular
(
QuaSAR
)
descriptors
.
This
set
of
analyses
was
ultimately
employed
to
produce
meaningful
chemical
patterns
that
are
correlated
with
proteasome
inhibitory
activity
.
The
dataset
comprises
only
human
proteasome
activity
data
for
the
CT-L
catalytic
site
,
as
this
is
the
only
site
with
the
largest
number
of
compounds
,
and
is
divided
into
four
classes
.
Full
data
are
available
in

Analysis
of
chemical
space
distribution
and
the
scaffold
similarity
of
proteasome
inhibitors
.
First
,
we
analyzed
human
proteasome
inhibitors
’
chemical
space
distribution
.
To
address
this
analysis
,
chemical
space
was
defined
by
the
t-SNE
calculation
applied
to
the
21
calculated
molecular
descriptors
listed
in
the
Supplementary
Information
(
Table
S1
)
.
The
proximity
in
a
t-SNE
plot
is
relative
in
nature
,
and
the
distance
between
points
simply
represents
relative
proximity
(
i.
e.
,
it
is
not
a
direct
scaling
from
real
distances
in
the
21
dimensional
space
)
.
</p>
<p>
In
<figure>
Figure
4
</figure>
(
left
)
the
difference
of
distribution
of
the
four
activity
classes
is
easily
perceptible
,
with
the
most
active
compounds
(
class
A
,
purple
)
having
close
to
half
of
its
compounds
(
~47
%
)
in
the
top-right
quadrant
of
the
plot
,
while
the
least
active
compounds
(
class
D
,
orange
)
are
mainly
concentrated
in
the
bottom-left
quadrant
(
~58
%
of
class
D
compounds
)
,
as
quantified
in
<figure>
Figure
4
</figure>
(
right
)
.
Classes
B
(
blue
)
and
C
(
green
)
have
a
more
disperse
distribution
,
but
show
some
higher
density
areas
close
to
the
bottom-left
corner
.
This
indicates
that
class
D
,
for
example
,
is
fundamentally
different
to
the
remaining
classes
from
a
structural
and
physicochemical
level
,
and
therefore
supports
the
existence
of
a
SAR
in
the
proteasome
inhibitors
developed
in
the
last
20
years
.
Additionally
,
no
particular
cluster
was
formed
with
a
single
class
,
which
means
there
is
no
particular
location
in
chemical
space
(
at
least
one
that
is
defined
by
the
descriptors
that
we
considered
)
which
is
reserved
to
one
single
class
.
This
observation
indicates
that
carrying
out
compound
selection
biased
for
physicochemical
similarity
to
known
inhibitors
might
be
a
good
initial
filter
to
enrich
the
set
of
compound
candidates
with
active
hits
.
</p>
<p>
Next
,
we
wanted
to
investigate
what
characteristics
are
responsible
for
the
differences
between
classes
in
the
chemical
space
distribution
.
Upon
applying
the
Tc
to
characterize
the
similarity
between
Murcko
scaffolds
within
each
class
,
we
observed
a
high
diversity
in
the
dataset
,
not
just
within
each
class
,
but
also
between
the
different
classes
,
with
most
pairs
of
compounds
showing
a
Tc
below
0.5
that
represents
a
considerable
dissimilarity
(
<figure>
Figure
5
</figure>
)
.
Nonetheless
a
clear
trend
of
correlation
between
activity
and
similarity
is
observed
.
</p>
<p>
The
scaffolds
of
class
B
differ
negligibly
from
class
A
,
however
,
class
C
shows
a
two-peak
distribution
which
suggests
it
contains
scaffolds
similar
to
both
classes
A/B
,
as
well
as
with
lower
activity
compounds
(
class
D
)
.
This
is
probably
a
result
of
the
practical
strategies
applied
in
medicinal
chemistry
where
inactive
structures
are
modified/derivatized
to
meet
or
better
resemble
substructures
seen
among
actives
,
thus
creating
this
transition
from
A
to
D.
As
concluded
from
the
chemical
space
observation
,
this
also
shows
that
functionalizing
scaffolds
from
more
potent
compounds
(
class
A/B
)
might
be
a
feasible
initial
strategy
to
find
new
actives
.
However
,
selected
scaffolds
should
also
be
sufficiently
dissimilar
to
the
lower
activity
scaffolds
,
effectively
avoiding
the
right-end
tail
of
the
class
D
(
i.
e.
,
the
most
similar
scaffolds
to
A
,
which
are
still
largely
inactive
)
.
