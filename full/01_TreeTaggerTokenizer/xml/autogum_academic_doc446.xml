<p>
Only
<hi rend="italic">
Lucilia

</hi>
larvae
from
certified
farms
can
be
safely
used
in
medicine
.
Complicated
procedures
of
egg
disinfection
,
using
chloroamine
,
povidone-iodine
and
sodium
hypochlorite
,
are
intended
to
ensure
safety
during
use
of
this
product
.
MDT
is
based
on
three
mechanisms
,
observed
when
<hi rend="italic">
Lucilia
sericata
</hi>
are
introduced
to
the
wound
:
the
mechanical
removal
of
necrotic
tissue
,
bactericidal
and
bacteriostatic
activity
,
and
promotion
of
the
healing
process
.
Reports
from
the
last
decade
point
out
that
physical
contact
with
the
wound
is
a
less
important
effect
of
the
larval
presence
within
the
wound
,
and
is
probably
a
negative
effect
for
the
patient
,
who
may
feel
a
physical
presence
and
wiggling
in
the
wound
.
Chemicals
secreted
by
larvae
initiate
the
process
of
bacterial
elimination
and
remodeling
of
the
wound
bed
.

Figure

</figure>
shows
the
effect
of
debridement
on
a
necrotic
forearm
wound
measuring
over
200
cm²
.
Within
72
hours
,
100
free-range
larvae
cleansed
over
70
%
of
necrosis
in
the
wound
,
revealing
the
damaged
forearm
bones
.
The
above
observations
suggest
the
potential
use
of
this
method
in
cases
where
wounds
cover
full
skin-thickness
,
with
a
high
risk
of
necrosis
,
or
an
already
existing
infection
.
The
selection
of
an
appropriate
method
for
the
further
wound
healing
process
is
the
next
stage
of
local
action
.
</p>
<p>
A
maggot
does
not
literally
consume
pieces
of
tissue
,
but
it
secretes
and
excretes
digestive
enzymes
(
digestive
secretions
and
excretions
of
arginase
)
.
Digestion
begins
directly
in
the
wound
bed
,
outside
the
maggot
’s
body
.
Dead
tissue
is
liquefied
and
can
be
easily
absorbed
by
the
maggot
.
This
phenomenon
can
be
easily
observed
during
therapy
because
of
the
increase
in
the
amount
of
exudate
from
the
wound
and
its
specific
odor
.
Hobson
was
the
first
scientist
to
systematically
present
the
proteolytic
effects
of
digestive
enzymes
produced
by
the
larvae
of
<hi rend="italic">
Lucilia
sericata
</hi>
.
The
movements
of
maggots
,
scratching
tissue
and
secreting
arginase
,
facilitate
the
debridement
process
.
Other
enzymes
released
include
leucine
aminopeptidase
,
collagenase
and
chymotrypsin-like
proteases
.
These
enzymes
have
various
functions
in
the
wound
;
they
mainly
transform
dead
tissue
into
liquid
,
which
is
either
exuded
from
the
wound
or
consumed
by
the
maggots
.
The
evacuation
of
necrosis
and
reduction
in
bacterial
contamination
promotes
the
regeneration
process
.
The
authors
of
numerous
recently
published
papers
have
noted
chemical
substances
that
influence
the
promotion
of
the
healing
process
.
The
migration
of
resident
epidermal
keratinocytes
and
dermal
cells
,
including
fibroblasts
and
dermal
microvascular
cells
,
from
the
wound
margins
into
the
wound
bed
,
is
a
crucial
step
in
wound
healing
.
Amino
acids
,
such
as
L-histidine
,
3-guanidinopropionic
acid
and
L-valinol
,
have
been
identified
in
larva
secretions
,
and
it
has
been
demonstrated
in
vitro
that
these
isolated
components
specifically
increase
the
proliferation
of
human
endothelial
cells
.
</p>
<p>
Collagenase
speeds
up
the
process
of
proteolysis
by
decomposing
the
material
into
smaller
components
,
digested
later
by
other
enzymes
secreted
by
the
larvae
.
Once
necrosis
is
effectively
removed
,
the
consecutive
stages
of
healing
are
facilitated
by
the
increased
phagocytic
activity
of
leukocytes
and
higher
oxygen
pressure
,
resulting
in
optimum
conditions
for
the
regeneration
of
damaged
tissues
.
</p>
<p>
Proteolytic
digestion
is
the
initial
act
of
tissue
repair
,
leading
to
hemostasis
,
thrombosis
,
inflammatory
cell
activation
and
the
reconstruction
of
tissue
.
Several
studies
suggest
that
the
beneficial
effect
of
larvae
may
be
due
to
their
ability
to
reduce
pro-inflammatory
factors
.
The
work
of
Pecivova
et
al.
studied
the
effect
of
the
<hi rend="italic">
Lucilia
sericata
</hi>
salivary
gland
extract
on
opsonized
neutrophils
,
stimulated
with
zymogen
and
unstimulated
neutrophils
.
Salivary
gland
extract
had
no
effect
on
superoxide
production
and
myeloperoxidase
release
from
unstimulated
neutrophils
,
but
significantly
reduced
both
peroxide
production
and
MPO
secretion
levels
in
zsonogen-stimulated
opsonized
neutrophils
.
</p>
<p>
Following
debridement
,
the
wound
may
be
appropriately
assessed
.
Consequently
,
it
is
also
possible
to
introduce
other
methods
that
promote
wound
closure
,
or
to
perform
a
skin
transplant
.
</p>
<p>
The
granulation
tissue
in
the
wound
,
debrided
and
stimulated
by
larval
secretions
,
should
be
dressed
as
soon
as
possible
with
the
chosen
method
of
local
treatment
.
The
choice
of
method
depends
on
several
factors
,
such
as
level
of
tissue
destruction
,
area
,
wound
etiopathogenesis
,
and
general
condition
of
the
patient
.
Wound
management
criteria
should
be
carefully
implemented
based
on
the
TIME
concept
.
The
use
of
negative
pressure
wound
therapy
(
NPWT
)
is
effective
in
shrinking
the
wound
,
reducing
exudate
and
bacteria
,
and
stimulating
neoangigenesis
,
specialized
dressings
,
in
the
case
of
superficial
and
penetrative
lesions
that
do
not
qualify
for
surgery
.
There
are
clinical
situations
,
especially
in
terminally
ill
patients
,
in
which
wounds
debrided
from
necrotic
tissue
are
only
managed
with
dressings
,
due
to
the
patient
’s
condition
and
poor
prognosis
.
