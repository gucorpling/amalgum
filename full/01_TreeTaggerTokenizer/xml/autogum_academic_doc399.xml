Literature
Review
:
Human
Security
and
Forced
Migration
</head>
<p>
Developed
by
the
United
Nations
Development
Programme
(
UNDP
)
,
the
concept
of
human
security
stresses
economic
,
environmental
,
health
,
food
,
personal/community
and
political
aspects
of
people
’s
wellbeing
.
Accordingly
,
the
human
development
index
introduced
by
UNDP
has
expanded
the
study
of
development
from
mere
economic
terms
to
13
different
dimensions
.
</p>
<p>
Supported
by
the
UN
,
the
Commission
on
Human
Security
(
CHC
)
has
defined
human
security
as
<hi rend="italic">
“
…
creating
political
,
social
,
environmental
,
economic
,
military
and
cultural
systems
that
together
give
people
the
building
blocks
of
survival
,
livelihood
and
dignity
</hi>
”
(

)
.
Human
security
and
national
security
are
not
mutually
exclusive
,
since
a
failed
state
would
largely
be
incapable
of
providing
essential
provisions
for
its
citizens
.
Yet
,
these
two
concepts
are
not
fully
compatible
,
because
undemocratic
states
can
protect
their
national
borders
while
ripping
their
citizens
of
their
personal
and
community
resources
.
To
note
,
human
security
has
also
been
questioned
for
the
tangibility
of
its
contributions
to
the
development
debate
,
especially
from
an
environmental
perspective
.
</p>
<p>
The
study
of
forced
migration
requires
that
we
clarify
the
differences
between
various
migrant
categories
.
The
International
Organization
for
Migration
(
IOM
)
has
defined
“
migrant
”
as
,
“
<hi rend="italic">
any
person
who
is
moving
or
has
moved
across
an
international
border
or
within
a
State
away
from
his/her
habitual
place
of
residence
,
regardless
of
(

)
the
person
’s
legal
status
;
(
2
)
whether
the
movement
is
voluntary
or
involuntary
;
(
3
)
what
the
causes
for
the
movement
are
;
or
(
4
)
what
the
length
of
the
stay
is
</hi>
”
.
</p>
<p>
The
IOM
has
defined
forced
migration
as
,
“
<hi rend="italic">
A
migratory
movement
in
which
an
element
of
coercion
exists
,
including
threats
to
life
and
livelihood
,
whether
arising
from
natural
or
man-made
causes
(
e.
g.
,
movements
of
refugees
and
internally
displaced
persons
as
well
as
people
displaced
by
natural
or
environmental
disasters
,
chemical
or
nuclear
disasters
,
famine
,
or
development
projects
)
</hi>
”
.
In
parallel
,
“
refugee
”
is
someone
“
who
has
been
forced
to
flee
his
or
her
country
because
of
persecution
,
war
or
violence
”
,
and
“
asylum
seeker
”
is
someone
“
whose
request
for
sanctuary
has
yet
to
be
processed
”
.
Although
the
IOM
’s
definition
of
“
migrant
”
comprises
“
refugee
”
and
“
asylum
seeker
”
,
the
legal
framework
of
different
countries
can
actually
make
a
vital
distinction
for
these
categories
.
While
refugees
can
be
provided
with
some
socioeconomic
rights
and
a
path
to
full
citizenship
,
asylum
seekers
are
not
granted
these
options
.
</p>
<p>
Noting
the
legal
and
conceptual
differences
between
various
migrant
categories
,
we
pool
all
refugees
,
asylum-seekers
and
other
types
of
internally
and
externally
displaced
persons
(
but
not
voluntary
migrants
,
as
measured
by
the
UN
High
Commissioner
for
Refugees
—
UNHCR
)
together
for
each
country-year
in
this
study
.
As
discussed
in
the
methodology
section
,
our
underlying
assumption
is
that
total
number
of
forced
migrants
amounting
to
at
least
5
percent
of
a
country
’s
population
constitutes
a
special
case
for
origin
countries
,
although
these
people
may
be
classified
differently
in
destination
countries
.
For
instance
,
Turkey
considers
forced
migrants
coming
from
Europe
as
refugees
,
whereas
it
considers
those
coming
from
“
East
”
(
including
Africa
)
as
asylum
seekers
(
p.
21
)
.
We
assume
that
these
legal
differences
have
no
theoretical
implications
for
the
purposes
of
this
study
,
because
we
are
investigating
the
relationship
between
our
variables
for
each
origin
country
,
not
for
destination
or
transit
countries
.
</p>
<p>
The
literature
highlights
international
wage
differentials
,
policies
of
origin
and
destination
states
,
poverty
and
violent
conflict
among
the
drivers
of
human
migration
.
Simply
put
,
repressive
(
e.
g.
,
against
ethnic/religious
minorities
)
home
governments
push
,
and
welcoming
(
e.
g.
,
through
multicultural
policies
)
destination
countries
attract
migrants
.
Not
surprisingly
,
migrants
flow
from
poor
and/or
conflict-ridden
countries
to
relatively
developed
and
stable
states
.
Moreover
,
adverse
environmental
factors
,
such
as
drought
,
flood
and
inundation
,
increase
the
likelihood
of
conflict
and
migration
.
For
example
,
Gleick
has
attributed
the
mass
uprising
and
the
subsequent
civil
war
in
Syria
during
the
so-called
Arab
Spring
to
a
prior
collapse
in
food
output
due
to
several
years
of
drought
.
</p>
<p>
Given
that
several
African
economies
rely
heavily
on
agricultural
production
,
their
exposure
to
extreme
weather
conditions
(
whether
causing
drought
,
heavy
rainfall
or
other
extreme
events
)
makes
an
adverse
effect
on
the
livelihoods
of
millions
of
people
.
Sea
level
rise
poses
another
threat
on
both
populations
and
commercial
activities
of
coastal
cities
.
Taken
together
with
“
poverty
traps
”
that
have
strangled
the
continent
for
decades
,
these
challenges
are
among
the
potential
causes
of
large-scale
human
migration
in
Africa
.
Below
we
review
various
aspects
of
human
security
,
as
well
as
foreign
aid
as
a
potential
remedy
for
these
challenges
.
