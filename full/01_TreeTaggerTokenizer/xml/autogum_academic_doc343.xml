Robust
Data
Analysis
</head>
<p>
This
section
is
divided
into
three
parts
.
First
,
a
statistical
summary
of
the
data
is
presented
.
Second
,
a
nonparametric
inferential
analysis
is
performed
.
Finally
,
the
section
ends
using
robust
estimators
to
analyze
measures
of
centralization
and
dispersion
of
the
data
of
the
variables
under
study
.
The
latter
is
justified
by
the
fact
that
robust
estimators
are
relatively
insensitive
to
small
changes
in
the
data
.

Statistical
Summary
of
the
Dataset
</head>
<p>
In
accordance
with
,
in
this
research
work
,
there
is
a
set
of
data
that
is
going
to
be
analyzed
in
order
to
properly
interpret
the
relationships
between
them
.
Furthermore
,
in
this
subsection
,
different
types
of
graphs
will
be
used
with
the
intention
of
showing
a
simple
transmission
of
the
analysis
and
conclusions
.
Here
,
it
has
been
considered
that
these
graphs
will
allow
a
simple
comparison
between
the
data
and
,
on
the
other
hand
,
highlight
differences
between
the
variables
under
study
.
According
to
,
these
graphs
make
a
clear
and
precise
representation
of
the
consequences
.
</p>
<p>
To
perform
the
analysis
,
a
graph
of
each
of
the
datasets
was
first
considered
,
where
these
were
treated
as
if
they
were
a
time
series
(
see
<figure>
Figure
4
</figure>
)
.
The
order
in
which
the
data
was
collected
is
represented
on
the
abscissa
axis
,
while
the
value
of
the
data
is
represented
on
the
axis
of
the
ordinates
.
</p>
<p>
<figure>
Figure
4
</figure>
shows
the
collected
data
separated
by
the
lines
that
are
parallel
to
the
park
,
which
are
represented
by
the
letter
,
and
the
lines
that
are
perpendicular
to
the
park
,
which
are
represented
by
the
letter
(
see
<figure>
Figure
1
</figure>
and
<figure>
Figure
2
</figure>
)
.
The
results
of
the
PM2.5
measurements
that
are
represented
in
this
figure
are
the
observations
of
the
variables
represented
in
<figure>
Figure
1
</figure>
,
which
have
been
explained
in
Section
2
.
</p>
<p>
From
<figure>
Figure
4
</figure>
,
it
can
be
seen
that
the
variable
,
which
is
the
one
with
the
most
data
,
and
the
variable
are
the
ones
with
the
greatest
fluctuations
,
while
the
variables
and
behave
in
a
more
linear
way
and
with
less
variations
,
although
the
values
of
are
lower
than
those
of
.
The
other
two
variables
,
and
,
apparently
behave
analogously
to
each
other
and
different
from
the
rest
.
Below
,
a
statistical
summary
of
the
data
is
shown
in
Table
1
.
This
table
includes
measures
of
central
tendency
,
variability
,
and
shape
.
</p>
<p>
When
comparing
the
summary
statistics
presented
in
Table
1
with
those
presented
in
,
it
can
be
said
that
the
difference
between
both
studies
is
that
in
,
the
skewness
and
kurtosis
were
not
studied
.
However
,
in
this
article
,
it
is
important
to
study
these
third
and
fourth
moments
,
because
it
is
important
to
analyze
whether
the
data
comes
from
heavy-tailed
distributions
.
According
to
,
heavy-tailed
distributions
are
those
probability
distributions
whose
density
tails
are
not
bounded
by
the
normal
density
tails
.
</p>
<p>
<figure>
Figure
5
</figure>
shows
the
multiple
box-plot
of
data
from
each
variable
,
and
<figure>
Figure
6
</figure>
shows
the
empirical
confidence
intervals
for
the
median
,
including
both
the
mean
and
the
median
of
the
data
.
</p>
<p>
Based
on
the
previous
figures
,
at
first
sight
it
is
observed
that
the
sizes
of
the
six
variables
under
study
are
different
,
with
having
almost
double
the
observations
compared
to
each
of
the
rest
of
the
variables
.
In
addition
,
it
is
observed
that
the
means
are
higher
than
the
medians
in
all
cases
,
except
for
.
The
aforementioned
indicates
the
existence
of
extreme
values
on
the
right
,
which
is
corroborated
by
the
multiple
box-plot
shown
in
<figure>
Figure
5
</figure>
.
</p>
<p>
In
addition
,
the
values
of
the
standard
deviation
shown
in
Table
1
confirm
that
the
variability
of
is
similar
to
the
variability
of
,
that
the
dispersion
of
the
values
of
and
is
small
,
and
that
there
is
some
similarity
between
the
fluctuations
of
and
the
fluctuations
of
.
</p>
<p>
Moreover
,
it
can
be
seen
that
all
the
variables
present
a
great
lack
of
normality
due
to
the
high
skewness
values
.
All
the
skewness
values
shown
in
Table
1
are
positive
,
so
the
distributions
are
lengthened
to
the
right
.
The
lack
of
normality
is
reaffirmed
for
most
of
the
variables
,
since
almost
all
the
kurtosis
values
are
much
greater
than
3
,
in
particular
the
kurtosis
values
of
and
.
</p>
<p>
Next
,
in
order
to
see
the
trends
of
the
variables
under
study
,
the
technique
of
moving
average
(
MA
)
was
used
.
The
MA
technique
was
used
to
soften
the
data
of
the
time
series
,
in
order
to
reduce
the
influence
that
each
individual
data
had
.
