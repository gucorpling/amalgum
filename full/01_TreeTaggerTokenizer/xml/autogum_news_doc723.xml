The
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her%20Majesty's%20Government">
British
government
</ref>
has
decided
to
sell
off
its
stake
in
the
British
nuclear
weapon
manufacturer
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic%20Weapons%20Establishment">
Atomic
Weapons
Establishment
(

)
</ref>
.
The
move
has
been
met
with
anger
and
claims
of
cover
up
by
the
opposition
parties
.
The
news
was
broken
by
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobs%20Engineering%20Group">

The
details
of
the
deal
have
not
been
published
,
though
opposition
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal%20Democrats">
Liberal
Democrat
</ref>
Treasury
spokesman
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince%20Cable">
Vince
Cable
</ref>
suggested
the
deal
was
&quot;
probably
in
the
millions
rather
than
the
billions
&quot;
,
echoing
fears
that
the
firm
may
have
been
undervalued
in
its
sale
.
Both
the
methods
of
the
deal
's
announcement
and
the
deal
itself
have
been
attacked
by
both
opposition
parties
.
There
is
anger
in
some
quarters
over
the
deal
being
revealed
on
a
website
rather
than
through
the
commons
,
the
Liberal
Democrats
describing
such
a
failure
as
staggering
.
The
Liberal
Democrats
have
also
raised
the
issue
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear%20Non-Proliferation%20Treaty">
Nuclear
Non-Proliferation
Treaty
</ref>
,
their
defence
spokesman
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick%20Harvey">
Nick
Harvey
</ref>
questioned
&quot;
The
whole
argument
used
for
Britain
having
a
separate
weapons
establishment
is
that
this
is
required
by
the
non-proliferation
treaty
,
as
technology
sharing
is
not
allowed
.
We
must
therefore
query
the
rationale
of
a
US
company
having
a
majority
shareholding
in
AWE
.
How
does
this
all
square
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative%20Party%20(UK)">
Tories
</ref>
have
also
raised
doubts
over
the
decision
,
with
Commons
Public
Accounts
Select
Committee
member
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard%20Bacon">
Richard
Bacon
</ref>
suggesting
that
they
may
involve
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Audit_Office_(United_Kingdom)">
National
Audit
Office
</ref>
.
The
Tory
defence
spokesperson
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald%20Howarth">
Gerald
Howarth
</ref>
,
commented
that
the
firm
was
&quot;
critical
&quot;
and
said
&quot;
What
I
'm
absolutely
determined
is
that
the
United
Kingdom
should
have
total
control
of
its
independent
nuclear
capability
&quot;
.
Mr
Howarth
criticised
handing
over
control
to
American
firms
,
saying
that
the
British
people
would
want
to
know
&quot;
their
politicians
are
in
command
of
the
research
and
development
of
this
capability
&quot;
.
</p>
<p>
The
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry%20of%20Defence%20(United%20Kingdom)">
Ministry
of
Defence
</ref>
has
defended
the
decision
,
saying
&quot;
the
UK
Government
not
AWE
that
sets
the
UK
's
nuclear
policy
&quot;
.
The
MoD
also
assured
that
the
sale
would
have
no
affect
on
the
independence
of
the
British
nuclear
deterrent
or
on
the
safe
operation
of
AWE
.
These
statements
have
been
backed
up
by
news
from
the
government
that
it
has
retained
the
ability
to
re-assert
control
over
the
site
should
it
feel
the
need
,
due
to
a
&quot;
Special
Share
&quot;
.
