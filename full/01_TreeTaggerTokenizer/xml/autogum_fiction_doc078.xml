CHAPTER
21
</head>
<p>
“
Well
,
”
said
one
of
the
deputies
,
as
he
backed
the
horse
into
the
shafts
of
the
buggy
in
which
the
pursuers
had
driven
over
from
the
Hill
,
“
we
've
about
as
good
as
got
him
.
It
is
n't
hard
to
follow
a
man
who
carries
a
bird
cage
with
him
wherever
he
goes
.
”
</p>
<p>
McTeague
crossed
the
mountains
on
foot
the
Friday
and
Saturday
of
that
week
,
going
over
through
Emigrant
Gap
,
following
the
line
of
the
Overland
railroad
.
He
reached
Reno
Monday
night
.
By
degrees
a
vague
plan
of
action
outlined
itself
in
the
dentist
's
mind
.
</p>
<p>
“
Mexico
,
”
he
muttered
to
himself
.
“
Mexico
,
that
's
the
place
.
They
'll
watch
the
coast
and
they
'll
watch
the
Eastern
trains
,
but
they
wo
n't
think
of
Mexico
.
”
</p>
<p>
The
sense
of
pursuit
which
had
harassed
him
during
the
last
week
of
his
stay
at
the
Big
Dipper
mine
had
worn
off
,
and
he
believed
himself
to
be
very
cunning
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
'm
pretty
far
ahead
now
,
I
guess
,
”
he
said
.
At
Reno
he
boarded
a
south-bound
freight
on
the
line
of
the
Carson
and
Colorado
railroad
,
paying
for
a
passage
in
the
caboose
.
“
Freights
don
'
run
on
schedule
time
,
”
he
muttered
,
“
and
a
conductor
on
a
passenger
train
makes
it
his
business
to
study
faces
.
I
'll
stay
with
this
train
as
far
as
it
goes
.
”
</p>
<p>
The
freight
worked
slowly
southward
,
through
western
Nevada
,
the
country
becoming
hourly
more
and
more
desolate
and
abandoned
.
After
leaving
Walker
Lake
the
sage-brush
country
began
,
and
the
freight
rolled
heavily
over
tracks
that
threw
off
visible
layers
of
heat
.
At
times
it
stopped
whole
half
days
on
sidings
or
by
water
tanks
,
and
the
engineer
and
fireman
came
back
to
the
caboose
and
played
poker
with
the
conductor
and
train
crew
.
The
dentist
sat
apart
,
behind
the
stove
,
smoking
pipe
after
pipe
of
cheap
tobacco
.
Sometimes
he
joined
in
the
poker
games
.
He
had
learned
poker
when
a
boy
at
the
mine
,
and
after
a
few
deals
his
knowledge
returned
to
him
;
but
for
the
most
part
he
was
taciturn
and
unsociable
,
and
rarely
spoke
to
the
others
unless
spoken
to
first
.
The
crew
recognized
the
type
,
and
the
impression
gained
ground
among
them
that
he
had
“
done
for
”
a
livery-stable
keeper
at
Truckee
and
was
trying
to
get
down
into
Arizona
.
</p>
<p>
McTeague
heard
two
brakemen
discussing
him
one
night
as
they
stood
outside
by
the
halted
train
.
“
The
livery-stable
keeper
called
him
a
bastard
;
that
's
what
Picachos
told
me
,
”
one
of
them
remarked
,
“
and
started
to
draw
his
gun
;
an
'
this
fellar
did
for
him
with
a
hayfork
.
He
's
a
horse
doctor
,
this
chap
is
,
and
the
livery-stable
keeper
had
got
the
law
on
him
so
's
he
could
n't
practise
any
more
,
an
'
he
was
sore
about
it
.
”
</p>
<p>
Near
a
place
called
Queen
's
the
train
reentered
California
,
and
McTeague
observed
with
relief
that
the
line
of
track
which
had
hitherto
held
westward
curved
sharply
to
the
south
again
.
The
train
was
unmolested
;
occasionally
the
crew
fought
with
a
gang
of
tramps
who
attempted
to
ride
the
brake
beams
,
and
once
in
the
northern
part
of
Inyo
County
,
while
they
were
halted
at
a
water
tank
,
an
immense
Indian
buck
,
blanketed
to
the
ground
,
approached
McTeague
as
he
stood
on
the
roadbed
stretching
his
legs
,
and
without
a
word
presented
to
him
a
filthy
,
crumpled
letter
.
The
letter
was
to
the
effect
that
the
buck
Big
Jim
was
a
good
Indian
and
deserving
of
charity
;
the
signature
was
illegible
.
The
dentist
stared
at
the
letter
,
returned
it
to
the
buck
,
and
regained
the
train
just
as
it
started
.
Neither
had
spoken
;
the
buck
did
not
move
from
his
position
,
and
fully
five
minutes
afterward
,
when
the
slow-moving
freight
was
miles
away
,
the
dentist
looked
back
and
saw
him
still
standing
motionless
between
the
rails
,
a
forlorn
and
solitary
point
of
red
,
lost
in
the
immensity
of
the
surrounding
white
blur
of
the
desert
.
</p>
<p>
At
length
the
mountains
began
again
,
rising
up
on
either
side
of
the
track
;
vast
,
naked
hills
of
white
sand
and
red
rock
,
spotted
with
blue
shadows
.
Here
and
there
a
patch
of
green
was
spread
like
a
gay
table-cloth
over
the
sand
.
All
at
once
Mount
Whitney
leaped
over
the
horizon
.
Independence
was
reached
and
passed
;
the
freight
,
nearly
emptied
by
now
,
and
much
shortened
,
rolled
along
the
shores
of
Owen
Lake
.
At
a
place
called
Keeler
it
stopped
definitely
.
It
was
the
terminus
of
the
road
.
</p>
<p>
The
town
of
Keeler
was
a
one-street
town
,
not
unlike
Iowa
Hill
--
the
post-office
,
the
bar
and
hotel
,
the
Odd
Fellows
'
Hall
,
and
the
livery
stable
being
the
principal
buildings
.
</p>
<p>
“
Where
to
now
?
”
muttered
McTeague
to
himself
as
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
in
his
room
in
the
hotel
.
He
hung
the
canary
in
the
window
,
filled
its
little
bathtub
,
and
watched
it
take
its
bath
with
enormous
satisfaction
.
“
Where
to
now
?
”
he
muttered
again
.
“
This
is
as
far
as
the
railroad
goes
,
an
'
it
won
'
do
for
me
to
stay
in
a
town
yet
a
while
;
no
,
it
won
'
do
.
I
got
to
clear
out
.
Where
to
?
That
's
the
word
,
where
to
?
I
'll
go
down
to
supper
now”
--
He
went
on
whispering
his
thoughts
aloud
,
so
that
they
would
take
more
concrete
shape
in
his
mind
--
“I
'll
go
down
to
supper
now
,
an
'
then
I
'll
hang
aroun
'
the
bar
this
evening
till
I
get
the
lay
of
this
land
.
Maybe
this
is
fruit
country
,
though
it
looks
more
like
a
cattle
country
.
Maybe
it
's
a
mining
country
.
If
it
's
a
mining
country
,
”
he
continued
,
puckering
his
heavy
eyebrows
,
“
if
it
's
a
mining
country
,
an
'
the
mines
are
far
enough
off
the
roads
,
maybe
I
'd
better
get
to
the
mines
an
'
lay
quiet
for
a
month
before
I
try
to
get
any
farther
south
.
