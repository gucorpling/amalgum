Keep
a
Family
Calendar
</head>
<p>
Today
's
families
are
busy
!
Keeping
everyone
's
schedules
straight
on
a
family
calendar
can
be
a
daunting
task
.
Even
with
a
plethora
of
online
calendar
tools
available
,
many
people
prefer
an
old
fashioned
written
calendar
,
and
with
a
little
creativity
and
preparation
,
you
can
turn
this
pending
tsunami
into
nothing
more
than
a
gentle
breeze
.
The
added
bonus
is
it
does
n't
have
to
cost
an
arm
and
a
leg
...

Decide
how
you
want
to
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Keep_a_Calendar">
keep
your
calendar
</ref>
.
Some
people
prefer
decorative
wall
calendars
,
others
prefer
desk
calendars
,
yet
others
prefer
white
board
calendars
.
The
important
thing
is
to
make
sure
it
has
plenty
of
room
to
write
at
least
one
thing
for
each
person
in
your
family
.

Assign
each
person
in
the
family
a
specific
&quot;
color
&quot;
.
All

appointments
</ref>
,
activities
,
meetings
,
etc.
for
that
person
will
be
written
in
that
color
.

<item>
Decide
how
simple
or
complex
you
want
to
make
your
calendar
.
Some
people
like
to
keep
it
simple
,
with
just
times
or
places
.
Others
like
to
make
it
more
decorative
and
use
stickers
or
magnets
relating
to
the
particular
activity
(
for
example
,
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Play_Baseball">
baseballs
</ref>
for
baseball
practice
or
games
,
musical
notes
for
piano
lessons
)
.

Purchase
all
supplies
.
The
supplies
needed
are
listed
below
under
&quot;
Things
You
'll
Need
&quot;
.
All
of
these
can
be
found
at
most
craft
stores
,
&quot;
big
box
&quot;
stores
(
Target
,
Walmart
)
,
office
supply
stores
(
Office
Max
,
Staples
)
,
or
online
.
You
can
adjust
your
complexity
to
fit
your
budget
(
Obviously
,
you
can
skip
this
step
if
you
already
have
everything
.
)

<item>
Fill
out
your
calendar
.
Use
one
color
for
each
person
.
Fill
out
as
much
information
as
necessary
,
but
try
not
to
get
overly
detailed
.
The
more
details
you
add
,
the
harder
it
will
be
to
keep
the
different
items
straight
.
This
is
also
beneficial
if
you
have
multiple
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Incorporate_Activities_Into_Your_Child's_Life">
activities
</ref>
on
one
day
...
if
you
add
too
many
details
,
you
risk
having
to
&quot;
bleed
&quot;
over
into
adjoining
days
.

<item>
Keep
the
calendar
in
a
place
where
you
will
see
it
every
day
such
as
the
fridge
,
the
hallway
,
a
shared
telecommunications
area
,
etc.
If
you
regularly
check
your
email
first
thing
in
the
morning
,
a
desk
calendar
might
be
the
best
.
If
you
walk
into
the
kitchen
initially
,
a
wall
calendar
would
be
optimal
.

Tips

<list type="unordered">
<item>
There
are
pros
and
cons
to
each
type
of
calendar
.
What
may
work
for
one
person
may
not
work
for
another
.
Do
a
test
run
and
be
prepared
to
change
to
a
different
method
if
the
first
does
n't
seem
to
be
working
so
well
for
your
family
.

Over-scheduling
is
a
huge
issue
in
families
.
Seeing
a
calendar
with
everyone
's
schedule
will
give
you
a
chance
to
prioritize
what
really
needs
doing
.
</item>
<item>
Before
throwing
out
an
old
calendar
,
write
down
any
birthdays
or
anniversaries
in
the
new
one
.
</item>
<item>
If
using
a
white
board
calendar
,
update
it
at
the
beginning
of
the
month
every
month
.
</item>
<item>
Many
people
prefer
to
also
keep
a
small
pocket
calendar
to
jot
down
appointments
as
they
are
made
or
keep
a
business
card
holder
to
collect
appointment
cards
at
doctor
's
visits
.
</item>
<item>
When
a
new
appointment
is
made
,
update
the
calendar
as
soon
as
possible
.
The
longer
you
wait
,
the
more
likely
you
are
to
forget
to
do
so
.
Likewise
,
when
a
school
calendar
comes
out
,
write
down
all
days
off
,
early-dismissals
,
or
other
important
dates
right
away
.
