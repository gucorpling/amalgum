The
group
's
tactics
have
been
criticized
.
Co-founder
Pacheco
,
who
is
no
longer
with
PETA
,
called
them
&quot;
stupid
human
tricks
.
&quot;
Some
feminists
criticize
their
campaigns
featuring

said
&quot;
The
effort
by
PETA
to
compare
the
deliberate
systematic
murder
of
millions
of
Jews
to
the
issue
of
animal
rights
is
abhorrent
.
&quot;
(
Newkirk
later
issued
an
apology
for
any
hurt
it
caused
)
.
Perhaps
most
controversial
amongst
politicians
,
the
public
and
even
other
animal
rights
organizations
is
PETA
's
refusal
to
condemn
the
actions
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal%20Liberation%20Front">

Liberation
Front

,
which
in
January
2005
was
named
as
a
terrorist

on
November
12
,
and
the
following
day
he
sat
down
with
Ingrid
Newkirk
to
discuss
her
perspectives
on
PETA
,
animal
rights
,
her
responses
to
criticism
lodged
against
her
and
to
discuss
her
on-going
life
's
work
to
raise
human
awareness
of
animal
suffering
.
Below
is
her
interview

How
did
you
feel
about
the

Oh…um…I
did
n’t
know
what
it
was
going
to
be
.
I
had
expectations
because
I
<hi rend="italic">
did
</hi>
trust
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew%20Galkin">

,
but
I
realize
there
has
to
be
a
certain
more
interesting
bent
to
it
.
Like
my
hate
mail
and
my
will
.
Getting
naked

.
Trying
to
draw
me
out
so
that
I
will
cry
.
Those
are
the
kinds
of
things
I
think
HBO
wants
to
have
because
those
are
the
things
that
will
hold
an
audience
better
than
just
the
facts
.
So
much
was
left
out
,
and
I
did
n’t
know
what
was
going
to
be
left
out
,
so
that
was
interesting
.

You
are
pretty
media
savvy
;
was
that
okay
with
you
that
they
crafted
the
film
the
way
they
did
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
IN
:
</hi>
You
have
to
make
allowances
,
because
you
know
you
will
not
be
directing
and
producing
it
yourself
,
so
there
is
some
give
and
take
.
I
hoped
what
would
be
shown
is
the
good
of
the
behind-the-scenes
PETA
,
and
the
footage
,
and
giving
a
glimpse
to
people
of
why
we
do
what
we
do
.
You
have
to
take
the
bits
that
you
would
n’t
necessarily
put
in
your
own
film
.

DS
:
Many
people
when
they
hear
about
PETA
think
they
are
an
organization
that
is
more
concerned
with
the
well-being
of
chickens
than
they
are
with
the
well-being
of
humans
.
How
would
you
respond
to
that
?
