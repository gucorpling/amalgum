Divide
Astilbe
</head>
<p>
Astilbe
are
shade-tolerant
plants
with
average
moisture
needs
.
They
have
fern-like
foliage
and
colorful
flowers
ranging
from
pink
to
red
or
white
.
They
grow
up
to
tall
and
they
can
multiply
quickly
,
so
it
is
important
to
divide
your
astilbe
regularly
.
Without
regular
divisions
,
astilbe
may
wither
from
overcrowding
.
Dividing
your
astilbe
is
easy
,
so
incorporate
this
into
your
gardening
practice
for
beautiful
astilbe
year
after
year
!

Timing
the
Astilbe
Divisions
</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Check
every
3
to
4
years
.
Astilbe
does
not
need
to
be
divided
every
year
.
Plan
to
divide
your
astilbe
about
once
every
3
to
4
years
or
when
you
notice
that
it
has
started
to
clump
up
.
This
will
help
to
keep
the
astilbe
healthy
and
looking
its
best
.

Plan
to
divide
in
the
spring
.
Cooler
temperatures
are
best
for
dividing
astilbe
,
so
plan
your
divisions
for
the
spring
.
Dividing
the
plants
in
the
summer
or
when
the
weather
is
too
warm
can
be
a
shock
to
your
plants
and
may
even
kill
them
.

You
may
also
divide
the
astilbe
in
the
fall
as
long
as
the
temperatures
are
cool
.

</list>
</item>
<item>
Wait
until
you
can
get
several
clumps
from
the
astilbe
.
It
is
not
worth
dividing
your
astilbe
if
you
will
only
get
a
few
clumps
.
Instead
,
wait
until
you
can
get
several
clumps
from
each
plant
.
Check
the
plants
to
see
how
many
clumps
of
stems
are
near
the
base
of
the
plant
.
<figure rend="Divide Astilbe Step 3.jpg">

For
example
,
if
there
are
only
2
or
3
clumps
per
plant
,
then
it
's
too
soon
to
divide
.
If
there
are
5
or
more
clumps
,
then
now
is
a
good
time
to
divide
.

Digging
Up
the
Astilbe
</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Water
the
astilbe
a
couple
of
days
before
dividing
.
Watering
helps
to
soften
the
soil
.
It
will
be
much
easier
to
divide
the
astilbe
if
the
soil
is
moist
and
softened
up
a
bit
.
Make
sure
that
you
water
your
plants
at
couple
of
days
before
dividing
them
to
ensure
that
the
soil
is
moist
.

Another
option
is
to
plan
to
divide
the
astilbe
a
couple
of
days
after
it
rains
.

<item>
Insert
a
spade
or
garden
fork
deep
into
the
soil
under
the
roots
.
You
do
not
want
to
cut
into
the
roots
,
because
this
can
harm
the
plant
.
Instead
,
dig
down
underneath
the
roots
to
protect
them
.
If
you
are
unsure
how
deep
the
roots
go
,
then
dig
alongside
the
plant
until
you
find
the
base
of
the
roots
and
then
dig
under
them
.
<figure rend="Divide Astilbe Step 5.jpg">

<item>
Dig
a
trench
around
the
root
ball
.
Once
you
have
gotten
to
the
bottom
of
the
root
ball
,
use
a
spade
to
dig
out
the
soil
from
around
the
root
ball
.
This
will
help
to
loosen
the
plant
and
make
it
easier
for
you
to
pull
it
out
of
the
ground
without
damaging
it
.

you
do
this

Pull
the
plant
out
with
the
root
ball
intact
.
Grasp
the
astilbe
near
the
base
of
the
stems
and
pull
it
out
of
the
ground
after
you
have
loosened
it
from
the
surrounding
soil
.
If
there
is
any
resistance
,
use
your
spade
or
fork
to
loosen
the
dirt
some
more
.
Do
not
yank
on
the
astilbe
,
as
this
may
damage
it
.
<figure rend="Divide Astilbe Step 7.jpg">

Shake
off
the
excess
dirt
.
Give
the
plant
a
good
shake
as
you
pull
it
out
to
remove
the
excess
dirt
from
the
root
ball
.
You
may
also
need
to
tap
or
scrape
it
with
your
fingers
,
but
be
gentle
.

Separating

Replanting
the
Crowns
</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Use
your
fingers
or
a
pair
of
garden
shears
to
separate
the
crowns
.
Once
you
have
removed
all
of
the
astilbe
plants
you
want
to
divide
,
use
your
fingers
or
a
pair
of
gardening
shears
to
break
apart
the
crowns
.
The
bases
of
the
astilbe
are
the
crowns
,
and
these
are
what
you
need
to
separate
.
Each
crown
should
only
have
a
few
stems
extending
from
it
.
<figure rend="Divide Astilbe Step 9.jpg">
</figure>
<list type="unordered">
<item>
If
there
is
still
too
much
dirt
near
the
base
to
make
out
the
individual
crowns
,
then
rinse
away
the
dirt
with
some
cool
water
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Replant
the
divisions
as
soon
as
possible
.
It
is
important
to
get
the
crowns
back
into
the
ground
or
a
pot
of
soil
as
soon
as
possible
.
After
you
have
made
the
divisions
,
replant
the
astilbe
in
a
garden
bed
or
pot
of
soil
with
the
plants
apart
.
Place
the
root
ball
deep
into
the
soil
so
that
it
is
completely
covered
,
and
then
press
the
soil
around
the
base
of
the
plant
.

Make
sure
to
locate
the
plants
in
light
to
moderate
shade
.
Astilbe
does
not
do
well
in
full
sun
—
too
much
sun
will
cause
its
leaves
to
burn
.
</item>
<item>
Avoid
areas
with
poor
drainage
.
Astilbe
plants
need
moisture
,
but
too
much
will
cause
them
to
rot
.

<item>
Water
and
add
mulch
to
the
soil
around
the
plant
to
keep
it
moist
.
Water
the
astilbe
after
replanting
them
to
ensure
that
the
soil
is
moist
.
It
is
important
to
keep
the
plants
consistently
moist
after
replanting
them
,
so
apply
a
layer
of
mulch
over
the
soil
as
well
.
This
will
help
to
keep
the
moisture
in
the
soil
.
