Methodology
</head>
<p>
The
proposed
agricultural
and
meteorological
drought
comparison
framework
begins
with
the
selection
of
appropriate
indicators
to
quantify
agricultural
and
meteorological
droughts
.
Time
series
of
these
indicators
over
a
common
time
period
are
then
used
to
make
comparisons
.
Drought
indicators
provide
numerical
values
whose
magnitude
indicates
the
(
moisture
)
state
the
system
is
in
.
This
continuous
drought
indicator
time
series
can
be
used
directly
to
understand
correlations
between
agricultural
and
meteorological
droughts
,
as
well
as
to
perform
confirmatory
hypothesis
tests
to
establish
their
relationships
under
various
lags
.
For
most
indicators
,
negative
values
below
a
prespecified
threshold
indicate
drought
.
Therefore
,
indicator
time
series
can
be
transformed
into
a
binary
(
drought/non-drought
)
time
series
using
the
appropriate
thresholds
.
These
binary
time
series
have
traditionally
been
used
to
calculate
drought
duration
,
severity
,
and
intensity
.
Binary
time
series
can
also
be
compared
to
determine
the
level
of
agreement
between
various
drought
indices
,
and
can
be
used
to
construct
contingency
tables
and
perform
a
wide
array
of
statistical
analyses
to
compare
meteorological-
and
agriculture-related
droughts
.
The
proposed
framework
provides
a
suite
of
exploratory
and
confirmatory
tests
that
can
be
used
to
evaluate
continuous
and
discrete
(
binary
)
meteorological
and
agricultural
drought
time
series
,
which
are
illustrated
using
Ethiopia
as
a
case-study
.

Selection
of
Meteorological
and
Agricultural
Drought
Indicators
</head>
<p>
As
stated
,
the
first
step
in
the
evaluation
framework
is
to
select
appropriate
meteorological
and
agricultural
drought
indicators
.
While
there
are
many
such
indicators
,
the
Lincoln
declaration
recommended
the
adoption
of
the
Standardized
Precipitation
Index
(
SPI
)
as
a
universal
indicator
of
meteorological
droughts
.
Several
studies
have
adopted
this
indicator
to
study
meteorological
droughts
in
Ethiopia
,
and
as
such
,
it
has
been
adopted
here
.
</p>
<p>
While
the
quantification
of
meteorological
droughts
using
SPI
has
become
standard
practice
worldwide
,
no
universally-accepted
indicator
for
characterizing
agricultural
droughts
exists
today
.
It
is
widely
recognized
that
agricultural
droughts
are
best
defined
using
soil
moisture
as
the
master
variable
.
However
,
soil
moisture
has
not
been
extensively
monitored
in
most
parts
of
the
world
(
Ethiopia
included
)
,
as
doing
so
has
proven
to
be
challenging
due
to
the
high
level
of
spatio-temporal
variability
of
this
parameter
and
lack
of
reliable
methods
for
upscaling
point
level
measurements
to
larger
spatial
scales
.
While
agricultural
drought
indices
based
on
model-derived
soil
moisture
estimates
have
been
proposed
,
calculating
them
is
usually
unfeasible
for
large-scale
(
regional
and
national
)
studies
spanning
multiple
watersheds
.
Crop
stress
and
vegetative
health
indices
(
e.
g.
,
the
normalized
difference
vegetation
index
,
or
NDVI
)
have
also
been
used
to
assess
agricultural
droughts
.
However
,
these
methods
do
not
yield
standardized
measures
that
can
be
consistently
compared
in
space
and
time
,
and
are
also
affected
by
the
limited
length
of
the
records
,
as
they
rely
on
satellite-derived
data
,
and
as
such
,
are
not
suitable
for
evaluating
long-term
droughts
to
capture
natural
climatic
and
hydrologic
variability
that
manifest
over
multi-decadal
scales
due
to
limited
data
availability
.
Gridded
soil
moisture
datasets
have
also
been
developed
in
recent
times
,
either
using
simple
water
budgets
or
energy
budgets
from
remotely-sensed
data
.
These
derived
datasets
can
be
directly
used
to
study
agricultural
droughts
,
especially
when
their
adequacy
can
be
ascertained
using
ground-based
soil
moisture
data
.
Efforts
have
also
been
made
to
archive
in
situ
soil
moisture
measurements
collected
worldwide
.
</p>
<p>
In
areas
where
soil
moisture
data
are
unavailable
to
validate
model-
or
remote-sensed-based
soil
moisture
products
,
drought
indices
that
utilize
temperature-based
potential
evapotranspiration
,
in
addition
to
rainfall
,
to
indirectly
capture
the
effects
of
soil
moisture
deficits
have
been
proposed
,
and
are
often
used
to
characterize
agricultural
droughts
.
The
standardized
precipitation
evapotranspiration
index
(
SPEI
)
uses
the
standardized
measure
of
precipitation
(
P
)
minus
evapotranspiration
(
PET
)
to
characterize
droughts
.
While
SPEI
is
a
meteorological
drought
indicator
,
and
does
not
explicitly
model
soil
moisture
dynamics
,
it
is
known
to
correlate
well
with
agricultural
droughts
,
as
the
atmospheric
water
budget
(
P-PET
)
affects
surface
soil
dryness
.
Therefore
,
SPEI
computed
over
short
accumulation
periods
(
typically
1
â€“
6
months
)
has
been
widely
used
as
an
indicator
of
agricultural
droughts
.
Therefore
,
SPEI
can
be
viewed
as
an
agriculture-related
drought
indicator
.
In
this
regard
,
Vicente-Serrano
et
al.
indicated
that
the
method
used
to
estimate
PET
has
little
bearing
on
the
computation
of
SPEI
,
and
recommended
using
the
Thornthwaite
model
which
allows
the
use
of
the
SPEI
drought
index
with
minimal
data
requirements
.
