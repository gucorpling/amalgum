Tom
is
Imprisoned
</head>
<p>
&quot;
Well
,
I
must
say
he
's
a
cool
one
,
&quot;
remarked
Tom
,
as
the
echoes
of
Mr.
Berg
's
steps
died
away
.
&quot;
The
idea
of
thinking
his
boat
better
than
ours
!
I
do
n't
like
that
man
,
dad
.
I
'm
suspicious
of
him
.
Do
you
think
he
came
here
to
steal
some
of
our
ideas
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
No
,
I
hardly
believe
so
,
my
son
.
But
how
did
you
discover
him
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Just
as
you
saw
,
dad
.
I
heard
a
noise
and
went
back
there
to
investigate
.
I
found
him
sneaking
around
,
looking
at
the
electric
propeller
plates
.
I
went
to
grab
him
just
as
he
stumbled
over
a
board
.
At
first
I
thought
it
was
one
of
the
old
gang
.
I
'm
almost
sure
he
was
trying
to
discover
something
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
No
,
Tom
.
The
firm
he
works
for
are
good
business
men
,
and
they
would
not
countenance
anything
like
that
.
They
are
heartless
competitors
,
however
,
and
if
they
saw
a
legitimate
chance
to
get
ahead
of
me
and
take
advantage
,
they
would
do
it
.
But
they
would
not
sneak
in
to
steal
my
ideas
.
I
feel
sure
of
that
.
Besides
,
they
have
a
certain
type
of
submarine
which
they
think
is
the
best
ever
invented
,
and
they
would
hardly
change
at
this
late
day
.
They
feel
sure
of
winning
the
Government
prize
,
and
I
'm
just
as
glad
we
're
not
going
to
have
a
contest
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Do
you
think
our
boat
is
better
than
theirs
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Much
better
,
in
many
respects
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
do
n't
like
that
man
Berg
,
though
,
&quot;
went
on
Tom
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Nor
do
I
,
&quot;
added
his
father
.
&quot;
There
is
something
strange
about
him
.
He
was
very
anxious
that
I
should
compete
.
Probably
he
thought
his
firm
's
boat
would
go
so
far
ahead
of
ours
that
they
would
get
an
extra
bonus
.
But
I
'm
glad
he
did
n't
see
our
new
method
of
propulsion
.
That
is
the
principal
improvement
in
the
Advance
over
other
types
of
submarines
.
Well
,
another
week
and
we
will
be
ready
for
the
test
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Have
you
known
Mr.
Berg
long
,
dad
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Not
very
.
I
met
him
in
Washington
when
I
was
in
the
patent
office
.
He
was
taking
out
papers
on
a
submarine
for
his
firm
at
the
same
time
I
got
mine
for
the
Advance
.
It
is
rather
curious
that
he
should
come
all
the
way
here
from
Philadelphia
,
merely
to
see
if
I
was
going
to
compete
.
There
is
something
strange
about
it
,
something
that
I
ca
n't
understand
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
time
was
to
come
when
Mr.
Swift
and
his
son
were
to
get
at
the
bottom
of
Mr.
Berg
's
reasons
,
and
they
learned
to
their
sorrow
that
he
had
penetrated
some
of
their
secrets
.
</p>
<p>
Before
going
to
bed
that
night
Tom
and
Mr.
Sharp
paid
a
visit
to
the
shed
where
the
submarine
was
resting
on
the
ways
,
ready
for
launching
.
They
found
Mr.
Jackson
on
guard
and
the
engineer
said
that
no
one
had
been
around
.
Nor
was
anything
found
disturbed
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
It
certainly
is
a
great
machine
,
&quot;
remarked
the
lad
as
he
looked
up
at
the
cigar-shaped
bulk
towering
over
his
head
.
&quot;
Dad
has
outdone
himself
this
trip
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
It
looks
all
right
,
&quot;
commented
Mr.
Sharp
.
&quot;
Whether
it
will
work
is
another
question
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Yes
,
we
ca
n't
tell
until
it
's
in
the
water
,
&quot;
conceded
Tom
.
&quot;
But
I
hope
it
does
.
Dad
has
spent
much
time
and
money
on
it
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
Advance
was
,
as
her
name
indicated
,
much
in
advance
of
previous
submarines
.
There
was
not
so
much
difference
in
outward
construction
as
there
was
in
the
means
of
propulsion
and
in
the
manner
in
which
the
interior
and
the
machinery
were
arranged
.
</p>
<p>
The
submarine
planned
by
Mr.
Swift
and
Tom
jointly
,
and
constructed
by
them
,
with
the
aid
of
Mr.
Sharp
and
Mr.
Jackson
,
was
shaped
like
a
Cigar
,
over
one
hundred
feet
long
and
twenty
feet
in
diameter
at
the
thickest
part
.
It
was
divided
into
many
compartments
,
all
water-tight
,
so
that
if
one
or
even
three
were
flooded
the
ship
would
still
be
useable
.
</p>
<p>
Buoyancy
was
provided
for
by
having
several
tanks
for
the
introduction
of
compressed
air
,
and
there
was
an
emergency
arrangement
so
that
a
collapsible
aluminum
container
could
be
distended
and
filled
with
a
powerful
gas
.
This
was
to
be
used
if
,
by
any
means
,
the
ship
was
disabled
on
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
.
The
container
could
be
expanded
and
filled
,
and
would
send
the
Advance
to
the
surface
.
</p>
<p>
Another
peculiar
feature
was
that
the
engine-room
,
dynamos
and
other
apparatus
were
all
contained
amidships
.
This
gave
stability
to
the
craft
,
and
also
enabled
the
same
engine
to
operate
both
shafts
and
propellers
,
as
well
as
both
the
negative
forward
electrical
plates
,
and
the
positive
rear
ones
.
</p>
<p>
These
plates
were
a
new
idea
in
submarine
construction
,
and
were
the
outcome
of
an
idea
of
Mr.
Swift
,
with
some
suggestions
from
his
son
.
</p>
<p>
The
aged
inventor
did
not
want
to
depend
on
the
usual
screw
propellers
for
his
craft
,
nor
did
he
want
to
use
a
jet
of
compressed
air
,
shooting
out
from
a
rear
tube
,
nor
yet
a
jet
of
water
,
by
means
of
which
the
creature
called
the
squid
shoots
himself
along
.
Mr.
Swift
planned
to
send
the
Advance
along
under
water
by
means
of
electricity
.
</p>
<p>
Certain
peculiar
plates
were
built
at
the
forward
and
aft
blunt
noses
of
the
submarine
.
Into
the
forward
plate
a
negative
charge
of
electricity
was
sent
,
and
into
the
one
at
the
rear
a
positive
charge
,
just
as
one
end
of
a
horseshoe
magnet
is
positive
and
will
repel
the
north
end
of
a
compass
needle
,
while
the
other
pole
of
a
magnet
is
negative
and
will
attract
it
.
In
electricity
like
repels
like
,
while
negative
and
positive
have
a
mutual
attraction
for
each
other
.
