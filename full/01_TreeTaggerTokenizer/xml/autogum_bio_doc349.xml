Poglietti

The

was
particularly

ennobling
him
and
bestowing
upon
him
the
title
<hi rend="italic">
Comes

the
composer

Poglietti
's
importance
lies
primarily
in
his
keyboard
music
.
Together
with
Johann

he
represents
the
transitional
period
between
the
time
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girolamo_Frescobaldi">
