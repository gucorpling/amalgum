THROUGH
THE
GAP
</head>
<p>
When
thistles
go
adrift
,
the
sun
sets
down
the
valley
between
the
hills
;
when
snow
comes
,
it
goes
down
behind
the
Cumberland
and
streams
through
a
great
fissure
that
people
call
the
Gap
.
Then
the
last
light
drenches
the
parson
's
cottage
under
Imboden
Hill
,
and
leaves
an
after-glow
of
glory
on
a
majestic
heap
that
lies
against
the
east
.
Sometimes
it
spans
the
Gap
with
a
rainbow
.
</p>
<p>
Strange
people
and
strange
tales
come
through
this
Gap
from
the
Kentucky
hills
.
Through
it
came
these
two
,
late
one
day
--
a
man
and
a
woman
--
afoot
.
I
met
them
at
the
foot-bridge
over
Roaring
Fork
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Is
thar
a
preacher
anywhar
aroun
'
hyeh
?
&quot;
he
asked
.
I
pointed
to
the
cottage
under
Imboden
Hill
.
The
girl
flushed
slightly
and
turned
her
head
away
with
a
rather
unhappy
smile
.
Without
a
word
,
the
mountaineer
led
the
way
towards
town
.
A
moment
more
and
a
half-breed
Malungian
passed
me
on
the
bridge
and
followed
them
.
</p>
<p>
At
dusk
the
next
day
I
saw
the
mountaineer
chopping
wood
at
a
shanty
under
a
clump
of
rhododendron
on
the
river-bank
.
The
girl
was
cooking
supper
inside
.
The
day
following
he
was
at
work
on
the
railroad
,
and
on
Sunday
,
after
church
,
I
saw
the
parson
.
The
two
had
not
been
to
him
.
Only
that
afternoon
the
mountaineer
was
on
the
bridge
with
another
woman
,
hideously
rouged
and
with
scarlet
ribbons
fluttering
from
her
bonnet
.
Passing
on
by
the
shanty
,
I
saw
the
Malungian
talking
to
the
girl
.
She
apparently
paid
no
heed
to
him
until
,
just
as
he
was
moving
away
,
he
said
something
mockingly
,
and
with
a
nod
of
his
head
back
towards
the
bridge
.
She
did
not
look
up
even
then
,
but
her
face
got
hard
and
white
,
and
,
looking
back
from
the
road
,
I
saw
her
slipping
through
the
bushes
into
the
dry
bed
of
the
creek
,
to
make
sure
that
what
the
half-breed
told
her
was
true
.
