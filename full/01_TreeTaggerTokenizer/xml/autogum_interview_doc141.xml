citizens
carrying

day

as

Yes
,
they
are
.
This
is
not
like
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban%20Missile%20Crisis">
Cuban

Crisis

when
people
were
emptying
the
store
shelves
and
building
bunkers
in
their
basements
.
My

are
coming

going
like
normal

Indeed

South

composure
is
very
impressive

Is
North
Korea
becoming
further
isolated
in
the
world
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
RK
</hi>
:
Yes
,
it
is
.
Threatening
nuclear
war
is
a
genuine
escalation
that
would
alienate
any
state
.
Importantly
though
,
NK
is
already
fairly
isolated
.
And
because
China
,
its
main
aid
supplier
,
does
not
cut
it
off
,
further
isolation
has
few
practical
impacts
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
SS
</hi>
:
North
Korea
is
increasingly
politically
isolated
but
it
is
comparatively
more
economically
and
informationally
connected
than
it
was
a
decade
ago
.

Is

well-prepared
to

Yes

The
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic%20of%20Korea%20Army">
ROKA
</ref>
[
Republic
of
Korea
Army
,
of
South
Korea

is
a
modern
,
well-trained
,
well-groomed
force
with
substantial
technical
and
organization
superiority
over
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean%20People's%20Army">
KPA
</ref>
[
Korean
People
's
Army
,
of
North
Korea
]
.
To
date
,
the
South
Koreans
have
not
responded
to
Northern
provocation
in
order
to
avoid
escalation
,
not
because
they
are
incapable
.
SK
conventional
superiority
is
augmented
further
by
US
assistance
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
SS
</hi>
:
South
Korea
will
decisively
win
most
direct
conventional
engagements
with
the
North
,
but
is
vulnerable
in
selected
theaters
where
North
Korea
perceives
a
lack
of
readiness
or
a
tactical
advantage
.

Is
the
closure
of
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Kaesong">
Kaesong
</ref>
by
North
Korea
,
evidence
of
further
escalating
tensions
between
the
two
nations
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
RK
</hi>
:
Yes
and
no
.
It
is
important
,
because
it
is
a
source
of
hard
currency
for
the
North
,
so
its
closure
suggests
that
the
North
is
willing
to
carry
genuine
costs
over
this
feud
.
On
the
other
hand
,
the
SK
media
identified
the
closure
of
Kaesong
early
as
a
marker
of
NK
seriousness
,
saying
very
openly
that
if
NK
did
not
close
the
facility
,
they
did
not
really
mean
what
they
were
saying
.
In
other
words
,
NK
was
,
I
think
,
goaded
into
closing
Kaesong
in
the
war
of
words
,
not
as
a
part
of
any
larger
strategic
plan
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
SS
</hi>
:
Thus
far
,
it
is
a
symbolic
evidence
of
potential
for
escalating
tensions
,
but
has
not
yet
resulted
in
material
changes
.
Let
's
see
how
the
situation
plays
out
over
the
next
couple
of
days
.
Kaesong
will
only
become
vulnerable
when
operations
halt
and
when
financial
transfers
connected
to
failure
of
operations
become
operative
.

North
Korea
has
moved
one
of
its
missiles
that
carries
a
large
range
missile
to
its
East
Coast
,
is
this
a
serious
move
?
</p>
<figure>
</figure>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
RK
</hi>
:
I
do
n't
think
it
's
as
serious
a
move
as
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Media">
media
</ref>
has
made
it
out
to
be
.
First
of
all
they
just
moved
one
[
missile
]
.
Second
of
all
,
it
's
not
clear
that
North
Korea
actually
has
nuclear
warheads
that
are
small
enough
to
actually
put
on
top
of
missiles
;
they
tell
us
this
but
nuclear
weapons
are
actually
pretty
heavy
,
which
is
why
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Nuclear_missiles">
nuclear
missiles
</ref>
are
frequently
quite
large
,
so
moving
the
weapon
there
does
n't
necessarily
mean
it
's
pointed
at
the
United
States
or
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Tokyo">
Tokyo
</ref>
which
I
suppose
would
be
the
likely
targets
.
It
's
not
clear
that
it
's
necessarily
a
nuclear
missile
and
it
's
not
being
fueled
or
anything
so
far
as
I
know
so
again
it
's
sort
of
more
of
the
same
...
bluffing
...
sort
of
talking
around
the
issue
and
sort
of
saying
things
that
do
n't
actually
have
genuine
consequences
so
my
sense
is
it
's
more
of
a
war
of
words
.
