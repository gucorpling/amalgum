<p>
This
research
takes
the
specific
case
of
EVCARD
in
China
for
study
and
application
;
therefore
,
the
evaluation
outcomes
may
provide
some
useful
insights
for
ECS
companies
,
the
government
,
and
other
stakeholders
in
terms
of
improving
the
planning
of
the
ECSS
and
the
attractiveness
of
CS
.

According
to
the
experts
’
assessment
,
the
score
of
each
question
under
VURM
was
higher
than
that
of
the
other
questions
(
Table
3
)
.
VURM
is
considered
to
be
the
greatest
criterion
influencing
the
planning
performance
of
ECSS
in
China
(
Table
6
)
.
This
means
that
ECS
companies
must
pay
more
attention
in
controlling
the
relocation
costs
by
reducing
the
relocation
distance
and
relocation
staff
.
Meanwhile
,
this
assessment
result
shows
that
the
convenience
of
renting
and
returning
shared
vehicles
means
the
most
for
users
and
the
score
for
this
question
was
the
highest
.
This
demonstrates
that
the
value
co-creation
between
the
CS
companies
and
users
is
essential
in
the
ECSS
,
in
other
words
,
the
planning
performance
improvement
of
the
ECSS
must
be
based
on
the
satisfaction
of
the
consumers
’
travel
demand.
.
Operators
may
have
to
consider
how
to
increase
the
convenience
through
good
planning
methods
such
as
increasing
the
reservation
time
(
time
between
requesting
and
picking
up
a
vehicle
)
,
adequate
parking
spaces
,
longer
business
hours
,
or
the
application
of
intelligent
networking
technology
.
The
development
of
CS/ECSS
in
China
greatly
relies
on
government
support
.
It
is
essential
for
the
government
to
take
appropriate
policies
to
promote
the
takeoff
of
CS/ECSS
.
The
results
show
that
policies
such
as
appropriately
allocating
parking
resources
to
CS/ECSS
operators
are
key
for
improving
the
attractiveness
of
CS/ECSS
.

CSS
and
RI
were
reported
as
the
second
highest
factors
influencing
the
planning
(
Table
6
)
.
The
importance
of
CSS
on
the
strategic
planning
has
already
been
identified
in
prior
studies
as
described
above
.
For
CS
companies
,
station
attributes
such
as
the
coverage
area
of
each
station
and
the
corresponding
density
and
fleet
size
should
be
calculated
regarding
the
demand
forecast
so
that
use
efficiency
and
construction
costs
can
be
balanced
.
The
location
of
stations
is
what
consumers
emphasize
,
and
its
choice
should
consider
the
built
environment
.
</item>
<item>
RI
is
a
negligible
but
important
factor
,
which
is
directly
related
to
user
satisfaction
.
How
to
deal
with
facility
failure
and
equipment
occupancy
more
effectively
and
efficiently
is
what
CS
operators
must
focus
on
.
In
fact
,
for
CS
operators
,
intelligent
and
information
technology
should
be
integrated
to
improve
the
supervision
efficiency
,
and
achieve
the
coordination
of
vehicles
,
charging
piles
,
parking
spaces
,
and
power
grids
.
</item>
<item>
MR
was
reported
as
the
least
important
factor
(
Table
6
)
.
This
may
be
due
to
the
operation
phase
of
ECS
.
After
all
,
most
of
the
ECS
companies
in
China
are
still
in
the
early
stage
of
development
.

According
to
the
evaluation
results
,
the
JA
district
of
EVCARD
performed
better
than
the
CN
district
(
Table
10
)
.
The
main
reasons
were
the
RI
and
VURM
.
However
,
the
assessment
value
of
the
JD
district
was
lower
than
the
CN
district
in
CSS
and
MR
.
The
main
reason
may
be
due
to
the
geographic
location
.
The
JA
district
is
much
closer
to
the
urban
center
,
which
may
cause
difficulties
in
distributing
station
networks
and
controlling
the
relevant
costs
.
In
fact
,
the
stations
of
EVCARD
are
distributed
more
in
the
outskirts
of
the
city
rather
than
in
urban
centers
.
How
to
improve
the
construction
planning
of
ECSS
in
urban
centers
,
therefore
,
should
be
seriously
considered
during
future
development
.

Conclusions
</head>
<p>
This
paper
is
among
the
first
to
evaluate
the
planning
of
ECSS
from
a
comprehensive
view
.
In
this
paper
,
we
contribute
to
the
existing
literature
by
developing
a
comprehensive
evaluation
framework
consisting
of
evaluation
criteria
and
an
evaluation
method
.
Through
a
literature
review
and
expert
interviews
,
four
major
evaluation
criteria
were
determined
:
construction
of
stations
,
routine
inspection
,
vehicle
usability
and
relocation
management
,
and
maintenance
and
replacement
of
stations
.
These
criteria
present
a
comprehensive
consideration
of
the
whole
planning
process
of
the
ECSS
.
Then
,
a
combinational
decision
support
tool
for
evaluating
the
planning
of
ECSS
is
presented
in
this
paper
,
based
on
AHP
,
CBA
,
and
VD
.
CBA
and
VD
were
adopted
as
a
supplement
to
the
AHP
method
with
the
aim
to
increase
the
accuracy
of
the
evaluation
.
Based
on
the
CBA
method
,
thirteen
sub-factors
were
introduced
to
measure
the
alternatives
and
some
evaluation
principles
related
to
the
distribution
of
the
station
network
and
station
capacity
are
presented
based
on
the
VD
method
.
This
evaluation
framework
is
capable
of
comprehensively
evaluating
the
planning
of
the
ECSS
.
</p>
<p>
The
case
study
of
EVCARD
contributes
to
an
original
analysis
of
the
planning
of
the
most
influential
ECS
business
in
China
.
We
demonstrate
that
the
planning
of
EVCARD
in
different
areas
has
great
differences
.
EVCARD
should
seek
a
balanced
development
between
different
districts
.
For
EVCARD
,
the
construction
planning
of
the
JA
district
is
a
key
direction
for
improvement
;
relocation
management
and
convenience
of
picking
up
and
returning
EVs
,
however
,
should
be
the
key
improvement
direction
for
the
CN
district
.
