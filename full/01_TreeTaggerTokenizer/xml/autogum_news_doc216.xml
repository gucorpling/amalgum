,

.
</p>
<p>
The
four
countries
met
at
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency">
International
Atomic
Energy
Agency
(
IAEA
)
</ref>
today
in
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Vienna">

</ref>
,
despite
a
statement
on
Iranian
television
shortly
beforehand
saying
that
the
government
would
not
deal
directly
with
France
,
due
to
it
previously
failing
to
provide
&quot;
nuclear
materials
&quot;
.
</p>
<p>
The
countries
are
working
on
a
deal
which
would
allow
Iran
to
send
enriched
uranium
to
France
and
Russia
and
converted
for
use
in
a
medical
isotopes
research
reactor
.
This
is
the
first
time
that
a
deal
has
been
worked
on
regarding
Iran
's
nuclear
programme
since
the
issue
was
brought
up
at
a
meeting
in
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Geneva">
Geneva
</ref>
at
the
start
of
this
month
.
</p>
<p>
One
concern
is
that
Iran
has
not
sent
its
atomic
agency
chief
,
an
indication
that
a
resolution
of
the
matter
may
be
be
achieved
;
nevertheless
ElBaradei
remained
positive
.
&quot;
We
had
this
afternoon
quite
a
constructive
meeting
.
We
're
off
to
a
good
start
.
Most
of
the
technical
issues
have
been
discussed
,
&quot;
he
said
following
the
meeting
.
The
head
of
the
Iranian
delegation
,
Ali
Asghar
Soltanieh
,
agreed
with
with
the
comments
,
but
declined
to
comment
on
Iranian
media
reports
that
the
government
is
reluctant
to
send
its
nuclear
fuel
.
Talks
are
due
to
resume
tomorrow
morning
.

A
senior
Iranian
official
denied
reports
on
state
broadcaster
<hi rend="italic">
Press
TV
</hi>
that
Iran
only
wanted
to
import
higher-enriched
uranium
for
its
research
reactor
directly
from
France
,
Russia
or
the
US
,
due
to
difficulties
under
current
UN
sanctions
.
</p>
<p>
Iran
's
nuclear
energy
agency
spokesman
,
Ali
Shirzadian
,
said
the
deal
would
not
end
nuclear
enrichment
activities
,
as
it
was
not
&quot;
economically
feasible
&quot;
to
purify
further
low
enriched
uranium
itself
to
the
130-300kg
yield
required
,
adding
this
was
an
option
if
talks
&quot;
do
not
bring
about
Iran
's
desired
result
&quot;
.

<p>
Iran
escaped
further
UN
sanctions
after
talks
in
Geneva
earlier
this
month
.
It
agreed
to
IAEA
inspections
of
a
hidden
nuclear
site
,
believed
to
be
near
the
holy
city
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qom">
Qom
</ref>
and
to
send
nuclear
material
to
Russia
and
France
for
processing
,
part
of
the
deal
being
negotiated
at
the
Vienna
talks
.
According
to
Western
officials
,
Iran
already
agreed
tentatively
in
Geneva
to
major
points
,
but
this
is
denied
by
Iran
.
</p>
<p>
According
to
a
Western
diplomat
,
who
wished
to
remain
anonymous
,
the
talks
this
week
were
supposed
to
seal
the
deal
.
&quot;
But
,
since
we
have
had
no
negotiations
thus
far
with
the
Iranians
,
the
next
couple
of
days
could
reopen
a
lot
of
what
we
hoped
was
already
agreed
in
principle
,
&quot;
he
added
.
