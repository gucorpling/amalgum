Wake
up
early
to
get
things
done
.
When
you
get
up
,
clean
up
your
room
.
If
you
work
until
late
,
you
might
consider
taking
your
showers
at
night
so
you
can
sleep
an
extra
20
minutes
or
so
.
If
pets
,
children
or
work
schedules
do
n't
allow
you
to
do
this
,
just
try
not
to
use
the
snooze
function
and
shower
when
you
get
the
chance
.

Make
sure
you
wake
up
early
enough
to
actually
get
ready
.
You
may
feel
run
down
but
you
sure
do
n't
have
to
look
like
it
.
It
will
also
help
if
you
have
everything
that
you
need
for
the
day
packed
up
and
ready
to
go
.

Assuming
you
go
to
school
,
use
every
second
of
your
time
wisely
.
Study
halls
,
lunch
breaks
,
and
free
time
should
n't
be
wasted
.
It
's
easy
to
daydream
but
instead
of
sitting
in
a
sleepy
stare
,
you
could
be
working
on
homework
you
already
know
is
going
to
be
due
or
even
other
assignments
.
Make
it
your
goal
to
get
as
much
done
as
possible
at
school
.
Use
planners
and
schedulers
to
plan
time
to
get
projects
,
readings
,
and
other
assignments
finished
.
Try
not
to
procrastinate
.
It
's
something
everyone
is
guilty
of
,
but
by
doing
a
little
work
day
by
day
it
will
ultimately
be
easier
.

This
might
not
seem
important
,
but
really
it
is
.
You
'll
have
more
energy
and
feel
better
.
Try
to
avoid
take
out
foods
,
especially
if
you
work
in
a
restaurant
!
Everyone
realizes
by
now
that
coffee
,
snack
cakes
and
McDonald
's
meals
really
do
add
up
and
hit
your
wallet
.

Pump
yourself
up
for
work
.
Many
people
hate
their
jobs
.
There
will
always
be
someone
who
you
do
n't
like
.
A
task
that
you
hate
to
do
.
So
on
your
way
to
work
,
try
listening
to
your
favorite
songs
.
Listen
to
songs
that
make
you
feel
good
or
remind
you
of
good
times
.
Make
sure
you
get
to
work
on
time
and
are
ready
for
the
job
.
Getting
yelled
at
when
you
walk
in
the
door
first
thing
is
never
a
good
way
to
start
a
day
's
work
or
shift
.
Remember
that
's
it
's
only
a
few
hours
of
your
day
and
you
are
making
money
.
And
as
hard
as
it
,
try
to
be
pleasant
to
your
coworkers
.
Starting
drama
will
not
help
anyone
or
solve
any
problems
.

Be
thankful
when
you
get
your
paycheck
that
you
have
a
job
.
Some
money
is
better
than
no
money
.
Make
sure
your
bills
are
paid
.
If
you
're
young
,
you
probably
have
few
bills
to
pay
.
It
helps
to
make
a
list
of
things
you
want
and
need
.
Put
the
things
you
really
need
at
the
top
.
Maybe
your
jeans
are
getting
a
little
too
thin
to
be
considered
nice
,
or
your
shoes
are
a
bit
worn
out
.
Think
of
things
you
really
need
.
Those
should
be
the
things
you
purchase
first
.
Then
later
come
the
wants
.
Before
you
go
splurge
on
one
item
,
also
think
of
future
wants
.
Will
you
want
to
get
your
hair
done
in
a
few
weeks
?
Will
you
want
to
go
to
that
concert
later
this
summer
?
Do
you
want
to
redo
your
room
?
All
of
this
things
are
wants
and
ultimately
cost
money
as
well
;
think
long
term
.

Do
n't
waste
time
when
you
get
home
.
It
could
be
very
easy
to
plop
down
in
front
of
the
computer
and
waste
2
hours
on
Facebook
or
staring
at
the
TV
screen
for
the
night
.
Try
to
avoid
this
because
before
you
know
it
,
it
'll
be
1
AM
and
you
still
have
n't
moved
since
you
got
home
.
Make
sure
you
make
time
to
spend
with
your
loved
ones
and
find
ways
to
relieve
your
[
[
Reduce
Stress|stress
}
}
.
Do
n't
spend
all
your
free
time
sleeping
.
That
may
actually
make
you
feel
even
more
run
down
in
the
long
run
.
Go
to
bed
at
a
reasonable
time
.
Try
to
get
8
hours
of
sleep
;
it
's
easier
said
then
done
for
most
of
us
.

Make
life
easier
on
yourself
by
doing
the
little
things
.
Make
sure
you
have
gas
in
your
car
.
Do
n't
put
off
stopping
just
because
you
're
tired
.
If
you
ran
out
of
gas
in
the
middle
of
the
road
one
day
,
you
know
you
'd
not
be
happy
.
Make
sure
you
get
your
laundry
done
.
There
's
nothing
worse
then
doing
a
smell
check
to
see
what
's
clean
and
what
's
not
.
Make
sure
you
do
n't
carry
around
more
than
you
need
.
And
do
everyone
a
favor
by
not
constantly
complaining
about
your
life
.
Everyone
goes
through
hard
times
and
no
one
can
really
do
anything
to
fix
your
problems
.

Remember
that
work
is
just
work
.
It
's
something
you
have
to
do
and
will
most
likely
have
to
do
for
a
very
long
time
.
Do
your
job
and
do
it
well
,
and
then
leave
the
stress
there
as
you
walk
out
the
door
.
Do
n't
let
school
,
work
,
and
other
stresses
take
over
your
life
.
Remember
it
's
just
apart
of
your
day
.
You
are
in
actually
a
person
!
