Thursday
.
Apparently
the
crisis
between
Venezuela
and
Colombia
is
almost
solved
.
The
crisis
began
with
the
imprisonment
of
the
alleged
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FARC">
FARC
</ref>
member
Rodrigo
Granda
by
Colombian
forces
on
December
13
,
2004
.
Venezuela
accused
Colombian
of
invading
Venezuelan
territory
.
Colombia
accused
Venezuela
of
harboring
FARC
terrorists
.
The
President
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba">
Cuba
</ref>
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidel%20Castro">
Fidel
Castro
</ref>
,
intervened
in
the
crisis
and
talked
to
Chavez
and
Uribe
.
</p>
<p>
According
to
Bogota
's
newspaper
El
Tiempo
,
Uribe
asked
for
Castro
's
help
on
January
21
.
Castro
responded
with
surprising
speed
and
effectiveness
.
On
January
21
Castro
sent
the
chancellor
Felipe
Perez
Roque
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caracas">
Caracas
</ref>
where
he
met
with
Chávez
and
then
returned
to
Havana
,
informing
Castro
on
the
results
of
the
encounter
.
After
midnight
Castro
communicated
by
telephone
with
Uribe
for
two
hours
.
They
decided
that
Castro
would
send
his
Vice-chancellor
with
a
letter
detailing
what
they
had
talked
about
to
Chávez
.

Chavez
appeared
to
be
optimistic
about
the
end
of
the
crisis
.
He
recognized
the
importance
of
Castro
's
role
in
the
resolution
of
the
problems
between
Colombia
and
Venezuela
.
Also
he
was
thankful
for
the
help
of
the
other
leaders
in
South
America
.
</p>
<p>
The
crisis
between
Venezuela
and
Colombia
lasted
more
than
a
month
without
a
solution
and
it
was
entering
a
dangerous
stage
,
with
severe
accusations
from
both
sides
.
During
recent
days
the
US
government
became
more
interested
in
the
conflict
and
was
pressuring
Chávez
for
a
clear
declaration
about
his
relationship
with
the
FARC
.
The

an
