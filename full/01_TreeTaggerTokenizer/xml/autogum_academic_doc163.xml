The
mid
cross
section
of
ECC
link
slab
is
the
most
disadvantageous
position
under
the
loading
condition
presented
in
<figure>
Figure
1
</figure>
.
Meanwhile
,
the
sample
points
within
the
mid
cross
section
are
the
most
intensive
.
Hence
it
should
be
a
good
attempt
to
investigate
the
working
states
of
ECC
link
slabs
based
on
the
GSED
sum
of
mid
cross
sections
.
Importantly
,
these
scattered
measured
strains
in
this
area
need
to
be
expanded
into
spatially
continuous
strain
data
without
loss
of
original
information
before
the
detection
of
structural
working
state
.
</p>
<p>
Space
interpolation
methods
(
SIMs
)
providing
access
to
the
data
expansion
from
limited
scattered
sample
points
have
been
widely
used
in
various
subjects
.
SIMs
can
be
grouped
into
four
categories
:
Global
methods
(
trend
surface
analysis
and
regression
models
)
,
local
methods
(
natural
neighbor
and
splines
)
,
geostatistical
methods
(
simple
kriging
)
,
and
mixed
methods
(
trend
surface
analysis
combined
with
kriging
)
.
Despite
the
various
assumptions
and
properties
of
these
SIMs
,
nearly
the
general
estimation
formula
is
shared
:
(
11
)
where
<hi rend="italic">
r
</hi>
(
<hi rend="italic">
j
</hi>
)
is
the
simulated
response
value
at
the
interpolated
<hi rend="italic">
j
</hi>
th
point
,
<hi rend="italic">
ωi
</hi>
refers
to
the
weighting
function
assigned
to
the
<hi rend="italic">
i
</hi>
th
sample
point
at
which
the
observed
response
value
is
<hi rend="italic">
ri
</hi>
,
and
<hi rend="italic">
m
</hi>
represents
the
total
number
of
sampling
points
.
Consequently
it
is
a
matter
to
determine
the
weighting
function
<hi rend="italic">
ωi
</hi>
.
</p>
<p>
Among
the
various
SIMs
,
the
response
simulating
interpolation
method
is
introduced
which
makes
full
use
of
the
important
properties
of
numerical
shape
function
(
NSF
)
simulated
by
a
physical
model
.
According
to
the
discretization
concept
and
the
properties
of
NSF
,
the
weighting
function
can
be
derived
by
numerical
simulation
.
Actually
,
the
numerical
simulation
generally
used
for
estimating
experimental
responses
can
partially
reflect
the
implicit
information
included
in
a
specific
physical
model
.
Hence
the
combination
of
numerical
simulation
and
interpolation
is
of
adequate
accuracy
.
The
data
expanded
by
a
reliable
SIM
is
deemed
to
be
helpful
to
the
investigation
on
the
working
state
of
ECC
link
slab
.
</p>
<p>
The
determination
of
NSF
and
the
estimation
of
response
field
(
strains
)
are
implemented
following
the
procedure
:
<list>
<item>
Divide
the
area
into
a
certain
amount
of
suitable
elements
as
shown
in
<figure>
Figure
5
</figure>
.
Although
the
shape
function
of
each
element
is
estimated
,
the
simulated
strain
fields
assembled
with
enough
small
elements
can
still
reflect
the
strain
characteristics
of
this
area
exactly
with
high
order
continuity
.
The
reason
is
that
the
calculation
of
element
stiffness
matrices
and
the
assembling
of
global
stiffness
equation
are
based
on
the
virtual
displacement
principle
and
the
force
balance
principle
,
respectively
.
</item>
<item>
Apply
a
unit
strain
at
node
1
along
the
direction
at
right
angle
to
this
area
,
while
the
other
nodes
are
fixed
along
the
same
direction
to
restrict
rigid
body
displacement
.
Then
,
the
simulated
strain
field
solved
by
static
finite
element
analysis
represents
the
shape
function
<hi rend="italic">
N
</hi>
1
,
as
shown
in
<figure>
Figure
6
</figure>
.
And
it
can
be
expressed
by
discrete
vector
N1
=
{
<hi rend="italic">
N
</hi>
1
(
1
)
,
<hi rend="italic">
N
</hi>
1
(
2
)
,
…
,
<hi rend="italic">
N
</hi>
1
(
<hi rend="italic">
k
</hi>
)
,
…
,
<hi rend="italic">
N
</hi>
1
(
<hi rend="italic">
n
</hi>
)
}
,
where
<hi rend="italic">
N
</hi>
1
(
<hi rend="italic">
k
</hi>
)
is
the
function
value
at
element
node
<hi rend="italic">
k
</hi>
and
<hi rend="italic">
n
</hi>
is
the
total
node
number
.
</item>
<item>
Other
NSFs
(
N
<hi rend="italic">
i
</hi>
)
can
be
determined
in
the
same
way
.
Given
the
strain
value
at
each
measuring
point
and
the
corresponding
NSF
,
the
strain
field
of
this
area
denoted
by
ε
=
{
<hi rend="italic">
ε
</hi>
(
1
)
,
<hi rend="italic">
ε
</hi>
(
2
)
,
…
,
<hi rend="italic">
ε
</hi>
(
<hi rend="italic">
n
</hi>
)
}
can
be
constructed
as
following
,
(
12
)
where
<hi rend="italic">
m
</hi>
is
the
number
of
measured
points
of
strain
.
The
constructed
strain
field
conforming
to
Castigliano
’s
theorem
is
independent
of
loading
paths
and
linear
superposition
can
be
applied
to
the
simulated
results
with
explicit
physi-cal
meanings
.

Data
expansion
is
implemented
with
the
support
of
finite
element
analysis
software
(
ANSYS
)
.
The
models
of
mid
cross
sections
are
created
with
element
Shell
181
for
ECC
materials
and
element
Beam
188
for
reinforcing
materials
.
After
meshing
the
cross
sections
(
60
times
10
=
600
elements
)
,
the
strain
data
of
each
mesh
node
can
be
determined
following
the
steps
described
above
and
then
the
corresponding
stress
can
be
calculated
via
constitutive
relations
.
Accordingly
,
the
GESD
at
each
node
and
the
<hi rend="italic">
E
</hi>
<hi rend="italic">
j
,
</hi>
norm
are
obtained
.
Furthermore
,
the
structural
response
field
at
a
specific
loading
step
can
be
plotted
using
the
expanded
data
.
