People
will
often
ask
me
,
“
Was
n’t
it
hard
for
you
when
the
ACLU
defended
the
rights
of
the
Nazis
to
march
in
Skokie
?
”
No
!
For
me
,
it
’s
never
about
the
Nazis
,
it
’s
about
freedom
of
speech
.
It
’s
about
the
principle
.
So
I
tend
to
see
things
in
a
rather
abstract
level
.
For
every
bad
piece
of
mail
I
receive
,
I
get
marriage
proposals
,
love
letters
,
letters
of
praise
!

There
are
few
organizations
in
the
United
States
that
elicit
a
stronger
emotional
response
than
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACLU">
American
Civil
Liberties
Union
</ref>
,
whose
stated
goal
is
&quot;
to
defend
and
preserve
the
individual
rights
and
liberties
guaranteed
to
every
person
in
this
country
by
the
Constitution
and
laws
of
the
United
States
&quot;
.
Those
people
include
gays
,
Nazis
,
women
seeking
abortion
,
gun
owners
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPAM">
SPAM
</ref>
mailers
and
drug
users
.
People
who
are
often
not
popular
with
various
segments
of
the
public
.
The
ACLU
's
philosophy
is
not
that
it
agrees
or
disagrees
with
any
of
these
people
and
the
choices
that
they
make
,
but
that
they
have
personal
liberties
that
must
not
be
trampled
upon
.

'
s
interview
with
the
President
of
the
ACLU
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadine%20Strossen">
Nadine
Strossen
</ref>
,
he
wanted
to
cover
some
basic
ground
on
the
ACLU
's
beliefs
.
Perhaps
the
area
where
they
are
most
misunderstood
or
have
their
beliefs
most
misrepresented
is
their
feelings
about
religion
in
the
public
sphere
.
The
ACLU
categorically
does
not
want
to
see
religion
disappear
from
schools
or
in
the
public
forum
;
but
they
do
not
want
to
see
government
advocacy
of
any
particular
religion
.
Thus
,
former
Alabama
Chief
Justice
Roy
Moore
's
placement
of
a
ten
ton
monument
to
the
Ten
Commandments
outside
the
courthouse
is
strenuously
opposed
;
but
&quot;
Lone
Ranger
of
the
Manger
&quot;
Rita
Warren
's
placement
of
nativity
scenes
in
public
parks
is
vigorously
defended
.
In
the
interview
,
Strossen
talks
about
how
certain
politicians
and
televangelists
purposefully
misstate
the
law
and
the
ACLU
's
work
in
order
to
raise
funds
for
their
campaigns
.
</p>
<p>
David
Shankbone
's
discussion
with
Strossen
touches
upon
many
of
the
ACLU
's
hot
button
issues
:
religion
,
Second
Amendment
rights
,
drug
liberalization
,
&quot;
partial-birth
abortion
&quot;
and
whether
or
not
George
W.
Bush
should
be
impeached
.
It
may
surprise
the
reader
that
many
ideas
people
have
about
the
most
visible
of
America
's
civil
libertarian
organizations
are
not
factually
correct
and
that
the
ACLU
often
works
closely
with
many
of
the
organizations
people
think
despise
its
existence
.
