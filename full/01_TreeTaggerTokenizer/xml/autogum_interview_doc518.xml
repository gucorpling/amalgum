Campaigning
for
the
American
presidency
is
one
of
the
most
expensive
exercises
in
the
world
.
How
do
you
deal
with
the
cost
and
fundraising
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
Well
,
it
does
n’t
have
to
be
.
I
probably
will
have
spent
around
$1,000-$
3,000
for
the
2
years
of
the
campaign
.
I
’m
use
to
doing
things
without
much
money
.
Is
it
effective
?
You
asked
me
to
do
this
interview
!
And
I
have
a
waiting
line
!
This
kind
of
campaign
is
made
easier
by
the
internet
,
the
indie
media
,
public
access
cable
tv
,
etc.
And
it
will
probably
get
easier
to
do
this
kind
of
campaign
in
the
next
few
years
.
European
mainstream
press
has
covered
our
campaign
quite
a
lot
.
I
expect
that
the
mainstream
press
here
will
discover
our
campaign
via
Europe
after
the
conventions
.
</p>
<p>
So
our
campaign
has
no
paid
ads
,
no
paid
staff
,
no
travel
expenses
[
I
tie
my
campaign
appearances
to
my
performance
tours
]
,
etc.
Our
biggest
expenses
are
things
like
buttons
,
bumper
stickers
,
and
booths
at
street
festivals
.
</p>
<p>
Historically
the
goal
of
independent
and
third-party
candidates
is
not
to
“
win
.
”
Realistically
the
process
is
rigged
to
prevent
us
from
“
winning
.
”
The
function
of
such
a
candidate
as
I
is
to
introduce
ideas
,
to
induce
change
,
to
raise
the
bar
.
Within
this
context
,
my
campaign
is
extremey
effective
.
But
on
the
other
hand
,
I
JUST
MAY
WIN
THIS
SUCKER
!
