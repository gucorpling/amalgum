Introduction
</head>
<p>
Stroke
is
a
major
cause
of
dementia
,
especially
in
the
elderly
.
Specifically
,
the
one-year
post-stroke
dementia
(
PSD
)
rates
after
first-ever
and
recurrent
stroke
are
approximately
10
%
and
30
%
,
respectively
.
Neuropathological
studies
into
Alzheimer
’s
disease
(
AD
)
have
shown
that
AD
pathology
is
often
concomitant
with
ischemic
lesions
in
the
elderly
.
For
instance
,
evidence
from
the
Nun
Study
showed
that
lacunes
increase
the
risk
of
clinical
expression
of
cognitive
impairment
more
than
20
times
during
early
Braak
stages
that
were
yet
sufficient
to
produce
dementia
symptoms
.
It
follows
that
vascular
insults
enhance
the
clinical
expression
of
AD
pathology
.
Vascular
dementia
is
more
prevalent
in
men
and
in
populations
affected
by
cerebral
small-vessel
disease
,
including
Asians
,
Hispanics
,
and
Africans
.

The
cholinergic
system
is
distributed
throughout
the
central
nervous
system
,
playing
a
role
in
neurotransmission
and
possibly
mediating
various
neuroprotective
functions
.
Furthermore
,
cholinergic
neurotransmission
regulates
the
immune
response
during
inflammation
,
in
a
pathway
that
involves
nicotinic
acetylcholine
receptors
(
nAChRs
)
and
inhibits
peripheral
cytokine
release
.
In
particular
,
the
efferent
vagus
nerve
may
release
acetylcholine
(
Ach
)
,
which
subsequently
binds
with
macrophage
receptors
and
therefore
may
inhibit
the
release
of
inflammatory
factors
after
stroke
.
In
addition
to
inflammation
,
excitotoxicity
and
energy
failure
following
cerebral
ischemia
may
also
initiate
intracellular
death
pathways
and
oxidative
stress
(
OS
)
.
The
structural
and
functional
changes
caused
by
OS
led
to
cholinergic
and
other
cellular
damage
.
Cholinergic
deficit
further
caused
brain
atrophy
and
finally
resulted
in
cognitive
impairment
.
Anticholinergic
agents
have
been
shown
to
regulate
OS
and
alleviate
apoptosis
.
Therefore
,
a
key
role
in
the
pathogenesis
of
stroke
and
dementia
may
be
attributed
to
OS
.

<p>
Cholinergic
dysfunction
is
related
to
vascular
dementia
.
Specifically
,
Ach
levels
in
the
cerebrospinal
fluid
are
up
to
49
%
lower
in
patients
with
small-vessel
vascular
dementia
than
in
control
patients
,
suggesting
that
cholinergic
agents
or
cholinesterase
inhibitors
,
both
of
which
increase
the
Ach
level
,
could
be
used
to
treat
such
patients
.
One
pilot
study
showed
that
acetylcholinesterase
(
AChE
)
inhibitor
promoted
functional
recovery
in
elderly
patients
with
cognitive
impairment
who
had
suffered
stroke
.
In
a
rat
model
of
chronic
ischemic
,
AChE
activity
was
slightly
decreased
in
the
frontal
cortex
,
but
muscarinic
acetylcholine
receptor
M1
was
gradually
depleted
in
cerebral
cortex
,
striatum
and
hippocampus
that
are
involved
in
cognitive
function
.
In
addition
,
in
stroke
patients
,
reduced
AChE
activity
was
correlated
with
lower
survival
rate
.
Taken
together
,
these
results
suggest
that
AChE
dysfunction
is
a
result
of
stroke
rather
than
a
cause
for
further
neurodegeneration
.
Moreover
,
AChE
inhibitors
exert
no
effect
on
stroke
risk
in
dementia
patients
.
These
observations
suggest
that
Ach
and
AChE
function
may
predict
post-stroke
neuronal
damage
.
To
date
,
only
a
few
blood
biomarkers
for
predicting
PSD
have
been
examined
(
e.
g.
,
D-amino
acid
oxidase
,
β-secretase
,
and
inflammation
markers
)
,
and
few
studies
have
focused
on
changes
in
blood
cholinesterase
(
ChE
)
levels
and
activity
in
patients
with
PSD
.
Since
plasma
Ach
is
metabolized
by
AChE
and
butylcholinesterase
(
BChE
)
,
the
present
study
examined
the
functional
activities
of
these
two
enzymes
in
a
population
of
patients
with
chronic
ischemic
stroke
(
IS
)
.
