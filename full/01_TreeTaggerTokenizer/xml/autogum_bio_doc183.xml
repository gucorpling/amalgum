Two

</hi>
was
born
between
the
years
of
1846
and
1851
.
The
actual
date
is
not
known
because
many
Native
Americans
living
free
in
the
American
West
during
the
mid-19th
century
had
no
need
to
keep
accurate
records
.
His
death
is
recorded
as
April
23
,
1923
by
William
Wildschut
,
one
of
the
men
who
created
a
biography
(
field
manual
)
of
his
life
.
Two
Leggings
married
his
wife
Ties
Up
Her
Bundle
around
1880
according
to
testimony
given
by
Ties
Up
Her
Bundle
in
1924
at
a
hearing
dictating
who
gained
control
of
Two
Leggings
'
capital
.
They
never
had
their
own
children
but
they
adopted
Red
Clay
Woman
,
the
daughter
of
his
wife
's
sister
.
They
later
went
on
to
adopt
the
son
of

Once
the
extermination
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_bison">

</ref>
began
,
the
competition
among
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plains_Indians">
Plains
Indians
</ref>
was
at
its
fiercest
.
War
became
a
struggle
of
life
and
death
in
the
many
plains
societies
.
War
was
no
trivial
matter
,
in
the
societies
it
was
a
very
spiritual
matter
.
War
required
the
proper
ceremonies
and
occult
assistance
.
Triumph
in
war
was
contingent
on
divine
arrangements
,
war
medicine
,
the
bravery
of
the
warrior
,
and
the
expertise
they
possessed
.
Owing
to
the
constant
state
of
war
found
in
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Plains">
Great
Plains
</ref>
,
death
in
conflict
was
a
special
honor
,
people
who
died
young
were
thought
to
have
had
a
weak
sacred
helper
or
that
they
did
not
abide
by
their
sacred
father
.
Warriors
who
lived
into
old
age
were
believed
to
have
very
formidable
spiritual
helpers
.

Two

lived
to
be
quite
old
,
though
it
was
deemed
that
he
did
not
have
a
very
strong
spiritual
helper
due
to
the
inadequacy
of
his
spiritual
manifestations
.
He
eventually
went
onto
buy
War
Medicine
from
Sees
the
Living
Bull
,
but
ultimately
it
did
little
to
help
him

Two

conducted
many
raids
before
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crow_Nation">
Crow
Nation

was
confined
to
a
reservation
.
Two

was
described
as
a
very
modest
individual
,
documented
by
William
Wildschut
,
in
his
field
manual
about
Two
Leggings
.
Two
Leggings
talked
about
both
his
triumphs
and
defeats
during
his
raids
against
his
band
's
enemies
.
One
of
Two
Leggings
'
first
raids
he
tried
his
luck
because
he
went
to
battle
without
War
Medicine
.
This
raid
almost
cost
him
his
life
,
he
lost
his
horse
and
blanket
,
his
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moccasin">

</ref>
s
and
clothing
were
tattered
,
though
he
still
held
onto
his
gun
and
bow
.

Though
his
spiritual
helper
may
have
been
considered
overall
not
strong
,
he
still
had
visions
,
that
were
deemed
strong
by
his
peers
.

Sun
Dance
Experience
</head>
<p>
The
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Dance">
Sun
Dance
</ref>
is
a
highly
sacred
event
that
occurred
within
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plains_Indians">
Plains
Indian
</ref>
culture
,
as
well
as
other
indigenous
groups
in
North
America
.
As
interaction
with
whites
grew
in
the
19th
century
,
in
order
to
&quot;
civilize
&quot;
the
native
peoples
,
certain
practices
like
the
Sun
Dance
were
suppressed
because
it
was
determined
to
be
too
gruesome
.
Due
to
this
suppression
not
everything
is
known
about
the
Sun
Dance
.
Two
Leggings
performed
his
first
Sun
Dance
after
his
two
cousins
were
killed
in
a
raid
against
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheyenne">
Cheyenne
</ref>
.
His
uncle
Shows
His
Face
was
deranged
with
heartache
over
the
loss
of
his
two
sons
.
Shows
His
Face
asked
a
friend
Puts
Earth
On
Top
Of
His
Head
,
to
use
his
Sun
Dance
Medicine
Bundle
,
which
was
particularly
powerful
.
Two
Leggings
did
not
take
part
in
the
preparations
of
the
ritual
,
while
still
mourning
the
loss
of
his
two
cousins
.
Once
everything
was
prepared
Two
Leggings
decided
that
he
would
be
one
of
the
dancers
in
the
ceremony
.
He
participated
in
the
brutal
ritual
,
and
while
dancing
a
skewer
came
loose
and
he
began
to
bleed
profusely
.
He
tried
to
dance
again
but
the
sheer
exhaustion
kept
him
from
continuing
,
only
watching
from
the
side
while
praying
for
his
own
vision
.
The
next
morning
he
was
awoken
and
informed
of
Shows
His
Face
's
powerful
vision
,
when
asked
if
he
had
received
a
vision
Two
Leggings
admitted
that
he
did
not
.
An
elder
spoke
in
a
tender
tone
,
explaining
that
after
going
through
a
Sun
Dance
everyone
would
acknowledge
him
as
a
Man
.
