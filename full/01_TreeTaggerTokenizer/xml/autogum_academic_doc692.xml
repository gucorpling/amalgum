Introduction

<p>
Modern
construction
works
,
such
as
green
buildings
,
with
increasing
complexity
and
immensity
involve
a
wide
range
of
stakeholders
,
such
as
consultants
,
contractors
,
material
suppliers
,
general
public
,
governmental
institutions
,
etc.
Coordinating
all
of
these
parties
simultaneously
in
the
execution
of
a
construction
project
is
a
big
challenge
.
Value
management
helps
to
improve
communication
between
the
project
’s
parties
,
accommodate
mutual
understanding
of
the
project
objectives
,
provide
better
quality
project
definition
,
build
innovation
,
and
eliminate
unnecessary
cost
.
Value
can
be
understood
in
a
multitude
of
dimensions
through
economic
,
cultural
,
and
social
interpretations
.
The
whole-life-cycle
value
exchange
mechanisms
are
risky
,
complex
,
might
have
an
effect
on
adding
value
,
and
are
composed
of
value
exchange
and
value
creation
(
VC
)
.
Therefore
,
detailed
investigations
focusing
on
finding
mechanisms
for
achieving
sustainability
targets
over
the
entire
life
cycle
of
a
project
is
required
.
</p>
<p>
Globally
,
the
construction
industry
has
been
showing
greater
interest
in
sustainable
green
buildings
since
the
last
few
years
.
Although
,
the
primary
benefits
that
were
obtained
from
sustainable
development
have
been
defined
in
several
manners
,
their
financial
impacts
are
alike
,
including
sustainable
VC
and
premium
profits
.
Value
management
aims
to
achieve
the
desired
value
with
lower
prices
without
compromising
the
quality
and
function
of
the
building
.
Experience
of
several
organization
revealed
that
implementing
green
building
initiatives
by
simply
evaluating
the
existing
processes
efficiency
reduced
wastes
,
improved
drives
,
and
saved
money
.
Lützkendorf
and
Lorenz
identified
several
direct
and
indirect
benefits
for
investors
and
other
stakeholders
,
of
applying
value
creation
assessment
for
green
buildings
,
such
as
:
(
i
)
drastic
reduction
in
the
operational
cost
and
an
increase
in
marketability
,
(
ii
)
increase
in
useful
life-spans
,
(
iii
)
more
stable
cash
flows
,
(
iv
)
reduced
exposure
to
increasingly
stringent
environmental
legislation
,
and
(
v
)
significantly
increased
occupant
productivity
and
well-being
.
Presently
,
the
building
sector
in
Saudi
Arabia
is
also
aiming
to
attain
the
advantages
like
the
developed
countries
that
have
already
benefited
from
the
use
of
green
buildings
.
Therefore
,
there
is
a
need
to
set
up
a
framework
for
improving
the
creation
of
value
during
the
building
development
stage
in
Saudi
Arabia
by
integrating
value
with
project
management
.
</p>
<p>
It
has
been
widely
recognized
that
all
of
the
projects
have
opportunities
for
improved
VC
.
The
primary
aim
of
value
engineering
is
to
deliver
quantifiable
improvements
in
the
value
by
reducing
the
cost
,
getting
better
quality
,
and
improving
the
design
features
of
the
building
for
the
customer
.
It
is
a
systematic
process
to
gather
a
team
of
multidisciplinary
professionals
with
experience
in
the
construction
industry
to
perform
functional
analysis
of
a
system
for
providing
the
best
value
to
the
owner
.
</p>
<p>
Improving
the
VC
in
a
green
building
development
project
by
improving
the
function
longevity
and
operation
and
maintenance
costs
enhances
the
performance
reliability
,
quality
,
safety
,
life-cycle
cost
,
and
brings
additional
revenue
to
the
building
owner
.
Kelly
and
Duerk
suggested
that
the
client
’s
value
system
,
comprising
of
seven
elements
:
time
,
capital
expenditure
cost
(
CAPEX
)
,
operating
expenditure
cost
(
OPEX
)
,
environment
,
exchange
,
esteem
,
and
fitness
of
purpose
,
should
be
considered
in
the
construction
project
.
They
go
on
to
suggest
that
measuring
and
optimising
an
asset
’s
performance
involves
economic
performance
(
to
obtain
value
for
money
)
,
functional
performance
(
to
be
fit
for
purpose
such
as
appropriate
in
size
and
form
)
,
physical
performance
(
concerns
about
the
efficiency
of
the
asset
’s
operation
and
maintenance
)
,
and
service
performance
(
to
achieve
a
satisfactory
working
environment
for
the
occupants
and
satisfaction
regarding
quality
from
the
client
’s
perspective
)
.
Arena
believed
that
VC
drives
improving
a
company
’s
performance
.
The
nonfinancial
performance
indicators
—
which
are
time
(
to
deliver
,
to
develop
,
to
market
)
,
quality
,
flexibility
(
respond
to
change
,
expansion
)
,
productivity
,
environment
and
sustainability
,
plus
social
responsibility
—
guide
a
company
in
predicting
the
VC
and
measure
both
revenue
drivers
and
cost
drivers
.
Identifying
the
performance
variables
in
value
management
is
necessary
for
appraising
the
client
about
the
project
value
creation
.
</p>
<p>
The
Construction
Industry
Council
(
United
Kingdom
)
has
produced
design
quality
indicators
to
evaluate
and
measure
the
design
quality
and
the
value
obtained
,
including
functionality
,
build
quality
,
and
impact
within
the
project
context
of
finance
,
time
,
and
environment
resources
(
natural
and
human
)
.
Kelly
described
the
performance
variables
for
a
client
’s
VC
system
as
nine
non-correlated
performance
variables
,
which
are
:
CAPEX
,
OPEX
,
time
,
esteem
,
environment
,
exchange
,
politics/community
,
and
the
use
value
,
which
is
composed
of
flexibility
and
comfort
.
</p>
<p>
The
tangible
value
of
the
initiatives
is
hard
to
assess
in
green
buildings
,
but
improved
productivity
is
certainly
a
valuable
factor
.
Even
a
minor
improvement
in
productivity
leading
to
the
corresponding
increase
in
firm
value
would
make
more
green
building
initiatives
worth
the
investment
.
Although
several
tools
have
been
developed
to
assess
the
environmental
performance
of
a
green
building
,
disconnect
between
the
design
community
and
the
investment
community
still
exists
on
the
tangibility
of
VC
over
the
short
,
medium
,
or
long-term
.
Conducting
value
analysis
can
identify
project
development
contextual
issues
and
thus
provide
opportunities
for
optimising
the
design
and
operation
of
the
green
building
asset
during
early
stages
of
the
development
.
