‘
Well
,
Annie
,
I
have
bad
news
for
you
,
’
said
Mr
Ridgway
,
as
he
entered
the
comfortable
dining-room
of
his
cabin
in
the
Bush
.
‘
Sam
Redfern
the
Bushranger
is
about
this
part
of
the
Bush
just
now
.
I
hope
he
will
not
attack
us
with
his
gang
.
’
</p>
<p>
‘
I
hope
not
,
’
responded
Annie
,
a
gentle
maiden
of
some
sixteen
summers
.
</p>
<p>
Just
then
came
a
knock
at
the
door
of
the
hut
,
and
a
gruff
voice
asked
them
to
open
the
door
.
</p>
<p>
‘
It
is
Sam
Redfern
the
Bushranger
,
father
,
’
said
the
girl
.
</p>
<p>
‘
The
same
,
’
responded
the
voice
,
and
the
next
moment
the
hall
door
was
smashed
in
,
and
Sam
Redfern
sprang
in
,
followed
by
his
gang
.

CHAPTER
II
</head>
<p>
Annie
’s
Father
was
at
once
overpowered
,
and
Annie
herself
lay
bound
with
cords
on
the
drawing-room
sofa
.
Sam
Redfern
set
a
guard
round
the
lonely
hut
,
and
all
human
aid
was
despaired
of
.
But
you
never
know
.
Far
away
in
the
Bush
a
different
scene
was
being
enacted
.
</p>
<p>
‘
Must
be
Injuns
,
’
said
a
tall
man
to
himself
as
he
pushed
his
way
through
the
brushwood
.
It
was
Jim
Carlton
,
the
celebrated
detective
.
‘
I
know
them
,
’
he
added
;
‘
they
are
Apaches
.
’
just
then
ten
Indians
in
full
war-paint
appeared
.
Carlton
raised
his
rifle
and
fired
,
and
slinging
their
scalps
on
his
arm
he
hastened
towards
the
humble
log
hut
where
resided
his
affianced
bride
,
Annie
Ridgway
,
sometimes
known
as
the
Flower
of
the
Bush
.

CHAPTER
III
</head>
<p>
The
moon
was
low
on
the
horizon
,
and
Sam
Redfern
was
seated
at
a
drinking
bout
with
some
of
his
boon
companions
.
</p>
<p>
They
had
rifled
the
cellars
of
the
hut
,
and
the
rich
wines
flowed
like
water
in
the
golden
goblets
of
Mr
Ridgway
.
</p>
<p>
But
Annie
had
made
friends
with
one
of
the
gang
,
a
noble
,
good-hearted
man
who
had
joined
Sam
Redfern
by
mistake
,
and
she
had
told
him
to
go
and
get
the
police
as
quickly
as
possible
.
</p>
<p>
‘
Ha
!
ha
!
’
cried
Redfern
,
‘
now
I
am
enjoying
myself
!
’
He
little
knew
that
his
doom
was
near
upon
him
.
</p>
<p>
Just
then
Annie
gave
a
piercing
scream
,
and
Sam
Redfern
got
up
,
seizing
his
revolver
.
‘
Who
are
you
?
’
he
cried
,
as
a
man
entered
.
</p>
<p>
‘
I
am
Jim
Carlton
,
the
celebrated
detective
,
’
said
the
new
arrival
.
</p>
<p>
Sam
Redfern
’s
revolver
dropped
from
his
nerveless
fingers
,
but
the
next
moment
he
had
sprung
upon
the
detective
with
the
well-known
activity
of
the
mountain
sheep
,
and
Annie
shrieked
,
for
she
had
grown
to
love
the
rough
Bushranger
.

A
new
slate
is
horrid
till
it
is
washed
in
milk
.
I
like
the
green
spots
on
them
to
draw
patterns
round
.
I
know
a
good
way
to
make
a
slate-pencil
squeak
,
but
I
wo
n’t
put
it
in
because
I
do
n’t
want
to
make
it
common

Peppermint
is
a
great
help
with
arithmetic
.
The
boy
who
was
second
in
the
Oxford
Local
always
did
it
.
He
gave
me
two
.
The
examiner
said
to
him
,
‘
Are
you
eating
peppermints
?
’
And
he
said
,
‘
No
,
Sir
.
’
</p>
<p>
He
told
me
afterwards
it
was
quite
true
,
because
he
was
only
sucking
one
.
I
’m
glad
I
was
n’t
asked
.
I
should
never
have
thought
of
that
,
and
I
could
have
had
to
say
‘
Yes
.

THE
WRECK
OF
THE
‘
MALABAR
’
</p>
<head>
By
Noel
</head>
<p>
(
Author
of
‘
A
Dream
of
Ancient
Ancestors
.
’
)
He
is
n’t
really
--
but
he
put
it
in
to
make
it
seem
more
real
.
</p>
<p>
Hark
!
what
is
that
noise
of
rolling
Waves
and
thunder
in
the
air
?
‘
Tis
the
death-knell
of
the
sailors
And
officers
and
passengers
of
the
good
ship
Malabar
.
</p>
<p>
It
was
a
fair
and
lovely
noon
When
the
good
ship
put
out
of
port
And
people
said
‘
ah
little
we
think
How
soon
she
will
be
the
elements
’
sport
.
’
</p>
<p>
She
was
indeed
a
lovely
sight
Upon
the
billows
with
sails
spread
.
But
the
captain
folded
his
gloomy
arms
,
Ah
--
if
she
had
been
a
life-boat
instead
!
</p>
<p>
See
the
captain
stern
yet
gloomy
Flings
his
son
upon
a
rock
,
Hoping
that
there
his
darling
boy
May
escape
the
wreck
.
</p>
<p>
Alas
in
vain
the
loud
winds
roared
And
nobody
was
saved
.
That
was
the
wreck
of
the
Malabar
,
Then
let
us
toll
for
the
brave
.

GARDENING
NOTES
</head>
<p>
It
is
useless
to
plant
cherry-stones
in
the
hope
of
eating
the
fruit
,
because
they
do
n’t
!
</p>
<p>
Alice
wo
n’t
lend
her
gardening
tools
again
,
because
the
last
time
Noel
left
them
out
in
the
rain
,
and
I
do
n’t
like
it
.
He
said
he
did
n’t
.
</p>

SEEDS
AND
BULBS
</head>
<p>
These
are
useful
to
play
at
shop
with
,
until
you
are
ready
.
Not
at
dinner-parties
,
for
they
will
not
grow
unless
uncooked
.
Potatoes
are
not
grown
with
seed
,
but
with
chopped-up
potatoes
.
Apple
trees
are
grown
from
twigs
,
which
is
less
wasteful
.
</p>
<p>
Oak
trees
come
from
acorns
.
Every
one
knows
this
.
When
Noel
says
he
could
grow
one
from
a
peach
stone
wrapped
up
in
oak
leaves
,
he
shows
that
he
knows
nothing
about
gardening
but
marigolds
,
and
when
I
passed
by
his
garden
I
thought
they
seemed
just
like
weeds
now
the
flowers
have
been
picked
.
</p>
<p>
A
boy
once
dared
me
to
eat
a
bulb
.
</p>
<p>
Dogs
are
very
industrious
and
fond
of
gardening
.
Pincher
is
always
planting
bones
,
but
they
never
grow
up
.
There
could
n’t
be
a
bone
tree
.
I
think
this
is
what
makes
him
bark
so
unhappily
at
night
.
He
has
never
tried
planting
dog-biscuit
,
but
he
is
fonder
of
bones
,
and
perhaps
he
wants
to
be
quite
sure
about
them
first
.
