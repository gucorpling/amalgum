As
the
sliding
volumes
will
be
used
later
to
explain
the
differences
of
the
two
approaches
,
a
procedure
called
the
radiating
scan
method
is
proposed
and
briefly
introduced
here
.
To
quantify
the
failure
volume
,
an
estimation
of
slip
area
(
<hi rend="italic">
A
</hi>
)
has
to
be
made
for
the
problem
.
This
is
done
by
locating
the
rupture
surface
first
,
then
smoothing
this
surface
and
at
last
,
finding
the
arc
length
(
)
and
<hi rend="italic">
A
</hi>
by
integration
.
</p>
<p>
The
technique
used
in
has
been
adopted
to
define
the
rupture
surface
based
on
the
shear
strain
invariant
,
(
3
)
in
which
,
and
are
the
normal
strains
in
the
<hi rend="italic">
x
</hi>
and
<hi rend="italic">
y
</hi>
directions
and
shear
strain
,
respectively
.
</p>
<p>
First
,
the
maximum
shear
strain
invariant
was
found
along
the
line
just
below
the
toe
and
the
line
just
below
the
slope
face
.
Next
,
an
imaginary
point
in
space
,
above
the
centre
of
the
slope
face
,
was
chosen
.
Then
,
a
series
of
lines
radiating
out
from
this
point
(
across
the
slope
mesh
,
clockwise
)
was
considered
(
the
first
radiating
line
is
the
line
connecting
the
point
located
in
the
first
step
and
the
imaginary
point
)
.
The
maximum
value
of
shear
strain
invariant
along
each
line
(
i.
e.
,
clockwise
)
was
detected
and
,
by
connecting
the
locus
of
maxima
from
all
the
lines
,
the
rupture
surface
was
defined
.
This
is
shown
in
<figure>
Figure
5
</figure>
schematically
.
Note
that
the
shear
strain
invariant
within
an
element
is
interpolated
using
the
shape
functions
.
</p>
<p>
However
,
no
precise
information
about
the
length
of
the
rupture
surface
is
available
by
adopting
the
above-mentioned
Radiation
Scan
method
only
.
A
procedure
is
implemented
to
smooth
the
curve
by
polynomial
curve
fitting
;
that
is
,
by
finding
the
coefficients
of
a
polynomial
of
degree
<hi rend="italic">
n
</hi>
that
fits
the
data
,
to
,
in
a
least
squares
sense
,
(
)
are
the
coordinate
pair
defining
the
rupture
surface
)
.
By
doing
so
,
the
rippled
curve
shown
in
<figure>
Figure
6
</figure>
is
smoothed
to
the
curve
shown
in
red
.
Next
,
the
arc
length
is
found
by
numerically
integrating
between
0.5
and
10
:
(

)
</p>
<p>
<figure>
Figure
6
</figure>
shows
that
the
slip
area
is
found
by
computing
the
integral
of
<hi rend="italic">
p
</hi>
with
respect
to
<hi rend="italic">
x
</hi>
,
using
repeated
trapezium
integration
and
then
subtracting
the
area
of
the
triangle
above
the
slope
face
.
For
the
present
slope
geometry
and
failure
mechanism
,
the
integrated
length
of
the
rupture
surface
is
m
and
the
slip
area
is
m2
.
