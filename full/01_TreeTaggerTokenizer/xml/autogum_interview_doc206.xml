Jada
:
</hi>
Just
random
people
who
have
certain
things
happen
in
their
life
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
Like
what
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Jada
:
</hi>
Anything
really
.
Like
a
trauma
from
school
or
problems
with
a
family
member
.
Things
like
that
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
How
would
you
treat
that
person
differently
than
someone
who
is
coming
here
for
the
pleasure
or
the
thrill
of
it
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Jada
:
</hi>
I
would
be
more
aware
and
pay
more
attention
to
where
the
session
is
taking
them
.
You
really
need
to
be
fully
aware
of
everything
that
is
going
on
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
What
would
be
a
point
where
you
did
n’t
feel
comfortable
with
the
session
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Jada
:
</hi>
His
reaction
,
if
I
see
he
is
starting
to
fall
deeper
and
deeper
into
depression
,
whereas
sometimes
that
has
happened
in
sessions
.
Sometimes
a
guy
will
cry
during
the
session
,
or
sob
uncontrollably
.
Sometimes
he
will
get
angry
and
start
screaming
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
In
both
of
those
situations
,
how
would
you
handle
it
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Jada
:
</hi>
You
start
to
console
them
.
That
’s
when
you
know
you
are
no
longer
in
that
session
,
that
It
is
no
longer
a
role
play
.
That
is
where
the
psychological
really
comes
into
it
,
when
the
psychology
helps
,
to
be
there
and
to
listen
.
Sometimes
they
are
like
,
“
I
killed
my
pet
dog
by
accident
and
I
’ve
kept
this
inside
for
me
for
so
long
!
”
Or
,
“
I
had
a
close
family
member
just
pass
away
and
I
do
n’t
know
how
to
deal
with
that
right
now
.
”
“
My
girlfriend
just
left
me
—
“
I
mean
,
you
hear
all
these
stories
!
One
after
the
other
after
the
other
,
and
it
’s
just
like
,
“
Wow
!
”
If
one
is
crying
,
you
console
them
;
if
one
is
angry
you
try
to
calm
them
down
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
Do
you
give
them
absolution
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Jada
:
</hi>
Yeah
,
“
It
was
n’t
your
fault
what
happened
.
You
were
five
years
old
,
how
would
you
know
what
this
would
do
to
the
dog
,
you
know
?
”
A
lot
of
cases
you
have
to
help
them
out
with
it
and
at
the
end
of
the
session
they
just
feel
so
much
better
about
themselves
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
What
do
you
do
when
someone
gets
angry
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Jada
:
</hi>
Usually
just
try
to
bring
them
down
and
find
out
about
what
it
is
that
gets
them
so
angry
.
A
lot
of
times
they
are
not
going
to
come
out
and
say
,
“
This
is
what
is
bothering
me
.
”
They
are
going
to
veil
it
so
much
that
you
are
trying
to
knock
down
so
many
walls
they
put
up
,
and
finally
it
can
be
one
word
,
one
comment
,
a
simple
thing
that
you
might
say
that
might
trigger
something
,
and
then
you
realize
what
happened
.
A
lot
of
times
you
try
to
keep
it
within
the
role
play
,
as
well
,
which
is
what
really
makes
the
session
great
,
but
you
just
calm
them
down
.
