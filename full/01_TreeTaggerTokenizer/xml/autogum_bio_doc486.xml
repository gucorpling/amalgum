Connections
between
the
Medici
and
Bavarian
courts
were
close
through
the
period
,
and
composers
often
passed
between
them
.
Nothing

Music
</head>
<p>
All
of
his
surviving
music
is
vocal
,
and
includes
madrigals
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motet">
motets
</ref>
,
some
of
which
were
probably
intended
for
performance
as

,
</hi>
musical
interludes
between
acts
of
plays
.
</p>
<p>
Along
with
the
other
Medici
composers
,
taking
part
in
a
trend
of
the
time
,
he
wrote
gigantic
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polychoral">
polychoral
</ref>
compositions
.
One
of
the
largest
polychoral
works
ever
composed
,
at
least
prior
to
modern
times
,
was
his
huge
50-voice
motet
<hi rend="italic">
Consolamini
popule
meus
</hi>
.
The
date
of
the
composition
is
unknown
,
but
the
manuscript
is
at
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayerische_Staatsbibliothek">
Bayerische
Staatsbibliothek
</ref>
in
Munich
,
suggesting
he
wrote
it
while
in
the
service
of
the
Bavarian
court
.
Only
a
handful
of
larger
compositions
are
known
:
Alessandro
Striggio
's
colossal
40
and
60
voice

Rossetto
also
composed
three
books
of
madrigals
,
for
four
,
five
,
and
six
voices
,
respectively
(
all
published
in
Venice
in
1560
and
1566
)
,
and
an
ambitious
setting
of
the
<hi rend="italic">
Lamento
d'Olimpia
</hi>
,
in
seventeen
parts
,
for
from
four
to
ten
voices
,
which
he
published
in
Venice
in
1567
.
(
Florence
,
for
all
its
opulence
,
lacked
publishing
houses
,
and
most
of
the
Medici
composers
published
their
works
in
Venice
,
a
city
with
a
long
publishing
history
.
)
In
addition
to
his
secular
music
,
he
published
a
book
of
motets
in
Nuremberg
in
1573
,
<hi rend="italic">
Novae
quaedam
sacrae
cantiones
,
quas
vulgo
motetas
vocant
</hi>
,
for
five
and
six
voices
.

<p>
In
his
madrigals
he
uses
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromaticism">
chromaticism
</ref>
creatively
,
and
he
liked
to
write
both
madrigals
and
motets
in
groups
,
as
did
the
other
Medici
composers
(
such
as
Corteccia
and
Striggio
)
.
Much
of
his
music
is
intended
to
be
accompanied
by
instruments
,
another
characteristic
of
Florentine
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphony">
polyphony

of
