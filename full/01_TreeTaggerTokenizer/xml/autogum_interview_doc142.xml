There
's
a
lot
of
talk
about
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Kim_Jong-un">
Kim
Jong-un
</ref>
being
an
inexperienced
leader
—
do
you
think
he
knows
where
the
'
brink
'
lies
?

That
's
actually
a
really
good
question
.
No
,
I
do
n't
,
which
is
why
we
're
having
this
whole
conversation
.
Kim
's
father
,
Kim
the
second
[
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Kim_Jong-il">
Kim
Jong-il
</ref>
]
,
was
actually
very
good
about
this
,
&quot;
good
&quot;
in
quotations
I
suppose
.
He
knew
really
well
how
to
play
this
game
,
he
knew
really
well
how
to
play
the
South
,
particularly
for
aid
,
rice
,
assistance
,
fuel
,
things
like
that
.
The
new
guy
—
he
's
only
been
in
there
for
a
year-and-a-half
,
right
,
14
,
15
months
—
he
did
n't
go
through
the
grooming
institutions
of
the
regime
,
he
did
n't
go
through
the
military
or
the
party
.
And
he
certainly
has
no
military
training
,
it
's
not
like
he
went
to
some
military
institute
—
he
went
to
some
boarding
school
in
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Switzerland">
Switzerland
</ref>
,
or
something
like
that
.
So
it
's
not
at
all
clear
that
this
guy
knows
,
sort
of
how
this
is
done
.
I
have
a
feeling
myself
that
he
's
being
egged
on
by
the
generals
at
home
,
and
the
generals
are
really
doing
this
because
they
do
not
want
the
military
's
position
to
be
lowered
in
the
new
order
.
Under
the
previous
Kim
,
under
the
second
Kim
[
Kim-Jong-il
]
,
the
military
was
raised
in
the
constitution
to
a
very
high
level
of
importance
,
they
were
sort
of
the
primary
pillar
of
the
government
,
this
is
called
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songun">
'
Military
First
'
</ref>
policy
.
I
think
people
now
worry
that
the
new
Kim
—
in
order
to
re-start
the
economy
might
downgrade
the
role
of
the
military
,
and
I
think
that
is
where
all
this
is
coming
from
.
I
do
n't
think
they
want
a
war
.

All
of
these
threats
,
do
you
think
they
are
just
a
way
of
getting
more
economic
aid
from
the
United
Nations
?

<hi rend="bold">

</hi>
:
I
would
n't
say
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_Nations">
United
Nations
</ref>
[
UN
]
because
the
UN
role
in
this
is
actually
pretty
minimal
.
It
is
true
that
there
are
some
UN
specialized
agencies
that
operate
in
North
Korea
—
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World%20Food%20Programme">
World
Food
Programme
</ref>
I
believe
is
the
big
one
because
North
Korea
constantly
has
food
problems
—
and
there
are
western
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental%20organization">
NGOs
</ref>
,
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aid">
aid
groups
</ref>
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charities">
charities
</ref>
and
stuff
like
that
,
also
operate
in
North
Korea
.
I
've
actually
been
to
North
Korea
and
I
've
seen
these
charities
operate
.
I
've
actually
met
some
of
the
people
who
actually
live
there
and
do
this
stuff
.
But
they
're
actually
pretty
small
,
right
?
I
mean
,
the
North
Koreans
are
pretty
worried
about
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westerners">
Westerners
</ref>
running
around
in
North
Korea
making
trouble
and
saying
things
and
this
and
that
.
Any
kind
of
foreign
penetration
in
North
Korea
is
very
,
very
limited
.
I
think
the
real
issue
is
actually
North
Korea
's
neighbors
,
specifically
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Japan">
Japan
</ref>
,
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/China">
China
</ref>
,
the
United
States
and
South
Korea
.
Russia
's
really
sort
of
a
<ref target="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bit%20player">
bit
player
</ref>
in
this
drama
.
And
that
's
what
they
really
want
,
the
North
Koreans
now
are
very
dependent
on
<hi rend="italic">
only
</hi>
the
Chinese
.
They
used
to
be
able
to
play
the
Chinese
off
the
South
Koreans
off
the
Japanese
off
the
Americans
and
extract
aid
and
concessions
from
each
of
those
.
In
the
last
ten
years
or
so
it
has
become
harder
to
do
that
—
particularly
Japan
,
the
United
States
and
South
Korea
have
closed
ranks
and
do
n't
really
deal
individually
with
North
Korea
anymore
.
This
has
pushed
North
Korea
to
China
.
North
Korea
does
n't
like
being
dependent
on
just
one
player
.
And
so
I
think
that
's
what
this
is
an
effort
to
shake
up
,
[
...
]
a
very
difficult
game
for
the
North
were
they
an
economic
colony
of
China
.
