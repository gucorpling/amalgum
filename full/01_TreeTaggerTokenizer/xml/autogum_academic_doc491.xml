Introduction
</head>
<p>
The
rapid
development
of
large-scale
pharmaceutical
manufacturing
has
contributed
to
increased
concentrations
of
contaminants
present
in
wastewater
and
surface
waters
.
Pharmaceutical
wastewaters
are
produced
during
the
drug
manufacturing
processes
(
i.
e.
,
fermentation
,
extraction
,
chemical
synthesis
,
formulation
,
packaging
and
washing
of
solid
cake
and
equipment
)
.
Hence
,
the
main
pollution
source
of
these
pharmaceutical
compounds
in
the
environment
is
through
industrial
process
water
discharge
.
Several
studies
have
shown
that
pharmaceutical
drugs
(
and
their
derived
metabolites
)
are
found
in
effluents
of
wastewater
treatment
plants
(
WWTPs
)
and
their
removal
is
very
inefficient
.
Wastewater
originating
during
the
manufacturing
of
antidiabetic
drugs
is
also
an
important
environmental
challenge
due
to
the
high
production
volume
.
Several
research
papers
have
reported
the
occurrence
,
degradability
,
and
environmental
impact
of
antidiabetic
drugs
in
wastewater
,
and
substantial
efforts
to
achieve
environmental
improvements
in
line
with
regulations
and
legislation
have
been
implemented
.
</p>
<p>
Metformin
(
C4H11N5
)
is
one
of
the
most
prescribed
and
widely
used
antidiabetic
drugs
worldwide
,
since
a
significant
portion
of
the
population
suffers
from
diabetes
.
Recent
reports
have
indicated
that
there
are
also
high
concentrations
of
metformin
in
domestic
wastewater
treatment
plants
’
influent
.
This
is
because
it
is
excreted
un-metabolized
from
the
human
body
in
urine
and
ends
up
in
wastewater
and
aquatic
environments
.
Metformin
is
the
pharmaceutical
compound
with
the
highest
concentration
in
domestic
wastewater
(
i.
e.
,
64
–
98
µg/L
)
.
This
study
is
therefore
relevant
for
wastewater
treatment
in
general
,
even
though
it
is
focused
on
metformin-containing
industrial
wastewater
.
Pharmaceutical
wastewater
has
traditionally
been
treated
using
conventional
physico-chemical
and
biological
process
methods
.
Metformin
can
be
aerobically
degraded
to
guanylurea
(
C2H6N4O
)
—
a
metabolite
that
is
stable
against
further
biodegradation
in
wastewater
treatment
plants
.
However
,
it
appears
to
be
a
novel
idea
to
integrate
anaerobic
and
aerobic
processes
for
the
efficient
removal
of
metformin
and
other
pharmaceutical
constituents
.
</p>
<p>
The
basic
hypothesis
of
this
study
is
that
anaerobic
granular
sludge
and
aerobic
biofilms
supported
by
a
hybrid
vertical
anaerobic
biofilm
(
HyVAB®
)
reactor
design
(
<figure>
Figure
1
</figure>
)
are
the
most
robust
combined
niches
for
microorganisms
to
treat
inhibitory
substances
,
since
microbial
aggregates
protect
the
microorganisms
against
such
substances
as
they
are
delivered
slowly
by
diffusion
from
the
liquid
phase
.
The
more
sensitive
organisms
are
in
the
deeper
layers
protected
by
layers
of
organisms
embedded
in
an
extracellular
polymeric
matrix
.
Adaptation
to
toxic
chemicals
can
be
slow
and
can
go
through
the
stages
of
survival
,
tolerance
,
capture
,
and
—
if
at
all
biodegradable
—
the
final
adaptation
stage
is
degradation
.
The
process
can
even
remove
non-biodegradable
constituents
by
integration
in
the
extracellular
matrix
to
build
more
aggregates
.
</p>
<p>
HyVAB®
is
a
compact
reactor
that
integrates
both
anaerobic
and
aerobic
processes
.
Wastewater
is
introduced
at
the
bottom
anaerobic
digestion
(
AD
)
stage
,
where
organic
matter
is
degraded
and
converted
into
methane
.
The
remaining
unconsumed
organics
flow
up
for
further
treatment
in
the
aerobic
biofilm
stage
designed
as
a
Continuous
Flow
Intermittent
Cleaning
(
CFIC®
)
.
Plastic
bio-carriers
serve
as
a
biofilm
substratum
in
the
aerobic
biofilm
stage
,
protecting
the
biofilm
from
shear
force
.
Excess
aerobic
sludge
is
washed
off
during
the
intermittent
washing
process
(
i.
e.
,
CFIC®
)
.
Part
of
the
detached
aerobic
biofilm
settles
down
by
gravity
to
the
AD
stage
in
the
HyVAB®
,
where
it
is
degraded
simultaneously
with
the
feed
substrates
.
In
this
study
,
two
types
of
wastewater
—
wastewater
I
(
WWI
)
and
wastewater
II
(
WWII
)
—
were
fed
to
the
reactor
,
and
performance
was
evaluated
on
the
basis
of
metformin
reduction
,
chemical
oxygen
demand
(
COD
)
removal
efficiency
,
and
biogas
production
.
