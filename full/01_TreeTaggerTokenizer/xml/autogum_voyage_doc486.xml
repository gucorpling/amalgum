History
</head>
<p>
In
the
mid-17th
century
,
Fire
Island
was
used
as
a
base
for
whaling
.
Whalers
would
watch
for
spouting
whales
from
towers
,
then
launch
their
boats
after
them
.
The
island
also
has
a
bit
of
pirate
history
as
pirates
were
known
to
build
fires
on
the
island
to
attract
passing
boats
on
which
to
prey
.
</p>
<p>
The
Fire
Island
Lighthouse
was
first
built
in
1826
at
a
height
of
due
to
the
large
number
of
shipwrecks
.
In
1868
,
a
new
lighthouse
was
built
to
a
height
of
168
feet
,
100
feet
from
the
old
.
The
foundation
of
the
original
lighthouse
can
still
be
seen
today
.
For
many
immigrants
the
lighthouse
was
their
first
sight
of
land
when
arriving
to
America
.
In
less
than
a
century
four
miles
of
sand
accumulated
between
the
lighthouse
and
the
western
tip
of
the
island
.
The
island
still
grows
at
its
western
end
and
is
constantly
reshaped
.
</p>
<p>
The
state
set
aside
part
of
Fire
Island
as
a
state
park
in
1908
,
making
it
the
first
state
park
on
Long
Island
.
In
the
1920s
Fire
Island
began
its
life
as
a
Bohemian
beach
community
.
By
the
1950s
real
estate
was
booming
as
the
island
became
a
fashionable
retreat
from
the
city
.
In
1964
the
rest
of
the
lands
were
designated
the
Fire
Island
National
Seashore
.
In
1980
Congress
set
aside
as
the
Otis
Pike
Wilderness
area
.
</p>
<head>
Landscape
</head>
<p>
All
barrier
islands
are
shaped
to
some
degree
by
the
ocean
,
and
that
certainly
applies
to
Fire
Island
.
The
Sunken
Forest
area
is
the
result
of
high
dunes
built
up
on
both
sides
of
the
trees
which
protect
them
and
allow
their
protected
growth
.
Swamp
species
such
as
red
maple
and
sour
gum
are
then
able
to
thrive
there
.
On
the
west
end
of
the
island
new
land
has
formed
at
the
rate
of
50
meters
a
year
.
In
some
areas
dunes
are
whipped
into
low
cliffs
in
one
season
and
the
cliffs
later
dissolved
to
sloping
beach
.

Flora
and
fauna
</head>
<p>
From
the
unassuming
insectivorous
sundews
lurking
in
swales
to
the
tops
of
the
wind-pruned
trees
in
the
Sunken
Forest
,
Fire
Island
is
a
varied
and
most
interesting
barrier
beach
ecosystem
.
This
makes
taking
in
a
ranger-led
interpretive
program
or
tour
a
must
.
The
Sunken
Forest
area
in
particular
is
a
somewhat
unusual
barrier
island
situation
with
several
bogs
,
complete
with
sphagnum
,
ferns
,
mosses
,
cattails
,
rushes
and
other
wetland
species
.
</p>
<p>
The
island
is
also
a
wonderful
birdwatching
(
and
listening
!
)
venue
.
Catbirds
and
eastern
towhees
keep
the
music
playing
and
yellow
warblers
and
yellow
bellied
sapsuckers
keep
it
colorful
.
Fire
Island
is
a
popular
rest
stop
for
migratory
birds
with
over
300
species
have
been
recorded
here
--
over
one-third
of
the
birds
in
North
America
.
</p>
<p>
There
is
a
full
array
of
beach
dwellers
as
well
and
fishing
is
excellent
,
particularly
in
Great
South
Bay
.
