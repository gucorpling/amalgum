CHAPTER
XIV
</head>
<p>
As
I
drove
into
the
yard
,
a
bare-headed
old
nigger
with
a
game
leg
throwed
down
an
armful
of
wood
he
was
gathering
and
went
limping
up
to
the
veranda
as
fast
as
he
could
.
He
opened
the
door
and
bawled
out
,
pointing
to
us
,
before
he
had
it
fairly
open
:
</p>
<p>
&quot;
O
Marse
WILLyum
!
O
Miss
LUCY
!
Dey
've
brung
him
home
!
DAR
he
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
A
little
,
bright
,
black-eyed
old
lady
like
a
wren
comes
running
out
of
the
house
,
and
chirps
:
</p>
<p>
&quot;
O
Bud
--
O
my
honey
boy
!
Is
he
dead
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
reckon
not
,
Miss
Lucy
,
&quot;
says
Bud
raising
himself
up
on
the
mattress
as
she
runs
up
to
the
wagon
,
and
trying
to
act
like
everything
was
all
a
joke
.
She
was
jest
high
enough
to
kiss
him
over
the
edge
of
the
wagon
box
.
A
worried-looking
old
gentleman
come
out
the
door
,
seen
Bud
and
his
mother
kissing
each
other
,
and
then
says
to
the
old
nigger
man
:
</p>
<p>
&quot;
George
,
yo
'
old
fool
,
what
do
yo
'
mean
by
shouting
out
like
that
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Marse
Willyum
--
&quot;
begins
George
,
explaining
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Shut
up
,
&quot;
says
the
old
gentleman
,
very
quiet
.
&quot;
Take
the
bay
mare
and
go
for
Doctor
Po'ter
.
&quot;
Then
he
comes
to
the
wagon
and
says
:
</p>
<p>
&quot;
So
they
got
yo
'
,
Bud
?
Yo
'
WOULD
go
nightriding
like
a
rowdy
and
a
thug
!
Are
yo
'
much
hurt
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
He
said
it
easy
and
gentle
,
more
than
mad
.
But
Bud
,
he
flushed
up
,
pale
as
he
was
,
and
did
n't
answer
his
dad
direct
.
He
turned
to
his
mother
and
said
:
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Miss
Lucy
,
dear
,
it
would
'
a
'
done
yo
'
heart
good
to
see
the
way
them
trust
warehouses
blazed
up
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
And
the
old
lady
,
smiling
and
crying
both
to
oncet
,
says
,
&quot;
God
bless
her
brave
boy
.
&quot;
But
the
old
gentleman
looked
mighty
serious
,
and
his
worry
settled
into
a
frown
between
his
eyes
,
and
he
turns
to
me
and
says
:
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Yo
'
must
pardon
us
,
sir
,
fo
'
neglecting
to
thank
yo
'
sooner
.
&quot;
I
told
him
that
would
be
all
right
,
fur
him
not
to
worry
none
.
And
him
and
me
and
Mandy
,
which
was
the
nigger
cook
,
got
Bud
into
the
house
and
into
his
bed
.
And
his
mother
gets
that
busy
ordering
Mandy
and
the
old
gentleman
around
,
to
get
things
and
fix
things
,
and
make
Bud
as
easy
as
she
could
,
that
you
could
see
she
was
one
of
them
kind
of
woman
that
gets
a
lot
of
satisfaction
out
of
having
some
one
sick
to
fuss
over
.
And
after
quite
a
while
George
gets
back
with
Doctor
Porter
.
</p>
<p>
He
sets
Bud
's
arm
,
and
he
locates
the
bullet
in
him
,
and
he
says
he
guesses
he
'll
do
in
a
few
weeks
if
nothing
like
blood
poisoning
nor
gangrene
nor
inflammation
sets
in
.
</p>
<p>
Only
the
doctor
says
he
&quot;
reckons
&quot;
instead
of
he
&quot;
guesses
,
&quot;
which
they
all
do
down
there
.
And
they
all
had
them
easy-going
,
wait-a-bit
kind
of
voices
,
and
did
n't
see
no
pertic'ler
importance
in
their
&quot;
r
's
.
&quot;
It
was
n't
that
you
could
spell
it
no
different
when
they
talked
,
but
it
sounded
different
.
</p>
<p>
I
eat
my
breakfast
with
the
old
gentleman
,
and
then
I
took
a
sleep
until
time
fur
dinner
.
They
would
n't
hear
of
me
leaving
that
night
.
I
fully
intended
to
go
on
the
next
day
,
but
before
I
knowed
it
I
been
there
a
couple
of
days
,
and
have
got
very
well
acquainted
with
that
fambly
.
</p>
<p>
Well
,
that
was
a
house
divided
agin
itself
.
Miss
Lucy
,
she
is
awful
favourable
to
all
this
nightrider
business
.
She
spunks
up
and
her
eyes
sparkles
whenever
she
thinks
about
that
there
tobaccer
trust
.
</p>
<p>
She
would
of
like
to
been
a
night-rider
herself
.
But
the
old
man
,
he
says
law
and
order
is
the
main
pint
.
What
the
country
needs
,
he
says
,
ai
n't
burning
down
tobaccer
warehouses
,
and
shooting
your
neighbours
,
and
licking
them
with
switches
,
fur
no
wrong
done
never
righted
another
wrong
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
But
you
were
in
the
Ku
Klux
Klan
yo'self
,
&quot;
says
Miss
Lucy
.
</p>
<p>
The
old
man
says
the
Ku
Kluxes
was
working
fur
a
principle
--
the
principle
of
keeping
the
white
supremacy
on
top
of
the
nigger
race
.
Fur
if
you
let
'
em
quit
work
and
go
around
balloting
and
voting
it
wo
n't
do
.
It
makes
'
em
biggity
.
And
a
biggity
nigger
is
laying
up
trouble
fur
himself
.
Because
sooner
or
later
he
will
get
to
thinking
he
is
as
good
as
one
of
these
here
Angle-Saxtons
you
are
always
hearing
so
much
talk
about
down
South
.
And
if
the
Angle-Saxtons
was
to
stand
fur
that
,
purty
soon
they
would
be
sociable
equality
.
And
next
the
hull
dern
country
would
be
niggerized
.
Them
there
Angle-Saxtons
,
that
come
over
from
Ireland
and
Scotland
and
France
and
the
Great
British
Islands
and
settled
up
the
South
jest
simply
could
n't
afford
to
let
that
happen
,
he
says
,
and
so
they
Ku
Kluxed
the
niggers
to
make
'
em
quit
voting
.
It
was
THEIR
job
to
MAKE
law
and
order
,
he
says
,
which
they
could
n't
be
with
niggers
getting
the
idea
they
had
a
right
to
govern
.
So
they
Ku
Kluxed
'
em
like
gentlemen
.
But
these
here
night-riders
,
he
says
,
is
AGIN
law
and
order
--
they
can
shoot
up
more
law
and
order
in
one
night
than
can
be
manufactured
agin
in
ten
years
.
He
was
a
very
quiet
,
peaceable
old
man
,
Mr.
Davis
was
,
and
Bud
says
he
was
so
dern
foolish
about
law
and
order
he
had
to
up
and
shoot
a
man
,
about
fifteen
years
ago
,
who
hearn
him
talking
that-a-way
and
said
he
reminded
him
of
a
Boston
school
teacher
.
