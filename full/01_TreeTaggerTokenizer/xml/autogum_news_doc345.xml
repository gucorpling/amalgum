After
published
reports
stated
suspected
plane
debris
washed
up
on
several
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Maldives">
Maldives
</ref>
islands
,
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Malaysia">
Malaysia
</ref>
has
stated
it
will
send
a
team
of
investigators
to
examine
it
.
Investigators
are
to
try
to
determine
if
the
debris
came
from
a
plane
before
taking
any
further
action
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
urge
all
parties
to
allow
for
the
verification
process
to
take
its
due
course
.
Once
it
is
determined
to
be
aircraft
debris
,
discussions
will
be
held
to
determine
next
steps
in
terms
of
the
process
of
analysis
.
Undue
speculation
will
only
stress
the
families
and
loved
ones
,
anxiously
awaiting
news
on
this
matter

An
investigation
into
the
debris
was
launched
after
an
photos
of
the
debris
were
uploaded
to
the
social
networking

on
,
reportedly
,
May
31
,
by
an
employee
of
a
beach
resort
.
Some
of
the
debris
is
reported
to
have
washed
ashore
as
early
as
May
31
and
was
found
on
a
beach
owned
by
the
Banyan
Tree
Vabbinfaru
resort
,
located
in

.
In
the
past
few
days
,
several
other
pieces
of
debris
were
recovered
on
at
least
three
other
islands
.
Authorities
are
trying
to
determine
if
it
may
be
part
of
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Malaysia_Airlines_Flight_370">
Malaysia

Flight
370

(

.

Last
week
,
a
piece
of
a
wing
known
as
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flaperon">

</ref>
was
found
washed
ashore
on
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Réunion">
Réunion
</ref>
Island
.
The
Malaysian
government
stated
it
's
from
MH370
,
but
according
to
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/China">
Chinese
</ref>
officials
,
the
piece
has
yet
to
be
confirmed
to
be
from
MH370
because
managers
were
on
leave
from
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Spain">
Spanish
</ref>
manufacturer
of
the
part
.
</p>
<p>
However
,
before
most
of
the
debris
could
be
examined
,
it
had
already
been
taken
away
for
disposal
.
The
photographs
showed
a
large
white
object
,
possibly
two
,
stained
with
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/algae">
algae
</ref>
and
appear
to
be
made
of
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fiberglass">
fiberglass
</ref>
and
honeycomb
material
.
The
objects
appear
to
be
several
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foot%20(unit)">
feet

in
length
and
width
and
in
one
photo
where
the
paint
is
severely
peeled
,
red
letters
&quot;
IC
&quot;
can
be
seen
.
Those
pieces
,
along
with
others
,
were
taken
away
and
disposed
of
as
trash
.
When
authorities
discovered
the
photographs
,
they
returned
to
the
site
,
but
only
found
a
small

to
seven

)
piece
of
debris
they
say
does
n't
appear
to
be
part
of
a
plane
.
</p>
<p>
Some
of
the
debris
may
not
be
from
a
plane
.
Abdulla
Rasheed
,
a
captain
of
a
cargo
boat
which
recently
capsized
in
the
waters
off
the
Maldives
,
stated
,
&quot;
From
the
pictures
of
the
debris
found
on
most
of
the
islands
,
I
can
almost
certainly
say
that
they
are
from
the
cargo
we
were
carrying
&quot;
.
Despite
this
possibility
,
any
debris
located
is
being
gathered
up
and
stored
in
a
warehouse
until
Malaysian
authorities
can
examine
it
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
We
are
collecting
any
unidentified
debris
and
storing
them
in
a
warehouse
so
that
the
Malaysians
can
carry
out
tests
and
determine
if
it
is
from
their
plane
or
not
,

MH370
,
while
flying
from

Kuala
Lumpur
</ref>
,
Malaysia
to
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Beijing">

,
China
,
vanished
without
a
trace
on
March
8
,
2014
.
All
239
passengers
and
crew
are
believed
to
be
dead
.
On
the
day
the
plane
went
missing
,
residents
on
the
small
Maldive
island
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kudahuvadhoo">
Kudahuvadhoo
</ref>
claimed
to
have
seen
a
very
&quot;
low
flying
jumbo
jet
&quot;
crash
into
the
Indian
Ocean
.
Some
also
noted
the
colors
appeared
to
resemble
that
of
a
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Malaysia_Airlines">
Malaysia
Airlines
</ref>
plane
.
&quot;
I
’ve
never
seen
a
jet
flying
so
low
over
our
island
before
.
We
've
seen
seaplanes
,
but
I
'm
sure
that
this
was
not
one
of
those
.
I
could
even
make
out
the
doors
on
the
plane
clearly
&quot;
,
one
resident
was
quoted
as
saying
to
the
newspaper
<hi rend="italic">
Haveeru
Daily
</hi>
.
Some
claim
the
plane
appeared
to
he
headed
in
the
direction
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego%20Garcia">
Diego
Garcia
</ref>
,
but
Malaysian
authorities
have
discounted
those
claims
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Based
on
the
monitoring
up
to
date
,
no
indication
of
Flight
MH370
has
been
observed
on
any
military
radars
in
the
country
[
Maldives
]
.
Furthermore
,
the
data
of
radars
at
Maldives
airports
have
also
been
analysed
and
shows
no
indication
of
the
said
flight
,
&quot;
said
Malaysia
's
transport
ministry
at
the
time
of
the
report
.
