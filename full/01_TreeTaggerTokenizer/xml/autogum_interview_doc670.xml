I
do
n't
have
an
opinion
on
Woodward
;
he
's
been
successful
.
I
mean
,
when
I
was
a
young
man
there
was
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James%20Reston">
James
Reston
</ref>
.
I
wrote
about
him
in
The
Kingdom
of
Power
a
lot
.
He
was
the
most
important
reporter
when
I
was
coming
up
in
the
1950
's
,
and
he
was
in
Washington
and
in
bed
with
the
enemy
all
the
time
.
He
had
sources
in
the
administration
of
Kennedy
,
of
Eisenhower
before
Kennedy
,
or
Johnson
.
He
was
a
guy
who
liked
power
and
liked
being
around
power
,
and
he
was
very
much
a
patriot
writer
.
He
was
very
popular
and
wrote
easy-to-read
pieces
.

When
I
was
in
my
teens
and
early
twenties
my
travels
were
very
Europe-centric
.
But
as
an
adult
I
have
been
drawn
to
places
either
seemingly
&quot;
dangerous
&quot;
to
me
or
places
that
I
do
n't
feel
like
I
know
because
I
've
read
so
much
about
them
or
seen
so
often
in
books
and
magazines
.
So
Europe
is
off
my
map
now
,
though
I
did
sneak
into

I
was
there
in

I
was
there
in

82
.
And
I
did
n't
sneak
in
,
but
I
had
to
get
a
visa
from
the
Czechoslovakian
Embassy
in
Washington
to
get
in
there
in
'
82
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald%20Reagan">
Reagan

was
in
power
then
and
he
did
n't
want
me
to
go
to
Cuba
.
I
went
.
My
wife
also
went
for
two
weeks
.
And
then
in
'
96
I
went
.
And
now
you
do
n't
have
the
dollar
.
What
do
you
have
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">

You
have
the
Cuban
pesos

Where
do
you
get
them

<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
I
'm
not
really
sure
now
because
when
I
was
there
they
had
the
system
where
you
could
actually
just
use
dollars
.
That
's
what
we
used
.
The
local
currency
was
called
<hi rend="italic">
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban%20convertible%20peso">
pesos
convertibles
</ref>
</hi>
that
were
convertible
into
dollars
.
Of
course
they
have
no
value
anywhere
else
in
the
world
except
in
Cuba
,
but
then
they
stopped
doing
that
.
Castro
has
kind
of
created
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulgencio%20Batista">
Batista
</ref>
'
s
society
in
some
ways
;
not
in
every
way
.
The
poor
are
certainly
a
lot
better
off
than
they
were
under
Batista
.
But
with
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban%20embargo">
embargo
</ref>
,
the
economy
is
now
very
tourist-based
,
which
creates
this
tourist
class
.
We
did
n't
stay
in
the
hotels
.
We
wanted
to
stay
in
what
they
call
<hi rend="italic">
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casa%20particular">

</hi>
and
I
remember
talking
to
a
woman
who
made
$
30
a
month
as
a
doctor
.
But
running
this
<hi rend="italic">
casa
particular
</hi>
,
she
was
making
around
$
300
,
$
500
a
month
,
which
made
her
very
rich
.
