Stardust
is
a
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/NASA">
NASA
</ref>
space
capsule
that
collected
samples
from
comet
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/81P/Wild">
81P/Wild
</ref>
(
also
known
as
&quot;
Wild
2
)
in
deep
space
and
landed
back
on
Earth
on
January
15
,
2006
.
It
was
decided
that
a
collaborative
online
review
process
would
be
used
to
&quot;
discover
&quot;
the
microscopically
small
samples
the
capsule
collected
.
The
project
is
called
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Stardust@home">
Stardust@home
</ref>
.
Unlike
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/distributed%20computing">
distributed
computing
</ref>
projects
like
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SETI@home">
SETI@home
</ref>
,
Stardust@home
relies
entirely
on
human
intelligence
.
</p>
<p>
Andrew
Westphal
is
the
director
of
Stardust@home
.
Wikinews
interviewed
him
for
May
's
Interview
of
the
Month
(
IOTM
)
on
May
18
,
2006
.
As
always
,
the
interview
was
conducted
on
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC">
IRC
</ref>
,
with
multiple
people
asking
questions
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Some
may
not
know
exactly
what
Stardust
or
Stardust@home
is
.
Can
you
explain
more
about
it
for
us
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
Stardust
is
a
NASA
Discovery
mission
that
was
launched
in
1999
.
It
is
really
two
missions
in
one
.
The
primary
science
goal
of
the
mission
was
to
collect
a
sample
from
a
known
primitive
solar-system
body
,
a
comet
called
Wild
2
(
pronounced
&quot;
Vilt-two
&quot;
—
the
discoverer
was
German
,
I
believe
)
.
This
is
the
first
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/US">
US
</ref>
&quot;
sample
return
&quot;
mission
since
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Apollo_program">
Apollo
</ref>
,
and
the
first
ever
from
beyond
the
moon
.
This
gives
a
little
context
.
By
&quot;
sample
return
&quot;
of
course
I
mean
a
mission
that
brings
back
extraterrestrial
material
.
I
should
have
said
above
that
this
is
the
first
&quot;
solid
&quot;
sample
return
mission
—
Genesis
brought
back
a
sample
from
the
Sun
almost
two
years
ago
,
but
Stardust
is
also
bringing
back
the
first
solid
samples
from
the
local
interstellar
medium
—
basically
this
is
a
sample
of
the
Galaxy
.
This
is
absolutely
unprecedented
,
and
we
're
obviously
incredibly
excited
.
I
should
mention
parenthetically
that
there
is
a
fantastic
launch
video
—
taken
from
the
POV
of
the
rocket
on
the
JPL
Stardust
website
—
highly
recommended
—
best
I
've
ever
seen
—
all
the
way
from
the
launch
pad
,
too
.
Basically
interplanetary
trajectory
.
Absolutely
great
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Is
the
video
available
to
the
public
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
Yes
[
see
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Main_Page#External_links">
below
</ref>
]
.
OK
,
I
digress
.
The
first
challenge
that
we
have
before
can
do
any
kind
of
analysis
of
these
interstellar
dust
particles
is
simply
to
find
them
.
This
is
a
big
challenge
because
they
are
very
small
(
order
of
micron
in
size
)
and
are
somewhere
(
we
do
n't
know
where
)
on
a
HUGE
collector
—
at
least
on
the
scale
of
the
particle
size
—
about
a
tenth
of
a
square
meter
.
<hi rend="italic">
So
</hi>
...
</p>
<p>
We
're
right
now
using
an
automated
microscope
that
we
developed
several
years
ago
for
nuclear
astrophysics
work
to
scan
the
collector
in
the
Cosmic
Dust
Lab
in
Building
31
at
Johnson
Space
Center
.
This
is
the
ARES
group
that
handles
returned
samples
(
Moon
Rocks
,
Genesis
chips
,
Meteorites
,
and
Interplanetary
Dust
Particles
collected
by
U2
in
the
stratosphere
)
.
The
microscope
collects
stacks
of
digital
images
of
the
aerogel
collectors
in
the
array
.
These
images
are
sent
to
us
—
we
compress
them
and
convert
them
into
a
format
appropriate
for
Stardust@home
.
