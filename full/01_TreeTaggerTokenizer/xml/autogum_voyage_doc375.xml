La
Fortuna
is
mostly
famous
for
the
nearby
Arenal
Volcano
(
1,633
m
)
.
The
Arenal
Volcano
is
a
destination
for
scientists
and
tourists
.
La
Fortuna
was
called
&quot;
El
Borio
&quot;
before
the
day
of
a
huge
eruption
in
1968
,
when
the
volcano
erupted
to
the
east
and
destroyed
all
in
its
path
,
including
two
villages
.
El
Borio
(
La
Fortuna
)
is
located
on
the
west
side
of
the
volcano
and
was
untouched
.
After
the
eruption
of
the
volcano
,
El
Borio
was
renamed
&quot;
La
Fortuna
&quot;
,
which
means
&quot;
the
fortunate
&quot;
,
referring
to
the
town
's
luck
during
the
eruption
.

take

and
alight
at

<p>
<hi rend="bold">
When
leaving
</hi>
La
Fortuna
,
bus
schedules
seem
to
be
highly
arbitrary
and
unreliable
.
The
more
often
you
ask
,
the
more
departure
times
they
will
tell
you
.
Some
touts
will
try
to
exploit
this
situation
.
It
is
best
to
approximately
have
a
bus
departure
time
,
arrive
a
little
earlier
and
plan
for
1
hr
waiting
or
so
.

<head>
By
private
shuttle
</head>
<p>
The
cost
of
a
private
transportation
with
a
Costa
Rican
driver
is
not
much
if
you
compare
it
with
the
benefit
of
a
direct
safe
drive
to
the
destination
.
Available
from
San
Jose
to
Arenal
and
other
destinations
.
</p>
<head>
By
car
</head>
<p>
It
is
a
3½-hour
drive
from
San
José
,
but
the
junctions
are
not
very
well
marked
,
so
bring
a
good

Get
around
</head>
<p>
The
are
just
one
or
two
buses
that
go
around
the
volcano
.
Generally
,
most
tourists
rely
on
taxis
or
their
own
cars
(
everywhere
you
will
have
to
pay
for

)
.
</p>
<p>
Hitch-hiking
is
actually
a
reasonable
option
and
quite
easy
if
you
are
travelling
on
a
tight
budget
.
This
way
you
can
reach
the
park
entrance
,
trails
or
hot
springs
time
independently
and
fast

The

are
views
from
the
village
of
El
Castillo
,
on
the
southwest
side
of
the
Volcano
,
about
25
km
west
of
La
Fortuna
and
about
4
km
up
the
road
from
the
Arenal
National

entrance
.
There
are
great
views
of
Lake
Arenal
and
the
Monteverde
Cloud
Forest
from
road
up
above
El
Castillo
.
In
October
2010
,
the
volcano
ceased
its
activity
and
the
famous
flowing
lava
has
been
gone
since
.
Seeing
some
smoke
during
the
day
is
possible
,
however
,
do
not
expect
to
see
lava/eruptions
in
the
night
,
regardless
of
clouds
.
This
could
change
at
any
time
.
Tours
to
the
National
Park
usually
start
out
in
the
early
afternoon
and
include
walking
for
about
an
hour
through
lava
rocks
before
reaching
<hi rend="italic">
El
Mirador
</hi>
,
the
best
place
to
view
the
eruption

There
are
also
possibilities
of
skipping
the
lava
rock
walking
and
go
straight
to
<hi rend="italic">
El
Mirador
</hi>
.
Most
tours
state
that
they
will
stay
for
1-1½
hours
at
this
place
,
but
if
there
is
nothing
to
be
seen
,
probably
a
lot
less
.
It
might
be
chilly
,
so
bring
a
jacket
.
The
tours
come
in
a

of
options

with
