Yeah
.
I
think
very
highly
of
Wikipedia
.
I
think
that
’s
most
of
the
criticisms
about
it
are
completely
missing
the
point
.
The
reason
Wikipedia
is
useful
is
not
because
it
has
a
similar
error
rate
to
Britannica
for
example
.
That
’s
one
thing
you
often
see
in
comparison
.
I
think
that
a
lot
of
the
criticism
of
Wikipedia
misses
a
key
point
--
that
the
way
people
interact
with
Wikipedia
is
fundamentally
different
from
interaction
with
any
other
reference
source
in
history
.
Wikipedia
is
a
system
for
pooling
information
.
It
's
where
you
go
to
find
the
consensus
of
interested
parties
backed
up
by
citation
.
Yes
,
someone
can
edit
an
article
and
cause
harm
,
but
someone
can
also
shoot
you
in
the
face
while
you
're
walking
down
a
street
.
It
does
n't
make
walking
on
streets
a
broken
behavior
.
People
use
Wikipedia
,
by
and
large
,
properly
--
as
a
glance
at
the
collected
pool
of
information
on
a
subject
,
to
figure
out
what
something
is
or
how
it
works
.
It
's
not
a
scholarly
reference
book
,
and
I
do
n't
know
anyone
who
treats
it
like
one
.

Now
we
’re
going
to
move
on
to
something
fairly
controversial
,
because
just
I
ca
n’t
resist
.
Religion
and
politics
.
You
criticized
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young%20Earth%20creationism">
Young
Earth
creationism
</ref>
and
in
the
same
strip
(
Comic
258
,
<ref target="http://xkcd.com/258/">
Conspiracy
Theories
</ref>
)
make
a
bug
report
to
God
.
It
's
not
clear
how
much
the
strip
represents
your
own
religious
views
but
how
much
does
that
one
?
How
much
do
others
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
R
:
It
’s
a
hard
balance
.
I
try
to
avoid
being
preachy
because
I
can
just
talk
endlessly
for
anything
especially
when
someone
is
listening
to
me
because
it
's
part
of
their
job
.
I
could
go
on
and
on
.
I
’ve
avoided
making
the
comic
too
personal
just
to
avoid
people
feeling
like
they
are
reading
someone
else
's
stuff
.
They
should
feel
&quot;
that
could
be
me
.
&quot;
If
I
were
like
this
is
the
part
that
represents
me
and
this
is
n’t
that
takes
away
from
some
of
that
.
But
I
do
n’t
think
there
’s
any
contradiction
there
.
I
think
that
Young
Earth
creationism
is
such
a
fringe
idea
that
this
concept
that
the
Earth
is
young
is
not
representative
of
anything
that
’s
real
spirituality
.
That
’s
a
misunderstanding
.
They
are
looking
at
science
and
then
convincing
themselves
that
their
ideas
are
scientific
and
then
really
thinking
we
’re
doing
science
here
and
deceiving
themselves
.
It
seems
much
more
like
a
delusion
than
anything
to
do
with
the
validity
of
religion
.
And
for
making
a
bug
report
to
God-
Einstein
would
talk
about
God
all
the
time
.
It
's
sort
of
a
device
.
Einstein
did
n’t
believe
in
God
not
in
the
way
we
talk
about
it
today
.
But
he
’d
talk
about
understanding
what
God
did
when
he
made
the
universe
in
looking
at
physics
.
That
’s
sort
of
the
same
way
I
approach
that
.
It
’s
a
convenient
device
.
It
’s
a
way
to
make
a
joke
or
something
.
At
one
point
I
referred
to
the
“
the
gods
”
as
a
multiple
thing
because
that
works
just
as
well
I
feel
like
.
