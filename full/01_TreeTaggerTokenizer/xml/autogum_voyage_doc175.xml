<p>

the
parking
lot
across
the
street
from
the
airport
.
</p>
<p>
Independent
travelers
can
sometimes
find
taxis

more
likely

rent
a
car
or
arrange
for
the
16
km
(
30
minute
)
car
ride
to
town
from
the
operators
of
the
rental
car
company

sometimes
be
a
window
open
for

Pre-Security
and
Arriving
Airport
Amenities
</head>
<p>
The
waiting
areas
are
hot
,
crowded
and
have
little
seating
so
if
you
will
be
in
this
area
for
as
significant
period
of
time
it
is
best
to
walk
cross
the
street
and
enjoy
some
refreshments
at
the
outdoor
cantina
(
open
to
the
air
but
covered
with
an
awning
.

Airport
Amenities
</head>
<p>

of
seating

is
a
small
cafe

is
also
good
selection
of
gift

,
which
includes
leather
crafts
,
clothing
,
books
(

)
,
postcards
,
and
rum
.
Most
prices
are
fairly
comparable
to
prices
elsewhere
in
Cuba
,
however
,
it

smart
to
not
change
all
of
one
's
CUC
's
back

entering
this
area
,
as
prices
are

better

not
in
other
currency
.
