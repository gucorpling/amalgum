.
After
the
election
result
was
announced
,
he
said
:
&quot;
I
want
to
thank
the
prime
minister
for
his
personal
support
to
my
campaign
and
I
want
to
thank
the
government
for
its
commitment
to
re-building
Britain
.
I
hope
now
that
I
can
repay
the
faith
and
trust
that
the
people
of
Newark
have
put
in
me
as
your
new
member
of
parliament
—
and
in
the
months
and
years
to
come
I
can
build
a
reputation
as
a
strong
and
effective
MP
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
UKIP
's
candidate
,
Roger
Helmer
,
attracted
controversy
during
the
election
campaign
due
to
past
public
statements
about
the
acceptability
of
homosexuality
.
In
remarks
to
<hi rend="italic">
The
Sun
</hi>
newspaper
,
he
compared
considering
homosexuality
&quot;
distasteful
if
not
viscerally
repugnant
&quot;
to
tea
preferences
.
He
explained
:
&quot;
Different
people
may
have
different
tastes
.
You
may
tell
me
that
you
do
n’t
like
Earl
Grey
tea
.
That
may
be
a
minority
view
but
you
are
entitled
not
to
like
it
if
you
do
n't
like
it
.
&quot;
Helmer
later
stated
the
manner
in
which
his
comments
were
reported
showed
&quot;
the
mainstream
media
are
engaged
in
a
feeding
frenzy
against
UKIP
,
and
are
prepared
to
twist
the
facts
to
suit
their
agenda
&quot;
.
</p>
<p>
UKIP
leader
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Nigel_Farage">
Nigel
Farage
</ref>
said
the
party
had
run
a
&quot;
stunning
campaign
&quot;
:
&quot;
We
've
been
up
against
probably
the
biggest
ever
Conservative
machine
,
defending
about
their
40th
safest
seat
in
the
country
.
If
the
indications
are
right
,
we
'll
be
celebrating
a
massive
advance
for
our
party
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Liberal_Democrats_(UK)">
Liberal
Democrat
</ref>
candidate
,
David
Watts
,
said
coming
in
sixth
place
&quot;
was
n't
a
good
result
,
but
smaller
parties
often
get
squeezed
in
by-elections
and
that
's
what
's
happened
to
us
here
&quot;
.
He
said
the
independent
campaign
by
Paul
Baggaley
had
got
a
lot
of
support
,
and
&quot;
a
lot
of
our
voters
had
transferred
to
vote
against
UKIP
to
make
sure
UKIP
did
n't
get
elected
&quot;
.
</p>
<p>
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant%20Shapps">
Grant
Shapps
</ref>
from
the
Conservative
Party
said
the
surge
of
support
for
UKIP
after
the
European
elections
was
now
&quot;
going
backwards
&quot;
,
while
Nigel
Farage
said
Conservative
MPs
in
more
marginal
seats
would
be
filled
with
&quot;
sheer
horror
&quot;
at
UKIP
's
success
.
