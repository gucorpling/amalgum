is
a
medieval
town

and
serves

It

<head>
Understand

<p>
Goslar
was
founded
in
922
AD
,
although
it
is
widely
assumed
that
there
had
been
a
settlement
since
pre-Roman
times
.
The
town
is
famed
for
its
magnificent
gates
and
ramparts
,
the
medieval
Imperial
Palace
,
Romanesque
churches
,
its
half
timbered
guild
houses
,
the
ancient
Rammelsberg
ore
mine
...
and
its
witches
,
the
last
of
which
was
burned
at
the
stake
in
1657
AD
.
In
medieval
times
the
city
was
a
major
producer
of
armouries
and
coins
—
the
raw
ores
for
their
manufacture
came
from
the
Rammelsberg
mine
just
outside
the
city
's
walls
.

What
,
Ram
+
Goat
=
Goslar
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
Not
quite
...
!
According
to
legend
,
Ramm
,
a
knight
to
Henry
's
son
Otto
the
Great
,
tied
his
horse
to
a
tree
,
half
way
up
the
Rammelsberg
,
to
continue
hunting
in
the
undergrowth
.
In
anticipation
of
the
return
of
its
owner
,
the
horse
scraped
with
its
hoof
in
the
ground
laying
open
a
ledge
of
silver
so
rich
that
it
took
over
a
millennium
to
mine
.
Hence
the
mountain
and
mine
were
called
the
Rammelsberg
,
after
Otto
's
knight
Ramm
.
As
the
wife
of
knight
Ramm
was
called
Gosa
,
they
named
the
town
Goslar
in
her
honor
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Emperors
,
Dukes
,
and
Townsfolk
</hi>
</p>
<p>
Essentially
Goslar
was
a
Free
Imperial
City
,
which
was
under
direct
control
of
the
Emperor
and
there
were
no
regional
feudal
overlords
,
who
were
in
charge
of
the
city
until
the
end
of
the
Thirty
's
Year
War
.
Thus
the
citizens
were
largely
left
to
their
own
devices
,
since
the
emperors
had
mostly
better
things
to
do
than
to
sit
in
their
Imperial
Palace
at
Goslar
.
There
were
several
other
imperial
palaces
throughout
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
,
where
the
emperors
held
court
.
The
only
problem
for
the
city
's
craftsmen
was
that
their
Free
Imperial
City
ended
right
behind
the
city
's
walls
.
Unfortunately
for
them
,
the
mine
they
depended
upon
,
for
the
delivery
of
the
ores
,
was
immediately
outside
these
very
city
walls
.
So
they
had
to
lease
the
rights
to
the
mine
from
even
such
regional
feudal
overlords
,
the
Dukes
of
Brunswick
,
who
would
have
fancied
it
,
if
the
city
was
theirs
.
This
inevitably
let
to
regular
skirmishes
between
the
Dukes
and
their
men
on
the
one
side
,
and
the
burghers
on
the
other
side
,
which
were
not
resolved
until
the
end
of
the
Thirty
's
Year
War
in
1642
AD
with
the
Goslar
Accord
.

.
With
the
onset
of
the
Reformation
in
1517
AD
Goslar
has
escaped
the
interest
of
the
emperor
,
and
its
riches
declined
so
that
Goethe
,
Germany
's
national
polymath
,
writes
in
1777
during
his
visit
to
Goslar
:
&quot;
Imperial
City
,
which
rots

inside
'
and
'
with
'
its
privileges

<p>
This
might
be
a
reason
why
the

Mine
and
Town
have
been
so
uniquely
preserved
that
they

<p>
If
you
own
a
plane
,
a
helicopter
or
even
a
flying
saucer
then
you
might
wish
to
land
at
the
club
airport
<ref target="http://www.mfc-salzgitter.de">
Salzgitter-Drütte
</ref>
in
the
immediate
vicinity
(
24
miles
)
of
Goslar
or
the
Brunswick-Wolfsburg
Airport
.
Maybe
try
the
disused
military
airfield
at
Goslar
itself
,
but
do
n't
get
yourselves
into
troubles
over
this
.
</p>
<p>
However
,
as
a
lesser
mortal
you
need
to
take
a
plane
into
either
</p>

<p>
and
make
your
way
to
Goslar
by
car
or
by
train
.
Both
airports
are
connected
to
the
S-Bahn
network
of
their
respective
cities
from
where
you
can
take
a
train
to
Goslar
.
</p>
<p>
A
further
option
is
flying
into
<ref target="Frankfurt%20Airport">
Frankfurt

(
FRA
)
and
taking
the
train
from
there
</p>
<head>

Goslar
can

be
accessed
by
regional
trains
from

</ref>

In

</ref>
there
is
access
to
Germany
's
ICE
(

network
.
Getting
to
other
cities
might
require
changes
along
the
way
,
often
in
Hildesheim

Salzgitter
or

Goslar
is
a
popular
destination
for
bikers
who
enjoy
riding
their
bikes
through
the
<ref target="Harz">

mountains
.
</p>
<head>
By

<p>
Bus
services
to
and
from
Goslar
are
relatively
frequent
and
efficient
.
The
regional
bus
operator
<ref target="http://rbb-bus.de/index.php%3Fid%3D61">
Brunswick
Regional
Transport
RBB
</ref>
runs
a
<ref target="http://www.weser-ems-bus.de/hafas/query.exe/en%3FL%3Drbb%26amp%3B">
website
</ref>
,
which
assists
you
with
finding
the
relevant
connection
.
In
Goslar
,
their
hub
is
in
front
of
the
central
railway
station
.
Here
you
also
find
a
small
travel
centre
,
where
staff
can
provide
you
with
further
advise
.
Essentially
,
the
most
frequent
routes
are
between
Goslar
,
Seesen
,
Harzburg-Spa
,
Salzgitter
and
Clausthal-Zellerfeld
,
with
less
frequent
services
to
other
destinations
in
the
Upper
Harz
(
lines
440
,
450
,
462
,
831
,
838
,
841
,
842
,
850
,
861
,
879
)
.
The
RegioBus
lines
are
the
express
ones
—
the
others
are
slow
.
The
handy
thing
is
that
the
RBB
forms
a
<ref target="http://www.vrb-online.de/">
partnership
</ref>
with
other
regional
public
<ref target="http://www.zgb.de">
transport
operators
</ref>
,
so
that
you
only
have
to
buy
a
single
transferable
ticket
.
Thus
,
there
is
no
need
to
purchase
a
new
one
every
time
you
change
your
train
or
bus
