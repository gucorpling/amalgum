(
PETA
)
has
made
headlines
and
raised
eyebrows
.
They
are
almost
single-handedly
responsible
for
the
movement
against
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal%20testing">
animal

</ref>
and
their
efforts
have
raised
the
suffering

first
made
headlines
in
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver%20Spring%20monkeys">

case
</ref>
,
when
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex%20Pacheco">
Alex
Pacheco
</ref>
,
then
a
student
at
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George%20Washington%20University">
George
Washington
University
</ref>
,
volunteered
at
a
lab
run
by
Edward
Taub
,
who
was
testing
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity">
neuroplasticity
</ref>
on
live
monkeys
.
Taub
had
cut
sensory
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganglia">
ganglia
</ref>
that
supplied
nerves
to
the
monkeys
'
fingers
,
hands
,
arms
,
legs
;
with
some
of
the
monkeys
,
he
had
severed
the
entire
spinal
column
.
He
then
tried
to
force
the
monkeys
to
use
their
limbs
by
exposing
them
to
persistent
electric
shock
,
prolonged
physical
restraint
of
an
intact
arm
or
leg
,
and
by
withholding
food
.
With
footage
obtained
by
Pacheco
,
Taub
was
convicted
of
six
counts
of
animal
cruelty
—
largely
as
a
result
of
the
monkeys
'
reported
living
conditions
—
making
them
&quot;
the
most
famous
lab
animals
in
history
,
&quot;
according
to
psychiatrist
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Brain%20That%20Changes%20Itself">
Norman
Doidge
</ref>
.
Taub
's
conviction
was
later
overturned
on
appeal
and
the
monkeys
were
eventually

They
have
launched
campaigns
and
engaged
in
stunts
that
are
designed
for
media
attention
.
In
1996
,
PETA
activists
famously
threw
a

and
left
bloody

the
words
&quot;
Fur

&quot;
on
the
steps
of
her
home
.
They
ran
a
campaign
entitled
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal%20rights%20and%20the%20Holocaust">
Holocaust
on
your
Plate
</ref>
that
consisted
of
eight
60-square-foot
panels
,
each
juxtaposing
images
of
the
Holocaust
with
images
of
factory
farming
.
Photographs
of
concentration
camp
inmates
in

bunks
were
shown
next
to
photographs
of

,
and
piled
