M'SIEU
FORTIER'S
VIOLIN
</head>
<p>
Slowly
,
one
by
one
,
the
lights
in
the
French
Opera
go
out
,
until
there
is
but
a
single
glimmer
of
pale
yellow
flickering
in
the
great
dark
space
,
a
few
moments
ago
all
a-glitter
with
jewels
and
the
radiance
of
womanhood
and
a-clash
with
music
.
Darkness
now
,
and
silence
,
and
a
great
haunted
hush
over
all
,
save
for
the
distant
cheery
voice
of
a
stage
hand
humming
a
bar
of
the
opera
.
</p>
<p>
The
glimmer
of
gas
makes
a
halo
about
the
bowed
white
head
of
a
little
old
man
putting
his
violin
carefully
away
in
its
case
with
aged
,
trembling
,
nervous
fingers
.
Old
M'sieu
Fortier
was
the
last
one
out
every
night
.
</p>
<p>
Outside
the
air
was
murky
,
foggy
.
Gas
and
electricity
were
but
faint
splotches
of
light
on
the
thick
curtain
of
fog
and
mist
.
Around
the
opera
was
a
mighty
bustle
of
carriages
and
drivers
and
footmen
,
with
a
car
gaining
headway
in
the
street
now
and
then
,
a
howling
of
names
and
numbers
,
the
laughter
and
small
talk
of
cloaked
society
stepping
slowly
to
its
carriages
,
and
the
more
bourgeoisie
vocalisation
of
the
foot
passengers
who
streamed
along
and
hummed
little
bits
of
music
.
The
fog
's
denseness
was
confusing
,
too
,
and
at
one
moment
it
seemed
that
the
little
narrow
street
would
become
inextricably
choked
and
remain
so
until
some
mighty
engine
would
blow
the
crowd
into
atoms
.
It
had
been
a
crowded
night
.
From
around
Toulouse
Street
,
where
led
the
entrance
to
the
troisiemes
,
from
the
grand
stairway
,
from
the
entrance
to
the
quatriemes
,
the
human
stream
poured
into
the
street
,
nearly
all
with
a
song
on
their
lips
.
</p>
<p>
M'sieu
Fortier
stood
at
the
corner
,
blinking
at
the
beautiful
ladies
in
their
carriages
.
He
exchanged
a
hearty
salutation
with
the
saloon-keeper
at
the
corner
,
then
,
tenderly
carrying
his
violin
case
,
he
trudged
down
Bourbon
Street
,
a
little
old
,
bent
,
withered
figure
,
with
shoulders
shrugged
up
to
keep
warm
,
as
though
the
faded
brown
overcoat
were
not
thick
enough
.
</p>
<p>
Down
on
Bayou
Road
,
not
so
far
from
Claiborne
Street
,
was
a
house
,
little
and
old
and
queer
,
but
quite
large
enough
to
hold
M'sieu
Fortier
,
a
wrinkled
dame
,
and
a
white
cat
.
He
was
home
but
little
,
for
on
nearly
every
day
there
were
rehearsals
;
then
on
Tuesday
,
Thursday
,
and
Saturday
nights
,
and
twice
Sundays
there
were
performances
,
so
Ma'am
Jeanne
and
the
white
cat
kept
house
almost
always
alone
.
Then
,
when
M'sieu
Fortier
was
at
home
,
why
,
it
was
practice
,
practice
all
the
day
,
and
smoke
,
snore
,
sleep
at
night
.
Altogether
it
was
not
very
exhilarating
.
</p>
<p>
M'sieu
Fortier
had
played
first
violin
in
the
orchestra
ever
since
--
well
,
no
one
remembered
his
not
playing
there
.
Sometimes
there
would
come
breaks
in
the
seasons
,
and
for
a
year
the
great
building
would
be
dark
and
silent
.
Then
M'sieu
Fortier
would
do
jobs
of
playing
here
and
there
,
one
night
for
this
ball
,
another
night
for
that
soiree
dansante
,
and
in
the
day
,
work
at
his
trade
,
--
that
of
a
cigar-maker
.
But
now
for
seven
years
there
had
been
no
break
in
the
season
,
and
the
little
old
violinist
was
happy
.
There
is
nothing
sweeter
than
a
regular
job
and
good
music
to
play
,
music
into
which
one
can
put
some
soul
,
some
expression
,
and
which
one
must
study
to
understand
.
Dance
music
,
of
the
frivolous
,
frothy
kind
deemed
essential
to
soirees
,
is
trivial
,
easy
,
uninteresting
.
</p>
<p>
So
M'sieu
Fortier
,
Ma'am
Jeanne
,
and
the
white
cat
lived
a
peaceful
,
uneventful
existence
out
on
Bayou
Road
.
When
the
opera
season
was
over
in
February
,
M'sieu
went
back
to
cigar-making
,
and
the
white
cat
purred
none
the
less
contentedly
.
</p>
<p>
It
had
been
a
benefit
to-night
for
the
leading
tenor
,
and
he
had
chosen
&quot;
Roland
a
Ronceveaux
,
&quot;
a
favourite
this
season
,
for
his
farewell
.
And
,
mon
Dieu
,
mused
the
little
M'sieu
,
but
how
his
voice
had
rung
out
bell-like
,
piercing
above
the
chorus
of
the
first
act
!
Encore
after
encore
was
given
,
and
the
bravos
of
the
troisiemes
were
enough
to
stir
the
most
sluggish
of
pulses
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Superbes
Pyrenees
Qui
dressez
dans
le
ciel
,
Vos
cimes
couronnees
D'un
hiver
eternelle
,
Pour
nous
livrer
passage
Ouvrez
vos
larges
flancs
,
Faites
faire
l'orage
,
Voici
,
venir
les
Francs
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
M'sieu
quickened
his
pace
down
Bourbon
Street
as
he
sang
the
chorus
to
himself
in
a
thin
old
voice
,
and
then
,
before
he
could
see
in
the
thick
fog
,
he
had
run
into
two
young
men
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
--
I
--
beg
your
pardon
,
--
messieurs
,
&quot;
he
stammered
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Most
certainly
,
&quot;
was
the
careless
response
;
then
the
speaker
,
taking
a
second
glance
at
the
object
of
the
rencontre
,
cried
joyfully
:
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Oh
,
M'sieu
Fortier
,
is
it
you
?
Why
,
you
are
so
happy
,
singing
your
love
sonnet
to
your
lady
's
eyebrow
,
that
you
did
n't
see
a
thing
but
the
moon
,
did
you
?
And
who
is
the
fair
one
who
should
clog
your
senses
so
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
There
was
a
deprecating
shrug
from
the
little
man
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Ma
foi
,
but
monsieur
must
know
fo
'
sho
'
,
dat
I
am
too
old
for
love
songs
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
know
nothing
save
that
I
want
that
violin
of
yours
.
When
is
it
to
be
mine
,
M'sieu
Fortier
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Nevare
,
nevare
!
&quot;
exclaimed
M'sieu
,
gripping
on
as
tightly
to
the
case
as
if
he
feared
it
might
be
wrenched
from
him
.
&quot;
Me
a
lovere
,
and
to
sell
mon
violon
!
Ah
,
so
ver
'
foolish
!
&quot;
