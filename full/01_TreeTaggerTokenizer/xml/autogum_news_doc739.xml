the
day
before
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Christmas">

,
on
a
technicality
.
The
case
was
filed
by
David
and
Salma
Merritt
of
Santa
Clara
County
against
multiple
defendants
,
including
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countrywide%20Financial">
Countrywide
</ref>
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank%20of%20America">

Title
</ref>
,
among
others
.
</p>
<p>
The
Merritts
had
challenged
Judge
Stoelker
's
involvement
in
the
case
,
claiming
many
of
his
rulings
had
favored
his
former
clients
even
when
law
would
have
indicated
otherwise
.
Some
of
the
defendants
are
Judge
Stoelker
's
former
clients
.
</p>
<p>
The
events
leading
to
this
case
began
in
2006
when
the
Merritts
accepted
a
home
loan
from
Countrywide
.
At
that
time
,
Countrywide
was
advertising
30-year
mortgages
at
between
1
and
3
percent
interest
.
The
Merritts
received
a
&quot;
good
faith
estimate
&quot;
consistent
with
those
advertisements
.
They
claim
that
Countrywide
representatives
tricked
them
into
signing
loan
documents
that
were
subsequently
altered
to
appear
to
commit
them
to
an
obligation
they
had
not
agreed
to
.

A
review
of
similar
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/predatory%20lending">
predatory
lending
</ref>
cases
filed
by
individuals
in
California
found
that
all
had
been
settled
in
at
most
9
months
,
usually
in
favor
of
the
banks
.
Merritt
v.
Mozilo
has
continued
in
the
courts
for
much
longer
,
celebrating
its
third
anniversary
last
Saturday
.
The
Merritts
'
claims
are
consistent
with
published
statements
by
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eileen%20Foster">
Eileen
Foster
</ref>
,
former
Executive
Vice
President
of
Fraud
Risk
Management
at
Countrywide
,
that
fraud
was
endemic
to
certain
parts
of
Countrywide
.
</p>
<p>
Theirs
was
the
only
case
heard
in
Department
9
that
morning
in
recognition
of
Christmas
.
That
hearing
was
scheduled
,
because
the
Sixth
District
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California%20Court%20of%20Appeals">
California
Court
of
Appeals
</ref>
(
case
number
H038883
)
required
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa%20Clara%20County%20Superior%20Court">
Santa
Clara
County
Superior
Court
</ref>
to
(
a
)
give
all
parties
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
regarding
the
possible
disqualification
of
Judge
Stoelker
and
(
b
)
reply
to
the
appellate
court
by
December
26
.
This
appellate
ruling
was
only
issued
on
November
26
,
and
Judge
Mark
H.
Pierce
did
not
schedule
the
required
hearing
until
December
12
.
The
notice
for
this
hearing
required
parties
to
file
responses
ten
days
before
,
which
meant
that
the
parties
only
had
two
days
to
prepare
their
replies
.
</p>
<p>
On
August
16
,
the
Merritts
learned
Judge
Stoelker
had
represented
defendants
in
this
case
on
numerous
occasions
before
he
was
appointed
to
the
bench
in
December
2010
and
had
not
disclosed
this
fact
to
the
Merritts
.
The
next
day
they
filed
a
Verified
Statement
of
Disqualification
asking
Stoekler
to
recuse
himself
.
The
California
Code
of
Civil
Procedure
(
CCP
)
170.3(c)(3
)
and
(
4
)
[
confirmed
in
the
1988
appellate
decision
in
Lewis
v.
Superior
Court
]
give
a
judge
ten
days
to
respond
to
to
such
a
motion
.
Stoelker
replied
on
the
eleventh
day
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
All
Rise
&quot;
was
heard
at
9:04
AM
local
time
Monday
morning
,
whereupon
Judge
Pierce
entered
the
courtroom
.
Attending
by
phone
were
attorneys
James
Goldberg
representing
Bank
of
America
and
Brian
Craft
representing
First
American
Title
.
David
Merritt
was
present
representing
himself
.
Goldberg
had
filed
a
brief
asserting
that
the
Merritts
'
Verified
Statement
of
Disqualification
was
served
upon
Judge
Stoelker
on
August
17
but
was
not
filed
,
as
witnessed
by
the
fact
that
it
was
not
listed
on
the
docket
.
Judge
Pierce
reported
that
he
had
checked
the
files
and
found
that
this
Statement
had
indeed
been
filed
,
and
he
did
n't
know
why
it
was
not
on
the
docket
.
Attorney
Goldberg
suggested
that
the
fact
that
the
Statement
was
not
on
the
docket
may
have
contributed
to
Judge
Stoelker
's
failure
to
respond
within
the
ten
day
limit
.
Judge
Pierce
replied
,
&quot;
That
's
a
stretch
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Attorney
Craft
asked
about
next
steps
,
since
all
action
in
this
case
had
been
stayed
by
the
appellate
court
pending
resolution
of
this
issue
.
Judge
Pierce
then
replied
that
Judge
Manoukian
would
be
handling
discovery
in
this
case
,
replacing
Judge
Stoelker
in
that
capacity
.
He
further
stated
that
a
reply
to
the
appellate
court
had
been
prepared
concurring
with
the
appellate
court
's
disqualification
of
Judge
Stoelker
and
asked
Mr.
Merritt
to
retrieve
that
order
from
the
clerk
in
the
courtroom
and
file
it
as
usual
with
the
clerk
's
office
.
He
also
noted
that
this
action
would
lift
the
stay
.
Other
actions
in
this
case
could
now
proceed
with
the
next
steps
being
scheduled
January
22
,
2013
,
or
later
.
</p>
<p>
This
is
the
second
appellate
reversal
of
decisions
by
this
superior
court
in
this
case
.
The
first
reversal
came
on
December
19
,
2011
,
when
the
appellate
court
reinstated
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells%20Fargo">
Wells
Fargo
</ref>
as
a
defendant
.
