Introduction
</head>
<p>
Housing
is
required
to
provide
comfort
,
safety
,
satisfaction
,
experience
,
and
convenience
for
its
occupants
.
Hence
,
it
is
one
of
the
essential
social
conditions
which
define
the
living
standard
of
a
country
’s
citizens
.
If
the
housing
quality
is
adequate
and
available
,
the
citizens
and
government
will
spend
less
on
health
care
,
crime
prevention
,
recreation
,
and
pollution
;
leading
to
increased
productivity
and
prosperity
.
However
,
due
to
rapid
rates
of
urbanization
reported
worldwide
,
housing
supply
has
always
failed
to
satisfy
demand
.
Therefore
,
exploring
the
reasons
why
households
pay
or
choose
what
they
pay
for
housing
,
would
help
to
sustain
housing
delivery
,
which
can
eliminate
or
reduce
artificial
restrictions
and
prevent
housing
abandonment
.
A
clear
understanding
of
the
households
’
choice
will
offer
new
insight
towards
addressing
the
challenges
of
housing
shortages
and
poor
distribution
.
According
to
Olanrewaju
&amp;
woon
,
,
the
most
likely
problem
triggering
the
imbalance
between
the
demand
and
supply
of
affordable
housing
,
is
the
inability
to
reconcile
households
choice
and
supply
.
</p>
<p>
Several
factors
are
responsible
for
the
poor
delivery
of
affordable
housing
,
but
studies
have
demonstrated
that
unsold
properties
and
abandoned
houses
are
due
to
choice
.
Households
apply
choice
factors
to
define
their
housing
demand
.
Housing
choice
is
a
topic
of
interest
amongst
researchers
of
diverse
disciplines
and
has
been
studied
from
different
theoretical
perspectives
.
For
instance
,
economists
focus
primarily
on
housing
prices
and
how
housing
costs
determine
the
choice
between
owning
and
renting
.
Sociologists
and
geographers
study
the
housing
choices
individual
households
make
and
examining
housing
distribution
in
a
given
population
.
They
focus
on
socioeconomic
and
demographic
aspects
,
dwelling
,
and
the
neighborhood
features
that
influence
housing
choice
.
</p>
<p>
Demand
for
affordable
housing
has
been
essentially
evaluated
in
financial
terms
,
but
affordable
housing
concerns
have
progressed
beyond
mere
economic
concepts
,
to
wider
issues
of
social
wellbeing
and
sustainability
.
However
,
it
is
uncommon
to
address
affordable
housing
demand
concerns
within
the
ambit
of
sustainability
.
Regarding
this
,
Sirgy
,
et
al.
recommended
that
further
studies
on
housing
choice
determinants
should
be
improved
by
incorporating
wide-ranging
criteria
like
socio-psychological
factors
,
amongst
others
.
Several
studies
have
examined
housing
choice
from
other
perspectives
,
like
uncertainties
and
lifestyles
,
but
none
has
discussed
housing
choice
within
the
sustainability
framework
.
However
,
integrating
sustainability
into
the
concept
of
housing
choice
allows
for
the
introduction
of
wide-ranging
and
broader
variables
such
as
environmental
factors
,
which
are
routinely
neglected
in
housing
choice
literature
.
For
instance
,
ÆRØ
explored
why
residents
chose
a
particular
dwelling
type
in
Denmark
by
referring
to
lifestyle
variables
and
personal
tradition
.
Jansen
found
that
lifestyle
variables
exact
strong
influence
on
housing
choices
of
medium
and
high-income
Dutch
households
.
It
is
given
that
individual
lifestyle
variables
influence
their
choice
of
housing
,
but
this
influence
is
little
when
compared
with
those
of
their
socio-demographic
characteristics
.
</p>
<p>
In
Nigeria
,
affordable
housing
choice
has
never
been
studied
,
nor
investigated
in
academic
literature
.
Therefore
this
study
aims
to
fill
this
gap
in
housing
choice
literature
by
identifying
within
the
framework
of
sustainability
the
determinants
of
sustainable
affordable
housing
choice
in
Abuja
,
Nigeria
.
The
study
investigates
sustainable
affordable
housing
from
the
perspective
of
housing
choice
and
identifies
a
set
of
factors
that
strongly
influence
it
.
The
purpose
is
to
establish
the
severity
of
the
identified
factors
and
rank
them
based
on
the
respondent
’s
opinion
.
This
study
is
concerned
with
the
change
of
residence
in
a
national
context
and
the
process
through
which
urban
residents
find
and
choose
a
particular
dwelling
to
live-in
in
an
urban
setting
.
The
research
objectives
are
(
1
)
To
discuss
the
relationship
between
the
identified
factors
.
(
2
)
To
study
the
agreement
levels
in
the
opinions
of
the
three
respondent
groups
,
that
is
;
To
determine
if
the
general
opinion
of
the
three
groups
agrees
with
the
opinion
of
each
group
.
Specifically
,
if
there
is
an
agreement
between
affordable
housing
applicants
’
opinionand
the
overall
opinion
of
all
the
parties
.
If
also
there
is
an
agreement
between
affordable
housing
estate
residents
’
opinion
and
the
overall
opinion
of
all
the
groups
,
and
if
there
is
an
agreement
between
the
opinion
of
residents
of
shanty
towns
’
and
the
overall
opinion
of
all
the
groups
?
(

Lastly
,
to
develop
a
framework
for
achieving
SAHC
in
the
study
area
.
</p>
<p>
Based
on
the
main
research
question
,
what
are
the
factors
that
determine
urban
residents
’
choice
of
affordable
housing
?
From
this
,
the
following
two
sub-questions
emerge
:
(
1
)
What
is
the
extent
of
the
relationship
and
interplay
between
the
identified
factors
?
(
2
)
Is
there
an
agreement
between
affordable
housing
applicants
’
opinion
and
the
overall
opinion
of
all
the
groups
,
affordable
housing
estate
residents
’
opinion
,
and
overall
opinion
of
all
the
groups
and
residents
of
shanty
towns
’
opinion
and
the
overall
opinion
of
all
the
groups
?
This
research
is
guided
by
the
postulation
that
Null
Hypothesis
(
Ho
)
:
There
is
no
agreement
between
the
opinions
of
the
three
respondent
groups
.
