Introduction
</head>
<p>
Rheumatoid
arthritis
(
RA
)
is
an
autoimmune
condition
,
characterized
by
symmetrical
joint
inflammation
,
that
affects
approximately
1
%
of
the
world
’s
population
.
RA
is
characterized
mainly
by
synovium
hyperplasia
and
a
joint
destruction
process
.
In
this
scenario
,
immune
cells
and
the
inflammatory
microenvironment
that
they
create
in
affected
joints
are
key
components
in
the
pathophysiology
of
RA
.
Moreover
,
it
is
well-described
that
during
the
inflammatory
stages
of
the
disease
,
extra-articular
manifestations
are
common
,
which
involve
other
tissues
or
organs
.
</p>
<p>
RA
patients
are
at
risk
of
systemic
complications
and
several
co-morbidities
,
including
osteoporosis
and
frequent
vertebral
and
hip
fragility
fractures
.
The
incidence
rate
of
overall
fractures
in
RA
patients
is
33
per
1000
person-years
,
and
the
risk
is
increased
with
disease
activity
and
associated
with
overexpression
of
pro-inflammatory
cytokines
that
can
disturb
the
bone
remodeling
process
.
</p>
<p>
Over
the
last
decades
,
animal
models
—
especially
the
rodent
models
—
have
been
crucial
tools
for
understanding
the
biologic
process
of
RA
,
and
their
use
can
aid
in
developing
new
therapeutic
strategies
for
fracture
healing
in
RA
inflammatory
conditions
.
Collagen
induced-arthritis
(
CIA
)
animal
models
have
been
one
of
the
most
widely
used
models
in
RA
research
.
Originally
described
by
Trentham
,
CIA
is
a
reproducible
animal
experimental
model
of
RA
.
In
fact
,
the
similarity
to
human
RA
regarding
the
disease
clinical
,
histological
,
and
immunological
signals
—
including
high
articular
levels
of
inflammatory
cytokines
—
like
tumor
necrosis
factor-α
(
TNF-α
)
,
make
it
an
invaluable
model
to
study
the
pathologic
process
and
to
search
new
therapeutic
strategies
.
The
response
to
rat
CIA
has
been
reported
to
involve
macrophages
,
T
and
B
lymphocytes
,
and
mediators
such
as
TNF-α
,
Interleukin
(
IL)-1β
,
IL-6
,
and
IL-17
.
Nonetheless
,
the
systemic
response
in
this
model
has
not
been
well
characterized
so
far
.
</p>
<p>
Importantly
,
current
RA
treatments
do
not
promote
joint
repair
,
and
several
efforts
are
being
made
to
develop
new
therapies
,
especially
based
in
cell
approaches
using
mesenchymal
stem/stromal
cells
(
MSC
)
.
MSC
are
multipotent
progenitor
cells
with
the
potential
to
differentiate
into
mesenchymal
lineage
tissues
(
e.
g.
,
bone
,
cartilage
,
and
adipose
tissue
)
,
described
to
have
immunomodulatory
roles
,
being
capable
of
recruiting
different
cell
types
and
promoting
tissue
repair
.
The
transplantation
of
MSC
has
been
reported
to
ameliorate
or
delay
RA
onset
in
CIA
animals
,
partially
mediated
by
inflammatory
signaling
suppression
,
and
thereby
reducing
joint
swelling
and
destruction
.
Although
the
available
evidence
supports
the
use
of
MSC
transplantation
as
a
cell-based
strategy
in
CIA
animals
,
data
on
the
biology
of
endogenous
CIA
animals-derived
MSC
in
basal
conditions
is
scarce
.
Moreover
,
the
impact
of
the
systemic
inflammatory
condition
on
biological
properties
of
endogenous
MSC
has
not
been
explored
yet
.
</p>
<p>
Herein
,
we
propose
CIA
as
a
reliable
model
to
study
bone
regeneration
in
inflammatory
conditions
,
and
additionally
we
investigate
the
effect
of
RA
induction
on
the
biological
behavior
of
endogenous
MSC
as
crucial
cells
involved
in
repair/regeneration
.
</p>
<p>
Our
results
have
shown
that
the
combination
of
the
two
models
is
feasible
and
that
CIA
animals
respond
to
the
bone
injury
with
a
significant
increase
of
systemic
myeloid
cells
number
and
their
co-stimulatory
molecules
(
CD40
and
CD86
)
expression
,
accompanied
by
increased
levels
of
IL-13
,
IL-2
,
and
IL-6
in
plasma
.
The
systemic
inflammatory
environment
created
by
the
arthritis
induction
leads
to
decreased
metabolic
activity
and
proliferation
of
CIA-derived
MSC
,
and
increased
differentiation
capacity
determined
by
the
expression
of
osteogenic
(
runt-related
transcription
factor
2
(
RUNX2
)
and
alkaline
phosphatase
(
ALP
)
)
,
and
chondrogenic
(
aggrecan
(
ACAN
)
)
markers
in
basal
conditions
.
