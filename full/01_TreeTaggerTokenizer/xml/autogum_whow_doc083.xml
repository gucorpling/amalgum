Use
a
Cell
Phone
Safely
when
Driving
</head>
<p>
Doing
anything
that
distracts
you
when
driving
is
dangerous
,
whether
it
be
eating
,
changing
a
CD
,
fiddling
with
the
radio
dials
,
or
using
a
cell
phone
.
Talking
on
your
cellphone
while
driving
makes
you
four
times
more
likely
to
crash
.
This
fact
means
that
in
many
jurisdictions
around
the
world
,
it
is
illegal
to
use
a
cellphone
in
the
car
.
This
article
discusses
the
means
by
which
you
can
use
a
cellphone
or
mobile
phone
(
hand-held
phones
)
safely
in
the
car
.

<list type="ordered">
<item>
Use
a
bluetooth
headset
.
Never
directly
answer
the
phone
,
handle
it
or
fiddle
with
its
dials
.
Dialing
while
using
a
hand-held
phone
and
driving
makes
you
2.8
times
more
likely
to
crash
.
Speak
and
listen
only
using
the
bluetooth
.
Use
voice-activation
rather
than
having
to
touch
any
buttons
.
Check
that
this
equipment
is
legal
in
your
jurisdiction
.

The
safest
approach
to
doing
this
is
to
start
the
call
before
you
set
off
driving
.
That
way
,
you
do
n't
need
to
touch
any
controls
to
get
the
call
started
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Avoid
answering
the
phone
or
using
it
at
all
while
engaged
in
actual
driving
.
Turn
your
phone
off
or
set
it
to
silent
.
That
way
,
it
cannot
distract
you
at
all
and
you
wo
n't
feel
compelled
to
answer
it
if
it
rings
.
Whatever
it
is
,
it
can
wait
until
you
've
stopped
driving
.

Never
text
while
driving
.
Sending
a
text
takes
your
eyes
off
the
road
for
four
to
five
seconds
,
on
average
.
This
means
that
,
if
you
were
traveling
at
90kmh
,
you
'd
travel
the
length
of
a
rugby
(
football
)
field
blindfolded
.

Pull
over
and
stop
in
a
safe
location
.
If
you
really
must
answer
or
make
a
call
,
pull
over
safely
to
the
side
of
the
road
and
deal
with
your
call
while
stationary
.

Talking
on
a
cellphone
while
driving
decreases
the
driving
concentration
ability
of
your
brain
by
over
37
percent
.
Your
reaction
times
slow
down
too
,
by
fifty
percent
!
</item>
<item>
Put
your
phone
out
of
reach
.
Put
it
somewhere
that
will
force
you
to
pull
over
and
stop
in
order
to
deal
with
the
call
rather
than
continue
driving
.

<item>
Ask
a
passenger
to
answer
the
phone
and
to
relay
the
conversation
to
you
and
answer
for
you
.
Do
not
make
young
children
do
this
,
however
,
as
this
can
be
both
even
more
distracting
for
you
and
an
unfair
burden
on
them
.

A
passenger
can
send
texts
on
your
behalf
,
if
necessary
.
Ask
the
passenger
to
clarify
with
the
recipient
that
they
are
the
sender
,
to
discourage
more
texting
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Finish
calling
or
texting
prior
to
getting
into
the
car
.
If
you
really
need
to
get
through
to
someone
,
think
ahead
and
deal
with
it
before
driving
.
Alternatively
,
talk
or
text
on
arrival
at
your
destination
.

It
can
also
help
to
tell
the
person
waiting
for
a
call
that
you
're
about
to
drive
and
ca
n't
answer
until
the
trip
has
ended
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Let
people
know
that
you
do
n't
answer
or
use
the
cellphone
when
driving
.
The
more
people
are
aware
that
you
do
n't
talk
and
drive
or
text
and
drive
,
tell
them
.
The
sooner
they
know
,
the
sooner
they
'll
accept
that
they
ca
n't
expect
you
to
be
constantly
available
by
phone
and
that
it
's
okay
to
wait
to
hear
from
you
.
This
will
also
help
them
to
copy
your
example
and
feel
okay
that
they
do
n't
have
be
available
by
phone
when
driving
either
.

Tips

<list type="unordered">
<item>
Be
honest
about
your
driving
skills
.
Most
people
think
they
can
drive
better
than
they
actually
can
,
hence
it
's
a
good
idea
to
presume
that
you
are
n't
as
skilled
at
being
able
to
concentrate
on
driving
while
being
distracted
by
a
phone
.
</item>
<item>
Avoid
in-car
phone
use
during
peak
hour
,
when
on
busy
roads
or
when
you
're
tired
,
upset
or
frustrated
.
Put
your
energies
toward
full
concentration
on
the
road
.

<item>
Driving
and
using
a
hand-held
phone
is
illegal
in
many
jurisdictions
across
the
world
.
</item>
<item>
Using
a
cell
phone
while
driving
can
result
in
you
seriously
injuring
or
killing
yourself
or
someone
else
.
It
is
n't
possible
to
devote
your
full
attention
to
driving
,
the
road
,
things
happening
around
you
and
the
phone
buttons
at
the
same
time
.
Remember
it
's
better
to
save
your
life
then
finding
out
what
happened
to
your
friends
ex-boyfriend
.
</item>
<item>
Talking
and
driving
is
a
form
of
multi-tasking
.
Human
beings
are
not
great
at
multi-tasking
,
so
even
just
talking
into
the
phone
hands-free
instead
of
concentrating
on
the
road
and
driving
can
be
distracting
.
