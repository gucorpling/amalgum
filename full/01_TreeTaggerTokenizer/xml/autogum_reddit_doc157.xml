Wealth
inequality
can
be
helped
,
but
by
broadening
free
market
capitalism
instead
of
using
theft
and
force
to
redistribute
wealth
.
There
will
be
rich
and
poor
no
matter
the
society
,
but
I
'd
rather
live
in
one
where
even
the
poorest
of
the
poor
are
richer
than
the
socialist
oligarchs

Well
,
there
_shouldn't_
be
both
billionaires
and
homeless
people
.
A
better
way
to
state
it
is
that
there
_should_
be
billionaires
,
and
it
's
_inevitable_
that
there
will
be
homeless
poor
people
.
Here
's
why
I
think
that
is
so
:

Why
billionaires
are
good

Realize
that
wealth
is
not
zero-sum
.
This
is
key
.
Most
billionaires
have
not
stolen
the
money
from
other
people
(
and
if
they
did
they
should
indeed
be
punished
)
.
Rather
,
they
were
willingly
given
the
money
because
they
provide
value
.
That
is
,
there
is
more
total
wealth
to
go
around
to
everyone
when
someone
innovates
and
becomes
wealthy
.
Poor
people
in
the
US
have
tremendous
buying
power
because
the
innovations
of
the
wealthy
have
made
quality
goods
so
cheap
.

Very
wealthy
people
invest
money
in
things
that
others
wo
n't
.
Elon
Musk
,
Bill
Gates
,
tons
of
angel
investors
around
the
world
.
These
people
,
who
are
willing
to
put
money
in
high-risk
or
humanitarian
ventures
,
can
spur
innovation
.
Silicon
Valley
became
so
innovative
in
part
because
the
early
millionaires
turned
around
and
invested
in
the
next
group
.
</item>
<item>
The
wealthy
consume
goods
that
may
lead
to
innovations
.
In
some
fields
,
it
's
typical
for
technologies
developed
for
high-end
products
to
trickle
down
.
Technologies
in
Ferraris
find
their
way
into
Hyundais
,
eventually
.

<item>
The
wealthy
inspire
many
of
us
to
do
more
with
our
lives
,
because
we
want
to
be
them
.

Why
poor
folks
are
inevitable
:
</p>
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Some
poor
people
are
poor
because
they
repeatedly
make
bad
decisions
with
their
lives
.
They
have
a
very
hard
time
delaying
gratification
,
which
means
they
do
n't
plan
for
the
future
.
Monetary
handouts
are
n't
always
a
solution
here
--
witness
the
many
athletes
and
lottery
winners
than
go
broke
.
I
believe
some
countries
are
experimenting
with
a
basic
income
--
I
'm
curious
to
see
how
that
turns
out
.
A
steady
stream
of
a
modest
amount
of
money
could
work
a
bit
better
,
perhaps
.
</item>
<item>
Related
to
the
above
point
--
a
country
can
afford
to
boost
the
lives
of
bad
decision
makers
,
but
only
if
the
percentage
of
them
is
low
enough
.
As
the
number
of
bad
decision
makers
increases
,
it
becomes
increasingly
difficult
to
afford
.
Note
that
there
is
evidence
that
decision-making
is
at
least
partly
genetic
,
and
therefore
it
is
hard
to
simply
teach
people
.
</item>
<item>
Finally
,
there
will
always
be
a
small
percentage
that
are
borderline
insane
or
mentally
deficient
.
You
have
a
choice
to
make
:
Restrict
their
freedoms
,
or
accept
that
they
may
live
a
life
that
some
will
call
horrifying
.
I
'm
not
sure
the
best
solution
here
.
