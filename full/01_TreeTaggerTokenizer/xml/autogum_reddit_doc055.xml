Avoid
BMO
InvestorLine
</head>
<sp who="#kgalloway1">
<p>
Here
is
my
investor
beware
story
.
I
get
paid
partially
in
equity
that
is
dual
listed
in
the
US
and
Canada
.
I
opened
a
BMO
InvestorLine
account
because
they
will
allow
you
to
sell
shares
in
either
currency
without
a
phone
call
.
I
wanted
to
transfer
shares
into
my
BMO
account
,
so
I
called
them
first
to
ask
what
to
do
.
They
gave
me
the
address
and
told
me
to
just
have
the
shares
sent
there
and
they
would
show
up
in
my
account
so
I
could
sell
them
.
Everything
went
well
until
I
tried
to
actually
sell
the
shares
and
got
an
error
saying
I
could
n’t
.
Thinking
this
was
weird
,
I
called
in
and
asked
what
was
up
.
They
told
me
I
needed
a
form
filled
out
and
stamped
by
a
BMO
branch
.
No
problem
I
thought
.
The
branch
had
no
idea
what
to
do
with
the
form
,
but
three
hours
and
two
trips
to
the
branch
later
the
had
faxed
it
in
and
confirmed
InvestorLine
had
received
it
.
Not
great
but
at
least
I
’d
know
for
next
time
.
They
said
they
would
rush
process
it
and
it
would
n’t
be
longer
than
tomorrow
.
They
also
dropped
on
me
that
I
could
sell
the
shares
but
could
n’t
withdraw
the
proceeds
for
2
weeks
because
I
might
be
laundering
money
.
Waited
a
day
,
still
the
same
error
.
I
called
in
again
to
ask
what
was
up
.
They
did
n’t
know
why
I
could
n’t
trade
but
asked
me
to
email
the
form
in
this
time
.
I
did
that
,
they
confirmed
they
got
it
and
said
they
would
fix
it
that
day
and
call
me
when
it
was
done
.
I
received
no
call
back
.
Next
day
,
still
the
same
error
.
Called
in
again
.
Was
told
the
previous
two
people
did
n’t
know
what
to
do
and
I
would
get
a
call
back
in
15
minutes
with
a
fix
.
The
person
from
day
two
calls
me
,
and
says
that
actually
they
need
the
original
form
and
that
everything
I
had
been
told
up
to
then
was
wrong
.
Fax
and
email
is
n’t
valid
according
to
them
.
Still
ca
n’t
sell
,
it
’s
going
to
take
days
for
the
form
to
make
it
through
the
mail
,
and
I
just
have
to
hope
the
market
does
n’t
move
against
me
.
How
can
they
get
away
with
giving
me
so
much
incorrect
info
and
exposing
me
to
so
much
market
risk
as
a
result
?
!
?
Avoid
them
,
they
have
no
idea
what
they
are
doing
.

That
's
brutal
.
I
think
most
brokers
sell
on
multiple
exchanges
so
I
do
n't
think
you
're
locked
into
BMO
.
I
know
that
people
on
this
sub
love
questtrade
but
I
'm
not
sure
how
their
customer
is
.
