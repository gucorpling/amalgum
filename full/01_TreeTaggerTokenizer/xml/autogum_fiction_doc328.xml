CHAPTER

THE
PANEL
OF
LIGHT
</head>
<p>
The
lids
of
the
girl
's
eyes
lifted
slowly
,
and
she
stared
at
the
panel
of
light
in
the
wall
.
Just
at
the
outset
,
the
act
of
seeing
made
not
the
least
impression
on
her
numbed
brain
.
For
a
long
time
she
continued
to
regard
the
dim
illumination
in
the
wall
with
the
same
passive
fixity
of
gaze
.
Apathy
still
lay
upon
her
crushed
spirit
.
In
a
vague
way
,
she
realized
her
own
inertness
,
and
rested
in
it
gratefully
,
subtly
fearful
lest
she
again
arouse
to
the
full
horror
of
her
plight
.
In
a
curious
subconscious
fashion
,
she
was
striving
to
hold
on
to
this
deadness
of
sensation
,
thus
to
win
a
little
respite
from
the
torture
that
had
exhausted
her
soul
.
</p>
<p>
Of
a
sudden
,
her
eyes
noted
the
black
lines
that
lay
across
the
panel
of
light
.
And
,
in
that
instant
,
her
spirit
was
quickened
once
again
.
The
clouds
lifted
from
her
brain
.
Vision
was
clear
now
.
Understanding
seized
the
full
import
of
this
hideous
thing
on
which
she
looked
...
.
For
the
panel
of
light
was
a
window
,
set
high
within
a
wall
of
stone
.
The
rigid
lines
of
black
that
crossed
it
were
bars
--
prison
bars
.
It
was
still
true
,
then
:
She
was
in
a
cell
of
the
Tombs
.
</p>
<p>
The
girl
,
crouching
miserably
on
the
narrow
bed
,
maintained
her
fixed
watching
of
the
window
--
that
window
which
was
a
symbol
of
her
utter
despair
.
Again
,
agony
wrenched
within
her
.
She
did
not
weep
:
long
ago
she
had
exhausted
the
relief
of
tears
.
She
did
not
pace
to
and
fro
in
the
comfort
of
physical
movement
with
which
the
caged
beast
finds
a
mocking
imitation
of
liberty
:
long
ago
,
her
physical
vigors
had
been
drained
under
stress
of
anguish
.
Now
,
she
was
well-nigh
incapable
of
any
bodily
activity
.
There
came
not
even
so
much
as
the
feeblest
moan
from
her
lips
.
The
torment
was
far
too
racking
for
such
futile
fashion
of
lamentation
.
She
merely
sat
there
in
a
posture
of
collapse
.
To
all
outward
seeming
,
nerveless
,
emotionless
,
an
abject
creature
.
Even
the
eyes
,
which
held
so
fixedly
their
gaze
on
the
window
,
were
quite
expressionless
.
Over
them
lay
a
film
,
like
that
which
veils
the
eyes
of
some
dead
thing
.
Only
an
occasional
languid
motion
of
the
lids
revealed
the
life
that
remained
.
</p>
<p>
So
still
the
body
.
Within
the
soul
,
fury
raged
uncontrolled
.
For
all
the
desolate
calm
of
outer
seeming
,
the
tragedy
of
her
fate
was
being
acted
with
frightful
vividness
there
in
memory
.
In
that
dreadful
remembrance
,
her
spirit
was
rent
asunder
anew
by
realization
of
that
which
had
become
her
portion
...
.
It
was
then
,
as
once
again
the
horrible
injustice
of
her
fate
racked
consciousness
with
its
tortures
,
that
the
seeds
of
revolt
were
implanted
in
her
heart
.
The
thought
of
revenge
gave
to
her
the
first
meager
gleam
of
comfort
that
had
lightened
her
moods
through
many
miserable
days
and
nights
.
Those
seeds
of
revolt
were
to
be
nourished
well
,
were
to
grow
into
their
flower
--
a
poison
flower
,
developed
through
the
three
years
of
convict
life
to
which
the
judge
had
sentenced
her
.
</p>
<p>
The
girl
was
appalled
by
the
mercilessness
of
a
destiny
that
had
so
outraged
right
.
She
was
wholly
innocent
of
having
done
any
wrong
.
She
had
struggled
through
years
of
privation
to
keep
herself
clean
and
wholesome
,
worthy
of
those
gentlefolk
from
whom
she
drew
her
blood
.
And
earnest
effort
had
ended
at
last
under
an
overwhelming
accusation
--
false
,
yet
none
the
less
fatal
to
her
.
This
accusation
,
after
soul-wearying
delays
,
had
culminated
to-day
in
conviction
.
The
sentence
of
the
court
had
been
imposed
upon
her
:
that
for
three
years
she
should
be
imprisoned
...
.
This
,
despite
her
innocence
.
She
had
endured
much
--
miserably
much
!
--
for
honesty
's
sake
.
There
wrought
the
irony
of
fate
.
She
had
endured
bravely
for
honesty
's
sake
.
And
the
end
of
it
all
was
shame
unutterable
.
There
was
nought
left
her
save
a
wild
dream
of
revenge
against
the
world
that
had
martyrized
her
.
“
Vengeance
is
mine
.
I
will
repay
,
saith
the
Lord
.
”
...
The
admonition
could
not
touch
her
now
.
Why
should
she
care
for
the
decrees
of
a
God
who
had
abandoned
her
!
</p>
<p>
There
had
been
nothing
in
the
life
of
Mary
Turner
,
before
the
catastrophe
came
,
to
distinguish
it
from
many
another
.
Its
most
significant
details
were
of
a
sordid
kind
,
familiar
to
poverty
.
Her
father
had
been
an
unsuccessful
man
,
as
success
is
esteemed
by
this
generation
of
Mammon-worshipers
.
He
was
a
gentleman
,
but
the
trivial
fact
is
of
small
avail
to-day
.
He
was
of
good
birth
,
and
he
was
the
possessor
of
an
inherited
competence
.
He
had
,
as
well
,
intelligence
,
but
it
was
not
of
a
financial
sort
.
