Even
before
the
fall
of
Saddam
in
2003
,
Iran
reinterpreted
the
basically
pragmatic
cooperation
in
the
field
of
intelligence
and
security
.
Ever
since
Syria
was
part
of
a
so
called
&quot;
axis
of
resistance
&quot;
consisting
of
Iran
,
Syria
,
Hezbollah
,
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Hamas">
Hamas
</ref>
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic%20Jihad%20Organization">
Islamic
Jihad
</ref>
,
the
sole
common
strategic
denominator
of
these
different
actors
is
hostility
against
Israel
,
which
is
always
depicted
as
an
aggressor
against
whom
the
Muslims
should
resist
—
hence
,
the
[
designation
as
an
]
&quot;
axis
of
resistance
&quot;
.
Of
course
,
forming
an
alliance
'
officially
against
Israel
'
serves
another
purpose
too
:
to
take
a
stand
against
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia">
Saudi
Arabia
</ref>
without
naming
it
.
Much
of
the
current
crisis
in
Syria
has
to
do
with
this
scheme
.

that

a

the

countries

economic

political
,

military
cooperation

In
more
recent

,
Iran

have
self-identified
as

axis
of
resistance
against
Israeli
–
American
involvement
in
the
region

Despite
this
,
Iran
initially
mostly
followed
the
Russian
lead
in
the

However
as

regional
players
—
such
as
Israel
and
Saudi
Arabia
,
as
well
as
extra-regional
players
such
as
the
United
States
—
began
to
see
,
and
articulate
the
weakening
of
,
the
Assad
regime
as
a
first
step
to
the
weakening
of
Iran
,
this
enhanced
Iran
's
threat
perception
,
and
gave
it
[

incentive
for
further
involvement
in
support

Do
you

Iranian

a
way
of
standing

UN

No.

As
has
become
evident
in
the
past
few
weeks
,
the
primary
interactive
dynamic
regarding
the
Syrian
imbroglio
is
being
played
out
mostly
in
terms
of
US

Russian
rivalry
;
and
,
Iran
is
following
the
Russian
lead

The
UN
has
&quot;
overwhelmingly
&quot;
confirmed
use
of
chemical
weapons
in
Syria
.
Do
you
think
both
sides
have
used
chemical
weapons
?

It
is
undeniable
that
chemical
weapons
were
used
in
Syria
.
But
,
I
have
not
yet
seen
conclusive
evidence
for
the
responsibility
of
the
use
of
chemical
gas
by
one
side
or
another
.
Until
valid
evidence
is
made
available
—
proving
who
used
chemical
weapons
—
affixing
blame
to
either
the
government
forces
,
or
to
one
of
the
fractious
rebel
groups
,
is
only
a
matter
of
speculation
.

I
remain
skeptical
that
anyone
other
than
the
Syrian
government
used
chemical
weapons
.
It
is
widely
accepted
that
the
Syrian
government
was
behind
the
use
of
chemical
weapons
