Marsabit
is
on
a
plateau
that
rises
above
the
surrounding
rocky
plains
.
There
is
increased
rainfall
here
so
the
area
is
very
green
compared
to
the
surrounding
desert
.
Marsabit
National
Reserve
is
meant
to
protect
part
of
this
forest
and
large
herds
of
elephants
can
be
seen
around
the
crater
lakes
in
the
park
--
definitely
worth
seeing
.
Also
,
short
hikes
from
the
center
of
town
to
the
two
hills
with
visible
towers
give
panoramic
views
of
the
countryside
.

A
ride
in
the
cab
of
a
truck
can
cost
around
US$
20
.
Most
trucks
do
a
two-day
drive
to
<ref target="Nairobi">
Nairobi
</ref>
with
an
overnight
stop
in
Isiolo
.
There
is
also
a
bus
that
leaves
early
in
the
morning
every
few
days
from
infront
of
the
Modern
Hotel
.
A
seat
is
Ksh
1000
and
should
be
bought
the
night
before
if
possible
because
it
seems
to
fill
up
fast
.
Be
ready
for
you
pack
to
be
tied
ontop
of
the
bus
.
The
road
to
Isiolo
is
unpaved
and
very
bumpy
.
Also
there
are
rumors
of
bandits
along
the
stretch
just
before
reaching

Police
also
stop
the
bus
at
every
check
point
and
often
demand
bribes
.
