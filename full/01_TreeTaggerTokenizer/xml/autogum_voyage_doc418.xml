(

is
the
capital
city
of
<ref target="Chechnya">
Chechnya
</ref>
.
Since
2009
—
the
end
of
the
Second
Chechen
War
—
Grozny
has
undergone
a
renaissance
in
development
and
many
abandoned
or
low-quality
apartments
and
houses
demolished
and
replaced
with
newer
re-built
apartment
buildings
and
suburbs
.
Grozny
was
built
as
a
Russian
fort
.
Throughout
1994
and
the
early
2000s
the
city
underwent
chaos
as
Russian
military
battled
Chechen
rebels
.
</p>
<head>
Understand
</head>
<p>
Grozny
was
founded
in
1818
as
a
Russian
fort
.
It
was
a
major
stronghold
for
the
Russians
during
the
Caucasian
Wars
during
1818-1864
.
During
the
early
20th
century
,
population
boomed
because
of
the
city
's
rich
oil
reserves
which
drove
many
Russians
from
other
parts
of
the
country
to
work
in
the
city
.
</p>
<p>
During
World
War
II
,
Josef
Stalin
accused
the
Chechen
people
as
a
whole
with
working
with
the
Nazis
to
overthrow
the
Soviet
government
.
The
Chechens
were
labeled
as
a
&quot;
traitor
people
&quot;
.
It
was
decided
to
deport
all
Chechens
and
Ingushis
from
the
then
Chechen-Ingush
Autonomous
Republic
into
exile
in
Central
Asia
.
The
republic
was
abolished
and
re-peopled
with
settlers
from
other
parts
of
the
Soviet
Union
:
neighbouring
North
Ossetia
,
South
Ossetia
and
Dagestan
,
Central
Russia
,
Georgia
and
the
Ukraine
.
When
many
of
the
harsher
Stalin
's
policies
were
condemned
and
rolled
back
by
the
new
Soviet
leadership
after
1956
,
the
Chechen-Inglush
Autonomous
Republic
was
reinstated
and
Chechens
were
allowed
to
return
to
their
homeland
,
doubling
its
population
.
However
,
no
provisions
were
made
to
return
the
non-Chechen
newcomers
to
their
original
places
of
residence
or
to
compensate
returning
Chechens
for
homes
and
property
that
they
have
lost
,
much
of
it
now
in
hands
of
the
newcomers
.
This
and
the
experience
of
deportation
caused
bitter
resentment
between
Chechen
and
non-Chechen
population
of
the
Republic
.
Many
Chechens
with
no
means
to
subsist
in
the
countryside
anymore
settled
in
Grozny
,
which
has
been
an
industrial
city
with
predominantly
Russian
population
even
before
the
deportation
,
having
only
a
handful
of
Chechen
residents
up
until
then
.
</p>
<p>
In
the
1990s
,
rebels
began
to
form
groups
in
an
attempt
to
destroy
Russian
control
in
the
city
and
the
rest
of
Chechnya
.
The
government
lost
partial
control
and
the
city
was
dangerous
.
Peace
began
to
return
during
the
late
stages
of
the
war
in
the
2000s
,
and
the
government
is
beginning
to
reconstruct
the
city
.
</p>
<head>
Get
in
</head>
<p>
Because
Grozny
was
devastated
by
years
of
war
,
transportation
is
often
tricky
and
hard
as
much
of
Grozny
's
transportation
system
has
been
destroyed
.
However
,
since
reconstruction
began
,
it
's
possible
to
take
a
flight
to
the
city
or
use
a
train
,
bus
or
the
convenient
highway
system
.

For
Sep
2016
there
were
only
three
main
gateways
to
Grozny
by

:
the
Vnukovo
and
Domodedovo
Airports
in

<p>
A

train
departs

every
second

taking
two

.
Due
to
terrorist
threats
,
this

is

,
expect
delays
and
hassles
.
Also
,
there
is
a

<head>
By

<p>
Grozny
is
connected
to
the
rest
of
Russia
by
a
large
highway
system
.
The
P-308
,
P-307
and
M-29
highways
connect
the
city
to
other
cities
in
Russia
.
Keep
in

take

you

else
you

A

to
Grozny
and
other
cities
in
the
<ref target="North%20Caucasus">

so
remember
when
you

<head>
Get
around
</head>
<p>
It
's
very
difficult
to
get
around
Grozny
since
during
the
Siege
of
Grozny
the
tram
and
trolley
system
was
almost
destroyed
.
The
tram
is
not
expected
to
re-open
,
but
the
trolley
has
re-opened
.
The
trolley
still
has
not
fully
developed
,
so
it
's
best
to
use
a
car
in
the
city
.
There
is
a
(
religious
)
taxi
company
operating
in
the
city
called
Islam
,
which
uses
green-painted
cars
.

</head>
<p>
Because
of
the
regional
war
's
effect
on
the
economy
,
many
items
in
Grozny
are
cheap
.
Do
n't
expect
to
find
many
Western
essentials
you
can
find
in
stores
of
other
parts
of
the
country
.
Many
authentic
swords
and
daggers
can
be
bought
at
low
prices
.
There
is
a
flea
market
with
many
Chechen
and
Russian
merchants
.
Again
,
do
n't
expect
much
and
expect
to
find
some
bootleg
copies
of
well-known
products

Stay
safe
</head>
<p>
Grozny
has
only
partly
stabilized
enough
to
be
safe
for
travel
.
Take
extreme
caution
when
visiting
war-torn
areas
as
there
are
some
unexploded
land-mines
.
Rebels
often
take
tourists
as
hostages
,
so
try
to
blend
in
with
the
population
.
It
's
advised
<hi rend="italic">
not
</hi>
to
speak
Chechen
in
the
city
,
as
a
foreigner
speaking
the
language
will
attract
a
lot
of
unwanted
attention
.
If
you
plan
to
visit
Grozny
,
take
lots
of
precaution
.
