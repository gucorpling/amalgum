History
</head>
<p>
Glovertown
was
founded
as
&quot;
Bloody
Bay
&quot;
.
That
name
dated
back
to
the
18th
century
and
supposedly
it
referred
to
a
massacre
of
a
family
of
11
by
Beothuk
Aboriginals
that
were
living
in
the
area
at
the
time
.
The
town
was
renamed
Alexander
Bay
in
1894
.
During
1894
,
a
section
of
railway
was
being
built
in
the
area
.
A
few
years
later
the
town
was
renamed
&quot;
Glovertown
&quot;
,
after
Sir
John
Hawley
Glover
who
served
as
the
Governor
of
Newfoundland
from
1876
to
1881
and
from
1883
to
1885
.
</p>
<p>
The
first
settlers
of
Glovertown
appeared
in
the
early
19th
century
.
In
1845
,
12
people
lived
there
.
By
1857
there
were
only
10
and
by
1862
there
Glovertown
became
a
thriving
center
for
the
fishery
,
boat
building
and
lumbering
industries
.
</p>
<p>
In
1913
,
one
of
the
sawmills
at
Rosedale
exploded
and
six
people
were
killed
.
In
1946
there
was
a
fire
that
was
started
by
sparks
coming
from
a
passing
train
.
The
fire
destroyed
46
homes
.
Two
schools
,
several
businesses
and
390
km
²
of
timber
were
also
destroyed
during
the
fire
.
The
lumber
industry
has
never
recovered
from
this
loss
.
</p>
<p>
Eventually
people
from
Greenspond
,
Flat
Island
,
Bragg
's
Island
,
and
Gooseberry
Island
began
to
resettle
to
Glovertown
and
the
influx
of
new
people
brought
new
industries
to
the
town
,
including
dairy
and
construction
.
