At

In
early
1861
,
as
America
moved
closer
to
Civil
War
Wilson
and
Graves
returned
home
to
Long
Island
.
During
the
trip
home
,
they
thought
of
a
plan
to
stay
close
to
their
lovers
if
war
should
occur
,
since
both
men
had
stated
they
would
join
the
Union
Army
should
war
break
out
.
They
intended
to
enlist
in
the
same
regiment
as
their
men
,
but
in
different
companies
.
This
would
lessen
their
risk
of
discovery
,
while
still
being
close
to
their
lovers
.

In
1862
,
the
two
men
enlisted
in
the
new
regiment
being
formed
at
Camp
Cadwallader
,
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverly,_New_Jersey">
Beverly
,

</ref>
.
The
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24th_New_Jersey_Infantry_Regiment">
24th
New
Jersey
Infantry
Regiment
</ref>
was
mustered
into
Federal
service
on
September
16
,
1862
.
Wilson
and
Graves
enacted
their
plan
.
They
cut
their
hair
and
put
on
men
's
clothing
.
Graves
had
a
more
difficult
time
concealing
her
sex
than
Wilson
did
.
Wilson
was
described
as
having
a
&quot;
...
masculine
voice
&quot;
and
as
&quot;
tanned
and
smart
and
somewhat
educated
.

She
was
nineteen
at
the
time
.
</p>
<p>
Their
plan
worked
,
they
marched
and
trained
alongside
their
lovers
without
being
discovered
.
They
served
in
the
defense
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_D.C.">
Washington
D.C.
</ref>
until
December
1862
when
the
regiment
was
sent
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredericksburg,_Virginia">
Fredericksburg

</ref>
,
where
they
participated
in
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Fredericksburg">
Battle
of
Fredericksburg
</ref>
.
After
seeing
the
horrors
of
war
firsthand
,
both
women
viewed
their
service
in
a
more
serious
light
.
They
were
determined
to
continue
serving
,
not
because
of
their
lovers
,
but
because
they
felt
a
need
to
serve
their
country
.

the
regiment
fought
in
the

.
During
the
battle
,
Wilson
's
lover
was
seriously
wounded
.
After
the
battle
,
Wilson
took
care
and
watched
over
him
,
nearly
revealing
herself
.
Despite
Wilson
's
effort
,
her
lover
died
.
At
some
point
during
this
time
,
Graves
'
lover
was
also
killed
,
however
it
is
unknown
when
or
where
he
died
.

illness

.
While
there
Wilson
and
Graves
'
true
sex
was
discovered
.
Graves
recovered
first
and
was
discharged
,
parting
ways
with
Wilson
.
After
Wilson
was
discharged
she
became
a
ballet
dancer
with
the
Cairo
Theater
.
After
two
performances
she
quit
and
looked
for
another
regiment
to
join
,
feeling
the
need
to
serve
her
country
.
She
joined

During

second
assault
on

on

22
Wilson
was
wounded
in
battle
,
though
not
seriously
.
She
was
treated
without
her
true
sex
being
discovered
.
She
fully
recovered
and
continued
on
with
the
regiment
.
