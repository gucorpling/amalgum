Introduction
</head>
<p>
The
fifth-generation
(
5G
)
millimeter-wave
(
mm-Wave
)
frequency
range
,
also
referred
to
as
the
frequency
range
2
(
FR2
)
,
includes
the
band
between
24.25
and
52.6
GHz
.
For
the
5G
mm-Wave
wireless
applications
,
beamforming
antenna
system
is
essentially
needed
to
cope
with
high
free-space
path
loss
,
severe
multi-path
fading
,
and
possible
interference
management
for
improving
signal-to-noise
ratio
.
Two
approaches
are
possible
for
the
beamforming
system
realization
.
The
first
approach
is
phased-array
beamforming
system
.
It
can
provide
continuously
any-directional
beam-steering
capability
,
but
requires
sophisticated
beamforming
circuitry
comprising
precise
phase
shifters
,
variable
gain
blocks
,
and
switches
,
thus
it
inevitably
elevates
the
system
implementation
cost
and
complexity
.
On
the
other
hand
,
switched
beamforming
antenna
system
can
provide
discontinuous
discrete-directional
beam-steering
capability
,
but
with
much
less
hardware
complexity
and
easier
producibility
.
Thus
,
the
switched
beamforming
antenna
system
is
more
preferred
when
precise
and
continuous
beam
steering
function
is
not
necessarily
required
,
whereas
implementation
cost
and
producibility
are
of
more
importance
.
Passive
beamforming
matrices
such
as
Blass
matrix
,
Nolen
matrix
,
and
Butler
matrix
are
generally
adopted
for
the
switched
beamforming
antenna
system
.
Among
them
,
the
Butler
matrix
is
more
widely
used
due
to
its
wideband
characteristic
and
simple
structure
.
</p>
<p>
When
realizing
a
Butler
matrix
based
switched
beamforming
antenna
system
,
the
Butler
matrix
usually
occupies
a
much
larger
area
than
the
antenna
array
elements
.
Thus
,
minimizing
the
Butler
matrix
size
is
more
critical
for
the
overall
form
factor
minimization
.
Many
previous
works
have
been
reported
focusing
on
the
miniaturization
of
the
Butler
matrix
.
The
previous
techniques
can
be
categorized
into
a
single-layer
substrate
based
design
and
a
multi-layer
substrate
based
design
.
For
the
single-layer
substrate
designs
,
several
techniques
,
such
as
a
higher
characteristic
impedance
transmission
line
based
design
,
a
directional
coupler
employing
lumped
components
,
and
an
artificial
transmission
line
employing
quasi-lumped
elements
and
discontinuities
structure
,
were
effective
for
the
miniaturization
.
Nevertheless
,
since
the
Butler
matrix
and
the
antenna
elements
were
put
on
the
same
plane
,
the
spurious
radiation
leaking
from
the
Butler
matrix
toward
the
antenna
was
a
serious
issue
because
it
adversely
affected
the
total
radiation
pattern
.
</p>
<p>
The
multi-layer
substrate
design
approach
can
alleviate
the
spurious
radiation
issue
more
effectively
because
the
Butler
matrix
and
the
antenna
elements
are
placed
in
different
layers
.
In
addition
,
such
previous
multi-layer
designs
have
employed
further
miniaturization
techniques
,
such
as
the
suspended
stripline
,
dual
transmission
line
structure
in
a
multi-layer
structure
,
forward-wave
directional
coupler
,
modularized
multi-folded
structure
,
slot-directional
hybrid
coupler
,
and
dual-layer
substrate
integrated
waveguide
(
SIW
)
based
crossover
elimination
structure
.
Yet
,
it
should
be
noted
that
those
miniaturization
techniques
inevitably
lead
to
higher
implementation
cost
and
less
producibility
.
It
is
also
interesting
to
note
,
that
those
previous
works
have
utilized
only
the
same-property
homogenous
substrates
for
the
multiple
layers
.
</p>
<p>
In
this
work
,
we
propose
to
adopt
a
two-layer
hybrid
stackup
substrate
for
realizing
a
28-GHz
band
Butler
matrix
based
switched
beamforming
antenna
system
.
The
hybrid
two-layer
stackup
substrate
is
composed
of
two
dissimilar
layers
with
each
layer
having
optimal
electrical
properties
for
the
Butler
matrix
and
the
antenna
elements
.
Such
hybrid
stackup
substrate
based
design
approach
was
also
found
to
be
effective
for
performance
and
reliability
improvement
in
the
high-frequency
serial-link
applications
.
This
work
is
carried
out
to
achieve
the
overall
size
miniaturization
and
the
spurious
radiation
reduction
in
a
Butler
matrix
based
switched
beamforming
antenna
system
for
28-GHz
mm-Wave
5G
radio
applications
.
