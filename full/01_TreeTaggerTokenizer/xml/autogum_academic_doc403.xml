Introduction
</head>
<p>
Schizophrenia
is
a
severe
mental
illness
that
affects
about
one
percent
of
the
world
’s
population
.
The
patients
with
schizophrenia
are
characterized
with
cognitive
impairment
,
confusion
,
hallucinations
and
deterioration
of
social
function
.
It
is
noted
that
schizophrenia
leads
to
a
heavy
burden
on
the
patients
,
their
families
and
society
.
Substantial
efforts
have
been
devoted
to
elucidating
the
pathophysiology
of
schizophrenia
development
from
genetic
and
environmental
perspectives
,
as
well
as
gene-environment
interactions
.
Epidemiological
studies
have
suggested
that
urban
environments
could
increase
the
risk
of
schizophrenia
,
which
may
be
due
to
the
exposure
to
the
toxic
heavy
metals
(
THMs
)
in
the
environment
.
</p>
<p>
Chronic
exposure
to
THMs
impairs
numerous
biological
functions
and
results
in
a
series
of
health
problems
,
such
as
aberrant
immunological
responses
and
neuropathological
conditions
.
Moreover
,
it
has
been
reported
that
THMs
could
cause
oxidative
stress
and
subsequently
DNA
damage
,
lipid
peroxidation
and
protein
modification
,
which
play
a
role
in
the
pathogenesis
of
numerous
diseases
,
including
cancer
,
diabetes
,
neurological
disorders
and
chronic
inflammation
.
THMs
are
suggested
as
an
important
risk
factor
for
mental
diseases
since
they
cause
neurobehavioral
alterations
and
disrupt
dopamine
receptors
.
For
example
,
arsenic
(
As
)
-induced
neurotoxicity
has
been
reported
to
cause
compositional
changes
and
hyperphosphorylation
on
the
cytoskeletal
protein
,
leading
to
the
disintegration
of
the
cytoskeletal
framework
and
causing
neurodegenerative
diseases
.
An
animal
study
showed
lead
(
Pb
)
as
an
environmental
toxin
,
which
contributed
to
the
pathogenesis
of
schizophrenia
in
Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia
1
(
Disc1)-mutant
mice
.
Therefore
,
investigating
the
association
of
environmental
THM
exposure
with
the
risk
of
schizophrenia
via
a
reliable
epidemiological
study
is
worthwhile
.
</p>
<p>
The
serum
concentration
of
THMs
has
been
suggested
to
act
as
an
internal
indicator
of
their
intake
levels
,
reflecting
exposure
to
environmental
THMs
.
Changes
in
THM
concentrations
have
been
observed
in
peripheral
tissues
to
be
correlated
with
the
risk
of
schizophrenia
.
Although
multiple
studies
have
investigated
the
association
between
THMs
and
schizophrenia
,
the
results
remain
inconsistent
.
For
example
,
despite
supporting
evidence
both
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
for
the
association
between
Pb
and
schizophrenia
,
a
cross-sectional
study
among
a
Chinese
population
showed
no
significant
difference
in
the
concentration
of
Pb
between
patients
with
schizophrenia
and
healthy
controls
.
However
,
another
study
applying
a
very
similar
study
design
towards
the
same
sampling
region
resulted
in
a
significant
association
.
The
reason
for
the
divergence
may
be
related
to
the
choice
of
the
population
,
such
as
whether
the
schizophrenic
patients
have
received
antipsychotics
drug
during
the
time
of
study
.
A
previous
study
has
compared
serum
cadmium
(
Cd
)
concentration
between
healthy
controls
and
schizophrenia
patients
with
or
without
treatment
.
The
serum
concentration
of
Cd
in
patients
after
treatment
was
significantly
higher
than
that
of
the
healthy
controls
but
no
significant
change
was
observed
from
the
pre-treatment
patients
.
The
concentration
of
antimony
and
uranium
were
also
found
significantly
different
between
pre-treatment
patients
and
post-treatment
patients
of
schizophrenia
.
</p>
<p>
Although
several
studies
have
investigated
the
association
between
THMs
and
schizophrenia
,
the
potential
mechanisms
which
could
link
THMs
and
schizophrenia
have
not
been
elucidated
.
Recent
studies
have
suggested
metabolic
syndrome
as
a
risk
factor
of
schizophrenia
,
attributed
to
poor
dietary
habits
,
unhealthy
lifestyle
and
physical
inactivity
of
the
patients
and
side-effects
of
the
second
generation-antipsychotics
.
On
the
other
hand
,
THMs
such
as
As
and
Pb
were
found
to
be
associated
with
metabolic
diseases
,
suggesting
a
role
of
abnormal
metabolisms
in
linking
THMs
and
schizophrenia
.
</p>
<p>
Therefore
,
we
performed
a
case-control
study
with
first-episode
and
drug-naïve
schizophrenia
patients
and
healthy
controls
to
identify
the
association
between
serum
concentrations
of
the
4
THMs
(
i.
e.
,
Cr
,
Cd
,
Pb
and
As
,
selected
as
commonly
surveyed
heavy
metals
in
schizophrenia
studies
)
and
the
risk
of
schizophrenia
.
The
correlations
between
the
4
THMs
and
multiple
metabolic
biomarkers
were
also
tested
to
explore
the
potential
metabolisms
associated
between
these
THMs
and
schizophrenia
.
Furthermore
,
meta-analysis
was
conducted
to
comprehensively
summarize
the
association
between
the
4
individual
THMs
and
the
risk
of
schizophrenia
.
