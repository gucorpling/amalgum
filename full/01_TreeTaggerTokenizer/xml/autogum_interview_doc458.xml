Did
Tyra
encourage
a
certain
standard
among
the
girls
(
weight
or
otherwise
)
that
was
unhealthy
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
WC
:
</hi>
Not
at
all
.
I
think
that
viewers
think
that
we
have
a
whole
lot
more
interaction
with
Tyra
than
we
actually
do
.
We
only
really
saw
her
during
panel
and
during
our
&quot;
interventions
.

Do
you
think
Tyra
still
believes
her
show
is
about
finding
&quot;
the
next
top
model
&quot;
even
though
none
of
the
show
's
winners
have
had
that
success
?

<p>

That
is
a
phenomenal
question
.
I
do
n't
think
that
the
show
gives
its
winners
enough
time
to
reign
.
The
show
puts
out
two
cycles
a
year
.
While
one
cycle
is
airing
,
they
are
taping
another
and
apparently
the
show
is
scheduled
to
continue
until
2010
!
I
think
it
was
about
finding
a
&quot;
Top
Model
&quot;
during
the
show
's
beginnings
,
but
I
think
that
Ã¼ber-success
of
the
show
has
turned
it
into
a
profit-driven
production
.
I
just
wish
that
the
show
would
put
more
time
and
cultivation
into
their
winners
even
<hi rend="italic">
after
</hi>
their
cycle
's
conclusions
.
And
I
truly
think
that
the
show
would
see
a
return
on
cultivating
their
winners
,
because
the
show
's
credibility
would
increase
.

A
fan
wrote
in
to
ask
,
&quot;
What
struggles
did
you
face
on
the
show
as
a
plus
sized
model
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
WC
:
</hi>
I
think
that
my
biggest
struggle
was
realizing
that
plus
sized
models
and
straight
sized
models
are
apples
and
oranges
...
I
could
n't
study
magazines
and
try
to
develop
my
poses
,
because
a
woman
who
weighs
110
pounds
and
is
5'10
&quot;
looks
completely
different
when
she
shapes
and
curves
her
body
than
a
woman
who
is
5'10
&quot;
and
weighs
175
pounds
.
I
,
therefore
,
had
to
figure
things
out
as
I
went
along
.
The
other
girls
had
a
reference/vantage
point
to
learn
from
.
I
'm
still
figuring
things
out
.

Do
you
think
it
was
unfair
for
Tyra
to
ask
that
[
studying
magazines
and
developing
your
poses
]
of
you
and
Diana
,
considering
that
even
though
she
's
fuller-figured
now
,
she
has
a
lot
more
experience
under
her
belt
than
you
two
did
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
WC
:
</hi>
Well
,
you
know
,
I
would
say
that
it
would
have
been
fair
if
there
were
magazines
for
us
to
study
!
But
there
were
none
.
That
's
why
I
think
that
it
's
so
important
that
publications
like
Plus
Model
Magazine
continue
to
blossom
and
flourish
.
I
've
learned
more
reading
that
magazine
and
getting
to
know
the
folks
who
write
for
that
magazine
than
I
ever
learned
about
being
a
plus-sized
model
on
ANTM
.
P.S.
I
'll
be
gracing
the
cover
of
that
magazine
in
January
of
'
08
.
Look
out
for
me
.

It
sounds
like
you
're
doing
just
fine
for
yourself
.
Which
one
fan
also
asked
,
&quot;
Have
you
faced
adversity
about
your
weight
since
being
on
the
show
?
