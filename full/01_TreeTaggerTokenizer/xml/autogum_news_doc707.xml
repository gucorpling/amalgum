Brockie
's
career
stretches

He

students
formed
what
they
dubbed
&quot;
Earth
's
only
openly
extra-terrestrial
rock
band
&quot;
,
growing
famous
for
satirical
and
obscene
lyrical
themes
,
and
live
shows
featuring
the
defilement
of
effigies
and
plenty
of
fake
blood

it
's
hard
to
envision
their
saga
going
further
&quot;
after
Brockie
's
death
.

<p>
The
band
ran
with
the
backstory
of
crashing
to
&quot;
the
most
insignificant
planet
in
the
universe
&quot;
43
million
years
ago
before
creating
humans
by
having
sex
with
apes
.
Becoming
encased
with
ice
,
the
legend
ran
that
upon
thawing
out
in
1984
the
members
decided
to
form
a
band
