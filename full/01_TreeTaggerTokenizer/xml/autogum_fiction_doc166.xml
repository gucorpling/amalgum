CHAPTER
XVII
RETIRING
FROM
THE
SHOW-BUSINESS
</head>
<p>
Megaphones
were
constructed
out
of
heavy
wrapping-paper
,
and
Penrod
,
Sam
,
and
Herman
set
out
in
different
directions
,
delivering
vocally
the
inflammatory
proclamation
of
the
poster
to
a
large
section
of
the
residential
quarter
,
and
leaving
Roderick
Magsworth
Bitts
,
Junior
,
with
Verman
in
the
loft
,
shielded
from
all
deadhead
eyes
.
Upon
the
return
of
the
heralds
,
the
Schofield
and
Williams
Military
Band
played
deafeningly
,
and
an
awakened
public
once
more
thronged
to
fill
the
coffers
of
the
firm
.
</p>
<p>
Prosperity
smiled
again
.
The
very
first
audience
after
the
acquisition
of
Roderick
was
larger
than
the
largest
of
the
morning
.
Master
Bitts
--
the
only
exhibit
placed
upon
a
box
--
was
a
supercurio
.
All
eyes
fastened
upon
him
and
remained
,
hungrily
feasting
,
throughout
Penrod
's
luminous
oration
.
</p>
<p>
But
the
glory
of
one
light
must
ever
be
the
dimming
of
another
.
We
dwell
in
a
vale
of
seesaws
--
and
cobwebs
spin
fastest
upon
laurel
.
Verman
,
the
tattooed
wild
boy
,
speaking
only
in
his
native
foreign
languages
,
Verman
the
gay
,
Verman
the
caperer
,
capered
no
more
;
he
chuckled
no
more
,
he
beckoned
no
more
,
nor
tapped
his
chest
,
nor
wreathed
his
idolatrous
face
in
smiles
.
Gone
,
all
gone
,
were
his
little
artifices
for
attracting
the
general
attention
to
himself
;
gone
was
every
engaging
mannerism
which
had
endeared
him
to
the
mercurial
public
.
He
squatted
against
the
wall
and
glowered
at
the
new
sensation
.
It
was
the
old
story
--
the
old
,
old
story
of
too
much
temperament
:
Verman
was
suffering
from
artistic
jealousy
.
</p>
<p>
The
second
audience
contained
a
cash-paying
adult
,
a
spectacled
young
man
whose
poignant
attention
was
very
flattering
.
He
remained
after
the
lecture
,
and
put
a
few
questions
to
Roddy
,
which
were
answered
rather
confusedly
upon
promptings
from
Penrod
.
The
young
man
went
away
without
having
stated
the
object
of
his
interrogations
,
but
it
became
quite
plain
,
later
in
the
day
.
This
same
object
caused
the
spectacled
young
man
to
make
several
brief
but
stimulating
calls
directly
after
leaving
the
Schofield
and
Williams
Big
Show
,
and
the
consequences
thereof
loitered
not
by
the
wayside
.
</p>
<p>
The
Big
Show
was
at
high
tide
.
Not
only
was
the
auditorium
filled
and
throbbing
;
there
was
an
indubitable
line
--
by
no
means
wholly
juvenile
--
waiting
for
admission
to
the
next
pufformance
.
A
group
stood
in
the
street
examining
the
poster
earnestly
as
it
glowed
in
the
long
,
slanting
rays
of
the
westward
sun
,
and
people
in
automobiles
and
other
vehicles
had
halted
wheel
in
the
street
to
read
the
message
so
piquantly
given
to
the
world
.
These
were
the
conditions
when
a
crested
victoria
arrived
at
a
gallop
,
and
a
large
,
chastely
magnificent
and
highly
flushed
woman
descended
,
and
progressed
across
the
yard
with
an
air
of
violence
.
</p>
<p>
At
sight
of
her
,
the
adults
of
the
waiting
line
hastily
disappeared
,
and
most
of
the
pausing
vehicles
moved
instantly
on
their
way
.
She
was
followed
by
a
stricken
man
in
livery
.
</p>
<p>
The
stairs
to
the
auditorium
were
narrow
and
steep
;
Mrs.
Roderick
Magsworth
Bitts
was
of
a
stout
favour
;
and
the
voice
of
Penrod
was
audible
during
the
ascent
.
</p>
<p>
“
RE-MEM-BUR
,
gentilmun
and
lay-deeze
,
each
and
all
are
now
gazing
upon
Roderick
Magsworth
Bitts
,
Junior
,
the
only
living
nephew
of
the
great
Rena
Magsworth
.
She
stuck
ars'nic
in
the
milk
of
eight
separate
and
distinck
people
to
put
in
their
coffee
and
each
and
all
of
'
em
died
.
The
great
ars'nic
murderess
,
Rena
Magsworth
,
gentilmun
and
lay-deeze
,
and
Roddy
's
her
only
living
nephew
.
She
's
a
relation
of
all
the
Bitts
family
,
but
he
's
her
one
and
only
living
nephew
.
RE-MEM-BUR
!
Next
July
she
's
goin
'
to
be
hung
,
and
,
each
and
all
,
you
now
see
before
you
--
--
”
</p>
<p>
Penrod
paused
abruptly
,
seeing
something
before
himself
--
the
august
and
awful
presence
which
filled
the
entryway
.
And
his
words
(
it
should
be
related
)
froze
upon
his
lips
.
</p>
<p>
Before
HERSELF
,
Mrs.
Roderick
Magsworth
Bitts
saw
her
son
--
her
scion
--
wearing
a
moustache
and
sideburns
of
blue
,
and
perched
upon
a
box
flanked
by
Sherman
and
Verman
,
the
Michigan
rats
,
the
Indian
dog
Duke
,
Herman
,
and
the
dog
part
alligator
.
</p>
<p>
Roddy
,
also
,
saw
something
before
himself
.
It
needed
no
prophet
to
read
the
countenance
of
the
dread
apparition
in
the
entryway
.
His
mouth
opened
--
remained
open
--
then
filled
to
capacity
with
a
calamitous
sound
of
grief
not
unmingled
with
apprehension
.
</p>
<p>
Penrod
's
reason
staggered
under
the
crisis
.
For
a
horrible
moment
he
saw
Mrs.
Roderick
Magsworth
Bitts
approaching
like
some
fatal
mountain
in
avalanche
.
She
seemed
to
grow
larger
and
redder
;
lightnings
played
about
her
head
;
he
had
a
vague
consciousness
of
the
audience
spraying
out
in
flight
,
of
the
squealings
,
tramplings
and
dispersals
of
a
stricken
field
.
The
mountain
was
close
upon
him
--
--
</p>
<p>
He
stood
by
the
open
mouth
of
the
hay-chute
which
went
through
the
floor
to
the
manger
below
.
Penrod
also
went
through
the
floor
.
He
propelled
himself
into
the
chute
and
shot
down
,
but
not
quite
to
the
manger
,
for
Mr.
Samuel
Williams
had
thoughtfully
stepped
into
the
chute
a
moment
in
advance
of
his
partner
.
Penrod
lit
upon
Sam
.
</p>
<p>
Catastrophic
noises
resounded
in
the
loft
;
volcanoes
seemed
to
romp
upon
the
stairway
.
</p>
<p>
There
ensued
a
period
when
only
a
shrill
keening
marked
the
passing
of
Roderick
as
he
was
borne
to
the
tumbril
.
Then
all
was
silence
.
</p>
<p>
.
.
.
Sunset
,
striking
through
a
western
window
,
rouged
the
walls
of
the
Schofields
'
library
,
where
gathered
a
joint
family
council
and
court
martial
of
four
--
Mrs
.
Schofield
,
Mr.
Schofield
,
and
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Williams
,
parents
of
Samuel
of
that
ilk
.
Mr.
Williams
read
aloud
a
conspicuous
passage
from
the
last
edition
of
the
evening
paper
:
