Tens
of
thousands
of
people
spilled
out
into
streets
after
Friday
prayers
today
,
chanting
slogans
like
&quot;
Down
,
down
with
Mubarak
&quot;
and
&quot;
The
people
want
the
regime
to
fall
&quot;
.
At

eighteen
people

Police

In

Mubarak
ordered
the
army
out

the
streets
to
help
quell
the
conflict

Meanwhile
,
according
to
media
reports
and
statistics
,
Egypt
has
shut
down
practically
all
Internet
traffic
both
out
of
and
into
the
nation
,
as
well
as
disrupting
cellphone
usage
.

website
shows
an
almost
vertical
drop
in
overall
Egypt
internet
traffic
,
starting
shortly
before
four
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
with
over
2.5
million
megabits
per
second
down
to
almost
zero
in
the
space
of
an
hour
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Almost
nobody
in
Egypt
has
Internet
connectivity
,
and
there
are
no
workarounds
.
I
’ve
never
seen
it
happen
at
this
scale
,
&quot;
said
the
chief
technology
officer
for
Renesys
,
a
company
that
tracks
Internet
traffic
.
&quot;
In
a
fundamental
sense
,
it
’s
as
if
you
rewrote
the
map
and
they
are
no
longer
a
country
.
I
never
thought
it
would
happen
to
a
country
the
size
and
scale
of
Egypt
.

<p>
Andrew
Noyes
,
spokesman
for
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Facebook">
Facebook
</ref>
,
noted
that
the
social
website
had
seen
almost
all
of
its
Egypt
traffic
disappear
and
there
is
only
a
&quot;
minimal
&quot;
amount
left
.
In
a
statement
,
Noyes
said
:
&quot;
Although
the
turmoil
in
Egypt
is
a
matter
for
the
Egyptian
people
and
their
government
to
resolve
,
limiting
Internet
access
for
millions
of
people
is
a
matter
of
concern
for
the
global
community
.

<p>
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Vodafone">
Vodafone

announced
on
its
website
that
&quot;
all
mobile
operators
in
Egypt
have
been
instructed
to
suspend
services
in
selected
areas
.
Under
Egyptian
legislation
the
authorities
have
the
right

issue
such
an
order
and
we
are
