Professor
Balandin
’s
research
interests
are
in
the
area
of
advanced
materials
,
nanostructures
and
nanodevices
for
electronics
,
optoelectronics
and
renewable
energy
conversion
.
He
conducts
both
experimental
and
theoretical
research
.
Balandin
and
coworkers
were
among
the
pioneers
of
the
field
of
phonon
engineering
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-2">

</ref>
In
1998
,
he
published
an
influential
paper
on
the
effects
of
phonon
spatial
confinement
on
thermal
conductivity
of
nanostructures
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-3">

(
where
the
term
“
phonon
engineering
”
likely
appeared
for
the
first
time
in
a
journal
publication
)
.
Phonon
engineering
finds
application
in
thermoelectric
energy
conversion
and
thermal
management
of
advanced
electronics
.
He
has
contributed
to
development
of
GaN
technology
by
investigating
heat
conduction
in
GaN
films
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-4">
[

</ref>
and

noise
in
GaN
devices
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-5">
[

He
advanced
ZnO
technology
by
studying
excitonic
effects
,
confined
phonon
and
optical
properties
of
wurtzite
nanostructures
.

In
2008
,
Balandin
’s
group
authored
a
highly
cited
paper
on
the
first
measurement
of
thermal
conductivity
of
suspended
graphene
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-7">
[

</ref>
In
order
to
perform
the
first
measurement
of
thermal
properties
of
graphene
,
Balandin
invented
a
new
optothermal
experiment
technique
based
on
Raman
spectroscopy
.
He
and
his
coworkers
explained
theoretically
why
the
intrinsic
thermal
conductivity
of
graphene
can
be
higher
than
that
of
bulk
graphite
,

and
demonstrated
experimentally
the
evolution
of
heat
conduction
when
the
system
dimensionality
changes
from
2D
(
graphene
)
to
3D
(
graphite
)
.

Balandin
’s

advanced
the
graphene
field
