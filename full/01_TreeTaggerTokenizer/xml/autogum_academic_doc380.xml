Introduction

<p>
In
a
railway
freight
system
,
commodities
can
be
divided
into
two
categories
:
bulk
commodities
(
e.
g.
,
coal
,
ore
,
oil
,
etc.
)
and
high
value-added
commodities
(
e.
g.
,
electronics
,
foods
,
etc.
)
.
The
transportation
of
bulk
commodities
is
generally
less
sensitive
to
shipping
time
but
concerned
more
with
shipping
costs
,
while
that
of
high
value-added
shipments
is
usually
concerned
with
shipping
time
and
punctuality
.
</p>
<p>
In
recent
years
,
with
the
government
control
of
carbon
emissions
,
some
goods
,
mostly
high
value-added
shipments
,
have
been
shifted
from
roads
to
railways
.
According
to
statistics
released
by
the
China
Railway
,
from
2015
to
2018
,
the
total
amount
of
freight
transported
by
railway
first
decreased
and
then
increased
,
while
the
number
of
high
value-added
shipments
continually
increased
.
The
growth
rates
of
high
value-added
shipments
transported
by
rail
were
18.7
%
,
25
%
,
9.3
%
and
2.3
%
from
2015
to
2018
,
respectively
.
</p>
<p>
High
value-added
shipments
are
strict
about
the
delivery
time
.
At
present
,
express
scheduled
freight
trains
are
mainly
formed
between
the
distribution
centers
with
large
freight
flows
,
such
as
the
China
Railway
Express
and
the
Yangtze
River
Express
.
However
,
it
is
not
economical
to
provide
express
trains
for
scattered
high
value-added
shipments
.
Therefore
,
how
to
deliver
these
scattered
shipments
quickly
is
an
urgent
problem
to
be
solved
.
This
paper
proposes
a
new
transportation
pattern
approach
,
namely
the
method
of
reserving
axle
loads
(
here
,
the
“
method
of
reserving
axle
loads
”
means
that
a
train
makes
room
at
the
departing
station
,
so
that
the
train
can
pick
up
some
wagons
at
other
stations
)
,
which
can
improve
the
delivery
speed
of
high
value-added
shipments
in
regions
without
express
train
services
as
well
as
attract
more
high
value-added
shipments
to
the
railway
.
</p>
<p>
The
main
work
and
innovation
points
of
this
paper
are
as
follows
:
</p>
<p>
(
i
)
A
method
using
long-distance
direct
trains
to
reserve
axle
loads
for
high
value-added
shipments
in
the
regions
without
express
train
service
is
proposed
.
</p>
<p>
(
ii
)
The
accumulation
cost
of
freight
cars
in
reclassification
yards
is
analyzed
and
deduced
in
detail
by
using
the
method
of
reserving
axle
loads
.
</p>
<p>
(
iii
)
Compared
to
the
traditional
method
,
the
whole
process
and
costs
of
railway
transportation
for
high
value-added
shipments
using
the
method
of
reserving
axle
loads
are
analyzed
.
</p>
<p>
(
iv
)
Aiming
at
minimizing
the
total
cost
of
the
whole
process
of
transportation
,
a
mathematical
model
for
the
high
value-added
shipments
in
regions
without
express
train
services
is
constructed
.
The
model
can
be
solved
in
four
scenarios
:
reserving
axle
loads
for
departing
;
reserving
axle
loads
for
arriving
;
reserving
axle
loads
for
both
departing
and
arriving
;
and
not
reserving
axle
loads
.
The
practicability
of
the
model
was
tested
by
two
numerical
examples
.
</p>
<p>
The
remainder
of
this
paper
is
organized
as
follows
.
Section
2
summarizes
the
literature
related
to
car-to-block
,
block-to-train
and
car-to-train
problems
.
Section
3
introduces
the
delivery
methods
of
general
trains
and
express
trains
and
puts
forward
the
method
of
using
the
long-distance
direct
train
to
transport
the
high
value-added
shipments
in
the
area
without
express
train
services
.
Section
4
analyzes
the
car-hours
saved
for
the
accumulation
process
of
freight
cars
in
a
classification
yard
under
the
approach
of
reserving
axle
loads
.
In
Section
5
,
a
mathematical
model
for
high
value-added
shipments
in
regions
without
express
train
services
according
to
the
method
of
reserving
axle
loads
is
proposed
.
The
results
of
two
numerical
examples
are
presented
in
Section
6
.
Finally
,
concluding
remarks
and
future
research
directions
are
given
in
Section
7
.
