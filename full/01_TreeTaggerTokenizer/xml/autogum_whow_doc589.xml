Stop
Feeling
Like
a
Self
</head>
<p>
In
many
Eastern
philosophies
,
it
has
been
said
that
the
cause
of
suffering
in
human
beings
is
the
Ego
,
also
known
as
Ahamkara
,
Identity
,
character
,
etc.
Desire
and
resistance
are
opposite
forms
of
attachment
,
and
the
misperception
of
our
true
nature
is
connected
to
&quot;
feeling
like
a
self
.
&quot;
&quot;
Feeling
like
a
self
&quot;
translates
to
a
term
known
as
Asmita
.
In
order
to
access
true
,
genuine
happiness
,
it
is
suggested
amongst
many
wise
scholars
that
human
beings
end
their
idea
of
selfhood
.

Acknowledge
that
you
are
a
Self
.
There
is
no
way
that
we
can
solve
our
problems
until
we
recognize
that
we
have
a
problem
.
So
,
it
is
best
to
first
admit
to
your
Self
that
sometimes
you
are
feeling
like
a
self
.
</item>
<item>
Identify
the
characteristics
of
your
Self
.
What
makes
you
feel
like
a
Self
?
What
are
the
qualities
?
Do
you
have
interests
?
Things
you
do
n't
like
?
Do
you
experience
sensations
?
Do
you
care
about
the
past
or
future
?
Do
you
have
positive
or
negative
opinions
about
things
?
Do
you
have
sight
,
hearing
,
taste
,
smell
,
feeling
?
All
of
these
sensations
are
qualities
of
Feeling
Like
a
Self
.
Do
you
have
labels
that
you
attach
to
things
?
When
you
label
something
,
you
make
it
different
from
your
Self
with
your
mind
.
So
,
it
is
like
the
backwards
tricky
way
of
feeling
like
a
self
.
It
's
like
being
able
to
tell
how
you
Do
n't
feel
like
a
self
.
If
you
make
something
Not
you
,
then
that
means
there
is
a
You
!
And
identifying
as
You
is
the
cause
of
suffering
.

Renounce
feeling
like
a
Self
.
Through
breath
control
,
aware
movement
,
and
decades
upon
decades
of
deep
meditation
,
begin
to
end
caring
about
your
Self
.
Think
often
upon
the
inner
true
nature
of
all
things
,
and
recognize
that
the
qualities
of
all
things
are
inherently
the
same
,
and
there
is
no
difference
between
you
,
me
,
or
anybody
else
.
Slowly
notice
your
desire
and
aversion
to
things
,
and
over
time
,
by
noticing
the
many
sensations
you
experience
daily
,
begin
to
renounce
your
reactions
to
stimulus
.
By
actively
engaging
in
this
practice
you
will
end
&quot;
feeling
like
a
self
&quot;
and
asmita
will
leave
your
experience
.
This
is
known
as
&quot;
coalescence
,
&quot;
or
a
glittery
shimmering
purification
of
your
consciousness
that
develops
in
pervading
throughout
all
things
,
dissolving
differentiation
.

Practice

Practice
makes
practice
!
And
the
harder
you
try
,
the
harder
you
will
get
better
at
it
.
This
is
cited
in
many
research
articles
and
scholarly
texts
!
Never
give
up

You
are
more
likely
to
stop
feeling
like
a
self
if
you
surround
yourself
with
a
community
of
people
who
are
also
actively
working
towards
not
feeling
like
a
self
!
You
are
also
more
likely
to
enjoy
your
experience
on
Earth
,
as
feeling
like
a
Self
is
said
to
be
the
root
of
all
suffering
.
