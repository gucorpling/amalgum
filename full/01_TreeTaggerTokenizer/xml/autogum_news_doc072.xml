22
bronze

of

.
&quot;
If
you
look
at
the
face
of
Mark
Antony
,
many
believed
he
had
this
cleft
on
his
chin
and
that
's
why
I
thought
this
could
be
Mark
Antony
,
&quot;
said
Hawass
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
In
my
opinion
,
if
this
tomb
is
found
,
it
will
be
one
of
the
most
important
discoveries
of
the
21st
century
because
of
the
love
between
Cleopatra
and
Mark
Antony
,
and
because
of
the
sad
story
of
their
death
.
This
is
the
perfect
place
for
them
to
be
hidden
,
&quot;
said
Hawass
.
</p>
<p>
Recently
,
outside
the
temple
colourful
mummies
of
nobles
were
excavated
at
a
neighbouring
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/necropolis">
necropolis
</ref>
.
These
discoveries
have
lead
the
archaeologists
to
believe
that
a
ruler
or
person
of
royalty
is
interred
within
the
temple
itself
.
It
was
the
practice
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Roman%20world">
Greco-Roman
era
</ref>
to
assemble
the
tombs
of
persons
of
status
and
other
high
ranking
officials
near
their
rulers
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
The
discovery
of
the
cemetery
this
week
really
convinced
me
that
there
is
someone
important
buried
inside
this
temple
.
No
one
would
be
buried
outside
a
temple
without
a
reason
.
We
saw
that
in
the
pharaonic
days
,
they
were
always
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient%20Egyptian%20burial%20customs">
buried
beside
pyramids
</ref>
,
&quot;
explained
Hawass
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
She
needed
a
place
to
be
protected
in
the
afterlife
.
If
she
had
used
the
other
burial
site
,
she
would
have
disappeared
forever
,
&quot;
said
Kathleen
Martinez
,
a
Dominican
archaeologist
.
She
feels
that
&quot;
it
could
be
Taposiris
Magna
because
it
was
the
most
sacred
temple
of
its
time
.
&quot;

<p>
Dr.
Roger
Vickers
team
used
radar
to
locate
three
chambers
within
the
rocky
hill
atop
of
which
is
the
Temple
of
Taposiris
Magna
dedicated
to
the
goddess
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isis">
Isis
</ref>
.
The
temple
was
constructed
about
300
BC
by
