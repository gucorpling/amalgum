CHAPTER
I
</head>
<p>
“
Such
a
charming
lady
in
a
grey
silk
dress
and
a
hand
as
white
as
snow
.
She
looked
at
me
through
such
funny
glasses
on
the
end
of
a
long
handle
.
A
very
great
lady
but
her
voice
was
as
kind
as
the
voice
of
a
saint
.
I
have
never
seen
anything
like
that
.
She
made
me
feel
so
timid
.
”
</p>
<p>
The
voice
uttering
these
words
was
the
voice
of
Therese
and
I
looked
at
her
from
a
bed
draped
heavily
in
brown
silk
curtains
fantastically
looped
up
from
ceiling
to
floor
.
The
glow
of
a
sunshiny
day
was
toned
down
by
closed
jalousies
to
a
mere
transparency
of
darkness
.
In
this
thin
medium
Therese
’s
form
appeared
flat
,
without
detail
,
as
if
cut
out
of
black
paper
.
It
glided
towards
the
window
and
with
a
click
and
a
scrape
let
in
the
full
flood
of
light
which
smote
my
aching
eyeballs
painfully
.
</p>
<p>
In
truth
all
that
night
had
been
the
abomination
of
desolation
to
me
.
After
wrestling
with
my
thoughts
,
if
the
acute
consciousness
of
a
woman
’s
existence
may
be
called
a
thought
,
I
had
apparently
dropped
off
to
sleep
only
to
go
on
wrestling
with
a
nightmare
,
a
senseless
and
terrifying
dream
of
being
in
bonds
which
,
even
after
waking
,
made
me
feel
powerless
in
all
my
limbs
.
I
lay
still
,
suffering
acutely
from
a
renewed
sense
of
existence
,
unable
to
lift
an
arm
,
and
wondering
why
I
was
not
at
sea
,
how
long
I
had
slept
,
how
long
Therese
had
been
talking
before
her
voice
had
reached
me
in
that
purgatory
of
hopeless
longing
and
unanswerable
questions
to
which
I
was
condemned
.
</p>
<p>
It
was
Therese
’s
habit
to
begin
talking
directly
she
entered
the
room
with
the
tray
of
morning
coffee
.
This
was
her
method
for
waking
me
up
.
I
generally
regained
the
consciousness
of
the
external
world
on
some
pious
phrase
asserting
the
spiritual
comfort
of
early
mass
,
or
on
angry
lamentations
about
the
unconscionable
rapacity
of
the
dealers
in
fish
and
vegetables
;
for
after
mass
it
was
Therese
’s
practice
to
do
the
marketing
for
the
house
.
As
a
matter
of
fact
the
necessity
of
having
to
pay
,
to
actually
give
money
to
people
,
infuriated
the
pious
Therese
.
But
the
matter
of
this
morning
’s
speech
was
so
extraordinary
that
it
might
have
been
the
prolongation
of
a
nightmare
:
a
man
in
bonds
having
to
listen
to
weird
and
unaccountable
speeches
against
which
,
he
does
n’t
know
why
,
his
very
soul
revolts
.
</p>
<p>
In
sober
truth
my
soul
remained
in
revolt
though
I
was
convinced
that
I
was
no
longer
dreaming
.
I
watched
Therese
coming
away
from
the
window
with
that
helpless
dread
a
man
bound
hand
and
foot
may
be
excused
to
feel
.
For
in
such
a
situation
even
the
absurd
may
appear
ominous
.
She
came
up
close
to
the
bed
and
folding
her
hands
meekly
in
front
of
her
turned
her
eyes
up
to
the
ceiling
.
</p>
<p>
“
If
I
had
been
her
daughter
she
could
n’t
have
spoken
more
softly
to
me
,
”
she
said
sentimentally
.
</p>
<p>
I
made
a
great
effort
to
speak
.
</p>
<p>
“
Mademoiselle
Therese
,
you
are
raving
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
She
addressed
me
as
Mademoiselle
,
too
,
so
nicely
.
I
was
struck
with
veneration
for
her
white
hair
but
her
face
,
believe
me
,
my
dear
young
Monsieur
,
has
not
so
many
wrinkles
as
mine
.
”
</p>
<p>
She
compressed
her
lips
with
an
angry
glance
at
me
as
if
I
could
help
her
wrinkles
,
then
she
sighed
.
</p>
<p>
“
God
sends
wrinkles
,
but
what
is
our
face
?
”
she
digressed
in
a
tone
of
great
humility
.
“
We
shall
have
glorious
faces
in
Paradise
.
But
meantime
God
has
permitted
me
to
preserve
a
smooth
heart
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Are
you
going
to
keep
on
like
this
much
longer
?
”
I
fairly
shouted
at
her
.
“
What
are
you
talking
about
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
am
talking
about
the
sweet
old
lady
who
came
in
a
carriage
.
Not
a
fiacre
.
I
can
tell
a
fiacre
.
In
a
little
carriage
shut
in
with
glass
all
in
front
.
I
suppose
she
is
very
rich
.
The
carriage
was
very
shiny
outside
and
all
beautiful
grey
stuff
inside
.
I
opened
the
door
to
her
myself
.
She
got
out
slowly
like
a
queen
.
I
was
struck
all
of
a
heap
.
Such
a
shiny
beautiful
little
carriage
.
There
were
blue
silk
tassels
inside
,
beautiful
silk
tassels
.
”
</p>
<p>
Obviously
Therese
had
been
very
much
impressed
by
a
brougham
,
though
she
did
n’t
know
the
name
for
it
.
Of
all
the
town
she
knew
nothing
but
the
streets
which
led
to
a
neighbouring
church
frequented
only
by
the
poorer
classes
and
the
humble
quarter
around
,
where
she
did
her
marketing
.
Besides
,
she
was
accustomed
to
glide
along
the
walls
with
her
eyes
cast
down
;
for
her
natural
boldness
would
never
show
itself
through
that
nun-like
mien
except
when
bargaining
,
if
only
on
a
matter
of
threepence
.
Such
a
turn-out
had
never
been
presented
to
her
notice
before
.
The
traffic
in
the
street
of
the
Consuls
was
mostly
pedestrian
and
far
from
fashionable
.
And
anyhow
Therese
never
looked
out
of
the
window
.
She
lurked
in
the
depths
of
the
house
like
some
kind
of
spider
that
shuns
attention
.
She
used
to
dart
at
one
from
some
dark
recesses
which
I
never
explored
.
</p>
<p>
Yet
it
seemed
to
me
that
she
exaggerated
her
raptures
for
some
reason
or
other
.
With
her
it
was
very
difficult
to
distinguish
between
craft
and
innocence
.
