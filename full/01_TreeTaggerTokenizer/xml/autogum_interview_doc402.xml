We
live
in
the
age
of
the
lazy
tendency
to
categorize
the
work
of
one
artist
against
another
,
and
Khan
has
had
endless
exultations
as
the
next

the
list
goes
on
until
it
is
almost
meaningless
as
comparison
does
little
justice
to
the
sound

vision

I

beyond

has
an
ancient

she

powerful

&quot;
It
was
a
surprise
that

I

everyone

I
'm
not
the
best
about
finishing
books
.
What
I
usually
do
is
I
will
get
into
a
book
for
a
period
of
time
,
and
then
I
will
dip
into
it
and
get
the
inspiration
and
transformation
in
my
mind
that
I
need
,
and
then
put
it
away
and
come
back
to
it
.
But
I
have
a
select
rotation
of
cool
books
,
like
