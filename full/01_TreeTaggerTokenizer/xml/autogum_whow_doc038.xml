Choosing
the
Artwork
</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Choose
artwork
with
cool
colors
.
Two
examples
of
cool
colors
are
blue
and
green
.
Warm
colors
such
as
red
,
yellow
and
orange
should
be
saved
for
rooms
where
you
want
a
more
inviting
atmosphere
,
such
as
your
living
room
.

Make
sure
the
artwork
is
simple
.
Pictures
of
flowers
and
other
landscapes
are
good
choices
.
Your
bedroom
should
be
calm
and
peaceful
,
and
you
're
most
likely
going
to
look
at
this
artwork
while
you
're
going
to
sleep
.

Consider
your
values
.
For
example
,
some
people
would
rather
not
have
a
gory
piece
of
artwork
in
their
room
,
and
some
would
.
What
you
choose
is
really
dependent
on
what
you
think
is
best
for
your
room
.
Artwork
can
be
a
very
personal
thing
,
so
buy
something
that
makes
you
feel
peaceful
and
relaxed
,
and
that
you
like
.

Consider
the
atmosphere
,
size
and
lighting
in
your
room
.
For
example
,
if
your
room
is
very
dark
,
then
you
may
or
may
not
want
artwork
that
is
very
dark
colored
in
your
room
.

Take
note
of
the
colors
of
certain
things
in
your
room
,
such
as
your
bedspread
and
carpet
.
Once
you
take
note
of
this
,
try
and
find
artwork
that
contrasts
with
the
colors
of
the
things
that
are
in
your
room
.

Decide
which
medium
you
prefer
.
When
most
people
think
of
artwork
,
they
think
of
pictures
,
posters
and
paintings
.
However
,
things
like
mini
sculptures
,
and
even
curtains
could
be
good
artwork
examples
too
.

Considering
Other
Things
in
Your
Room
</head>
<p>
Sometimes
,
you
may
not
think
about
it
,
but
other
things
in
your
room
can
be
considered
artwork
as
well
.

A
clean
room
can
also
help
evoke
a
peaceful
,
relaxing
mood
,
and
although
you
may
not
think
about
it
,
if
it
is
clean
enough
,
it
can
be
considered
artwork
itself
.

Consider
adding
a
few
accents
.
Accents
can
help
with
the
mood
in
a
bedroom
as
well
,
choose
items
such
as
a
vase
,
as
well
as
a
plant
to
go
inside
it
.
As
with
the
artwork
,
avoid
getting
the
vase
in
a
bright
color
,
as
your
bedroom
is
a
place
for
you
to
sleep
in
.

Have
a
style
in
your
room
for
the
furniture
.
Whether
it
is
shabby
chic
,
or
modern
,
your
room
is
where
you
can
be
you
.
So
,
choose
a
style
for
your
room
that
reflects
who
you
are
.

Consider
repainting
your
bedroom
walls
.
As
with
the
artwork
,
try
to
repaint
your
walls
a
cool
color
that
you
really
like
.
If
you
go
to
the
store
,
there
are
often
a
ton
of
choices
,
so
you
wo
n't
be
too
limited
when
deciding
.

Have
a
floor
that
contrasts
with
the
rest
of
your
room
.
Usually
,
although
it
may
stain
,
plain
white
is
a
good
option
,
but
pick
a
color
that
you
like
and
that
contrasts
with
the
rest
of
your
room
.

<item>
You
could
always
make
your
own
work
if
you
'd
like
.
This
can
sometimes
be
a
cheaper
option
,
as
some
art
supplies
can
be
found
at
craft
and
department
stores
for
very
low
prices
.
Also
,
you
will
have
total
control
over
what
goes
on
the
canvas
.
</item>
<item>
If
you
'd
rather
not
paint
your
walls
yourself
,
although
you
will
most
likely
have
to
pay
them
,
you
can
hire
a
professional
painter
that
will
do
your
walls
for
you
.
</item>
<item>
Try
not
to
have
a
carpet
that
matches
your
wall
colors
,
as
this
may
not
look
nice
.
For
example
,
if
your
walls
are
a
dark
green
color
,
then
try
not
to
have
a
dark
green
colored
carpet
.
</item>
<item>
If
you
have
a
lower
headboard
,
consider
securely
hanging
your
artwork
above
your
bed
.
This
way
,
especially
if
the
artwork
is
peaceful
,
you
will
see
the
artwork
as
you
are
going
to
get
into
your
bed
to
go
to
sleep
.
</item>
<item>
If
you
are
concerned
about
what
people
may
think
,
remember
that
a
lot
of
people
wo
n't
see
it
.
While
almost
everyone
who
comes
over
to
your
house
will
see
the
bathroom
,
a
very
little
amount
of
people
will
see
your
room
.

Try
to
buy
artwork
that
you
'll
want
to
have
for
a
while
.
Sometimes
,
artwork
can
be
very
hard
to
get
down
once
it
is
hung
up
,
so
keep
this
in
mind
when
you
are
choosing
things
for
your
room
.
</item>
<item>
If
you
're
a
child
or
teenager
,
have
your
parents
change
your
carpet
and
walls
if
you
want
them
changed
,
and
be
sure
to
ask
permission
before
hanging
up
artwork
.
