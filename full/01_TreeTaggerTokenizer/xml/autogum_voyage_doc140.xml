Makeni
is
the
main
provincial
town
in
the
North
of
Sierra
Leone
.
It
has
seen
rapid
development
in
the
last
few
years
because
of
its
proximity
to
the
major
mining
and
bio-fuel
production
areas
.

Eat
</head>
<p>
There
are
several
very
nice
places
to
eat
in
Makeni
.
Global
Restaurant
on
Magburaka
Road
offers
both
local
and
international
food
for
a
very
good
price
.
The
waitresses
are
extremely
friendly
and
appreciate
the
business
and
will
often
sit
and
chat
with
you
throughout
your
visit
.
</p>
<p>
If
you
're
looking
for
a
more
familiar
touch
,
you
must
go
to
The
Clubhouse
Bar
,
also
on
Magburaka
Road
.
This
is
a
bar
and
restaurant
operated
by
the
charity
Street
Child
of
Sierra
Leone
.
All
profits
are
used
for
Street
Child
projects
across
the
country
.
Whilst
prices
are
expensive
in
comparison
to
other
restaurants
around
Makeni
,
the
food
is
very
good
and
it
is
one
of
the
few
air
conditioned
buildings
in
Makeni
.
At
the
Clubhouse
you
have
the
choice
of
sitting
outside
under
one
of
two
large
awnings
in
the
courtyard
,
or
sit
inside
in
the
main
area
of
the
restaurant
.
Most
of
the
time
,
it
is
quiet
enough
that
you
will
have
full
control
over
the
television
and
AC
,
meaning
that
you
can
watch
the
news
during
your
lunch
or
take
in
a
football
match
with
your
friends
.
It
also
has
become
a
popular
hangout
area
for
young
volunteers
from
abroad
,
so
there
is
usually
a
very
good
vibe
around
the
place
.
</p>
<p>
In
the
centre
of
town
,
near
the
Clock
Tower
,
there
are
several
food
stalls
offering
all
kinds
of
food
.
Popular
choices
are
the
bread
and
meat
skewer
stations
.
You
can
buy
a
loaf
of
bread
and
5
skewers
of
meat
for
about
Le
6,000
,
or
under
£1
,
and
make
a
delicious
meat
sandwich
which
will
fill
you
up
for
hours
.
There
are
also
several
fruit
stalls
offering
seasonal
produce
throughout
the
day
and
night
.
