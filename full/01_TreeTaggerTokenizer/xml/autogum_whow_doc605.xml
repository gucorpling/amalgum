Face
Your
Shadow
</head>
In
Jungian
psychology
,
the
&quot;
Shadow
&quot;
is
an
archetype
that
represents
the
unconscious
&quot;
dark
side
&quot;
of
an
individual
or
group
.
This
side
is
often
composed
of
repressed
,
disowned
,
unrecognized
,
or
unexpressed
needs
,
feelings
,
and
personality
traits
.
Sometimes
,
in
the
process
of
stuffing
things
away
(
to
either
cope
with
a
trauma
or
become
more
acceptable
to
others
)
,
we
bury
positive
things
about
ourselves
as
well
as
negative
-
like
a
talent
,
etc.
The
longer
we
continue
to
repress
or
refuse
to
acknowledge
or
integrate
this
side
into
our
conscious
ego
,
the
meaner
it
gets
.
From
there
,
it
begins
to
affect
our
relationships
with
others
by
causing
us
to
project
our
negative
(
or
even
positive
)
qualities
onto
them
.
The
&quot;
Shadow
&quot;
is
similar
to
the
&quot;
id
&quot;
in
Sigmund
Freud
's
model
of
the
psyche
.

&quot;
epitome

in
society

Shadow
Work
is
n't
easy
and
you
may
feel
very
uncomfortable
with
what
you
find
lurking
there
.
The
more
you
resist
accepting
that
it
is
a
part
of
you
,
the
stronger
and
longer
'
it
'
will
fight
with
you
.
</item>
<item>
Individuals
with
certain
&quot;
high
conflict
&quot;
personality
disorders
are
prone
to
projection
and
will
often
accuse
their
targets
of
the
same
.
Everyone
projects
to
some
degree
,
but
a
disordered
mind
usually
wo
n't
take
any
steps
to
integrate
their
Shadow
as
they
're
content
to
let
others
to
carry
that
baggage
for
them
.
