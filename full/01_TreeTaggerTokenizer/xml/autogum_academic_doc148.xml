Analytic
Network
Process
Approach
</head>
<p>
In
this
paper
we
consider
the
use
of
a
multiple
criteria
decision
analysis
method
to
rank
all
the
locations
potentially
suitable
for
siting
a
freight
lorry
parking
.
</p>
<p>
In
line
with
objective
RO.1
,
the
first
subsection
deals
with
the
analysis
of
the
stakeholders
and
their
objectives
.
The
main
task
here
is
to
identify
the
relationships
between
different
classes
of
stakeholders
and
the
issues
they
care
about
most
,
as
these
will
constitute
the
basic
elements
in
developing
our
Spatial
Decision
Support
System
.
Following
such
analyses
,
and
consistently
with
research
objective
R0.2
,
we
explore
the
possible
use
of
ANP
as
a
suitable
model
component
for
our
SDSS
.
Although
we
first
also
considered
using
the
Analytic
Hierarchy
Process
(
AHP
)
method
,
we
soon
realised
that
the
complexity
of
the
problem
rendered
this
method
unsuitable
.
The
characteristics
of
this
problem
cannot
in
fact
be
hierarchically
represented
,
as
it
involves
logical
interconnections
between
elements
in
a
complicated
dependency
structure
that
allows
elements
on
different
levels
to
influence
each
other
.
Moreover
,
a
purely
hierarchical
model
cannot
encompass
the
case
of
alternatives
potentially
influencing
the
weights
associated
to
the
criteria
.
Since
in
the
lorry
parking
location
problem
the
elements
influencing
the
decision-making
process
turn
out
to
be
highly
interconnected
,
the
Analytic
Network
Process
(
ANP
)
permits
to
model
the
problem
in
a
more
complete
way
by
controlling
and
estimating
all
the
element
interconnections
.
That
is
possible
because
ANP
is
able
to
generalise
the
AHP
approach
by
allowing
the
presence
of
any
type
of
possible
mutual
influences
among
the
elements
.
In
the
ANP
method
,
the
problem
is
structured
as
a
network
,
and
its
elements
are
evaluated
through
a
pairwise
comparisons
approach
to
measure
their
weights
in
the
model
,
which
,
after
some
matrix
calculations
,
allows
ranking
of
the
alternatives
considered
in
the
problem
.
A
detailed
description
of
the
proposed
ANP
method
is
provided
in
Section
3.2
,
where
we
focus
on
the
process
of
constructing
the
ANP
network
model
for
the
specific
lorry
parking
location
problem
.
To
this
aim
,
we
first
outline
the
main
phases
of
the
ANP
(
RO.2
)
and
then
construct
the
ANP
dependency
network
model
based
on
the
outcomes
of
the
stakeholder
analysis
(
RO.3-RO.4
)
.

Stakeholder
Analysis
</head>
<p>
In
the
process
of
making
a
decision
on
a
public
matter
,
the
starting
point
for
the
theoretical
model
should
be
the
various
stakeholders
and
their
interests
.
The
stakeholders
are
those
individuals
or
organisations
that
have
personal
interest
and
influence
in
the
decision
process
because
they
have
goals
directly
or
indirectly
affected
by
the
problem
and
its
possible
resolution
.
Consequently
,
the
first
essential
step
in
a
public
decision-making
problem
process
is
classification
of
the
stakeholders
involved
and
their
interests
.
The
stakeholders
identified
in
our
decision-making
problem
alongside
their
main
objectives
are
drafted
in
Table
1
.
</p>
<p>
As
expected
in
a
real
problem
scenario
,
we
can
see
that
there
are
multiple
stakeholders
with
different
and
conflicting
interests
.
Local
residents
are
directly
affected
by
inappropriate
HGV
parking
,
as
highlighted
in
Section
2
,
and
their
main
interest
is
to
maximise
the
distance
between
their
homes
and
HGV
traffic
and
hence
the
freight
lorry
parking
.
Local
residents
are
the
primary
source
of
information
on
inappropriate
parking
through
their
reporting
of
nuisances
to
local
authorities
,
and
these
complaints
are
the
spur
for
political
action
to
tackle
the
problem
.
Local
businesses
are
also
affected
by
inappropriate
parking
,
as
road
congestion
causes
delay
in
incoming
deliveries
.
Because
local
businesses
are
the
main
factor
in
the
generation
of
HGV
flow
,
through
their
involvement
it
is
possible
to
obtain
information
about
the
HGV
flow
that
would
otherwise
be
difficult
to
obtain
,
such
as
the
number
of
daily
deliveries
in
the
area
.
City
Council
holds
an
indirect
interest
in
the
problem
since
it
is
concerned
with
the
general
well
being
of
the
local
population
;
hence
,
it
could
decide
to
provide
financial
support
for
construction
of
a
freight
lorry
parking
and
enact
policies
to
discourage
inappropriate
parking
.
To
ensure
a
positive
revenue
stream
,
a
freight
lorry
parking
needs
to
be
attractive
to
drivers
,
which
means
it
should
offer
security
for
their
goods
and
access
to
amenities
while
avoiding
costly
HGV
deviations
from
their
original
routes
.
Freight
lorry
parking
owners
can
be
interested
in
the
project
as
it
represents
a
long-term
financial
investment
.

Building
an
ANP
Model
for
the
Considered
Problem
</head>
<p>
Let
us
start
by
outlining
the
main
phases
of
the
ANP
method
as
a
Multiple
Criteria
Decision
Making
tool
as
described
in
.
The
ANP
is
a
generalisation
of
AHP
,
and
is
more
appropriate
for
dealing
with
real
decision-making
processes
with
complex
dependency
structures
between
the
considered
elements
.
