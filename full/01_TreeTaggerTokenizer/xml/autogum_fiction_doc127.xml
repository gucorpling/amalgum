CHAPTER
IX
</head>
<p>
Red-Eye
was
an
atavism
.
He
was
the
great
discordant
element
in
our
horde
.
He
was
more
primitive
than
any
of
us
.
He
did
not
belong
with
us
,
yet
we
were
still
so
primitive
ourselves
that
we
were
incapable
of
a
cooperative
effort
strong
enough
to
kill
him
or
cast
him
out
.
Rude
as
was
our
social
organization
,
he
was
,
nevertheless
,
too
rude
to
live
in
it
.
He
tended
always
to
destroy
the
horde
by
his
unsocial
acts
.
He
was
really
a
reversion
to
an
earlier
type
,
and
his
place
was
with
the
Tree
People
rather
than
with
us
who
were
in
the
process
of
becoming
men
.
</p>
<p>
He
was
a
monster
of
cruelty
,
which
is
saying
a
great
deal
in
that
day
.
He
beat
his
wives
--
not
that
he
ever
had
more
than
one
wife
at
a
time
,
but
that
he
was
married
many
times
.
It
was
impossible
for
any
woman
to
live
with
him
,
and
yet
they
did
live
with
him
,
out
of
compulsion
.
There
was
no
gainsaying
him
.
</p>
<p>
No
man
was
strong
enough
to
stand
against
him
.
</p>
<p>
Often
do
I
have
visions
of
the
quiet
hour
before
the
twilight
.
From
drinking-place
and
carrot
patch
and
berry
swamp
the
Folk
are
trooping
into
the
open
space
before
the
caves
.
They
dare
linger
no
later
than
this
,
for
the
dreadful
darkness
is
approaching
,
in
which
the
world
is
given
over
to
the
carnage
of
the
hunting
animals
,
while
the
fore-runners
of
man
hide
tremblingly
in
their
holes
.
</p>
<p>
There
yet
remain
to
us
a
few
minutes
before
we
climb
to
our
caves
.
We
are
tired
from
the
play
of
the
day
,
and
the
sounds
we
make
are
subdued
.
Even
the
cubs
,
still
greedy
for
fun
and
antics
,
play
with
restraint
.
The
wind
from
the
sea
has
died
down
,
and
the
shadows
are
lengthening
with
the
last
of
the
sun
’s
descent
.
And
then
,
suddenly
,
from
Red-Eye
’s
cave
,
breaks
a
wild
screaming
and
the
sound
of
blows
.
He
is
beating
his
wife
.
</p>
<p>
At
first
an
awed
silence
comes
upon
us
.
But
as
the
blows
and
screams
continue
we
break
out
into
an
insane
gibbering
of
helpless
rage
.
It
is
plain
that
the
men
resent
Red-Eye
’s
actions
,
but
they
are
too
afraid
of
him
.
The
blows
cease
,
and
a
low
groaning
dies
away
,
while
we
chatter
among
ourselves
and
the
sad
twilight
creeps
upon
us
.
</p>
<p>
We
,
to
whom
most
happenings
were
jokes
,
never
laughed
during
Red-Eye
’s
wife-beatings
.
We
knew
too
well
the
tragedy
of
them
.
On
more
than
one
morning
,
at
the
base
of
the
cliff
,
did
we
find
the
body
of
his
latest
wife
.
He
had
tossed
her
there
,
after
she
had
died
,
from
his
cave-mouth
.
He
never
buried
his
dead
.
The
task
of
carrying
away
the
bodies
,
that
else
would
have
polluted
our
abiding-place
,
he
left
to
the
horde
.
We
usually
flung
them
into
the
river
below
the
last
drinking-place
.
</p>
<p>
Not
alone
did
Red-Eye
murder
his
wives
,
but
he
also
murdered
for
his
wives
,
in
order
to
get
them
.
When
he
wanted
a
new
wife
and
selected
the
wife
of
another
man
,
he
promptly
killed
that
man
.
Two
of
these
murders
I
saw
myself
.
The
whole
horde
knew
,
but
could
do
nothing
.
We
had
not
yet
developed
any
government
,
to
speak
of
,
inside
the
horde
.
We
had
certain
customs
and
visited
our
wrath
upon
the
unlucky
ones
who
violated
those
customs
.
Thus
,
for
example
,
the
individual
who
defiled
a
drinking-place
would
be
attacked
by
every
onlooker
,
while
one
who
deliberately
gave
a
false
alarm
was
the
recipient
of
much
rough
usage
at
our
hands
.
But
Red-Eye
walked
rough-shod
over
all
our
customs
,
and
we
so
feared
him
that
we
were
incapable
of
the
collective
action
necessary
to
punish
him
.
</p>
<p>
It
was
during
the
sixth
winter
in
our
cave
that
Lop-Ear
and
I
discovered
that
we
were
really
growing
up
.
From
the
first
it
had
been
a
squeeze
to
get
in
through
the
entrance-crevice
.
This
had
had
its
advantages
,
however
.
It
had
prevented
the
larger
Folk
from
taking
our
cave
away
from
us
.
And
it
was
a
most
desirable
cave
,
the
highest
on
the
bluff
,
the
safest
,
and
in
winter
the
smallest
and
warmest
.
</p>
<p>
To
show
the
stage
of
the
mental
development
of
the
Folk
,
I
may
state
that
it
would
have
been
a
simple
thing
for
some
of
them
to
have
driven
us
out
and
enlarged
the
crevice-opening
.
But
they
never
thought
of
it
.
Lop-Ear
and
I
did
not
think
of
it
either
until
our
increasing
size
compelled
us
to
make
an
enlargement
.
This
occurred
when
summer
was
well
along
and
we
were
fat
with
better
forage
.
We
worked
at
the
crevice
in
spells
,
when
the
fancy
struck
us
.
</p>
<p>
At
first
we
dug
the
crumbling
rocks
away
with
our
fingers
,
until
our
nails
got
sore
,
when
I
accidentally
stumbled
upon
the
idea
of
using
a
piece
of
wood
on
the
rock
.
This
worked
well
.
Also
it
worked
woe
.
One
morning
early
,
we
had
scratched
out
of
the
wall
quite
a
heap
of
fragments
.
I
gave
the
heap
a
shove
over
the
lip
of
the
entrance
.
The
next
moment
there
came
up
from
below
a
howl
of
rage
.
There
was
no
need
to
look
.
We
knew
the
voice
only
too
well
.
The
rubbish
had
descended
upon
Red-Eye
.
