First
,
you
should
off
course
come
up
with
an
ideal
business
idea
and
plan
then
,
a
business
name
.
Just
the
fundamental
stuffs
mainly
but
,
do
n’t
forget
to
think
big
.
How
you
do
this
is
up
to
you
really
you
can
go
from
conducting
a
feasibility
study
or
what
not
,
to
just
spending
more
time
at
home
with
your
neighbors
figuring
out
what
services
are
missing
or
lacking
in
your
hood
.

ne&quot;&gt;
Secondly
,
you
start
up
by
first
getting
capital
.
You
should
start
small
but
,
remember
think
big
and
grow
fast
(
Fela
Durotoye
)
.
If
you
are
able
to
fund
the
business
yourself
well
,
good
for
you
but
,
if
you
ca
n’t
;
get
investors
check
www.nairaland.com/investment
,
www.founded.com/
or
just
Google
it
(
www.google.com/search
)
.
You
can
also
lend
your
capital
from
friends
and
family
if
you
are
trust
worthy
or
get
a
bank
loan
.
Next
you
set
up
your
shop
,
store
or
whatever
,
and
you
can
also
set
up
online
easy
;
Google
it
or
better
still
hire
experts
if
you
do
n’t
know
any

&quot;
&gt;
Thirdly
,
you
market
your
product
or
service
the
cheapest
way
to
go
is
online
marketing
.
Trust
me
no
marketing
no
profits
also
,
online
is
the
freest
way
to
go
.
If
you
have
enough
capital
make
handbills
,
banners
,
T-shirts
,
print
nylons
etc.
but
if
you
want
free
or
cheap
marketing
go
online
you
can
just
hire
a
specialist

www.SoutechVentures.com
they
’ve
got
all
you
will
need
.
You
can
also
learn
for
free
by
taking
internet
marketing
fundamental
courses
on
www.pushcv.com/course
.
Register
your
business
on
Google
Place
,
yahoo
local
,
Microsoft
Bing
etc.
before
all
that
register
your
business
with
the
CAC
not
that
anyone
is
searching
for
your
business
there
.

Most
importantly
The
God
Factor
.
Everybody
can
figure
out
how
to
start
and
run
a
business
online
or
anywhere
else
but
,
you
need
an
extra/supernatural
wisdom
to
keep
it
afloat
.
God
created
us
to
be
able
to
know/see
with
our
hearts
;
there
is
more
to
us
than
what
we
can
see
,
hear
,
smell
,
and
touch
.
The
God
Factor
is
the
faith
tool
you
need
for
your
business
and
for
your
life
{
Hebrew
11:1
now
faith
is
the
assurance
of
things
hoped
for
,
the
conviction/evidence
of
things
not
seen
(
in
the
physical
)
}
.
Faith
is
real
;
as
real
as
you
and
me
it
is
the
ability
to
receive
what
you
have
asked
and
understand
that
you
have
received
it
now
and
not
praying
to
receive
it
later
.
Faith
is
like
when
you
ordered
that
car
or
whatever
from
a
shop
or
a
person
abroad
or
anywhere
.
You
have
the
receipt
you
know
it
’s
yours
.
You
’ve
seen
pictures
all
that
is
left
,
is
for
it
to
get
to
your
physical
location
.
Faith
is
the
receipt
,
Faith
are
those
pictures
,
and
Faith
is
that
tracking
software
that
tracks
its
location
;
that
tells
you
that
it
’s
still
on
the
way
.
At
this
point
you
rejoices
,
you
tell
people
about
that
thing
that
’s
on
its
way
.
You
are
excited
everyone
around
you
is
excited
you
do
n’t
get
surprised
when
you
see
it
you
’ve
already
seen
it
.
The
God
Factor
is
the
most
important
tool
grab
onto
the
reality
of
your
successful
business
and
by
the
time
it
arrives
at
your
door
,
you
would
have
already
ordered/seen
the
next
level
.
{
By
faith
we
understand
that
the
universe
was
created
by
the
word
of
God
,
so
that
what
is
seen
was
not
made
out
of
things
that
are
visible

3
