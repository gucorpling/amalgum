As
far
back
as
I
can
remember
I
have
always
had
an
innate
belief
in
what
I
now
would
call
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual%20rights">
individual

,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due%20process">

,
and
it
came
out
in
my
family
experiences
and
in
my
experiences
in
school
as
a
young
child
.

I
should
n’t
say
so
much
direct
experiences
—
well
,
to
some
extent
—
but
the
stories
I
was
brought
up
on
as
a
kid
.
My
father
was
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust%20survivor">
holocaust
survivor
</ref>
and
my
mother
’s
father
was
a
protester
during
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World%20War%20I">
World
War
I
</ref>
when
he
came
to
this
country
as
an
immigrant
,
and
he
was
literally
spat
upon
for
not
going
to
fight
in
the
war
.
His
official
sentence
for
being
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conscientious%20objector">
conscientious
objector
</ref>
was
to
be
forced
to
stand
against
the
courthouse
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson%20County,%20New%20Jersey">
Hudson
County
,
New
Jersey
</ref>
so
that
passers-by
could
spit
on
him
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS

What
were
you
taught
about
him
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
NS
:
</hi>
I
knew
him
as
a
kid
and
he
told
me
these
stories
,
and
my
mother
told
me
,
and
it
was
very
upsetting
to
me
,
but
very
inspiring
to
think
about
trying
to
rectify
injustices
.
When
I
say
my
own
family
,
my
own
personal
experiences
are
so
trivial
compared
to
those
,
but
having
teachers
not
allow
different
viewpoints
come
out
in
class
and
seeing
kids
tormenting
other
kids
that
were
different
.
When
I
got
a
little
bit
older
there
was
an
experience
with
a
teacher
who
was
exposing
students
to
different
viewpoints
about
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam%20War">
Vietnam
War
</ref>
,
and
there
was
a
call
for
him
to
be
fired
and
he
was
editorialized
against
;
I
led
a
campaign
to
defend
his
free
speech
rights
,
and
our
free
speech
rights
.
Once
I
had
the
idea
that
I
could
go
to
law
school
to
get
professional
skills
to
advocate
for
values
that
I
had
always
believed
in
,
it
just
seemed
the
right
thing
to
do
.
There
are
many
other
paths
,
I
realize
,
but
it
certainly
has
been
a
good
path
to
try
to
work
with
the
values
I
care
deeply
about
that
I
have
had
throughout
my
whole
life
.

When
you
went

<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard%20Law%20School">

,
were
you
an
activist
on

?

Not
so
much
.
I
should
say
,
I
was
an
activist
,
but
it
was
n’t
like
I
was
a
leader
of
something
.
Probably
because
I
was
involved
in
so
many
organizations
and
I
was
glad
that
I
was
exploring
so
many
different
forms
of
activism
.
In
college
I
was
involved
in
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-war_movement#The_Vietnam_Era:_1962-1975">
anti-war
movement
</ref>
,
and
I
was
very
involved
in
the
women
’s
movement
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive%20freedom">
Reproductive
freedom
</ref>
was
a
really
big
deal
then
;
it
was
before
<hi rend="italic">
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe%20vs.%20Wade">
Roe
vs.
Wade
</ref>
</hi>
.
I
remember
there
was
a
very
high
profile
prosecution
of
a
doctor
for
performing
an
abortion
in
Massachusetts
,
where
I
was
in
college
.
Then
in
law
school
I
was
very
active
in
a
lot
of
organizations
.
I
was
n’t
sure
of
which
direction
I
actually
wanted
to
go
,
including
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%20rights">
prison
legal
assistance
</ref>
project
,
the
voluntary
defenders
,
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal%20aid">
legal
aid
</ref>
bureau…and
I
was
also
earning
my
way
through
law
school
so
I
had
to
do
a
lot
of
work
.
