<p>
In
the
course
of
the
next
eight
years
Newmark
and
Orde
floated
high
on
that
flood
of
apparent
prosperity
that
attends
a
business
well
conceived
and
passably
well
managed
.
The
Boom
and
Driving
Company
made
money
,
of
course
,
for
with
the
margin
of
fifty
per
cent
or
thereabouts
necessitated
by
the
temporary
value
of
the
improvements
,
good
years
could
hardly
fail
to
bring
good
returns
.
This
,
it
will
be
remembered
,
was
a
stock
company
.
With
the
profits
from
that
business
the
two
men
embarked
on
a
separate
copartnership
.
They
made
money
at
this
,
too
,
but
the
burden
of
debt
necessitated
by
new
ventures
,
constantly
weighted
by
the
heavy
interest
demanded
at
that
time
,
kept
affairs
on
the
ragged
edge
.
</p>
<p>
In
addition
,
both
Orde
and
Newmark
were
more
inclined
to
extension
of
interests
than
to
“
playing
safe
.
”
The
assets
gained
in
one
venture
were
promptly
pledged
to
another
.
The
ramifications
of
debt
,
property
,
mortgages
,
and
expectations
overlapped
each
other
in
a
cobweb
of
interests
.
</p>
<p>
Orde
lived
at
ease
in
a
new
house
of
some
size
surrounded
by
grounds
.
He
kept
two
servants
:
a
blooded
team
of
horses
drew
the
successor
to
the
original
buckboard
.
Newmark
owned
a
sail
yacht
of
five
or
six
tons
,
in
which
,
quite
solitary
,
he
took
his
only
pleasure
.
Both
were
considered
men
of
substance
and
property
,
as
indeed
they
were
.
Only
,
they
risked
dollars
to
gain
thousands
.
A
succession
of
bad
years
,
a
panic-contraction
of
money
markets
,
any
one
of
a
dozen
possible
,
though
not
probable
,
contingencies
would
render
it
difficult
to
meet
the
obligations
which
constantly
came
due
,
and
which
Newmark
kept
busy
devising
ways
and
means
of
meeting
.
If
things
went
well
--
and
it
may
be
remarked
that
legitimately
they
should
--
Newmark
and
Orde
would
some
day
be
rated
among
the
millionaire
firms
.
If
things
went
ill
,
bankruptcy
could
not
be
avoided
.
There
was
no
middle
ground
.
Nor
were
Orde
and
his
partner
unique
in
this
;
practically
every
firm
then
developing
or
exploiting
the
natural
resources
of
the
country
found
itself
in
the
same
case
.
</p>
<p>
Immediately
after
the
granting
of
the
charter
to
drive
the
river
the
partners
had
offered
them
an
opportunity
of
acquiring
about
thirty
million
feet
of
timber
remaining
from
Morrison
and
Daly
's
original
holdings
.
That
firm
was
very
anxious
to
begin
development
on
a
large
scale
of
its
Beeson
Lake
properties
in
the
Saginaw
waters
.
Daly
proposed
to
Orde
that
he
take
over
the
remnant
,
and
having
confidence
in
the
young
man
's
abilities
,
agreed
to
let
him
have
it
on
long-time
notes
.
After
several
consultations
with
Newmark
,
Orde
finally
completed
the
purchase
.
Below
the
booms
they
erected
a
mill
,
the
machinery
for
which
they
had
also
bought
of
Daly
,
at
Redding
.
The
following
winter
Orde
spent
in
the
woods
.
By
spring
he
had
banked
,
ready
to
drive
,
about
six
million
feet
.
</p>
<p>
For
some
years
these
two
sorts
of
activity
gave
the
partners
about
all
they
could
attend
to
.
As
soon
as
the
drive
had
passed
Redding
,
Orde
left
it
in
charge
of
one
of
his
foremen
while
he
divided
his
time
between
the
booms
and
the
mill
.
Late
in
the
year
his
woods
trips
began
,
the
tours
of
inspection
,
of
surveying
for
new
roads
,
the
inevitable
preparation
for
the
long
winter
campaigns
in
the
forest
.
As
soon
as
the
spring
thaws
began
,
once
more
the
drive
demanded
his
attention
.
And
in
marketing
the
lumber
,
manipulating
the
firm
's
financial
affairs
,
collecting
its
dues
,
paying
its
bills
,
making
its
purchases
,
and
keeping
oiled
the
intricate
bearing
points
of
its
office
machinery
,
Newmark
was
busy
--
and
invaluable
.
</p>
<p>
At
the
end
of
the
fifth
year
the
opportunity
came
,
through
a
combination
of
a
bad
debt
and
a
man
's
death
,
to
get
possession
of
two
lake
schooners
.
Orde
at
once
suggested
the
contract
for
a
steam
barge
.
Towing
was
then
in
its
infancy
.
The
bulk
of
lake
traffic
was
by
means
of
individual
sailing
ships
--
a
method
uncertain
as
to
time
.
Orde
thought
that
a
steam
barge
could
be
built
powerful
enough
not
only
to
carry
its
own
hold
and
deck
loads
,
but
to
tow
after
it
the
two
schooners
.
In
this
manner
the
crews
could
be
reduced
,
and
an
approximate
date
of
delivery
could
be
guaranteed
.
Newmark
agreed
with
him
.
Thus
the
firm
,
in
accordance
with
his
prophecy
,
went
into
the
carrying
trade
,
for
the
vessels
more
than
sufficed
for
its
own
needs
.
The
freighting
of
lumber
added
much
to
the
income
,
and
the
carrying
of
machinery
and
other
heavy
freight
on
the
return
trip
grew
every
year
.
</p>
<p>
But
by
far
the
most
important
acquisition
was
that
of
the
northern
peninsula
timber
.
Most
operators
called
the
white
pine
along
and
back
from
the
river
inexhaustible
.
Orde
did
not
believe
this
.
He
saw
the
time
,
not
far
distant
,
when
the
world
would
be
compelled
to
look
elsewhere
for
its
lumber
supply
,
and
he
turned
his
eyes
to
the
almost
unknown
North
.
After
a
long
investigation
through
agents
,
and
a
month
's
land-looking
on
his
own
account
,
he
located
and
purchased
three
hundred
million
feet
.
This
was
to
be
paid
for
,
as
usual
,
mostly
by
the
firm
's
notes
secured
by
its
other
property
.
It
would
become
available
only
in
the
future
,
but
Orde
believed
,
as
indeed
the
event
justified
,
this
future
would
prove
to
be
not
so
distant
as
most
people
supposed
.
