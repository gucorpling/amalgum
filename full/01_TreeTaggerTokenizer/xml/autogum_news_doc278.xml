travels
to
the
Middle
East
in
the
coming
week
in
hopes
of
urging
U.S.
allies
in
the

to
support

The
president
's
first
stop
is
Israel
where
he
says
he
will
encourage
Prime
Minister
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehud%20Olmert">
Ehud
Olmert
</ref>
and
Palestinian
President
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmoud%20Abbas">

to
move
forward
with
peace
talks
they
began
in
November
in
the

States
</ref>
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
This
is
difficult
work
.
It
will
require
tough
decisions
on
complex
questions
.
But
I
am
optimistic
about
the
prospects
.
And
I
will
make
clear
that
America
is
deeply
committed
to
helping
both
parties
realize
the
historic
vision
we
share
:
two
democratic
states
,
Israel
and
Palestine
,
living
side
by
side
in
peace
and
security
,
&quot;
said
Mr.
Bush
.

Israel
,
the
president
visits

,
and

</ref>
.
In
his
weekly
radio
address
,
he
says
he
will
urge
regional
leaders
to
support
Israeli-Palestinian
talks
and
will
consult
with
them
on
the
war
against
extremists
.
</p>
<p>
The
president
says
America
will
stay
engaged
in
the
region
because
societies
growing
in
tolerance
and
hope
are
less
likely
to
become
sources
of
radicalism
and
violence
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
We
will
support
democrats
and
reformers
from
Beirut
and
Baghdad
to
Damascus
and
Tehran
,
&quot;
said
Mr.
Bush
.
&quot;
We
will
stand
with
all
those
working
to
build
a
future
of
liberty
and
justice
and
peace
.

<p>
Analysts
and
activists
in
some
Middle
Eastern
countries
allied
with
the
United
States
say
2007
was
marked
by
governments
backtracking
from
steps
toward
democracy
.
</p>
<p>
During
his
trip
,
President
Bush
will
meet
with
U.S.
officials
from
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Iraq">
Iraq
</ref>
for
an
update
on
the
fighting
there
.
</p>
<p>
Public
opinion
polls
say
a
majority
of
Americans
believe
the
president
's
decision
to
invade
Iraq
was
a
mistake
.
And
the
deployment
of
more
than
100,000
U.S.
troops
there
is
a
major
issue
in
this
year
's
presidential
campaign
.
</p>
<p>
In
the
Democratic
radio
address
,
party
chairman
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard%20Dean">
Howard
Dean
</ref>
urged
American
voters
to
put
an
end
to
seven
years
of
Republican
rule
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
The
Republican
candidates
stand
for
the
past
.
They
support
the
president
's
war
in
Iraq
,
the
president
's
veto
of
children
's
health
care
,
and
they
support
an
endless
charge-card
mentality
,
which
our
children
and
grandchildren
will
pay
the
bill
for
.
The
Democrats
stand
for
the
future
of
our
country
,
and
the
message
this
November
will
be
clear
.
If
you
want
to
get
out
of
Iraq
and
refocus
America
's
priority
to
really
fight
terrorism
,
vote
for
a
Democrat
for
president
,
&quot;
said
Dean
.
</p>
<p>
In
this
week
's
first
presidential
caucus
,
more
than
twice
as
many
Democrats
turned
out
as
Republicans
.
Dean
says
that
shows
Americans
do
not
want
another
Bush
term
.
That
cannot
happen
anyway
as
the
constitution
prevents
the
president
from
seeking
a
third
term
.
