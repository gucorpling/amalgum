Tell
if
a
Dog
Is
Microchipped
</head>
<p>
Microchips
placed
in
dogs
are
small
passive
radio
emitters
about
the
size
of
a
grain
of
rice
that
are
injected
under
the
skin
above
the
shoulder
blades
.
Each
microchip
has
a
unique
number
,
and
that
number
is
registered
on
an
official
central
database
along
with
a
description
of
that
dog
,
the
owner
's
name
,
address
,
and
contact
phone
numbers
.
When
a
scanner
is
passed
over
the
microchip
,
that
unique
number
is
picked
up
and
displayed
on
the
scanner
.
Knowing
if
a
dog
has
a
microchip
is
especially
helpful
if
you
find
a
stray
dog
and
need
to
trace
the
owner
.

Looking

a
Microchip

Look
for
a
tag
on
the
dog
's
collar
.
If
the
dog
is
wearing
a
collar
take
a
look
to
see
if
it
has
a
specific
tag
that
says
the
dog
is
microchipped
.
Microchips
are
made
by
different
manufacturers
,
and
these
companies
usually
issue
a
metal
tags
to
place
on
the
dog
's
collar
to
alert
interested
parties
that
the
dog
is
chipped
.

The
tag
is
supplied
in
part
to
let
anyone
that
finds
a
dog
know
that
it
is
chipped
in
order
to
scan
them
but
it
is
also
a
visual
deterrent
to
potential
thieves
thinking
of
stealing
the
dog
,
since
the
dog
has
permanent
ID
as
belonging
to
someone
else
.
</item>
<item>
If
the
dog
does
not
have
an
official
ID
tag
on
their
collar
,
look
for
a
bespoke
collar
tag
bearing
wording
such
as
&quot;
I
am
microchipped
&quot;
or
&quot;
microchipped
.
&quot;
Know
that
this
is
not
the
same
as
a
tag
engraved
with
the
dog
's
name
and
phone
number
.
The
purpose
of
this
tag
is
purely
to
alert
the
finder
that
the
dog
is
chipped
and
should
be
scanned
.
This
type
of
tag
usually
does
not
carry
personal
details
.

Feel
for
the
microchip
.
If
the
dog
has
lost
their
collar
or
there
is
no
tag
on
the
collar
,
try
gently
feeling
for
the
presence
of
the
microchip
.
The
microchip
is
encased
in
a
perspex
coat
that
is
the
size
and
shape
of
a
grain
of
rice
.
Microchips
are
injected
under
the
skin
in
the
loose
skin
of
the
neck
at
the
centerline
between
the
shoulder
blades
.
Therefore
this
is
the
ideal
place
to
start
feeling
.

Run
your
fingertips
over
the
skin
between
the
shoulder
blades
and
neck
.
Apply
gentle
pressure
to
see
if
you
can
detect
a
firm
rice-grain
sized
object
just
under
the
skin
.
Microchips
do
bed
in
,
which
means
they
can
migrate
slightly
from
the
original
implant
site
.
</item>
<item>
To
reduce
the
chance
of
missing
a
microchip
,
work
in
a
methodical
manner
working
up
and
down
between
shoulder
and
head
and
then
left
to
right
working
side
to
side
from
the
shoulders
up
the
neck
until
every
inch
is
covered
.
</item>
<item>
This
is
not
a
foolproof
method
.
If
you
ca
n't
feel
a
chip
it
does
not
mean
the
dog
is
definitely
not
chipped
because
the
chip
may
be
present
but
have
shifted
location
or
is
embedded
too
deeply
to
feel
.

Get
a
definitive
answer
by
getting
the
dog
scanned
.
Even
if
the
dog
does
n't
have
a
tag
that
says
it
has
a
chip
and
you
do
n't
feel
one
,
it
's
best
to
scan
the
dog
to
find
out
.
It
is
worth
scanning
for
a
microchip
if
you
are
trying
to
get
the
contact
details
of
a
lost
dog
's
owner
.

X-ray
the
dog
.
Microchips
show
up
on
x-ray
.
While
this
is
not
routinely
used
as
a
method
to
check
if
a
chip
is
present
,
in
cases
where
a
chip
was
implanted
and
has
stopped
working
,
taking
a
radiograph
of
the
dog
is
a
quick
and
easy
way
to
check
the
chip
is
still
in
place
but
not
working
.

Check
the
scanner
.
First
,
the
operator
needs
to
check
that
the
scanner
is
working
by
pressing
the
'
on
'
button
and
passing
the
sensor
over
a
test
chip
.
If
the
scanner
bleeps
and
displays
a
number
it
is
working
.
If
the
batteries
are
dead
the
display
will
either
remain
blank
or
display
a
message
&quot;
low
battery
.

Scan
the
dog
's
shoulders
.
Turn
on
the
scanner
and
hold
it
one
inch
above
the
skin
.
Move
the
scanner
in
up
and
down
sweeps
from
the
shoulder
to
neck
and
then
from
side
to
side
.
When
the
scanner
activates
,
make
a
note
of
the
number
.

<item>
Check
other
places
on
the
dog
's
body
.
If
no
chip
is
found
with
a
methodical
scanning
pattern
over
the
shoulders
,
do
n't
give
up
.
Pass
the
scanner
over
the
remainder
of
the
body
.
This
includes
under
the
sternum
and
around
the
armpits
,
just
in
case
it
has
migrated
to
an
unusual
location
.

Microchip
scanning
can
be
done
at
most
veterinary
clinics
.
If
you
have
found
a
stray
dog
,
take
it
to
a
local
veterinarian
to
get
scanned
.
</item>
<item>
Microchips
are
also
a
great
way
of
proving
ownership
.
Your
veterinarian
or
an
animal
welfare
officer
can
implant
the
chip
and
put
your
information
into
the
database
.
This
process
means
the
pet
is
officially
registered
with
your
details
.
The
database
then
issues
the
owner
a
certificate
,
which
has
a
copy
of
the
details
and
a
password
.
Thus
,
the
only
person
capable
of
changing
the
registered
details
is
the
owner
in
possession
of
a
valid
password
.
This
means
that
if
your
dog
is
stolen
and
then
spotted
by
the
police
,
the
results
of
scanning
the
microchip
can
prove
that
you
own
that
animal
.
