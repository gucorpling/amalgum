Introduction
</head>
<p>
The
liver
is
the
central
organ
of
lipid
metabolism
.
Dietary
fatty
acids
are
transported
to
the
liver
and
oxidized
to
produce
as
much
energy
as
the
hepatocyte
needs
.
The
excess
fatty
acids
are
converted
to
triglycerides
(
TG
)
and
stored
in
the
hepatocyte
.
When
the
amount
of
TG
accounts
for
more
than
5
%
of
the
liver
weight
,
the
organ
function
is
impaired
,
and
this
condition
is
known
as
fatty
liver
disease
.
Chronic
alcohol
intake
has
long
been
considered
the
major
cause
of
alcoholic
fatty
liver
,
while
non-alcoholic
fatty
liver
has
been
shown
to
be
unrelated
to
alcohol
intake
.
The
causes
of
non-alcoholic
fatty
liver
are
lifestyle
habits
,
which
include
excessive
dietary
intake
and
lack
of
energy
consumption
.
Therefore
,
it
is
often
accompanied
by
lifestyle
diseases
such
as
obesity
,
diabetes
,
and
metabolic
syndrome
.
In
recent
times
,
with
the
growing
incidence
of
these
diseases
,
the
attention
paid
to
non-alcoholic
fatty
liver
is
gradually
increasing
.
Non-alcoholic
fatty
liver
disease
(
NAFLD
)
shows
various
stages
.
Simple
hepatic
steatosis
is
characterized
by
lipid
accumulation
in
hepatocytes
.
Non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis
(
NASH
)
can
be
further
developed
into
cirrhosis
and
hepatocellular
carcinoma
.
Although
many
factors
such
as
obesity
,
diabetes
,
and
inflammation
have
been
implicated
in
relation
to
NAFLD
in
humans
,
the
underlying
mechanism
of
the
development
and
progression
of
NAFLD
remains
unclear
.
</p>
<p>
When
free
fatty
acid
(
FFA
)
is
overloaded
in
the
body
,
FFA
uptake
factors
such
as
cluster
of
differentiation
36
(
CD36
)
and
fatty
acid
transport
proteins
(
FATPs
)
are
significantly
up-regulated
,
and
then
excessive
FFA
is
accepted
into
the
liver
,
gradually
accumulating
.
According
to
previous
studies
,
palmitic
acid
and
high-fat
(
HF
)
diet
markedly
increased
CD36
expression
,
which
is
closely
associated
with
the
development
of
NAFLD
.
Furthermore
,
several
studies
have
indicated
that
fatty
acid
overflow
by
activated
CD36
subsequently
produced
a
higher
level
of
reactive
oxygen
species
(
ROS
)
,
which
could
be
linked
to
oxidative
stress
.
</p>
<p>
Oxidative
stress
is
the
imbalance
between
the
production
of
ROS
and
the
activation
of
antioxidants
in
the
body
and
results
in
several
metabolic
disorders
.
It
particularly
produces
a
disturbance
in
lipid
metabolism
,
eventually
leading
to
lipid
accumulation
in
hepatocytes
.
Of
the
several
existing
pathogenic
mechanisms
of
NAFLD
,
oxidative
stress
is
considered
a
major
contributor
.
According
to
a
previous
study
,
uric
acid-induced
oxidative
stress
in
hepatocytes
significantly
elevated
the
expression
of
lipogenesis
factors
such
as
acetyl-coenzyme
A
carboxylase
(
ACC
)
,
fatty
acid
synthase
(
FAS
)
,
and
sterol
regulatory
element-binding
protein-1c
(
SREBP-1c
)
.
Another
study
has
shown
that
an
HF
diet
destroyed
the
antioxidant
defense
system
by
decreasing
superoxide
dismutase
(
SOD
)
and
catalase
(
CAT
)
activities
,
and
markedly
increased
the
production
of
ROS
.
To
prevent
metabolic
disorders
due
to
oxidative
stress
,
antioxidative
capability
that
suppresses
or
eliminates
ROS
production
plays
an
important
role
in
the
body
.
Plants
contain
a
variety
of
phytochemicals
that
have
antioxidant
ability
to
effectively
remove
ROS
.

<hi rend="italic">
Curcuma
longa
</hi>
L.
is
a
flowering
plant
of
the
ginger
family
(
Zingiberaceae
)
.
As
<hi rend="italic">
C.
longa
</hi>
possesses
natural
antioxidants
,
which
leads
to
free
radical
scavenging
potential
,
it
has
been
widely
used
to
prevent
many
diseases
,
including
liver
injury
.

<p>
The
aim
of
our
study
was
to
investigate
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
protective
effects
of
hot
water
extract
(
CLW
)
from
<hi rend="italic">
C.
longa
</hi>
on
the
development
of
fatty
liver
.
Furthermore
,
the
mode
of
action
against
lipid
accumulation
and
oxidative
stress
in
non-alcoholic
liver
damage
was
determined
.
