Boston/Dorchester
</head>
<p>
So
,
you
've
decided
to
visit
<hi rend="bold">
Dorchester
</hi>
.
Congratulations
!
Boston
's
largest
neighborhood
had
long
been
written
off
,
dismissed
as
“
too
dangerous
”
by
those
who
had
never
set
foot
here
.
But
longtime
residents
—
or
“
Dot
Rats
”
—
have
always
known
what
the
rest
of
<ref target="Boston">
Boston
</ref>
is
beginning
to
rediscover
.
An
area
close
to
downtown
and
the
ocean
,
replete
with
beautiful
parks
,
charming
old
architecture
,
and
good
public
transit
.
An
area
with
a
diverse
and
inclusive
population
,
and
additionally
one
of
the
more
affordable
spots
in
Boston
.
When
you
consider
these
assets
as
a
whole
,
it
should
come
as
no
surprise
that
many
are
giving
the
neighborhood
a
second
look
.
</p>
<head>
Understand
</head>
<p>
Due
to
Dorchester
's
large
size
it
can
be
helpful
for
the
traveller
to
think
of
it
in
two
halves
,
north
and
south
.
The
northern
half
is
more
traditionally
urban
.
Houses
are
packed
tightly
together
,
people
walk
everywhere
,
all
accompanied
by
the
traffic
and
street
noise
one
might
expect
.
Due
to
its
proximity
to
downtown
,
the
majority
of
new
development
is
taking
place
here
as
well
.
A
huge
cineplex
,
mall
expansion
,
and
many
new
condos
are
under
construction
as
of
2016
.
The
southern
half
,
by
contrast
,
continues
to
retain
a
more
suburban
feel
.
City
lots
are
a
bit
roomier
,
large
condo
buildings
become
less
common
while
trees
become
more
prevalent
.
Driving
is
slightly
less
stressful
and
even
necessary
in
some
areas
.
Stitching
these
two
halves
together
is
Dorchester
Ave.
Running
from
<ref target="Boston/South%20Boston">
South
Boston
</ref>
to
<ref target="Milton%20%28Massachusetts%29">
Milton
</ref>
,
Dot
Ave
is
by
far
the
neighborhood
's
most
powerful
connector
of
people
and
places
.
Yes
,
the
big
draw
here
is
JFK
Presidential
Library
,
but
to
really
experience
Dorchester
you
should
allow
some
time
to
investigate
the
people
and
places
along
this
main
street
.
</p>
<head>
Neighborhoods
</head>
<p>
Again
,
Dorchester
is
huge
.
If
it
were
an
independent
city
,
it
would
be
the
4th
largest
in
the
state
.
Consider
this
a
severely
abridged
list
of
just
a
few
of
the
areas
you
may
be
interested
in
visiting
.
Also
take
these
names
with
a
pinch
of
salt
.
In
a
place
this
old
,
it
can
feel
like
every
intersection
has
a
special
name
or
used
to
be
called
something
else
.

Ashmont
:
</hi>
The
general
area
around
Ashmont
station
has
been
transformed
in
recent
years
,
showcasing
a
rebuilt
train
station
in
2011
and
several
new
shops
and
restaurants
.
The
residential
hills
to
the
east
and
west
of
the
station
have
deep
Irish-American
roots
,
and
boast
some
of
the
finest
houses
anywhere
in
the
city
.
The
Kennedys
'
family
home
was
in
this
area
.
Ashmont
is
also
one
of
the
few
areas
in
the
south
Dorchester
where
some
mid-rise
buildings
have
been
going
up
.
It
remains
to
be
seen
what
type
of
impact
they
will
have
on
the
neighborhood
.
You
might
also
hear
this
area
called
Ashmont
Hill
or
Peabody
Square
.
Another
neighborhood
,
Adams
Village
,
is
very
close
by
and
has
a
similar
Irish
color
.
</item>
<item>
<hi rend="bold">
Fields
Corner
:
</hi>
A
variety
of
cultures
meet
and
shop
in
this
bustling
commercial
district
.
Conveniently
clustered
shops
selling
a
vast
array
of
goods
draw
shoppers
from
nearby
African-American
,
Vietnamese
,
and
Irish
enclaves
.
During
the
warmer
months
the
community
park
is
in
almost
constant
use
with
kids
playing
baseball
,
neighborhood
festivals
,
or
families
barbecuing
.
This
area
could
also
be
considered
the
center
of
the
Vietnamese
community
in
Boston
.
You
can
find
many
Vietnamese
restaurants
,
places
of
worship
,
and
community
centers
in
the
vicinity
.

Lower
Mills
:
</hi>
On
the
shores
of
the
Neponset
River
and
functioning
as
Boston
's
southern
gateway
,
Lower
Mills
is
decidedly
upmarket
.
Once
the
heart
of
chocolate
manufacturing
in
the
region
,
many
picturesque
old
factory
buildings
have
been
painstakingly
restored
and
converted
into
hundreds
of
luxury
condos
.
Following
the
arrival
of
new
residents
,
new
and
old
retailers
alike
have
wasted
no
time
updating
their
offerings
in
order
to
cater
to
this
expanding
community
.
Lower
Mills
is
also
a
great
area
to
get
outdoors
.
Bike
or
walk
along
miles
of
trails
and
paved
paths
to
check
out
some
of
the
best
green
space
Boston
has
to
offer
.
</item>
<item>
<hi rend="bold">
South
Bay
:
</hi>
Not
an
official
neighborhood
per
se
,
but
worth
noting
with
all
the
construction
going
on
in
the
area
.
This
part
of
Dorchester
is
by
far
its
largest
commercial
district
.
Anchored
by
big
box
stores
like
Target
,
Home
Depot
,
and
Best
Buy
among
many
others
.
Its
proximity
to
South
Boston
and
the
<ref target="Boston/South%20End">
South
End
</ref>
make
it
a
neighborhood
crossroads
of
sorts
,
and
developers
are
pouring
money
in
.
It
's
surprisingly
easy
to
drive
here
,
due
to
the
large
parking
lot
and
interstate
highway
nearby
.

By
public
transit
</head>
<p>
The
T
's
<hi rend="bold">
Red
Line
</hi>
runs
frequent
service
to
much
of
Dorchester
.
Trains
run
about
every
8
minutes
,
more
during
rush
hour
and
less
often
at
night
.
<hi rend="bold">
JFK/UMass
</hi>
,
<hi rend="bold">
Savin
Hill
</hi>
,
<hi rend="bold">
Fields
Corner
</hi>
,
<hi rend="bold">
Shawmut
</hi>
,
and
<hi rend="bold">
Ashmont
</hi>
stations
all
provide
the
neighborhood
with
convenient
links
to
downtown
Boston
.
Be
aware
that
the
Red
Line
splits
into
two
separate
branches
at
JFK/UMass
,
so
make
sure
you
board
an
Ashmont
bound
train
!
JFK/UMass
also
provides
Dorchester
with
its
only
connection
to
several
South
Shore
commuter
rail
lines
.
Trains
on
the
<hi rend="bold">
Greenbush
</hi>
,
<hi rend="bold">
Kingston
</hi>
,
and
<hi rend="bold">
Middleborough/Lakeville
</hi>
lines
stop
here
.
On
the
western
border
with
<ref target="Boston/Roxbury">
Roxbury
</ref>
,
the
<hi rend="bold">
Fairmount
</hi>
commuter
rail
has
stations
at
<hi rend="bold">
Newmarket
</hi>
,
<hi rend="bold">
Uphams
Corner
</hi>
,
<hi rend="bold">
Four
Corners/Geneva
</hi>
,
and
<hi rend="bold">
Talbot
Avenue
</hi>
.
This
line
runs
on
an
infrequent
schedule
,
around
once
an
hour
,
but
the
city
planned
to
increase
service
by
2018
.
</p>
<p>
Ashmont
station
is
the
terminus
of
the
Red
Line
,
as
well
as
the
<hi rend="bold">
Ashmont-Mattapan
High
Speed
Line
</hi>
.
This
is
a
quaint
1940s
era
trolly
system
that
locals
continue
to
use
everyday
as
they
go
about
their
business
.
The
trolley
stops
in
<hi rend="bold">
Cedar
Grove
</hi>
,
and
<hi rend="bold">
Butler
</hi>
before
continuing
on
to
Milton
and
<ref target="Boston/Outer%20Neighborhoods">
Mattapan
</ref>
.
Ashmont
is
also
the
largest
bus
depot
in
Dorchester
.
From
here
the
<hi rend="bold">
#21
</hi>
,
<hi rend="bold">
#22
</hi>
and
<hi rend="bold">
#23
</hi>
busses
run
to
different
points
along
the
<hi rend="bold">
Orange
Line
</hi>
.
Lines
<hi rend="bold">
#215
</hi>
,
<hi rend="bold">
#217
</hi>
,
<hi rend="bold">
#240
</hi>
,
<hi rend="bold">
#245
</hi>
are
less
frequent
and
run
to
<ref target="Quincy%20%28Massachusetts%29">
Quincy
</ref>
and
Milton
.
While
the
<hi rend="bold">
#27
</hi>
runs
to
Mattapan
.
There
are
a
few
other
bus
connections
from
Fields
Corner
and
JFK/UMass
that
also
run
to
the
Orange
Line
.
There
is
even
a
bus
(
<hi rend="bold">
#18
</hi>
)
that
runs
up
and
down
Dorchester
Ave
,
but
good
luck
with
that
.
There
are
no
bus
connections
from
Savin
Hill
or
Shamut
stations
.
