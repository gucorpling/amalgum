Nordic

<p>
The

of
all
<ref target="Nordic%20countries">
Nordic

are
quite
similar
,
although
each
country
does
have
its

<head>
Countries
and
regions
</head>
<ref target="Denmark%23Eat">
Denmark
</ref>
is
a
major
exporter
of
dairy
products
,
pork
and
beer
,
and
its
cuisine
has
a
slight
Central
European
flair
.
Danes
have
a
justified
reputation
of
being
more
hedonistic
than
other
Nordic
people
,
eating
greasy
food
,
smoking
,
and
enjoying
more
relaxed
alcohol
laws
than
further
north
.
<ref target="Finland%23Eat">
Finland
's

has
been
influenced
by

with
dishes
such
as

the

<ref target="coffee">

<ref target="Iceland%23Eat">
Iceland
</ref>
is
known
for
fish

lamb
,
and
the
more
spectacular
<hi rend="italic">
Þorramatur

,
a
range
of
cured
fish
and
meat
products
traditionally
eaten
during
winter
.
Likely
the
most
exotic
of
the
Nordic
cuisines
,
Iceland
has
dishes
that
not
everyone
may
want
to
try
,
such
as
lamb
's
head
and
testicles
,
puffin
meat
and
whale

The
<ref target="Faroe%20Islands%23Eat">
Faroe
Islands

have
a
cuisine
rather
similar
to
that
of
Iceland
,
except
it
is
only
the
long-finned
pilot
whale
(
<hi rend="italic">
Globicephala

that
is
a
local
delicacy

<ref target="Norway%23Eat">
Norway
</ref>
also
has
a
heritage
of
seafood
.
As
with
Iceland
,
Norway
has
a
tradition
of
lamb
dishes
.
Norwegians
are
said
to
eat
more
pizza
per
capita
than
people
in
any
other
country
.
Norway
is
one
of
the
few
countries
in
the
world
,
where
it
is
possible
to
eat
whale
at
a
restaurant
.
<ref target="Sweden%23Eat">
Sweden
</ref>
,
being
the
largest
country
in
size
and
population
,
has
at
least
one
&quot;
signature
dish
&quot;
in
all
categories
of
food
.
Some
delicacies
are
freshwater
fish

crayfish

The

Understand
</head>
<p>
Before
modern
times
,
the
majority
of
Nordic
people
had
a
very
limited
range
of
ingredients
,
especially
in
the
far
north
.
Famines
occurred
as
recently
as
the
19th
century
.
While
industrialization
came
late
,
dining
in
the
Nordic
countries
has
become
very
cosmopolitan
in
the
21st
century
.
</p>
<p>
Most
traditional
dishes
are
based
on
what
used
to
be
poor
man
's
food
,
such
as
herring
,
dried
fish
,
potatoes
,
and
hard
bread
,
although
many
have
developed
a
certain
refinement
and
are
now
considered
classy
enough
for
middle
or
even
upper
class
people
to
enjoy
openly
.
