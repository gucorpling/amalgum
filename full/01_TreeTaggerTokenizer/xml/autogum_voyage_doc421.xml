it

You

Many
travelers
stay
for
one
night
in

Doc
and
go
the
next
day
to
Cambodia
.
Several
boats
are
available
,
from
slow
boats
to
fast
boats
.
A
journey
on
a
slow
boat
can
take
up
to
10
hr
to
Phnom
Pehn
,
and
the
quality
of
the
boats
is
not
always
the
best
(
extremely
noisy
engine
,
heavy
vibration
,
a
lot
of
sun
and
no
toilet
can
make
a
10-hr
trip
really
long
)
.
You
can
get
a
visa-on-arrival
at
the
border
,
it
costs
US$
20
or
400,000
dong
(
Feb
2010
)
.
Most
likely
,
some
of
the
tour
operators
will
tell
you
,
that
they
have
to
get
the
visa
for
you
and
that
it
is
now
more
expensive
and
other
lies
(
such
as
the
border
crossing
closes
soon
and
they
will
get
there
faster
with
your
passport
using
a
motorbike
,
etc.
)
but
this
is
not
true
and
you
can
ignore
them
.
Try
not
to
take
to
many
dong
with
you
,
because
the
exchange
rate
you
get
is
not
very
fair
.
There
is
no
ATM
,
so
bring
enough
dollars
with
you
.
At
the
border
,
there
is
a
small
restaurant
,
but
it
is
comparably
expensive
.
You
can
get
take-away
meals
and
a
bottle
of
water
from
restaurants
in
Chau
Doc
if
you
plan
ahead
.
