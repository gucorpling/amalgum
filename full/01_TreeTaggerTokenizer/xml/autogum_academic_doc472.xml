While
most
nAChR
agonists
and
antagonists
binding
at
ACh
orthosteric
sites
are
basic
molecules
with
at
least
one
ionizable
N
,
there
are
exceptions
,
including
lophotoxin
,
the
neonicotinoids
and
some
recently
synthesized
pyrimidine
agonists
.
To
optimize
a
molecule
to
serve
as
a
drug
or
selective
molecular
probe
of
some
receptor
it
is
important
to
identify
the
form
in
which
it
interacts
optimally
with
its
target
.
In
the
case
of
anabaseine
,
our
identification
of
the
cyclic
iminium
form
as
the
most
active
(
and
possibly
the
only
)
form
suggests
that
structural
modifications
that
enhance
the
basicity
of
its
tetrahydropyridyl
nitrogen
will
enhance
potency
and
possibly
selectivity
for
the
intended
receptor
target
.
In
fact
,
a
major
improvement
in
stability
occurs
with
addition
at
the
3-position
of
the
tetrahydropyridyl
ring
of
an
electron-conjugated
system
containing
an
aromatic
ring
,
as
in
3-(4-dimethylaminobenzylidene)-anabaseine
or
3-(2,4-dimethoxybenzylidene)-anabaseine
,
also
called
GTS-21
.
These
anabaseine
derivatives
do
not
undergo
ring
opening
(
hydrolysis
of
the
imine
bond
)
under
physiological
conditions
,
due
to
their
extended
π
electron
conjugation
.
</p>
<p>
Previously
,
it
was
assumed
(
but
not
experimentally
tested
)
that
the
cyclic
iminium
form
of
anabaseine
is
the
one
which
binds
avidly
to
the
ACh
binding
site
in
nAChRs
.
This
form
was
modeled
to
fit
into
a
muscle
type
homology
model
.
The
crystal
structure
of
the
molluscan
acetylcholine
binding
protein
binding
anabaseine
actually
was
derived
from
crystals
containing
both
the
cyclic
iminium
and
the
open-chain
monocationic
form
of
anabaseine
occupying
some
of
the
five
identical
binding
sites
.
Unlike
the
cyclic
iminium
,
the
ammonium-ketone
form
ammonium
group
did
not
insert
into
the
“
aromatic
box
.
”
In
the
preparation
of
the
AChBP-anabaseine
crystals
very
high
anabaseine
concentrations
were
used
so
that
most
of
the
five
sites
would
be
occupied
;
therefore
the
presence
of
the
ammonium-ketone
form
in
the
crystal
structure
does
not
necessarily
indicate
that
this
form
of
anabaseine
would
bind
to
AChBPs
and
nAChRs
at
the
low
concentrations
of
anabaseine
that
occur
in
our
in
vitro
functional
and
binding
studies
.
</p>
<p>
The
ability
of
a
variety
of
2-(aryl)-1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrmidines
to
block
neuromuscular
nAChRs
and
produce
teratogenic
effects
in
chick
embryos
was
reported
long
ago
.
Some
of
these
compounds
were
reported
to
be
nAChR
agonists
.
The
only
study
of
PTHP
on
neurons
was
that
of
Upshall
et
al.
on
leech
Retzius
cells
.
Our
results
also
indicate
that
PTHP
is
a
potent
agonist
at
neuronal
as
well
as
neuromuscular
nAChRs
.
The
2-aryl
compounds
reported
in
the
Brimblecombe
et
al.
study
did
not
include
PTHP
or
other
compounds
having
a
2-(3-pyridyl)-
substituent
,
which
is
known
to
be
essential
for
the
agonist
activity
of
nicotine
and
of
anabaseine
.
For
PTHP
to
be
equipotent
with
anabaseine
,
based
on
the
I+
form
being
the
only
active
form
,
its
EC50
would
need
to
be
~1/3
of
the
EC50
of
anabaseine
,
since
the
anabaseine
(
I+
)
is
~1/3
of
its
total
concentration
.
The
data
for
PTHP
and
anabaseine
in
<figure>
Figure
3
</figure>
and
<figure>
Figure
4
</figure>
and
in
Table
1
,
indicate
that
PTHP
has
approximately
30
%
of
the
potency
predicted
for
the
anabaseine
cyclic
iminium
form
.
One
possible
explanation
for
this
slightly
inferior
potency
is
that
the
additional
N
on
the
tetrahydropyrmidinyl
ring
must
form
an
H
bond
with
some
other
atom
within
the
aromatic
box
of
the
nAChR
orthosteric
binding
site
and
this
may
be
energetically
unfavorable
.
</p>
<p>
While
2,3′-bipyridyl
displayed
only
a
marginal
potency
at
vertebrate
receptors
that
could
be
predicted
from
its
pKa
,
it
has
been
found
to
be
quite
paralytic
to
insects
and
crustaceans
.
At
least
some
arthropod
nAChRs
are
known
to
not
require
a
cationic
ligand
for
activation
,
as
shown
by
many
studies
with
neonicotinoid
insecticides
such
as
imidachloprid
.
These
neonicotinoids
also
display
a
limited
activity
at
vertebrate
nAChRs
.
It
seems
likely
that
2,3′-bipyridyl
affects
some
arthropod
nAChRs
through
its
unionized
form
.
</p>
<p>
One
can
speculate
as
to
what
advantage(s)
might
accrue
to
an
organism
(
in
this
case
,
a
hoplonemertine
or
ant
)
to
produce
and
secrete
an
imine-bond
containing
toxin
like
anabaseine
.
The
entire
body
wall
integument
as
well
as
the
contiguous
epithelium
of
the
anterior
proboscis
of
<hi rend="italic">
P.
peregrina
</hi>
contains
very
high
concentrations
of
anabaseine
.
The
proboscis
everts
and
wraps
around
the
prey
during
its
capture
allowing
extensive
contact
of
this
epithelium
with
its
annelid
prey
.
The
mineralized
stylet
of
the
proboscis
can
be
observed
to
produce
multiple
punctures
of
the
prey
integument
,
which
should
further
facilitate
envenomation
.
In
addition
,
potential
predators
will
also
be
exposed
in
these
ways
to
anabaseine
and
related
alkaloids
.
Perhaps
a
major
advantage
of
possessing
an
imine
bond
,
besides
an
enhanced
affinity
for
the
nAChR
orthosteric
site
,
is
its
low
basicity
,
which
allows
the
unionized
form
to
reach
a
relatively
high
concentration
in
the
neutral
pH
range
of
the
marine
environment
and
thereby
enhance
passive
diffusion
across
the
integument
of
the
prey
or
predator
.
The
integument
of
a
marine
organism
exposed
to
sea
water
is
likely
to
have
a
pH
near
8
,
well
above
the
pH
range
in
which
anabaseine
is
primarily
ionized
.
Thus
,
the
toxin
has
a
much
better
chance
of
entering
the
prey/predator
than
would
anabaseine
,
the
more
basic
secondary
amine
analog
of
anabaseine
.
