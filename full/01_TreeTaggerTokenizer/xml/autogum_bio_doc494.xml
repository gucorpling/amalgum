In

the

'
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Topcliffe">
Richard

was
informed
by
a
spy
that
Father
Jones
had
visited
two
Catholics
and
had
said
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_(liturgy)">
Mass

in
their
home
.
It
was
later
shown
that
the
two
Catholics
were
actually
in
prison
when
the
alleged
offense
took
place
.
Regardless
,
Jones
was
arrested
,
severely
tortured
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scourge">
scourged
</ref>
.
Topcliffe
then
took
Jones
to
his
house
where
he
was
further
tortured
,
&quot;
To
him
(
Topcliffe
)
was
granted
the
privilege
,
unique
in
the
laws
of
England
,
or
,
perhaps
,
of
any
country
,
of
maintaining
a
private
rack
in
his
own
home
for
the
more
convenient
examination
of
prisoners
.

Following
his
torture
,
Jones
was
imprisoned
for
nearly
two
years
.
During
this
time
Jones
helped
sustain

On

July
1598
Father
Jones
was
tried
on
the
charge
of

going

seas
in
the

there
being

and
then
returning
to

contrary
to

He

Historian
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hungerford_Pollen_(Jesuit)">

suggests
that
it
was
written
by

further
suggests
that

could
be
Robert

Execution
</head>
<p>
As
by
this
time
the
people
had
grown
tired
of
these
butcheries
,
the
execution
was
arranged
for
an
early
hour
in
the
morning
.
The
place
was
St.
Thomas
's
Watering
,
a
small
bridge
over
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neckinger">
Neckinger
</ref>
crossing
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Kent_Road">
Old
Kent
Road
</ref>
,
at
the
site
of
the
junction
of
the
old
Roman
road
to
London
with
the
main
line
of
Watling
Street
.
This
marked
the
boundary
of
the
City
of
London
's
authority
;
it
was
also
a
place
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbets">
gibbets
</ref>
.
The
execution
was
delayed
by
about
an
hour
because
the
hangman
forgot
to
bring
a
rope
.
Jones
used
the
time
to
preach
to
the
people
and
answer
their
questions
.

When
the
time
came
to
draw
away
the
cart
,
the
hangman
whipped
the
horses
;
but
they
were
held
back
by
three
or
four
fellows
till
Jones
had
finished
what
he
was
saying
.

John
Jones
'
dismembered
remains
were
fixed
atop
poles
on
roads
leading

His
remains

later
reputedly
removed
by
at
least
two
Catholic
Englishmen

one
of
whom
suffered
a
long
imprisonment
