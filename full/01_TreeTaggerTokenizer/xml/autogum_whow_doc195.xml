Steps
</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Think
of
why
he
may
be
acting
the
way
that
he
is
.
Is
he
uncomfortable
with
the
relationship
?
Perhaps
you
said
something
to
him
that
he
took
the
wrong
way
?
Did
you
marry
his
mother
right
after
causing
the
death
of
his
father
?
These
are
all
good
questions
to
ask
yourself
in
trying
to
assess
your
relationship
and
understand
your
new
step
son
.
</item>
<item>
Since
you
are
new
to
the
child
,
let
them
set
the
pace
of
the
relationship
.
Younger
children
may
be
quicker
to
bond
with
you
,
while
older
children
may
be
more
reluctant
to
get
close
.
Do
n’t
force
them
to
become
close
to
you
,
as
you
cannot
force
trust
or
love
.
Remember
that
you
are
not
their
real
parent
and
that
they
will
still
feel
devoted
to
the
biological
parent
that
you
have
replaced
.
They
may
also
only
listen
to
your
spouse
before
warming
up
to
you
.
Do
not
begin
calling
them
“
son
”
or
“
daughter
.
”
Let
the
relationship
grow
before
jumping
into
that
.
</item>
<item>
Do
be
strong
in
the
household
,
whether
they
listen
to
you
or
not
.
Make
sure
the
stepchild
knows
that
they
are
to
respect
you
and
are
not
free
to
do
whatever
they
please
.
Your
spouse
should
have
your
back
and
do
their
best
to
encourage
the
child
to
cooperate
.
Enforce
the
rules
.
If
they
do
not
listen
to
you
,
let
them
suffer
the
consequences
.
Appropriate
punishments
would
be
grounding
them
or
not
letting
them
do
a
fun
thing
.
Plotting
to
kill
your
stepchild
may
be
too
much
.
</item>
<item>
Do
n’t
let
your
new
stepchild
feel
rejected
by
you
.
How
you
act
towards
them
will
seem
amplified
.
If
you
get
angry
,
it
will
feel
stronger
than
what
they
receive
from
their
parents
.
Make
sure
that
your
stepchild
understand
why
you
’re
angry
with
them
.
Ask
them
questions
to
make
them
feel
heard
and
understood
.
Children
do
n’t
like
to
feel
unloved
,
and
they
are
quick
to
feel
rejected
.
How
you
treat
them
in
the
beginning
can
have
a
huge
impact
on
your
future
relationship
.
