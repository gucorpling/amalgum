&quot;
The
major
label
system
sometimes
does
n't
allow
for
outside
&quot;
help
&quot;
to
get
involved
,
meaning
that
we
do
n't
get
to
choose
who
we
wanna
work
with
.
That
can
be
a
pretty
terrible
thing
and
bad
things
will
surely
come
of
it

This
interview
may
be
something
different
than
you
guys
are
used
to
,
because
although
the
questions
will
be
about
your
music
,
they
will
be
more
about
the
both
of
you
.
They
are
surveys
of
the
landscape
.
For
instance
,
in
the
last
week
I
have
interviews

proprietors
