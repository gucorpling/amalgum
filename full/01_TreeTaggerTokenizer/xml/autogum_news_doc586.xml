A
full
crowd
showed
up
at
the
Stade
de
Gerland
in
Lyon
earlier
today
,
only
to
watch
their
home
side
fall
to
Roma
of
Italy
.
The
previous
leg
in
the
series
saw
the
two
teams
draw
0-0
which
gave
Roma
a
slight
advantage
from
the
start
,
as
a
draw
would
allow
them
to
advance
.
The
previous
match
was
extremely
undisciplined
,
and
Roma
was
given
eight
yellow
cards
.
The
Italian
side
showed
a
much
calmer
demeanor
this
game
,
earning
only
two
yellows
in
comparison
to
Lyon
's
four
.
</p>
<p>
Lyon
produced
the
first
chance
of
the
game
as
Romas
keeper
Alexandre
Doni
was
unable
to
cope
with
Juninho
,
but
defender
Philippe
Mexes
was
able
to
clear
the
ball
from
nearby
strikers
.
Roma
had
their
own
chance
soon
after
,
as
Daniele
De
Rossi
was
left
open
,
and
he
headed
the
ball
home
.
The
goal
was
disallowed
by
the
referee
after
he
spotted
a
push
by
De
Rossi
on
Eric
Abidal
.
Juninho
continued
to
threaten
Roma
,
but
his
crosses
were
not
able
to
do
any
damage
to
the
Rossinari
.
Lyon
fell
behind
on
22
minutes
when
Max
Tonetto
clipped
a
cross
into
the
middle
,
and
Francesco
Totti
was
in
the
right
place
to
head
the
ball
past
Gregory
Coupet
.
Crosses
continued
to
be
the
only
attack
Lyon
could
muster
,
and
they
produced
a
good
chance
off
a
Juninho
corner
kick
.
The
ball
ricoched
off
several
players
before
Squillaci
latch
on
for
a
shot
,
but
the
ball
was
sent
directly
at
Doni
,
and
the
keeper
made
the
save
.
Mancini
then
doubled
the
visitors
lead
just
before
halftime
.
After
some
quick
stepovers
to
fool
Anthony
Reveillere
,
he
struck
the
ball
soundly
into
the
top
corner
of
the
net
.
</p>
<p>
After
the
break
,
Roma
could
have
killed
off
the
game
indefinitely
,
as
Tadei
beat
Lyon
's
offside
trap
,
but
was
unable
to
regain
the
composure
required
to
smash
the
ball
home
.
Doni
then
produced
a
few
saves
for
Roma
,
kicking
out
Sylvan
Wiltord
's
shot
,
and
then
diving
to
palm
away
a
curling
shot
by
Juninho
.
Both
teams
then
made
vain
attempts
for
a
penalty
,
but
both
Fred
and
Perrotta
diving
,
but
the
referee
made
the
right
decisions
and
awarded
only
a
yellow
to
Perrotta
.
Fred
was
then
given
a
yellow
for
cruelly
smashing
Chivu
in
the
face
with
his
arm
.
Fred
was
lucky
to
receive
a
red
for
his
actions
.
Roma
held
on
for
the
win
,
and
the
5
time
french
champions
bowed
out
of
the
Champions
League
.
