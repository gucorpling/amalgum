For
a
moment
Tarzan
thought
that
by
some
strange
freak
of
fate
a
miracle
had
saved
him
,
but
when
he
realized
the
ease
with
which
the
girl
had
,
single-handed
,
beaten
off
twenty
gorilla-like
males
,
and
an
instant
later
,
as
he
saw
them
again
take
up
their
dance
about
him
while
she
addressed
them
in
a
singsong
monotone
,
which
bore
every
evidence
of
rote
,
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
all
but
a
part
of
the
ceremony
of
which
he
was
the
central
figure
.
</p>
<p>
After
a
moment
or
two
the
girl
drew
a
knife
from
her
girdle
,
and
,
leaning
over
Tarzan
,
cut
the
bonds
from
his
legs
.
Then
,
as
the
men
stopped
their
dance
,
and
approached
,
she
motioned
to
him
to
rise
.
Placing
the
rope
that
had
been
about
his
legs
around
his
neck
,
she
led
him
across
the
courtyard
,
the
men
following
in
twos
.
</p>
<p>
Through
winding
corridors
she
led
,
farther
and
farther
into
the
remoter
precincts
of
the
temple
,
until
they
came
to
a
great
chamber
in
the
center
of
which
stood
an
altar
.
Then
it
was
that
Tarzan
translated
the
strange
ceremony
that
had
preceded
his
introduction
into
this
holy
of
holies
.
</p>
<p>
He
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
descendants
of
the
ancient
sun
worshippers
.
His
seeming
rescue
by
a
votaress
of
the
high
priestess
of
the
sun
had
been
but
a
part
of
the
mimicry
of
their
heathen
ceremony
--
the
sun
looking
down
upon
him
through
the
opening
at
the
top
of
the
court
had
claimed
him
as
his
own
,
and
the
priestess
had
come
from
the
inner
temple
to
save
him
from
the
polluting
hands
of
worldlings
--
to
save
him
as
a
human
offering
to
their
flaming
deity
.
</p>
<p>
And
had
he
needed
further
assurance
as
to
the
correctness
of
his
theory
he
had
only
to
cast
his
eyes
upon
the
brownish-red
stains
that
caked
the
stone
altar
and
covered
the
floor
in
its
immediate
vicinity
,
or
to
the
human
skulls
which
grinned
from
countless
niches
in
the
towering
walls
.
</p>
<p>
The
priestess
led
the
victim
to
the
altar
steps
.
Again
the
galleries
above
filled
with
watchers
,
while
from
an
arched
doorway
at
the
east
end
of
the
chamber
a
procession
of
females
filed
slowly
into
the
room
.
They
wore
,
like
the
men
,
only
skins
of
wild
animals
caught
about
their
waists
with
rawhide
belts
or
chains
of
gold
;
but
the
black
masses
of
their
hair
were
incrusted
with
golden
headgear
composed
of
many
circular
and
oval
pieces
of
gold
ingeniously
held
together
to
form
a
metal
cap
from
which
depended
at
each
side
of
the
head
,
long
strings
of
oval
pieces
falling
to
the
waist
.
</p>
<p>
The
females
were
more
symmetrically
proportioned
than
the
males
,
their
features
were
much
more
perfect
,
the
shapes
of
their
heads
and
their
large
,
soft
,
black
eyes
denoting
far
greater
intelligence
and
humanity
than
was
possessed
by
their
lords
and
masters
.
</p>
<p>
Each
priestess
bore
two
golden
cups
,
and
as
they
formed
in
line
along
one
side
of
the
altar
the
men
formed
opposite
them
,
advancing
and
taking
each
a
cup
from
the
female
opposite
.
Then
the
chant
began
once
more
,
and
presently
from
a
dark
passageway
beyond
the
altar
another
female
emerged
from
the
cavernous
depths
beneath
the
chamber
.
</p>
<p>
The
high
priestess
,
thought
Tarzan
.
She
was
a
young
woman
with
a
rather
intelligent
and
shapely
face
.
Her
ornaments
were
similar
to
those
worn
by
her
votaries
,
but
much
more
elaborate
,
many
being
set
with
diamonds
.
Her
bare
arms
and
legs
were
almost
concealed
by
the
massive
,
bejeweled
ornaments
which
covered
them
,
while
her
single
leopard
skin
was
supported
by
a
close-fitting
girdle
of
golden
rings
set
in
strange
designs
with
innumerable
small
diamonds
.
In
the
girdle
she
carried
a
long
,
jeweled
knife
,
and
in
her
hand
a
slender
wand
in
lieu
of
a
bludgeon
.
</p>
<p>
As
she
advanced
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
altar
she
halted
,
and
the
chanting
ceased
.
The
priests
and
priestesses
knelt
before
her
,
while
with
wand
extended
above
them
she
recited
a
long
and
tiresome
prayer
.
Her
voice
was
soft
and
musical
--
Tarzan
could
scarce
realize
that
its
possessor
in
a
moment
more
would
be
transformed
by
the
fanatical
ecstasy
of
religious
zeal
into
a
wild-eyed
and
bloodthirsty
executioner
,
who
,
with
dripping
knife
,
would
be
the
first
to
drink
her
victim
's
red
,
warm
blood
from
the
little
golden
cup
that
stood
upon
the
altar
.
</p>
<p>
As
she
finished
her
prayer
she
let
her
eyes
rest
for
the
first
time
upon
Tarzan
.
With
every
indication
of
considerable
curiosity
she
examined
him
from
head
to
foot
.
Then
she
addressed
him
,
and
when
she
had
finished
stood
waiting
,
as
though
she
expected
a
reply
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
do
not
understand
your
language
,
&quot;
said
Tarzan
.
&quot;
Possibly
we
may
speak
together
in
another
tongue
?
&quot;
But
she
could
not
understand
him
,
though
he
tried
French
,
English
,
Arab
,
Waziri
,
and
,
as
a
last
resort
,
the
mongrel
tongue
of
the
West
Coast
.
</p>
<p>
She
shook
her
head
,
and
it
seemed
that
there
was
a
note
of
weariness
in
her
voice
as
she
motioned
to
the
priests
to
continue
with
the
rites
.
These
now
circled
in
a
repetition
of
their
idiotic
dance
,
which
was
terminated
finally
at
a
command
from
the
priestess
,
who
had
stood
throughout
,
still
looking
intently
upon
Tarzan
.
</p>
<p>
At
her
signal
the
priests
rushed
upon
the
ape-man
,
and
,
lifting
him
bodily
,
laid
him
upon
his
back
across
the
altar
,
his
head
hanging
over
one
edge
,
his
legs
over
the
opposite
.
Then
they
and
the
priestesses
formed
in
two
lines
,
with
their
little
golden
cups
in
readiness
to
capture
a
share
of
the
victim
's
lifeblood
after
the
sacrificial
knife
had
accomplished
its
work
.
