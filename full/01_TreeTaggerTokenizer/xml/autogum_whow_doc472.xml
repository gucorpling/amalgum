Grow
Dandelions
</head>
<p>
Dandelions
are
known
for
their
bright
yellow
flowers
,
dark
green
leaves
,
and
seed-spreading
puffballs
that
children
love
to
blow
on
!
While
they
are
largely
considered
to
be
weeds
,
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Harvest_Dandelions">
dandelions
can
be
harvested
</ref>
and
used
in
many
ways
,
and
may
possibly
have
some
health
benefits
.
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Eat-Dandelions">
Dandelions
are
edible
</ref>
from
root
to
flower
,
and
people
often
use
them
in
herbal
medicine
to
treat
conditions
of
the
liver
,
bile
ducts
,
and
gallbladder
,
as
well
as
for
minor
problems
like
bloating
and
indigestion
.
Start
growing
dandelions
in
your
garden
or
in
pots
to
ensure
that
you
always
have
a
supply
of
these
useful
plants
on
hand

Planting
Dandelion
Seeds
</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Gather
or
purchase
some
seeds
.
Dandelions
grow
wild
and
you
can
easily
harvest
their
seeds
when
the
plant
is
in
the
seed
phase
.
This
is
when
the
top
of
the
plant
looks
like
a
puffball
.
Each
of
the
little
feathery
strands
has
a
seed
attached
to
it
,
so
you
can
collect
these
in
a
bag
or
other
small
container
and
take
them
home
for
planting
.
If
you
prefer
to
purchase
dandelion
seeds
,
then
check
your
local
garden
center
or
look
for
seeds
online
.

Wild
dandelion
greens
may
have
a
bitter
taste
,
while
cultivated
dandelion
greens
will
not
be
as
bitter
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Choose
a
sunny
location
to
grow
your
dandelions
.
Dandelions
do
best
when
they
have
full
sunlight
for
a
large
part
of
the
day
,
so
choose
a
sunny
location
in
your
garden
or
plan
to
place
potted
dandelions
in
a
sunny
window
.
Try
going
out
in
your
yard
a
few
times
throughout
the
day
to
scope
out
the
sunniest
spot
.
<figure rend="Grow Dandelions Step 2.jpg">

<item>
For
example
,
you
could
go
outside
at
8
am
,
12
pm
,
and
4
pm
and
note
where
the
sun
is
at
by
placing
a
few
rocks
on
the
edges
of
where
the
sun
is
shining
.
</item>
<item>
If
you
will
mainly
be
using
dandelions
for
their
leaves
,
then
growing
them
in
partial
shade
is
a
better
option
.
This
will
help
to
reduce
the
bitterness
of
the
leaves
and
the
number
of
flowers
it
produces
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Sow
the
seeds
for
flowers
or
greens
.
The
dandelion
seed
will
need
to
be
apart
for
flowers
and
apart
for
greens
.
Flowers
will
need
more
room
than
baby
dandelion
greens
because
they
will
have
deeper
roots
.
Measure
the
distance
between
your
seeds
to
ensure
that
they
will
have
plenty
of
room
.
<figure rend="Grow Dandelions Step 3.jpg">

<list type="unordered">
<item>
Leave
the
seeds
uncovered
if
you
are
planting
indoors
.
</item>
<item>
You
will
not
need
to
worry
about
the
seeds
getting
blown
out
.
Dandelions
do
best
in
a
shallow
bed
.
</item>
<item>
Do
not
plant
your
dandelions
in
an
area
with
poor
drainage
or
a
tightly
packed
soil
,
such
as
clay
.
</item>
<item>
Use
a
garden
fork
to
loosen
the
soil
before
you
plant
if
it
is
tightly
packed
.
Use
a
loosely
packed
potting
soil
with
added
compost
as
the
growing
medium
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Water
the
dandelions
regularly
.
Dandelions
need
a
lot
of
water
to
thrive
,
so
plan
to
water
them
regularly
.
However
,
do
not
water
them
too
much
.
Water
just
enough
so
that
the
soil
feels
moist
.
Check
the
soil
by
poking
your
finger
into
it
once
every
2
to
3
days
.
If
the
soil
feels
moist
,
then
they
do
not
need
water
yet
.
If
it
feels
dry
,
then
give
them
some
water
.

Harvesting
Dandelions
</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Cut
leaves
near
the
base
of
the
plant
.
Use
a
sharp
pair
of
garden
shears
to
snip
the
leaves
away
from
the
base
of
the
plant
.
Cut
as
many
individual
leaves
as
needed
or
cut
the
entire
rosette
of
greens
from
the
root
.
You
may
also
leave
the
smaller
leaves
to
continue
growing
if
desired
.
<figure rend="Grow Dandelions Step 5.jpg">

<list type="unordered">
<item>
You
can
harvest
the
dandelion
greens
when
they
are
small
for
the
mildest
flavor
,
or
wait
until
they
are
larger
if
you
prefer
a
bitter
flavor
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Cut
flowers
when
they
have
just
opened
.
If
left
too
long
,
dandelion
flowers
will
convert
to
seed
distributing
puffballs
.
This
means
that
you
might
end
up
with
an
infestation
of
dandelions
rather
than
a
controlled
crop
of
them
.
To
prevent
this
from
happening
,
cut
the
dandelion
flowers
right
after
they
bloom
.
Use
a
pair
of
sharp
garden
shears
to
cut
the
flowers
at
the
base
of
the
stem
near
the
leaves
.

You
can
cut
the
flower
from
the
stem
after
harvesting
and
discard
the
stems
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Dig
up
roots
after
the
flowers
have
bloomed
.
The
roots
of
the
dandelion
should
be
large
enough
to
harvest
after
the
flowers
have
bloomed
,
but
you
can
even
harvest
roots
of
dandelions
that
have
gone
to
seed
.
To
harvest
the
roots
,
insert
a
garden
spade
into
the
ground
about
from
the
base
of
the
dandelion
.
Dig
around
the
dandelion
to
loosen
the
dirt
and
make
it
easier
to
pull
up
,
and
then
pull
the
dandelion
root
out
of
the
ground
.

You
may
be
able
to
pull
up
younger
dandelion
roots
without
digging
since
they
tend
to
be
shallower
than
mature
ones
.
</item>
<item>
Dandelions
are
perennials
in
most
climates
.
Leave
the
plant
in
place
if
you
want
to
have
it
come
back
every
year

Add
fresh
dandelion
greens
to
salads
,
smoothies
,
and
stir-fry
dishes
.
Young
,
small
dandelion
greens
,
also
known
as
baby
dandelion
greens
,
are
mild
in
flavor
,
so
they
are
great
in
salads
and
smoothies
.
However
,
mature
dandelion
greens
(
larger
ones
)
will
taste
best
if
you
stir-fry
them
with
other
ingredients
and
seasonings
,
because
they
can
have
a
bitter
flavor
.
