<p>
I
'd
like
to
wait
a
little
while
with
defining
what
a
next
project
would
look
like
.
Given
the
constraints
of
&quot;
organizing
projects
to
improve
open
source
development
&quot;
,
we
might
have
not
much
choice
either
.
It
would
probably
mean
to
work
with
a
new
team
each
time
,
so
most
likely
be
based
on
shorts
only
.
On
the
other
hand
,
there
's
also
clear
signals
that
this
approach
works
well
,
and
creates
excitement
and
involvement
of
a
lot
of
people
,
also
from
producers
and
sponsors
.
That
might
enable
us
to
set
up
a
next
project
based
on
larger
targets
.
For
a
full-length
feature
film
however
,
we
should
involve
a
sufficient
amount
of
experienced
film
makers
as
well
,
and/or
invite
the
first
team
to
participate
again
.
That
would
put
a
lot
of
pressure
on
the
required
budget
…
.
You
ca
n't
do
that
based
on
a
1000
DVD
pre-sale
target
.
Would
more
be
like
20,000
or
so
…

How
did
the
process
of
making
the
movie
feed
back
into
the
development
of
Blender
?
Are
there
major
technical
changes
that
were
made
only
or
primarily
because
of
the
film
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
Already
during
the
pre-production
phase
the
artists
have
defined
the
key
targets
for
Blender
development
.
This
then
was
coordinated
with
the
online
development
community
too
.
I
've
done
the
most
crucial
(
re-)development
mostly
myself
,
though
.
Especially
on
the
character
animation
tools
,
on
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rendering%20pipeline">
rendering
pipeline
</ref>
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/compositing">
compositing
</ref>
tools
.
</p>
<p>
It
is
especially
the
latter
I
'm
most
satisfied
with
.
In
3D
movie
production
the
compositing
stage
creates
a
giant
content
bottleneck
.
By
transparently
integrating
this
in
our
render-pipeline
,
a
very
efficient
workflow
has
been
achieved
.
And
,
not
to
forget
,
Blender
now
also
offers
the
first
production-level
open
source
compositor
on
the
market
!
</p>
<p>
The
current
summary
you
can
find
in
our

What
are
the
key
technical
features
in
Blender
you
want
to
add
or
improve
for
future
movie
projects
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
Depends
on
what
the
movie
is
about
!
There
's
always
hundreds
of
features
you
can
work
on
.
However
,
we
'll
have
to
work
on
that
anyway
,
movie
project
or
not
.
There
's
a
lot
of
professionals
using
Blender
<hi rend="italic">
now
</hi>
,
and
they
ca
n't
wait
for
the
Blender
Foundation
to
do
movies
!
Look
at
this
studio
for
example
:

<hi rend="bold">
I
read
that
at
least
one
proprietary
software
package
,
Reaktor
,
was
used
for
the
sound
effects
.
Is
this
because
no
equivalent
free
software
solution
exists
yet
?
Will
future
projects
have
a
&quot;
free
software
only
&quot;
policy
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
We
've
limited
the
&quot;
Open
Source
tools
&quot;
requirement
to
our
own
Studio
Orange
only
.
That
was
what
we
could
keep
in
control
at
least
,
and
I
can
tell
you
it
was
not
always
easy
even
...
:
)
</p>
<p>
For
sound
and
music
we
've
decided
from
the
beginning
to
seek
an
external
sponsor
.
We
have
chosen
to
work
with
the
best
quality
studio
and
composer
we
could
find
,
preferably
using
open
source
,
but
not
as
a
prerequisite
.
