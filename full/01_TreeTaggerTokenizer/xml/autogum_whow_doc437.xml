Host
a
Party
in
an
Apartment
Without
Getting
Busted
or
Thrown
Out
</head>
<p>
It
's
happened
to
everyone
.
You
've
hosted
a
party
,
favorite
lite
beverage
in
hand
,
drinking
games
‘
round
the
round
table
,
and
some
intense
music
that
was
carrying
to
the
building
over
,
when
suddenly
around
3:20
a.
m.
,
a
knock
at
the
door
by
the
local
“
proud
to
protect
and
serve
”
asking
you
to
break
it
up
(
and
shut
it
up
)
.
Time
to
think
on
a
better
party-throwing
method
to
head
off
homelessness
.
Be
sure
and
keep
these

in
mind
before
you
throw
another
busted
party

Have
a
plan
.
This
may
be
a
bit
more
difficult
than
simply
calling
everyone
up
at
7
p.m.
for
a
party
at
9
,
but
it
's
well
worth
it
.

Do
n't
order
a
lot
of
delivery
food
.
If
the
apartment
building
does
n't
allow
parties
,
it
's
a
dead
giveaway
when
the
pizza
man
shows
up
with
ten
large
pizzas
if
only
two
people
are
supposed
to
be
living
in
your
room
!

Have
your
party
at
an
earlier
time
.
Parties
from
6pm
to
10pm
are
much
less
likely
to
have
the
cops
called
than
a
party
from
8pm
to
2am
.

Prepare
the
neighbors
.
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Avoid_Offending_Uninvited_Guests">
Explain
to
them
beforehand
of
the
party

,
and
if
appropriate
:
Invite
them
!

Take
it
outside
.
This
may
seem
counter-intuitive
.
Not
necessarily
.
A
party
by
the
pool
or
a
grill-out
can
often
remain
a
tad
calmer
than
a
party
without
all
the
outdoor
distraction
.
Even
better-Plan
a
midnight
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Play_Volleyball">
volleyball
</ref>
or
dodgeball
game
in
a
park
close
to
the
homestead
and
bring
glow
sticks…only
Bambi
and
Thumper
will
be
kept
awake
,
and
as
long
as
you
do
n’t
have
a
giant
strobe
light
,
you
should
be
fine
.
Extra
hint
:
Stay
clear
of
glass
bottles
.
Most
parks
do
n’t
allow
them
.

Plan
a
dinner
party
.
Kidding
.
But
,
it
may
worth
taking
the
party
to
a
cheap
nearby
Bar
and
Grill
with
live
music
or
a
juke
box
.
A
good
group
of
friends
,
great
food
,
and
a
little
music
always
means
awesome
times
.
And
the
clincher
of
the
whole
thing
:
NO
CLEANUP
!

Plan
a
beginning
with
the
end
in
mind
.
Mom
used
to
say
that
nothing
good
happens
after
midnight
.
She
obviously
has
never
been
to
a
slamming
after-party
.
Like
tip
#
4
,
you
want
to
go
out
on
the
town
,
but
still
want
to
play
host
a
little
at
your
place
.
Not
a
problem
.
If
you
really
want
to
insure
that
you
wo
n’t
have
to
lay
your
head
next
to
Gary
,
the
guy
under
the
bridge
,
take
mom
’s
advice
a
little
and
invite
friends
to
pre-party
instead
of
an
after
party
.
Then
head
out
on
the
town
around
11
p.m.
What
this
accomplishes
?
An
awesome
start
to
a
night
out
by
showing
off
your
digs
,
and
playing
host
without
upsetting
the
neighbors
.
