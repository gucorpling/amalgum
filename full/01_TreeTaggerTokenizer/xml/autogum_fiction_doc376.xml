CHAPTER
II
</head>
<p>
His
friend
the
Editor
turned
to
him
squarely
.
“
Willie
took
me
into
consultation
,
and
since
he
seems
to
have
let
you
in
I
may
just
as
well
tell
you
what
is
up
.
I
shall
try
to
be
as
short
as
I
can
.
But
in
confidence
—
mind
!
”
</p>
<p>
He
waited
.
Renouard
,
his
uneasiness
growing
on
him
unreasonably
,
assented
by
a
nod
,
and
the
other
lost
no
time
in
beginning
.
Professor
Moorsom
—
physicist
and
philosopher
—
fine
head
of
white
hair
,
to
judge
from
the
photographs
—
plenty
of
brains
in
the
head
too
—
all
these
famous
books
—
surely
even
Renouard
would
know
.
.
.
.
</p>
<p>
Renouard
muttered
moodily
that
it
was
n’t
his
sort
of
reading
,
and
his
friend
hastened
to
assure
him
earnestly
that
neither
was
it
his
sort
—
except
as
a
matter
of
business
and
duty
,
for
the
literary
page
of
that
newspaper
which
was
his
property
(
and
the
pride
of
his
life
)
.
The
only
literary
newspaper
in
the
Antipodes
could
not
ignore
the
fashionable
philosopher
of
the
age
.
Not
that
anybody
read
Moorsom
at
the
Antipodes
,
but
everybody
had
heard
of
him
—
women
,
children
,
dock
labourers
,
cabmen
.
The
only
person
(
besides
himself
)
who
had
read
Moorsom
,
as
far
as
he
knew
,
was
old
Dunster
,
who
used
to
call
himself
a
Moorsomian
(
or
was
it
Moorsomite
)
years
and
years
ago
,
long
before
Moorsom
had
worked
himself
up
into
the
great
swell
he
was
now
,
in
every
way
.
.
.
Socially
too
.
Quite
the
fashion
in
the
highest
world
.
</p>
<p>
Renouard
listened
with
profoundly
concealed
attention
.
“
A
charlatan
,
”
he
muttered
languidly
.
</p>
<p>
“
Well
—
no
.
I
should
say
not
.
I
should
n’t
wonder
though
if
most
of
his
writing
had
been
done
with
his
tongue
in
his
cheek
.
Of
course
.
That
’s
to
be
expected
.
I
tell
you
what
:
the
only
really
honest
writing
is
to
be
found
in
newspapers
and
nowhere
else
—
and
do
n’t
you
forget
it
.
”
</p>
<p>
The
Editor
paused
with
a
basilisk
stare
till
Renouard
had
conceded
a
casual
:
“
I
dare
say
,
”
and
only
then
went
on
to
explain
that
old
Dunster
,
during
his
European
tour
,
had
been
made
rather
a
lion
of
in
London
,
where
he
stayed
with
the
Moorsoms
—
he
meant
the
father
and
the
girl
.
The
professor
had
been
a
widower
for
a
long
time
.
</p>
<p>
“
She
does
n’t
look
just
a
girl
,
”
muttered
Renouard
.
The
other
agreed
.
Very
likely
not
.
Had
been
playing
the
London
hostess
to
tip-top
people
ever
since
she
put
her
hair
up
,
probably
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
do
n’t
expect
to
see
any
girlish
bloom
on
her
when
I
do
have
the
privilege
,
”
he
continued
.
“
Those
people
are
staying
with
the
Dunster
’s
<hi rend="italic">
incog
.
</hi>
,
in
a
manner
,
you
understand
—
something
like
royalties
.
They
do
n’t
deceive
anybody
,
but
they
want
to
be
left
to
themselves
.
We
have
even
kept
them
out
of
the
paper
—
to
oblige
old
Dunster
.
But
we
shall
put
your
arrival
in
—
our
local
celebrity
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Heavens
!
”
</p>
<p>
“
Yes
.
Mr.
G.
Renouard
,
the
explorer
,
whose
indomitable
energy
,
etc.
,
and
who
is
now
working
for
the
prosperity
of
our
country
in
another
way
on
his
Malata
plantation
.
.
.
And
,
by
the
by
,
how
’s
the
silk
plant
—
flourishing
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Yes
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Did
you
bring
any
fibre
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Schooner-full
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
see
.
To
be
transhipped
to
Liverpool
for
experimental
manufacture
,
eh
?
Eminent
capitalists
at
home
very
much
interested
,
are
n’t
they
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
They
are
.
”
</p>
<p>
A
silence
fell
.
Then
the
Editor
uttered
slowly
—
“
You
will
be
a
rich
man
some
day
.
”
</p>
<p>
Renouard
’s
face
did
not
betray
his
opinion
of
that
confident
prophecy
.
He
did
n’t
say
anything
till
his
friend
suggested
in
the
same
meditative
voice
—
</p>
<p>
“
You
ought
to
interest
Moorsom
in
the
affair
too
—
since
Willie
has
let
you
in
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
A
philosopher
!
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
suppose
he
is
n’t
above
making
a
bit
of
money
.
And
he
may
be
clever
at
it
for
all
you
know
.
I
have
a
notion
that
he
’s
a
fairly
practical
old
cove
.
.
.
.
Anyhow
,
”
and
here
the
tone
of
the
speaker
took
on
a
tinge
of
respect
,
“
he
has
made
philosophy
pay
.
”
</p>
<p>
Renouard
raised
his
eyes
,
repressed
an
impulse
to
jump
up
,
and
got
out
of
the
arm-chair
slowly
.
“
It
is
n’t
perhaps
a
bad
idea
,
”
he
said
.
“
I
’ll
have
to
call
there
in
any
case
.
”
</p>
<p>
He
wondered
whether
he
had
managed
to
keep
his
voice
steady
,
its
tone
unconcerned
enough
;
for
his
emotion
was
strong
though
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
business
aspect
of
this
suggestion
.
He
moved
in
the
room
in
vague
preparation
for
departure
,
when
he
heard
a
soft
laugh
.
He
spun
about
quickly
with
a
frown
,
but
the
Editor
was
not
laughing
at
him
.
He
was
chuckling
across
the
big
desk
at
the
wall
:
a
preliminary
of
some
speech
for
which
Renouard
,
recalled
to
himself
,
waited
silent
and
mistrustful
.
</p>
<p>
“
No
!
You
would
never
guess
!
No
one
would
ever
guess
what
these
people
are
after
.
Willie
’s
eyes
bulged
out
when
he
came
to
me
with
the
tale
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
They
always
do
,
”
remarked
Renouard
with
disgust
.
“
He
’s
stupid
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
He
was
startled
.
And
so
was
I
after
he
told
me
.
It
’s
a
search
party
.
They
are
out
looking
for
a
man
.
Willie
’s
soft
heart
’s
enlisted
in
the
cause
.
”
</p>
<p>
Renouard
repeated
:
“
Looking
for
a
man
.
”
</p>
<p>
He
sat
down
suddenly
as
if
on
purpose
to
stare
.
“
Did
Willie
come
to
you
to
borrow
the
lantern
,
”
he
asked
sarcastically
,
and
got
up
again
for
no
apparent
reason
.
</p>
<p>
“
What
lantern
?
”
snapped
the
puzzled
Editor
,
and
his
face
darkened
with
suspicion
.
“
You
,
Renouard
,
are
always
alluding
to
things
that
are
n’t
clear
to
me
.
If
you
were
in
politics
,
I
,
as
a
party
journalist
,
would
n’t
trust
you
further
than
I
could
see
you
.
Not
an
inch
further
.
You
are
such
a
sophisticated
beggar
.
Listen
:
the
man
is
the
man
Miss
Moorsom
was
engaged
to
for
a
year
.
He
could
n’t
have
been
a
nobody
,
anyhow
.
But
he
does
n’t
seem
to
have
been
very
wise
.
Hard
luck
for
the
young
lady
.
