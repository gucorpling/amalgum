reviewed
the
feature
and
launched
a
<hi rend="italic">

microsite
in
December

The
review
involved
checking
answers
to
basic
questions
such
as
whether
websites
stop
shaping

the

What
prompted
the
launch
of
DuckDuckGo
(
I
think
it
was
around
2006
?
)
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Gabriel
Weinberg
</hi>
:
We
launched
on
Sep
25
,
2008
,
though
I
had
been
working
on
it
for
about
a
year
prior
.
The
initial
motivation
was
to
try
a
search
engine
with
a
different
UI
that
did
a
better
job
of
using
more
structured
content
(
like
from
Wikipedia
)
and
also
more
aggressively
removed
spam
.

What
does
the
DuckDuckGo
Team
use
instead
of
Gmail
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
GW
</hi>
:
We
do
not
have
company
mail
accounts
(
beyond
forwarding
ones
)
,
so
everyone
uses
what
they
want
.
I
personally
use
outlook.com
right
now
.

When
and
how
did
DuckDuckGo
start
using
Perl
?
What
influenced
this
decision
and
language
choice
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
GW
</hi>
:
We
started
out
in
Perl
.
I
picked
it
up
at
MIT
where
it
was
prevalent
in
the
late
90s
,
and
pretty
much
never
looked
back
.
It
worked
really
well
for
a
project
like
this
that
is
text
heavy
and
can
use
a
lot
of
existing
helper
(

CPAN
</ref>
)
libraries
.

How
did
you
first
hear
about
&quot;
DoNotTrack
&quot;
feature
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
GW
</hi>
:
I
do
not
remember
,
but
it
was
a
long
time
ago
:
)
.
The
Do
Not
Track
concept
was
proposed
many
years
ago
.

When
did
you
launch
http://whatisDNT.com/
?
Who
worked
on
it
?
What
researches
,
tests
and
studies
did
it
involve
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
GW
</hi>
:
We
launched
the
What
Is
Do
Not
Track
micro-site
on
Dec
19
,
2012
,
and
various
members
of
the
DuckDuckGo
Team
worked
on
it
(
including
myself
)
.
We
had
been
following
it
closely
for
a
while
,
and
so
have
been
up
to
date
on
everything
that
is
going
on
with
it
.
It
honestly
does
n't
take
any
tests
to
prove
its
ineffectiveness
since
companies
like
Google
tell
you
straight
up
they
do
n't
honor
it
.

A
search
engine
that
does
not
track
users
sounds
good
.
What
do
you
recommend
users
to
do
to
not
be
tracked
by
*other*
websites
,
such
as
blogs
with
targeted
ads
in
sidebar
?
