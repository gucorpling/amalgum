On
Wikipedia
and
Wikinews
</head>
<p>
R.
It
is
interesting
talking
to
any
wikiproject
.
You
are
n’t
talking
to
one
person
you
are
reading
the
words
of
a
community
and
so
now
I
’m
almost
feel
like
I
’m
not
talking
to
you
across
the
table
I
’m
talking
to
some
random
internet
mass
and
so
you
know
“
hello
,
internet
,
what
are
you
doing
on
this
page
?
Are
you
browsing
this
from
work
?
”
There
’s
an
odd
feeling
to
it
.
I
’ve
also
have
this
urge
to
play
with
wikirules
.
I
wanted
for
a
while
to
find
something
I
could
say
in
an
interview
that
could
n’t
be
repeated
on
Wikipedia
.
</p>
<p>
I
was
thinking
something
almost
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt%20Gödel">
Godelian
</ref>
like
saying
making
a
sentence
that
in
some
way
depends
on
the
way
it
's
presented
on
Wikipedia
and
if
you
try
to
present
it
on
Wikipedia
with
a
neutral
point
of
view
by
virtue
of
taking
that
action
you
are
changing
the
point
of
view
to
do
something
.
</p>
<p>
I
wanted
to
do
an
announcement
saying
that
I
could
threaten
to
commit
a
crime
or
threatening
to
donate
money
to
a
charity
.
This
money
will
go
the
charity
determined
by
the
placement
of
this
comment
in
the
Wikipedia
article
about
this
.
</p>
<p>
So
by
making
the
decision
about
where
to
place
it
you
would
be
making
the
decision
about
how
the
real
life
event
would
go
and
how
the
rest
of
the
article
would
go
.
And
if
you
make
it
important
enough
people
ca
n’t
just
cling
to
the
guidelines
and
say
I
’m
writing
it
the
best
way
,
and
if
you
make
it
something
like
a
million
dollars
to
either
Africa
or
Asia
,
hunger
relief
suddenly
you
have
the
responsibility

I
’m
almost
worried
about
including
that
in
the
interview
,
just
because
I
could
see
some
sufficiently
rich
troll
actually
implementing
that
.
</hi>

<p>
R
:
Hey
,
if
you
do
n’t
put
it
in
the
article
,
I
’m
going
to
talk
about
this
.
</p>

So
in
general
how
has
you
experience
been
with
Wikipedia
?
How
did
you
first
here
of
it
,
and
actually
have
you
heard
of
Wikinews
before
this
interview
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
R
:
I
’ve
been
on
Wikinews
a
number
of
times
.
Whenever
there
is
a
news
story
where
the
data
is
still
being
sorted
out
,
there
have
been
press
releases
but
no
one
is
really
sure
what
’s
going
on
,
it
's
sometimes
the
place
to
go
,
to
see
.
Information
will
always
be
being
added
.
I
feel
that
like
if
there
’s
a
piece
of
information
that
got
out
there
it
's
on
Wikinews
,
it
wo
n’t
disappear
and
be
ignored
.
What
will
happen
is
sometimes
there
will
be
a
couple
of
different
sources
.
You
go
to
the
news
sources
and
you
do
n’t
know
which
of
those
sources
they
have
.
And
so
then
you
go
the
next
one
,
and
you
have
a
different
sort
of
information
.
And
so
Wikinews
is
sort
of
sticky
,
someone
with
one
source
came
in
and
gave
their
information
.
Someone
from
this
source
came
in
and
gave
theirs
.
They
’re
all
going
to
build
up
slowly
there
.
