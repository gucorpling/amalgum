In
the
Andes
</head>
<p>
Professor
Swyington
Bumper
seemed
to
live
in
a
region
all
by
himself
.
Though
he
was
on
board
the
Bellaconda
,
he
might
just
as
well
have
been
in
an
airship
,
or
riding
along
on
the
back
of
a
donkey
,
as
far
as
his
knowledge
,
or
recognition
,
of
his
surroundings
went
.
He
seemed
to
be
thinking
thoughts
far
,
far
away
,
and
he
was
never
without
a
book
--
either
a
bound
volume
or
a
note-book
.
In
the
former
he
buried
his
hawk-like
nose
,
and
Tom
,
looking
over
his
shoulder
once
,
saw
that
the
book
was
printed
in
curious
characters
,
which
,
later
,
he
learned
were
Sanskrit
.
If
he
had
a
note-book
the
bald-headed
professor
was
continually
jotting
down
memoranda
in
it
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
can
hardly
think
of
him
as
a
conspirator
against
us
,
&quot;
said
Tom
to
Mr.
Titus
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
After
you
have
been
in
the
contracting
business
as
long
as
I
have
you
'll
distrust
every
one
,
&quot;
was
the
answer
.
&quot;
Waddington
is
n't
on
board
,
or
I
'd
distrust
him
.
That
Spaniard
,
Senor
Pinto
,
seems
to
be
out
of
consideration
,
and
there
only
remains
the
professor
.
We
must
watch
him
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
But
Professor
Bumper
proved
to
be
above
suspicion
.
Carefully
guarded
inquiries
made
of
the
captain
,
the
purser
and
other
ships
'
officers
,
brought
out
the
fact
that
he
was
well
known
to
all
of
them
,
having
traveled
on
the
line
before
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
He
is
making
a
search
for
something
,
but
he
wo
n't
say
what
it
is
,
&quot;
the
captain
said
.
&quot;
At
first
we
thought
it
was
gold
or
jewels
,
for
he
goes
away
off
into
the
Andes
Mountains
,
where
both
gold
and
jewels
have
been
found
.
He
never
looks
for
treasure
,
though
,
for
though
some
of
his
party
have
made
rather
rich
discoveries
,
he
takes
no
interest
in
them
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
What
is
he
after
then
?
&quot;
asked
Mr.
Titus
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
No
one
knows
,
and
he
wo
n't
tell
.
But
whatever
it
is
he
has
never
found
it
yet
.
Always
,
when
he
comes
back
,
unsuccessful
,
from
a
trip
to
the
interior
and
goes
back
North
with
us
,
he
will
remark
that
he
has
not
the
right
directions
.
That
he
must
seek
again
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Back
he
comes
next
season
,
as
full
of
hope
as
before
,
but
only
to
be
disappointed
.
Each
time
he
goes
to
a
new
place
in
the
mountains
where
he
digs
and
delves
,
so
members
of
the
parties
he
hires
tell
me
,
but
with
no
success
.
He
carries
with
him
something
in
a
small
iron
box
,
and
,
whatever
this
is
,
he
consults
it
from
time
to
time
.
It
may
be
directions
for
finding
whatever
he
is
after
.
But
there
seems
to
be
something
wrong
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
This
is
quite
a
mystery
,
&quot;
remarked
Tom
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
It
certainly
is
.
But
Professor
Bumper
is
a
fine
man
.
I
have
known
him
for
years
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
This
seems
to
dispose
of
the
theory
that
he
planted
the
bomb
,
and
that
he
is
one
of
the
plotters
in
the
pay
of
Blakeson
&amp;
Grinder
,
&quot;
said
Mr.
Titus
,
when
he
and
Tom
were
alone
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Yes
,
I
guess
it
does
.
But
who
can
have
done
it
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
That
was
a
question
neither
could
answer
.
</p>
<p>
Tom
had
a
theory
,
which
he
did
not
disclose
to
Mr.
Titus
,
that
,
after
all
,
the
somewhat
mysterious
Senor
Pinto
might
,
in
some
way
,
be
mixed
up
in
the
bomb
attempt
.
But
a
close
questioning
of
the
steward
on
duty
near
the
foreigner
's
cabin
at
the
time
disclosed
the
fact
that
Pinto
had
been
ill
in
his
berth
all
that
day
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Well
,
unless
the
bomb
fell
from
some
passing
airship
,
I
do
n't
see
how
it
got
on
deck
,
&quot;
said
Tom
with
a
shake
of
his
head
.
&quot;
And
I
'm
sure
no
airship
passed
over
us
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
They
had
kept
the
matter
secret
,
not
telling
even
Mr.
Damon
,
for
they
feared
the
eccentric
man
would
make
a
fuss
and
alarm
the
whole
vessel
.
So
Mr.
Damon
,
occasionally
blessing
his
necktie
or
his
shoe
laces
,
played
chess
with
his
elderly
gentleman
friend
and
was
perfectly
happy
.
</p>
<p>
That
Professor
Bumper
not
only
had
kept
his
promise
about
not
mentioning
the
bomb
,
but
that
he
had
forgotten
all
about
it
,
was
evident
a
day
or
two
after
the
happening
.
Tom
and
Mr.
Titus
passed
him
on
deck
,
and
bowed
cordially
.
The
professor
returned
the
salutation
,
but
looked
at
the
two
in
a
puzzled
sort
of
fashion
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
beg
your
pardon
,
&quot;
he
remarked
,
&quot;
but
your
faces
are
familiar
,
though
I
cannot
recall
your
names
.
Have
n't
I
seen
you
before
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
You
have
,
&quot;
said
Tom
,
with
a
smile
.
&quot;
You
saved
our
lives
from
a
bomb
the
other
day
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Oh
,
yes
!
So
I
did
!
So
I
did
!
&quot;
exclaimed
Professor
Bumper
.
&quot;
I
felt
sure
I
had
seen
you
before
.
Are
you
all
right
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Yes
.
There
have
n't
been
any
more
bombs
thrown
at
us
,
&quot;
the
contractor
said
.
&quot;
By
the
way
,
Professor
Bumper
,
I
understand
you
are
quite
a
traveler
in
the
Andes
,
in
the
vicinity
of
Lima
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Yes
,
I
have
been
there
,
&quot;
admitted
the
bald-headed
scientist
in
guarded
tones
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Well
,
I
am
digging
a
tunnel
in
that
vicinity
,
&quot;
went
on
Mr.
Titus
,
&quot;
and
if
you
ever
get
near
Rimac
,
where
the
first
cutting
is
made
,
I
wish
you
would
come
and
see
me
--
Tom
too
,
as
he
is
associated
with
me
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Rimac-Rimac
,
&quot;
murmured
the
professor
,
looking
sharply
at
the
contractor
.
&quot;
Digging
a
tunnel
there
?
Why
are
you
doing
that
?
&quot;
and
he
seemed
to
resent
the
idea
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Why
,
the
Peruvian
government
engaged
me
to
do
it
to
connect
the
two
railroad
lines
,
&quot;
was
the
answer
.
&quot;
Do
you
know
anything
about
the
place
?
&quot;
