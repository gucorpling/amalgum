James

born
about
1680
,
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberdeen">
Aberdeen

,
where
he
was
educated
,
and
probably
took
the
degrees
of
M.A.

D.D.
In
1710
he
was
appointed
minister
of
the
Presbyterian
church
in

whence
he
was
transferred
,
in

,
to
a
similar
charge
in
Lisle
Street
,
Leicester
Fields

According
to
the
<hi rend="italic">
Gentleman

</hi>
he
is
said
to
have
been
&quot;
well
known
among
the
people
of
that
persuasion
resident
in
London
as
Bishop
Anderson
&quot;
,
and
he
is
described
as
&quot;
a

imprudent
man
,
who
lost
a
considerable
part

<p>
Anderson
's
work
,
although
of
the
first
importance
to
the
history
of
freemasonry
,
is
unfortunately
marred
by
a
number
of
extravagant
claims
which
are
simply
incredible
.
Indeed
,
it
was
shown
at
the
tercentenary
conference
of
the
respected
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quatuor_Coronati_Lodge">

Coronati
</ref>
research
Lodge
at
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_College,_Cambridge">

,
that
Anderson
's
history
of
the
founding
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Lodge_of_London_and_Westminster">
Grand
Lodge
</ref>
is
doubtful
,
since
the
public
houses
mentioned
could
probably
not
have
accommodated
the
meetings
that
he
claims
were
held
in
1717
.
Anderson
's
account
must
be
broadly
accurate
,
having
been
widely
published
within
six
years
of
the
events
described
,
but
it
may
have
been
backdated
by
two
or
three
years
,
perhaps
to
aggrandise
some
brethren
as
Past
Grand
Officers
.

Works

<p>
In
1732
appeared
the
work
by
which
Anderson
is
chiefly
remembered
,
<hi rend="italic">
Royal
Genealogies
;
or
,
the
Genealogical
Tables
of
Emperors
,
Kings
,
and
Princes
,
from
Adam
to
these
times
.
</hi>
Professedly
based
on
<hi rend="italic">
Genealogische
Tabellen
</hi>
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Hübner">
Johann
Hübner
</ref>
,
it
was
largely
supplemented
by
Anderson
's
industry
.
While
the
earlier
sections
of
the
work
are
of
little
historical
value
,
the
later
are
often
of
use
in
relation
to
the
genealogies
of
continental
dynasties
and
houses
.
The
volume
closes
with
a
synopsis
of
the
English
peerage
,
and
in
the
preface
the
author
intimated
his
readiness
,
if
adequately
encouraged
,
&quot;
to
delineate
and
dispose
at
full
length
the
genealogies
of
all
the
peers
and
great
gentry
of
the
Britannic
isles
&quot;

but
the
first
volume
alone
was
completed
when
Anderson
died
on
25
May
1739
,
and
a
second
volume

subsequently
published
,
was
due
to
another
pen
(

&quot;
To
the

in

.
The
work
was
soon
withdrawn
from
circulation
on
account
of
some
disparaging
remarks
in
it
on
the
condition
of
the
English
peerage
and
on
the
character
of
the
Irish
people
.
It
was
re-issued

without
the
offensive
