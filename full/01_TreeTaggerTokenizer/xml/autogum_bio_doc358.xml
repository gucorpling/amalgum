Biography
</head>
<p>
De
Gregorio
was
born
in
Petra-fixia
,
the
ancient
Satriano
di
Lucania
,
between
1579
and
1580
,
as
was
written
in
a
notary
act
dated
from
September
27
,
1595
,
which
states
that
he
,
son
of
Michele
,
at
the
age
of
15
attended
the
Neapolitan
workshop
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabrizio_Santafede">
Fabrizio
Santafede
</ref>
.
He
remained
for
six
years
in
his
workshop
.
He
frequented
assiduously
the
picture
gallery
of
the
prince
Matteo
di
Capua
where
he
admired
&quot;
Cristo
&quot;
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastiano_del_Piombo">
Sebastiano
del
Piombo
</ref>
,
from
which
he
would
draw
the
model
of
his
religiosity
and
his
images
.
He
devoted
himself
to
painting
with
passion
and
scrupulous
study
,
to
which
he
added
a
vast
culture
and
a
profound
religious
sense
of
life
.
</p>
<p>
After
returning
to
Basilicata
he
moved
to
Vineola
,
today
Pignola
,
where
he
married
a
woman
from
Pignola
and
had
two
children
.
He
opened
his
workshop
,
school
for
other
artists
including
Giuseppe
De
Gregorio
(
his
adopted
son
)
,
Girolamo
Bresciano
da
Pietragalla
and
Francesco
Romano
da
Laurenzana
.
</p>
<p>
His
artistic
life
took
place
between
the
province
of
Basilicata
and
that
of
Principato
Citra
(
Salerno
)
.
But
there
is
a
gap
to
be
filled
in
his
biography
,
between
1601
,
the
year
in
which
he
finished
his
training
in
the
workshop
of
Santafede
,
and
1608
when
he
produced
his
first
signed
work
known
as
La
Pietà
,
commissioned
by
the
church
of
S.
Francesco
di
Potenza
.
From
1608
to
1653
he
completed
several
works
moving
to
different
locations
in
the
Kingdom
of
Naples
.
</p>
<p>
He
died
in
1656
at
the
age
of
67
suffering
from
a
plague
in
Pignola
and
rests
,
according
to
Costantino
Gatta
,
in
the
mother
church
of
Pignola
.
