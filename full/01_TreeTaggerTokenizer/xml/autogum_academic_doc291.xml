In
this
section
,
we
will
verify
the
control
algorithm
proposed
in
Section
3
by
simulation
.
In
order
to
facilitate
the
simulation
,
we
consider
2DOF
flexible
manipulator
as
the
controlled
object
.
Firstly
,
the
IHSMC
algorithm
proposed
in
this
paper
is
simulated
and
compared
with
the
traditional
HSMC
algorithm
.
The
superiority
of
the
control
strategy
is
verified
.
Then
,
a
PID-IDA-PBC
proposed
in
this
paper
is
simulated
and
implemented
with
the
IDA-PBC
algorithm
.
In
comparison
,
it
is
verified
that
the
PID-IDA-PBC
algorithm
has
better
steady
state
performance
and
disturbance
–
resistance
ability
.
In
the
end
,
we
proceed
simulations
using
hybrid
control
.
We
use
the
parameter
values
of
robot
manipulator
reported
in
.
In
this
simulation
we
assume
that
each
joint
of
the
flexible-joint
robot
is
driven
by
PMSM
.
The
parameters
of
PMSM
are
given
as
.
The
initial
state
is
set
as
,
we
require
the
expected
position
vector
to
be
.
Lastly
,
we
agree
that
the
counterclockwise
direction
is
the
positive
direction
of
the
rotation
of
robot
.

For
the
IHSMC
algorithm
,
the
selected
controller
parameters
are
,
The
parameter
selection
of
the
joint

current
controller
are
.
The
original
HSMC
control
law
can
be
expressed
as
(

)
where
.
According
to
the
results
shown
in
<figure>
Figure

,
joint
1
and
joint
2
enter
a
steady
state
after
a
dynamic
process
of
about
0.4
s
,
but
there
is
still
a
small
chattering
in
the
system
at
steady
state
.
Compared
with
the
original
HSMC
algorithm
,
the
IHSMC
algorithm
has
a
faster
response
speed
and
chattering
is
effectively
suppressed
.

The
simulation
experiment
of
the
PID-IDA-PBC
algorithm
is
divided
into
two
parts
.
Firstly
,
the
performance
difference
between
the
algorithm
and
the
traditional
IDA-PBC
algorithm
is
compared
without
disturbance
.
Then
,
a
constant
value
disturbance
signal
of
2
N·m
is
added
at
the
System
dynamic
Equation
(
2
)
at
4
s
to
verify
the
disturbance
–
resistance
performance
of
the
algorithm
.
Parameters
of
PID-PBC-PCH
controller
:
.
According
to
<figure>
Figure
4
</figure>
,
it
can
be
concluded
that
the
PID-IDA-PBC
has
improved
dynamic
performance
and
steady-state
performance
compared
to
the
conventional
IDA-PBC
control
.
The
PID-IDA-PBC
control
algorithm
can
improve
the
steady-state
performance
by
adjusting

<figure>
Figure

</figure>
shows
the
simulation
curves
of
under
IDA-PBC
and
PID-IDA-PBC
method
.
At
the
same
time
,
it
will
reduce
the
dynamic
performance
.
In
order
to
validate
the
robustness
of
the
PID-IDA-PBC
algorithm
,
constant-size
perturbations
of
different
sizes
are
added
to
the
drive
motors
of
joint
1
and
joint
2
at
4
s.
The
result
is
shown
in
<figure>
Figure

</figure>
.
The
PID-IDA-PBC
algorithm
has
excellent
disturbance
–
resistance
performance
.
</p>
<p>
According
to
the
above
,
it
can
be
concluded
that
a
single
control
algorithm
finds
it
difficult
to
balance
both
dynamic
performance
and
steady
state
performance
.
Therefore
,
this
paper
proposes
a
hybrid
control
strategy
that
attempts
to
combine
the
advantages
of
the
two
control
algorithms
.
The
simulation
experiment
of
the
hybrid
control
strategy
was
divided
into
three
parts
.
First
,
we
compared
the
control
effects
of
hybrid
control
and
single
control
algorithms
.
Then
,
a
disturbance
was
added
at
4
s
to
verify
the
immunity
of
the
hybrid
control
.
Finally
,
a
simulation
experiment
was
designed
to
analyze
the
effect
of
switching
parameters
on
the
effects
of
hybrid
control
.
The
hybrid
controller
parameter
selection
is
.
</p>
<p>
According
to
the
simulation
results
in
<figure>
Figure
7
</figure>
,
it
can
be
concluded
that
the
hybrid
control
strategy
combines
the
advantages
of
the
two
control
algorithms
well
,
and
has
good
dynamic
performance
and
high
tracking
accuracy
.

the
simulation
curves
of
under
Hybrid
control
method
.
The
smoothing
function
curve
in
<figure>
Figure

</figure>
reflects
the
proportion
of
PID-IDA-PBC
control
during
the
switching
process
.
<figure>
Figure

</figure>
is
the
trajectory
curves
when
there
is
a
disturbance
imposed
at
the
time
of
.
The
result
shows
that
even
if
the
system
generates
small
high-frequency
chattering
due
to
disturbance
,
it
can
eventually
eliminate
chattering
.
The
simulation
results
in
<figure>
Figure
11
</figure>
show
that
the
control
effect
of
the
hybrid
control
strategy
is
related
to
the
switching
parameter
<hi rend="italic">
c
</hi>
.
The
curve
with
smooth
switching
function
under
different
parameters
is
shown
in
<figure>
Figure

</figure>
.
According
to
the
results
in
<figure>
Figure
11
</figure>
and
<figure>
Figure
12
</figure>
,
it
can
be
concluded
that
the
effect
of
the
hybrid
control
is
affected
by
the
parameter
<hi rend="italic">
c
</hi>
and
the
switching
interval
.
The
larger
the
<hi rend="italic">
c
</hi>
value
,
the
earlier
the
position
error
change
ratio
is
affected
by
the
PID-IDA-PBC
algorithm
.
According
to
the
value
of
<hi rend="italic">
c
</hi>
,
the
appropriate
switching
interval
is
selected
to
achieve
smooth
switching
,
and
the
abrupt
change
of
the
switching
is
avoided
.
