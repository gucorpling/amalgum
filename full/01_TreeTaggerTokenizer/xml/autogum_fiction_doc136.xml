CHAPTER
XVIII
.
THE
GULF
BETWEEN
</head>
<p>
FOR
three
months
Billy
met
has-beens
,
and
third-
and
fourth-rate
fighters
from
New
York
and
its
environs
.
He
thrashed
them
all
--
usually
by
the
knockout
route
and
finally
local
sports
commenced
talking
about
him
a
bit
,
and
he
was
matched
up
with
second-raters
from
other
cities
.
</p>
<p>
These
men
he
cleaned
up
as
handily
as
he
had
the
others
,
so
that
it
was
apparent
to
fight
fandom
that
the
big
,
quiet
“
unknown
”
was
a
comer
;
and
pretty
soon
Professor
Cassidy
received
an
offer
from
another
trainer-manager
to
match
Billy
against
a
real
“
hope
”
who
stood
in
the
forefront
of
hopedom
.
</p>
<p>
This
other
manager
stated
that
he
thought
the
mill
would
prove
excellent
practice
for
his
man
who
was
having
difficulty
in
finding
opponents
.
Professor
Cassidy
thought
so
too
,
and
grinned
for
two
hours
straight
after
reading
the
challenge
.
</p>
<p>
The
details
of
the
fight
were
quickly
arranged
.
In
accordance
with
the
state
regulations
it
was
to
be
a
ten
round
,
no
decision
bout
--
the
weight
of
the
gloves
was
prescribed
by
law
.
</p>
<p>
The
name
of
the
“
white
hope
”
against
whom
Billy
was
to
go
was
sufficient
to
draw
a
fair
house
,
and
there
were
some
there
who
had
seen
Billy
in
other
fights
and
looked
for
a
good
mill
.
When
the
“
coming
champion
,
”
as
Billy
's
opponent
was
introduced
,
stepped
into
the
ring
he
received
a
hearty
round
of
applause
,
whereas
there
was
but
a
scattered
ripple
of
handclapping
to
greet
the
mucker
.
It
was
the
first
time
he
ever
had
stepped
into
a
ring
with
a
first-rate
fighter
,
and
as
he
saw
the
huge
muscles
of
his
antagonist
and
recalled
the
stories
he
had
heard
of
his
prowess
and
science
,
Billy
,
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
,
felt
a
tremor
of
nervousness
.
</p>
<p>
His
eyes
wandered
across
the
ropes
to
the
sea
of
faces
turned
up
toward
him
,
and
all
of
a
sudden
Billy
Byrne
went
into
a
blue
funk
.
Professor
Cassidy
,
shrewd
and
experienced
,
saw
it
even
as
soon
as
Billy
realized
it
--
he
saw
the
fading
of
his
high
hopes
--
he
saw
his
castles
in
Spain
tumbling
in
ruins
about
his
ears
--
he
saw
his
huge
giant
lying
prone
within
that
squared
circle
as
the
hand
of
the
referee
rose
and
fell
in
cadence
to
the
ticking
of
seconds
that
would
count
his
man
out
.
</p>
<p>
“
Here
,
”
he
whispered
,
“
take
a
swig
o
'
this
,
”
and
he
pressed
a
bottle
toward
Billy
's
lips
.
</p>
<p>
Billy
shook
his
head
.
The
stuff
had
kept
him
down
all
his
life
--
he
had
sworn
never
to
touch
another
drop
of
it
,
and
he
never
would
,
whether
he
lost
this
and
every
other
fight
he
ever
fought
.
He
had
sworn
to
leave
it
alone
for
HER
sake
!
And
then
the
gong
called
him
to
the
center
of
the
ring
.
</p>
<p>
Billy
knew
that
he
was
afraid
--
he
thought
that
he
was
afraid
of
the
big
,
trained
fighter
who
faced
him
;
but
Cassidy
knew
that
it
was
a
plain
case
of
stage
fright
that
had
gripped
his
man
.
He
knew
,
too
,
that
it
would
be
enough
to
defeat
Billy
's
every
chance
for
victory
,
and
after
the
big
“
white
hope
”
had
felled
Billy
twice
in
the
first
minute
of
the
first
round
Cassidy
knew
that
it
was
all
over
but
the
shouting
.
</p>
<p>
The
fans
,
many
of
them
,
were
laughing
,
and
yelling
derogatory
remarks
at
Billy
.
</p>
<p>
“
Stan
'
up
an
'
fight
,
yeh
big
stiff
!
”
and
“
Back
to
de
farm
fer
youse
!
”
and
then
,
high
above
the
others
a
shrill
voice
cried
“
Coward
!
Coward
!
”
</p>
<p>
The
word
penetrated
Billy
's
hopeless
,
muddled
brain
.
Coward
!
SHE
had
called
him
that
once
,
and
then
she
had
changed
her
mind
.
Theriere
had
thought
him
a
coward
,
yet
as
he
died
he
had
said
that
he
was
the
bravest
man
he
ever
had
known
.
Billy
recalled
the
yelling
samurai
with
their
keen
swords
and
terrible
spears
.
He
saw
the
little
room
in
the
“
palace
”
of
Oda
Yorimoto
,
and
again
he
faced
the
brown
devils
who
had
hacked
and
hewed
and
stabbed
at
him
that
day
as
he
fought
to
save
the
woman
he
loved
.
Coward
!
What
was
there
in
this
padded
ring
for
a
man
to
fear
who
had
faced
death
as
Billy
had
faced
it
,
and
without
an
instant
's
consciousness
of
the
meaning
of
the
word
fear
?
What
was
wrong
with
him
,
and
then
the
shouts
and
curses
and
taunts
of
the
crowd
smote
upon
his
ears
,
and
he
knew
.
It
was
the
crowd
!
Again
the
heavy
fist
of
the
“
coming
champion
”
brought
Billy
to
the
mat
,
and
then
,
before
further
damage
could
be
done
him
,
the
gong
saved
him
.
</p>
<p>
It
was
a
surprised
and
chastened
mucker
that
walked
with
bent
head
to
his
corner
after
the
first
round
.
The
“
white
hope
”
was
grinning
and
confident
,
and
so
he
returned
to
the
center
of
the
ring
for
the
second
round
.
During
the
short
interval
Billy
had
thrashed
the
whole
thing
out
.
The
crowd
had
gotten
on
his
nerves
.
He
was
trying
to
fight
the
whole
crowd
instead
of
just
one
man
--
he
would
do
better
in
this
round
;
but
the
first
thing
that
happened
after
he
faced
his
opponent
sent
the
fans
into
delirious
ecstasies
of
shouting
and
hooting
.
</p>
<p>
Billy
swung
his
right
for
his
foe
's
jaw
--
a
terrible
blow
that
would
have
ended
the
fight
had
it
landed
--
but
the
man
side-stepped
it
,
and
Billy
's
momentum
carried
him
sprawling
upon
his
face
.
When
he
regained
his
feet
the
“
white
hope
”
was
waiting
for
him
,
and
Billy
went
down
again
to
lie
there
,
quite
still
,
while
the
hand
of
the
referee
marked
the
seconds
:
One
.
Two
.
Three
.
Four
.
Five
.
Six
.
Billy
opened
his
eyes
.
Seven
.
Billy
sat
up
.
Eight
.
The
meaning
of
that
monotonous
count
finally
percolated
to
the
mucker
's
numbed
perceptive
faculties
.
He
was
being
counted
out
!
Nine
!
Like
a
flash
he
was
on
his
feet
.
He
had
forgotten
the
crowd
.
Rage
--
cool
,
calculating
rage
possessed
him
--
not
the
feverish
,
hysterical
variety
that
takes
its
victim
's
brains
away
.
