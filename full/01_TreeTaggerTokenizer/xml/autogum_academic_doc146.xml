Existing
definitions
of
happiness
,
subjective
well-being
,
life
satisfaction
,
and
quality
of
life
suggest
a
conceptual
overlap
between
these
constructs
.
However
,
a
related
study
showed
that
high
positive
correlations
between
happiness
,
subjective
well-being
,
psychological
,
and
health
domains
of
quality
of
life
,
life
satisfaction
,
and
positive
affect
.
Actually
,
subjective
well-being
refers
to
an
individual
’s
overall
assessment
of
the
quality
of
life
from
his
or
her
own
perspective
.
Conventional
measures
for
subjective
well-being
primarily
focused
on
the
tangible
aspects
of
living
conditions
,
such
as
housing
and
employment
,
whereas
more
recent
research
starts
to
explore
the
less
tangible
parts
of
subjective
well-being
,
namely
what
people
think
and
feel
about
their
lives
,
such
as
the
quality
of
their
relationships
,
their
emotions
and
resilience
,
and
their
overall
life
satisfaction
.
As
a
key
component
of
subjective
well-being
,
life
satisfaction
is
one
’s
evaluation
of
life
as
a
whole
,
rather
than
the
feelings
and
emotions
that
are
experienced
in
the
moment
.
</p>
<p>
Early
studies
on
life
satisfaction
were
conducted
within
the
domains
of
psychology
and
philosophy
and
focused
on
the
individual-level
determinants
of
life
satisfaction
,
such
as
genes
,
personalities
,
and
value
systems
.
Human
health
is
increasingly
recognized
as
“
a
state
of
complete
physical
,
mental
,
and
social
well-being
and
not
merely
the
absence
of
disease
or
infirmity
”
.
Subsequently
,
life
satisfaction
,
as
an
important
dimension
of
human
well-being
,
has
attracted
attention
from
a
variety
of
research
disciplines
including
public
health
,
economics
,
sociology
,
education
,
and
policy
.
An
extensive
set
of
demographic
and
socioeconomic
factors
,
such
as
employment
,
religion
,
health
status
,
educational
attainment
,
social
network
,
and
income
,
were
documented
to
be
associated
with
life
satisfaction
.
</p>
<p>
The
relationship
between
income
and
life
satisfaction
could
be
complex
.
Conventional
economic
theory
predicts
an
increase
in
life
satisfaction
(
also
known
as
“
utility
”
in
economics
terminology
)
attributable
to
people
’s
ability
to
purchase
and
consume
more
goods
given
a
higher
disposable
income
.
Indeed
,
empirical
evidence
from
less
developed
nations
documented
higher
life
satisfaction
in
response
to
economic
growth
,
but
such
a
positive
relationship
between
income
and
life
satisfaction
was
not
replicated
in
the
wealthy
nations
.
These
contradicting
observations
led
to
the
Easterlin
Paradox
—
an
increase
in
personal
income
can
significantly
increase
happiness
and
life
satisfaction
;
when
income
level
is
low
,
happiness
or
life
satisfaction
is
initially
positively
influenced
by
income
both
across
and
within
nations
,
whereas
life
satisfaction
is
simply
less
dependent
income
as
one
’s
wealth
increases
.
</p>
<p>
The
relative
income
hypothesis
posits
that
the
satisfaction
or
utility
a
person
derives
from
a
given
income
depends
on
its
relative
magnitude
in
the
society
rather
than
its
absolute
amount
.
This
hypothesis
might
hold
the
potential
to
explain
,
at
least
in
part
,
the
Easterlin
Paradox
—
as
people
’s
living
condition
continues
to
improve
,
relative
income
could
play
a
more
essential
role
in
determining
life
satisfaction
relative
to
absolute
income
.
A
handful
of
recent
studies
assessed
the
influence
of
relative
income
on
people
’s
life
satisfaction
,
independent
of
their
absolute
income
level
.
The
majority
reported
a
positive
relationship
between
relative
income
and
life
satisfaction
.
However
,
these
studies
defined
relative
income
in
a
single
dimension
.
</p>
<p>
Measures
on
relative
income
can
be
largely
classified
into
two
major
categories
:
(
1
)
an
objective
measure
,
such
as
absolute
income
level
relative
to
the
median
or
average
income
of
an
individual
’s
community
,
city
,
state/province
,
or
country
of
residence
,
or
of
an
individual
’s
gender
,
age
,
or
education
group
,
and
(
2
)
a
subjective
measure
,
such
as
self-perceived
relative
income
level
in
comparison
to
a
reference
group
.
This
study
adopted
a
subjective
relative
income
measure
and
further
refined
it
by
making
a
contrast
with
four
different
dimensions
of
one
’s
social
network
.
</p>
<p>
There
is
not
much
direct
evidence
to
date
about
those
whom
people
really
compare
themselves
to
.
Most
of
the
time
,
the
evidence
for
comparison
is
indirect
.
This
is
because
surveys
usually
do
not
contain
direct
questions
about
the
composition
of
reference
groups
.
Previous
studies
have
usually
defined
reference
groups
based
on
geographical
location
or
demographic
characteristics
.
However
,
other
social
reference
groups
that
have
frequent
social
contact
with
individuals
,
such
as
relatives
and
friends
,
may
be
more
prominent
.
In
addition
,
previous
studies
have
not
systematically
studied
which
geographic
aggregation
level
has
the
greatest
influence
on
life
satisfaction
.
Residents
of
the
same
community
or
city
may
be
a
particularly
important
reference
groups
.
</p>
<p>
Some
papers
have
defined
the
reference
group
as
the
inhabitants
of
the
geographical
area
where
the
respondent
lives
.
Certain
authors
defined
reference
groups
as
being
composed
of
people
with
whom
one
has
daily
interactions
,
such
as
friends
and
colleagues
.
Only
a
few
studies
have
identified
different
social
dimensions
of
relative
income
at
the
same
time
.
None
of
the
above
studies
assessed
the
potential
mediating
and/or
moderating
effect
from
certain
personal
characteristics
,
most
prominently
,
gender
and
health
status
.
The
relative
importance
attached
to
a
specific
reference
group
may
differ
between
men
and
women
in
income
comparisons
,
partially
due
to
the
historical
and
enduring
division
of
labor
between
genders
.
As
for
the
less
healthy
individuals
,
they
could
be
more
concerned
about
their
health
status
than
other
things
.
