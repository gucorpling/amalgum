</ref>
,
<ref target="Umm%20al%20Quwain">
Umm

Quwain
</ref>
and
<ref target="Fujairah">

</ref>
while
the
emirate
of
<ref target="Ajman">
Ajman
</ref>
forms
an
enclave
within
Sharjah
.
</p>
<p>
It
is
the
only
emirates
to
have
a
coastline
on
both
the
Persian
Gulf
and
the
Gulf
of
Oman
.
This
is
by
virtue
of
the
emirate
being
made
up
of
a
main
part
(
where
the
capital
city
<ref target="Sharjah">
Sharjah
</ref>
is
)
that
is
located
along
the
Persian
Gulf
,
and
the
exclaves
of
Kalba
,
<ref target="Khor%20Fakkan">
Khor
Fakkan
</ref>
,
and
Dibba
Al
Hisn
which
are
scattered
along
the
Gulf
of
Oman
coast
.
Sharjah
also
controls
the
Nahwa
enclave
,
which
is
located
within
the
Omani
exclave
of
Madha
,
which
in
turn
is
surrounded
by
Sharjah
territory
near
the
Gulf
of
Oman
coast
.
</p>
<p>
Because
of
its
proximity
to
Dubai
and
the
lower
cost
of
living
in
Sharjah
,
many
people
live
in
Sharjah
and
work
in
Dubai
.
This
causes
daily
traffic
jams
at
rush
hours

As
in

Arabic

actually
speaking
other

entirely

There
is
no
public
transport
in
Sharjah
,
which
means
that
visitors
will
need
to
have
their
own
wheels
or
rely
on
taxis
,
which
have
historically
been
unmetered
,
and
although
some
of
these
remain
,
but
several
new
companies
operating
metered
taxis
have
become
operational
.
They
are
similar
in
quality
to
Dubai
's
taxi
fleet
.
</p>
<p>
Taxi
drivers
,
although
mostly
courteous
,
have
the
tendency
to
refuse
passengers
if
the
time
of
travel
coincides
with
rush
hour
traffic
.
It
is
advisable
to
plan
your
travel
well
,
allowing
for
traffic
jams
which
could
take
90
min
to
get
out
of
.

Stay
safe
</head>
<p>
Generally
speaking
,
Sharjah
is
a
very
safe
place
.
Western
women
may
get
a
few
stares
as
they
are
fairly
rare
in
Sharjah
,
but
it
is
a
safe
place
to
walk
around
even
at
night
.
