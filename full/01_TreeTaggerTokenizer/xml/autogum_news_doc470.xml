Bayern
Munich
</ref>
hosted
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Real_Madrid">
Real
Madrid
</ref>
at
the
Allianz
Arena
today
in
the
second
leg
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League">
Champions
League
</ref>
round
of
sixteen
.
The
first
leg
saw
Real
coming
out
on
top
3-2
,
but
the
two
away
goals
by
Bayern
gave
them
a
good
chance
in
the
second
leg
.
Madrid
were
without
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/David_Beckham">
David
Beckham
</ref>
for
the
game
,
who
orchestrated
all
3
goals
in
the
first
leg
,
and
he
was
replaced
in
the
midfield
by
Raúl
.
Bayern
played
a
strong
side
,
with
Lucas
Podolski
and
Roy
Makaay
in
attack
,
and
Owen
Hargreaves
in
the
midfield
.
</p>
<p>
Any
plans
Real
had
made
for
the
game
went
immediately
out
the
window
when
Roy
Makaay
scored
the
fastest
ever
goal
in
a
Champions
League
match
after
only
10
seconds
.
Real
took
the
kickoff
,
and
Roberto
Carlos
was
immediately
dispossessed
by
Salihamidzic
,
who
passed
in
the
ball
to
Makaay
.
The
German
striker
neatly
finished
passed
Iker
Casillas
to
stun
the
Galacticos
,
and
give
the
home
side
the
lead
.
Bayern
continued
to
press
,
and
Real
looked
listless
,
as
shots
from
Podolski
and
Makaay
were
saved
by
Casillas
.
Real
coach
Fabio
Capello
was
quick
to
make
changes
in
his
team
,
and
sent
on
Guti
in
place
of
Emerson
.
Casillas
was
again
forced
into
action
as
van
Buyten
headed
Sagnol
's
free
kick
towards
the
goal
,
but
the
keeper
got
down
well
to
make
the
stop
.
Madrid
finally
began
to
play
like
a
team
,
and
substitute
Guti
had
a
chance
after
a
neat
backheel
by
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Gonzalo_Higuaín">
Higuain
</ref>
found
him
,
but
the
shot
flew
wide
.
Real
continued
pressing
,
and
Dutchman
Ruud
van
Nistelrooy
headed
a
ball
towards
the
net
,
but
Oliver
Kahn
was
easily
able
to
cope
with
the
low
power
effort
.
Raúl
then
struck
an
acrobatic
effort
towards
the
goal
,
but
found
only
the
side
netting
.
</p>
<p>
After
the
restart
,
Real
looked
shaky
at
the
back
again
as
van
Bommel
found
his
way
in
on
goal
,
but
Casillas
was
again
on
hand
to
snuff
out
the
danger
.
Oliver
Kahn
was
then
forced
into
action
at
the
other
end
,
as
he
pushed
out
a
van
Nistelrooy
header
off
of
a
cross
by
Raúl
.
Bayern
had
a
penalty
claim
,
but
were
denied
by
referee
Lubos
Michel
.
It
did
n't
matter
however
,
and
the
resulting
corner
was
met
by
Lucio
's
head
,
doubling
Bayerns
lead
.
Bayern
had
another
chance
minutes
later
,
but
a
open
header
by
Salihamidzic
went
wide
.
Raúl
then
had
a
chance
for
Real
,
but
his
header
was
directed
straight
to
Kahn
.
Ruud
van
Nistelrooy
was
then
denied
a
run
on
goal
after
a
mistaken
offside
call
was
given
by
the
linesman
.
On
80
minutes
,
Robinho
was
hauled
down
by
van
Bommel
in
the
penalty
area
,
and
Real
was
awarded
a
penalty
.
Marco
van
Bommel
was
consequently
given
his
second
yellow
of
the
match
for
arguing
the
point
,
and
was
sent
off
along
with
Diarra
of
Real
for
his
part
in
the
confrontation
.
Once
everything
settled
,
van
Nistelrooy
stepped
up
to
the
spot
and
sent
the
ball
into
the
net
,
cutting
the
lead
in
half
,
but
still
leaving
Real
behind
on
aggregate
.
The
game
finished
dramatically
,
as
Ramos
thought
he
had
scored
to
tie
the
game
,
but
the
referee
correctly
judged
that
a
hand
had
been
used
in
the
build
up
,
and
the
goal
was
not
counted
.
The
game
ended
in
a
win
for
Bayern
,
and
they
will
go
on
to
the
next
round
,
while
Real
is
left
to
focus
on
domestic
play
.
