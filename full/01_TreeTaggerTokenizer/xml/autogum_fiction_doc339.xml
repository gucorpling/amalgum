AFTER
THE
CASH
</head>
<p>
Tom
's
proposal
as
a
way
out
of
the
difficulty
,
and
the
prompt
seconding
of
it
by
Mr.
Damon
,
seemed
to
deprive
the
other
bank
officials
,
Mr.
Swift
included
,
of
the
power
of
speech
for
a
few
moments
.
Then
,
as
there
came
to
the
room
where
the
scene
had
taken
place
,
the
sound
of
the
mob
outside
,
clamoring
for
cash
,
Mr.
Pendergast
,
the
president
,
remarked
in
a
low
voice
:
</p>
<p>
&quot;
It
seems
to
be
the
only
way
.
Do
you
think
you
can
do
it
,
Tom
Swift
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
'm
sure
of
it
,
as
far
as
my
electric
car
is
concerned
,
&quot;
replied
the
young
inventor
.
&quot;
If
we
get
the
cash
I
'll
have
it
back
here
on
time
.
The
runabout
is
all
ready
for
a
fast
trip
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Then
do
n't
lose
any
time
,
Tom
,
&quot;
advised
his
father
.
&quot;
Every
minute
counts
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Yes
,
&quot;
added
Mr.
Damon
.
&quot;
Come
on
.
I
've
got
the
securities
in
my
valise
,
and
we
can
bring
the
cash
back
in
the
same
satchel
.
Come
on
,
Tom
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
eccentric
character
caught
up
his
valise
,
and
started
from
the
room
.
Tom
followed
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Now
,
my
son
,
be
careful
,
&quot;
advised
his
father
.
&quot;
You
know
the
need
of
haste
,
but
do
n't
take
unnecessary
risks
.
You
'd
better
go
out
the
back
way
,
as
the
crowd
is
easily
excited
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Little
more
was
said
.
Mr.
Swift
clasped
his
son
's
hand
in
a
firm
pressure
,
and
the
bank
president
nervously
bade
the
lad
good-by
.
Then
,
slipping
out
of
the
bank
,
by
the
rear
entrance
,
the
porter
closing
the
door
after
them
,
Tom
and
Mr.
Damon
took
their
places
in
the
electric
machine
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Just
imagine
you
're
racing
for
that
three-thousand-dollar
prize
,
offered
by
the
Touring
Club
of
America
,
Tom
,
&quot;
observed
Mr.
Damon
,
as
he
deposited
the
valise
at
his
feet
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
do
n't
have
to
do
that
,
&quot;
replied
the
youth
.
&quot;
I
'm
trying
for
a
bigger
prize
than
that
.
I
want
to
save
the
bank
,
and
defeat
the
schemes
of
the
Fogers
--
father
and
son
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Tom
turned
on
the
power
,
and
the
machine
rolled
out
on
the
main
street
.
As
it
turned
the
corner
,
leaving
the
impatient
crowd
of
depositors
,
now
larger
than
ever
,
behind
,
Mr.
Damon
glanced
over
at
the
new
bank
,
and
,
as
he
did
so
,
he
called
to
Tom
:
</p>
<p>
&quot;
There
are
the
Fogers
now
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
young
inventor
looked
,
and
saw
Andy
and
his
father
on
the
steps
of
the
new
institution
.
</p>
<p>
At
the
sight
of
the
electric
car
,
speeding
along
,
Andy
turned
and
spoke
to
his
parent
.
What
he
said
seemed
to
impress
Mr.
Foger
,
for
he
started
,
and
looked
more
intently
at
Tom
and
Mr.
Damon
.
Then
,
as
Tom
watched
,
he
saw
the
two
excitedly
conversing
,
and
a
moment
later
Andy
ran
off
in
the
direction
in
which
Sam
Snedecker
and
Pete
Bailey
lived
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
wonder
if
he
's
up
to
any
tricks
?
&quot;
thought
Tom
,
as
he
turned
on
more
power
.
&quot;
Well
,
if
he
is
,
I
'll
soon
be
where
he
ca
n't
reach
me
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
young
inventor
did
not
dare
send
his
car
at
full
speed
through
the
streets
of
the
town
,
and
it
was
not
until
several
minutes
had
passed
that
they
could
go
at
more
than
the
ordinary
rate
.
But
once
the
open
country
was
reached
Tom
&quot;
opened
her
up
full
,
&quot;
and
the
song
the
motor
sung
was
one
of
power
.
The
vehicle
quickly
gathered
headway
and
was
soon
fairly
whizzing
along
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
If
we
keep
this
up
we
'll
be
there
and
back
in
good
time
,
&quot;
remarked
Mr.
Damon
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Yes
,
but
we
ca
n't
do
it
,
&quot;
replied
his
companion
.
&quot;
The
road
to
Clayton
is
a
poor
one
,
and
we
'll
soon
be
on
it
.
Then
we
'll
have
to
go
slow
.
But
I
'll
make
all
the
time
I
can
until
then
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
So
,
for
several
miles
more
they
crept
along
,
at
times
having
to
reduce
to
almost
a
walking
pace
,
because
of
bad
roads
.
Mr.
Damon
looked
at
his
watch
almost
every
other
minute
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Eleven
o'clock
,
&quot;
he
remarked
,
as
they
passed
a
milestone
,
&quot;
and
we
're
not
half
way
there
.
Bless
my
gizzard
,
but
I
'm
afraid
we
wo
n't
make
it
,
Tom
.
We
left
about
ten
,
and
we
ought
to
be
back
by
two
o'clock
to
do
any
good
.
That
's
four
hours
,
and
it
will
take
some
time
to
transfer
the
securities
,
and
get
the
cash
.
Every
minute
counts
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
know
it
,
&quot;
answered
Tom
,
&quot;
and
I
'm
going
to
count
every
minute
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
With
eager
eyes
he
watched
every
inch
of
the
road
,
to
steer
to
the
best
advantage
.
His
hands
gripped
the
wheel
until
his
knuckles
showed
white
with
the
strain
,
and
,
every
now
and
then
his
right
hand
adjusted
the
speed
lever
or
the
controller
handle
,
while
his
foot
was
on
the
emergency
brake
,
ready
to
stop
the
car
at
the
first
sign
of
danger
.
</p>
<p>
And
there
was
danger
,
not
infrequently
,
for
the
road
was
up
and
down
hill
,
over
frail
bridges
,
and
along
steep
cliffs
.
It
was
no
pleasure
tour
they
were
on
.
</p>
<p>
When
a
little
over
half
the
distance
had
been
made
they
came
to
a
better
road
,
and
Tom
was
able
to
use
full
speed
ahead
.
Then
the
electric
went
so
fast
that
,
had
it
not
been
for
the
steel
wind-shield
in
front
,
Mr.
Damon
,
at
any
rate
,
would
have
been
short
of
breath
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
This
is
going
some
!
&quot;
he
cried
to
Tom
.
The
lad
nodded
grimly
,
and
shoved
the
controller
handle
over
to
the
last
notch
.
Then
came
a
bad
stretch
and
they
had
to
slow
down
again
.
As
they
were
about
out
of
it
there
came
a
little
flash
of
fire
and
the
motor
stopped
.
