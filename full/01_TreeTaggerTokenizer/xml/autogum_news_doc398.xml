appropriate
understanding
and
sensitivity
concerning
issues

<p>
On
Thursday
the
Turkish
government
released
a
statement
saying
that
&quot;
It
is
unacceptable
that
the
Turkish
nation
should
be
accused
of
a
crime
that
it
never
committed
in
its
history
.
&quot;
&quot;
We
still
hope
that
the
House
of
Representatives
will
have
enough
good
sense
not
to
take
this
resolution
further
,
&quot;
the
statement
added
.
A
statement
on
the
Turkish
Foreign
Ministry
web
site
said
that
the
resolution
&quot;
will
not
only
endanger
relations
with
a
friendly
and
allied
nation
but
will
also
jeopardize
a
strategic
partnership
that
has
been
cultivated
for
generations
.

<p>
On
Thursday
,
Turkey
recalled
its
U.S.
ambassador
Nabi
Sensoy
,
and
warned
of
further
repercussions
.
&quot;
Yesterday
some
in
Congress
wanted
to
play
hardball
,
&quot;
said
Turkish
foreign
policy
adviser
Egemen
Bagis
.
&quot;
I
can
assure
you
Turkey
knows
how
to
play
hardball
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
White
House
spokesman
Scott
Stanzel
said
he
was
&quot;
disappointed
&quot;
by
the
vote
.
While
acknowledging
that
&quot;
[
w]e
understand
the
feelings
that
people
have
about
the
tragic
suffering
of
the
Armenian
people
,
&quot;
Stanzel
warned
that
&quot;
Turkey
is
playing
a
critical
role
in
the
war
on
terror
and
this
action
is
problematic
for
everything
we
're
trying
to
do
in
the
Middle
East
and
would
cause
great
harm
to
our
efforts
.
&quot;
U.S.
President

and
Turkey
.
</p>
<p>
House
of
Representatives
speaker
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi">
Nancy
Pelosi
</ref>
said
the
resolution
will
go
forward
for
a
vote
in
the
House
despite
Turkish
opposition
.
&quot;
As
long
as
there
is
genocide
,
there
is
a
need
to
speak
out
against
it
,

Pelosi
said
