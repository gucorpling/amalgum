Do
a
Messier
Marathon
</head>
<p>
A
Messier
Marathon
is
a
stargazing
session
in
which
you
try
to
spot
all
one
hundred
and
ten
Messier
objects
in
one
night
.
Although
it
is
difficult
,
it
is
possible
,
with
some
stargazing
organisations
offering
certificates
to
those
who
complete
the
marathon
.

<list type="ordered">
<item>
Check
your
latitude
.
The
northernmost
Messier
object
is
at
almost
70
degrees
declination
,
meaning
that
you
have
to
be
north
of
20
degrees
south
latitude
.
The
southernmost
is
at
-35
degrees
declination
,
so
you
have
to
be
south
of
55
degrees
north
latitude
.
The
best
point
is
around
25
degrees
north
latitude
.

Find
an
appropriate
time
of
year
.
To
see
all
the
objects
in
one
night
,
you
have
to
pick
a
night
around
the
spring
equinox
.
Pick
a
night
where
there
is
a
new
moon
if
possible
,
or
a
thin
crescent
if
not
.

Search
for
the
times
that
the
Messier
objects
will
appear
on
that
night
.

Create
an
observation
plan
.
Basically
,
what
order
you
will
look
at
them
in
,
and
how
long
you
will
spend
on
each
one
.
You
'll
want
to
start
with
the
ones
that
are
only
in
the
sky
for
a
few
minutes
after
the
sun
has
set
,
and
finish
with
the
ones
that
rise
a
couple
of
minutes
before
the
sun
.

Find
a
dark
site
.
You
'll
want
somewhere
away
from
cities
,
and
you
'll
want
somewhere
elevated
,
so
that
objects
on
the
horizon
do
n't
block
your
view
.
The
top
of
a
big
hill
would
be
pretty
good
.
<figure rend="Do a Messier Marathon Step 5.jpg">

<item>
Get
to
the
dark
site
and
get
set
up
before
sunset
.
You
'll
be
looking
for
the
objects
as
soon
as
the
sun
sets
,
so
you
do
n't
want
to
be
faffing
around
with
your
telescope
in
the
dark
.
Get
there
early
,
get
set
up
,
then
relax
until
sunset
.

Get
a
computerised
telescope
(
optional
)
.
That
way
,
you
do
n't
have
to
swivel
it
around
yourself
:
just
enter
the
next
target
and
let
the
telescope
do
the
work
.

Take
photos
of
each
object
,
if
desired
.
Use
a
camera
that
will
time
and
date
each
photo
,
so
that
you
have
proof
that
you
did
it
all
in
one
night
.

<item>
Do
n't
panic
if
you
miss
one
.
You
'll
usually
be
able
to
come
back
to
it
,
and
if
you
miss
it
,
hey
,
there
's
always
next
year
.
</item>

Sometimes
there
's
two
nights
in
one
year
,
one
before
the
equinox
and
one
after
,
where
you
can
do
a
Messier
marathon
.
In
that
case
:
prepare
for
<hi rend="italic">
both
</hi>
nights
:
you
can
use
the
first
as
a
practise
run
,
and
if
it
's
cloudy
on
one
night
you
'll
have
a
plan
for
the
other
.

Warnings
</head>
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Do
not
start
stargazing
before
the
sun
has
set
,
and
stop
as
soon
as
it
comes
up
.
If
you
do
n't
,
you
run
the
risk
of
accidentally
looking
at
the
sun
through
your
telescope
-
which
will
make
you
go
blind
.
</item>
<item>
Do
n't
expect
too
much
.
Astronomical
objects
always
look
better
in
photographs
.
If
you
're
just
using
a
simple
stargazing
telescope
,
you
wo
n't
see
very
many
details
beyond
a
bunch
of
grey
fuzzy
patches
.
</item>
<item>
Not
all
of
the
objects
in
Messier
's
catalogue
are
deep-sky
objects
.
M40
is
a
double
star
,
and
M73
is
an
asterism
-
a
pattern
of
unrelated
stars
.
However
,
you
can
still
find
both
of
these
.
Watch
out
for
M102
,
though
-
it
has
n't
been
unambiguously
identified
.
Most
people
agree
that
it
is
either
a
repeat
of
M101
,
or
NGC
5866
.
Feel
free
to
give
M40
,
M73
and
M102
a
miss
,
especially
if
you
are
pushed
for
time
.
