<p>
If
you
look
at
what
Obama
said
,
it
was
n't
even
progressive
.
All
he
said
was
this
is
my
personal
statement
.
He
did
n't
say
that
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/North_Carolina">
North
Carolina
</ref>
was
wrong
[
for
passing
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North%20Carolina%20Amendment%201">
ban
</ref>
on
same-sex
marriage
]
.
You
have
to
read
the
tealeaves
when
this
guy
talks
.
All
the
guy
said
was
I
think
that
gay
marriage
is
fine
with
me
personally
.
He
did
n't
say
that
we
're
going
to
make
a
federal
law
that
makes
it
incumbent
upon
the
states
not
to
outlaw
it
.
He
did
n't
do
that
.
He
's
fine
with
those
kind
of
laws
.
He
's
not
going
to
go
out
there
and
do
any
more
than
say
what
he
said
.
So
he
did
n't
give
us
an
agenda
like
:
are
you
going
to
go
ahead
and
have
it
where
you
're
going
to
have
a
situation
,
are
you
going
to
allow
homosexual
or
same-sex
couples
to
go
ahead
and
have
tax
deductions
?
Are
you
going
to
allow
them
to
have
the
same
kind
of
income
tax
return
as
a
traditional
family
?
He
did
n't
go
through
all
that
.
He
just
made
a
general
statement
.
Now
he
's
off
the
floor
as
some
kind
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar%20(title)">
Caesar
</ref>
;
someone
vindicating
the
rights
of
gay
people
.
His
statement
was
very
vague
.
It
's
just
very
Obama-like
.
He
did
n't
really
commit
to
anything
.
He
just
said
that
was
his
personal
opinion
.

Well
,
personally
,
do
you
believe
it
is
a
federal
or
state
issue
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Wolfe
</hi>
:
I
think
it
's
a
state
issue
.
But
I
think
it
's
something
that
I
need
to
study
more
because
I
'm
a
person
really
that
tries
to
get
beyond
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/identity%20politics">
identity
politics
</ref>
.
I
'm
interested
mostly
in
three
things
.
My
interests
are
:
number
one
,
the
economy
.
You
get
people
back
to
work
,
then
we
can
quite
fighting
each
other
on
these
social
issues
.
Some
of
these
social
issues
are
accented
because
there
's
a
lot
of
unrest
with
the
economy
.
We
need
to
worry
about
three
things
I
think
:
getting
the
economy
back
right
,
getting
out
of
these
commitments
like
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Afghanistan">
Afghanistan
</ref>
and
dictators
abroad
,
we
need
to
get
out
of
that
,
then
we
need
to
protect
our
civil
liberties
at
home
.
Those
are
the
three
main
things
that
John
Wolfe
has
on
his
agenda
.
So
I
think
those
are
the
most
important
.
</p>
<p>
The
economy
is
<hi rend="italic">
the
</hi>
most
important
.
And
I
think
the
economy
ca
n't
be
reformed
until
you
reform
the
bank
.
You
noticed
yesterday
[
May
11
]
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPMorgan%20Chase">
JP
Morgan
</ref>
lost
two
billion
dollars
because
they
're
pouring
billions
of
dollars
into
all
this
speculation
,
and
some
of
the
credit
default
swaps
and
derivatives
.
Well
guess
what
?
We
're
underwriting
that
.
That
's
casino
capitalism
.
I
've
been
talking
about
this
all
last
year
and
all
this
year
about
how
bad
that
's
getting
.
Now
,
the
chickens
are
coming
home
to
roost
.
That
's
just
JP
Morgan
.
We
do
n't
know
what
the
next
bank
is
going
to
report
.
We
got
to
underwrite
all
that
.
See
,
Obama
's
never
made
an
effort
really
to
separate
that
out
because
he
's
so
ensconced
in
Wall
Street
money
,
and
so
persuaded
by
Wall
Street
advisers
right
there
in
the
oval
office
.
He
wo
n't
even
go
back
to
traditional
banking
to
make
these
people
separate
casino
capitalism
from
traditional
banking
.
He
has
n't
done
it
.
As
long
as
he
does
n't
,
we
're
going
to
have
to
underwrite
these
things
.
We
're
going
to
have
to
keep
bailing
them
out
,
bailing
them
out
,
bailing
them
out
.
We
should
n't
have
to
do
that
.
Obama
ought
to
do
something
about
that
.
People
want
that
done
,
but
he
ca
n't
do
.
He
's
handcuffed
because
he
's
afraid
of
Wall
Street
.
