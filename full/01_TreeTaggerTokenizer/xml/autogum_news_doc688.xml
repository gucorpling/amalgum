has
died
after
the

electric
company
</ref>
limited
his

use
due
to

<p>
Bay
City
Electric
Light
&amp;
Power
installed
a
power-limiting
device
on
his
home
on
January
13
.
The
device
would
limit
the
amount
of
power
the
resident
uses
and
would
essentially
shut
it
off
if
that
limit
is
reached
,
or
if
the
resident
fails
to
pay
the
outstanding
bill
within
10
days
of
installation
.
In
order
for
the
electricity
to
be
turned
back
on
,
the
limiter
must
be
reset
by
pushing
a
button
.
</p>
<p>
Bay
City
power
says
that
a
warning
,
indicating
that
the
power
was
to
be
turned
off
and
a
limiter
installed
,
had
been
placed
on
Schur
's
front
door
.
Despite
that
,
the
company
says
that
they
are
now
&quot;
looking
at
our
website
and
possibly
doing
an
automated
phone
message
.
We
obviously
need
to
get
the
word
out
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
autopsy
performed
on
Schur
's
body
concluded
that
he
had
died
&quot;
a
slow
,
painful
death
&quot;
caused
by
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hypothermia">
hypothermia
</ref>
.
Dr.
Kanu
Virani
,
who
performed
the
autopsy
,
explained
:
&quot;
Hypothermia
shuts
the
whole
system
down
,
slowly
.
It
's
not
easy
to
die
from
hypothermia
without
first
realizing
your
fingers
and
toes
feel
like
they
're
burning
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
It
was
less
than
32
degrees
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit">
Fahrenheit
</ref>
(
0
Centigrade
)
in
Schur
's
home
when
neighbors
found
Schur
dead
on
January
17
.
Virani
commented
that
it
was
his
first
time
performing
an
autopsy
on
a
body
in
which
&quot;
the
person
froze
to
death
indoors
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
His
furnace
was
not
running
-
the
insides
of
his
windows
were
full
of
ice
the
morning
we
found
him
,
&quot;
said
George
A.
Pauwels
Jr.
,
who
was
with
his
wife
when
they
found
Schur
's
body
.
</p>
<p>
In
Michigan
it
is
illegal
for
a
utility
company
to
disconnect
power
to
any
home
between
November
1
and
March
31
when
a
resident
is
over
the
age
of
65
.
Limiters
are
also
not
supposed
to
be
used
during
that
time
frame
.
However
,
municipally-owned
electric
utilities
like
the
one
in
Bay
City
,
are
not
regulated
by
the
state
.
The
Michigan
state
attorney
general
's
office
has
launched
an
investigation
into
the
incident
.
</p>
<p>
Residents
around
Schur
's
home
say
he
was
hard
of
hearing
,
and
the
city
states
that
the
device
's
function
and
operation
were
never
explained
to
him
.
When
word
of
the
story
got
around
,
people
from
all
over
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_States">
United
States
</ref>
began
to
call
the
city
in
anger
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
've
taken
calls
from
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Canada">

,

-
and
that
's
just
the
ones
I
can
think
of
off
the
top
of
my
head
,
&quot;
said
Melody
Roth
of
the
city
's
administrative
office
,
who
also
added
that
people
from
all
over
are
&quot;
calling
all
city
departments
,
not
just
our
office
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Schur
has
no
known
children
,
and
his
wife
had
died
several
years
prior
to
the
incident
.
