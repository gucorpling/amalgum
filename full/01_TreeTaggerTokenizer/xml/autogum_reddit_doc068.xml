Kinda
scared
about
trying
acid
for
the
first
time
(
I
have
a
200ug
tab
)
</head>
<sp who="#stevekoull">
<p>
I
have
what
is
said
to
be
a
200
tab
(
but
other
reddit
users
say
this
is
probably
an
overestimate/exaggeration
made
by
my
dealer
)
but
anyways
,
I
have
the
most
perfect
set
and
setting
.
I
’m
gonna
be
with
some
of
my
closest
friends
I
’ve
known
since
I
was
4
at
one
of
their
houses
.
Their
parents
will
let
us
out
and
do
whatever
til
whatever
time
we
want
.
I
’ll
probably
start
my
trip
at
around
5:30-6
on
a
hot/warm
sunny
day
.
I
’ll
be
playing
some
soccer
and
basketball
while
they
are
stoned
,
as
I
’ll
be
the
only
one
tripping
on
acid
.
We
might
even
swim
if
his
pool
is
open
.
His
house
is
full
of
great
times
and
memories
.
What
can
I
expect
from
this
trip
?
I
’m
scared
of
having
flashbacks
or
a
bad
trip
even
from
a
one
time
use
.
I
know
I
will
probably
trip
one
or
two
more
times
over
the
summer
if
I
like
my
first
time
.

Its
nothing
to
be
scared
of
,
but
certainly
something
to
have
reverence
for
.
Its
to
be
feared
as
in
respected
,
not
feared
as
in
frightened
of
.
It
s
a
powerful
teacher
and
a
beautiful
friend
.
You
will
quickly
realize
that
everything
is
out
of
love
.
</p>
<p>
Regarding
your
expectations
:
have
none
.
Try
not
to
expect
too
much
,
because
you
likely
wo
n't
get
anything
near
what
you
were
expecting
.
Its
impossible
to
fathom
until
you
experience
it
.
</p>
<p>
Regarding
your
setting
.
With
4
very
close
friends
that
's
pretty
good
,
but
I
would
nt
expect
to
be
able
to
just
chill
like
you
normally
would
.
You
ca
n't
just
chill
on
acid
.
It
takes
priority
over
whatever
you
're
doing
.
It
becomes
the
moment
.
Your
head
will
be
going
all
different
directions
.
It
s
a
whole
event
itself
.
It
s
not
like
weed
,
where
you
can
just
chill
on
it
and
do
whatever
.
You
will
be
on
acid
,
and
that
will
be
the
main
focus
no
matter
what
,
so
try
not
to
fight
that
.
That
said
,
you
can
still
have
fun
with
your
friends
,
just
do
nt
expect
to
be
all
there
.
Acid
expands
your
awareness
greatly
,
but
at
the
same
time
leaves
you
profoundly
disoriented
.
Make
sure
your
friends
know
this
,
and
are
down
to
make
whatever
accommodations
to
suit
your
needs
,
and
even
wants
.
Also
,
I
would
n't
swim
on
acid
your
first
time
.
This
will
all
make
sense
once
you
take
it
haha
!
</p>
<p>
But
MOST
importantly
let
loose
and
have
a
good
time
man
!
Let
go
and
let
the
drug
do
its
magic
!
</p>
