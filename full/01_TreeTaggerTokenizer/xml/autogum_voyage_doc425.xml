control
</ref>
in

.
Iraq
gained
independence
in
1932
.
On
14
July
1958
,
the
long-time
Hashamite
monarchy
was
overthrown
in
a
coup
led
by
Abdul
Kassem
that
paved
way
to
radical
political
reforms
,
including
the
legalisation
of
political
parties
such
as
the
Ba'ath
and
the
Communist
Party
,
both
key
players
in
the
coup
(
also
called
the
14
July
Revolution
)
.
Following
the
Revolution
,
the
Soviet
Union
gradually
became
its
main
arms
and
commercial
supplier
.
</p>
<p>
In
February
1963
,
Kassem
was
overthrown
and
killed
in
a
second
coup
that
brought
the
Ba'ath
Party
into
power
.
Internal
divisions
would
follow
for
the
next
five
years
,
until
another
coup
on
17
July
1968
led
by
Ahmad
Hassan
al-Bakr
(
with
Communist
support
)
stabilised
the
party
.
Relations
between
the
Communists
and
the
Ba'athists
ranged
from
mutual
cooperation
to
violent
mistrust
,
culminating
in
the
purge
of
Communists
from
the
army
and
the
government
by
1978
,
causing
a
temporary
rift
with
the
Soviet
Union
.
On
16
July
1979
,
Bakr
resigned
and
was
succeeded
by
right-hand
man
Saddam
Hussein
,
who
carefully
purged
his
enemies
and
became
a
dictator
almost
overnight
.
</p>
<p>
The
next
twenty-five
years
took
a
grinding
toll
on
the
country
.
A
long
war
with
neighbouring
Iran
in
the
1980s
cost
hundreds
of
thousands
of
lives
and
billions
of
dollars
.
The
invasion
of
Kuwait
in
1990
and
subsequent
Gulf
War
caused
further
casualties
,
followed
by
civil
war
inside
the
country
and
a
decade
of
international
sanctions
.
</p>
<p>
Iraq
was
invaded
in
2003
by
a
US/UK-led
coalition
of
forces
,
who
removed
Saddam
Hussein
from
power
,
destroyed
most
of
the
country
's
infrastructure
in
bombings
and
missile
strikes
,
and
triggered
intercommunal
violence
that
resulted
in
millions
of
Iraqis
fleeing
into
exile
and
many
more
internally
displaced
within
the
country
.
As
of
2012
,
no
foreign
troops
remained
in
Iraq
;
however
,
the
United
States
has
sent
advisors
back
into
Iraq
in
2014
at
the
request
of
the
Iraqi
government
,
and
others
are
based
in
Erbil
in
Iraqi
Kurdistan
.
This
is
in
connection
with
the
fight
against
the
&quot;
Islamic
State
&quot;
organization
,
which
earlier
in
2014
quickly
captured
large
areas
of
Iraq
and
Syria
primarily
inhabited
by
Sunni
Arabs
,
and
proceeded
to
conduct
wholesale
murders
of
non-Sunni
boys
and
men
and
enslavements
of
non-Sunni
women
and
girls
who
fell
under
their
power
.
An
American-led
coalition
and
Kurdish
and
Iraqi
armed
forces
finally
drove
them
out
of
the
country
in
late
2017
.

Geography
</head>
<p>
Iraq
mainly
consists
of
desert
,
but
near
the
two
major
rivers
(
Euphrates
and
Tigris
)
are
fertile
alluvial
plains
,
as
the
rivers
carry
about
60,000,000m³
(
78,477,037
cu
yd
)
of
silt
annually
to
the
delta
.
The
north
of
the
country
is
mostly
composed
of
mountains
;
the
highest
point
being
at
3,611m
(
11,847
ft
)
point
,
unnamed
on
the
map
opposite
,
but
known
locally
as
Cheekah
Dar
(
black
tent
)
.
Iraq
has
a
small
coastline
measuring
58km
(
36
mi
)
along
the
Persian
Gulf
.

<head>
Climate
</head>
<p>
Most
of
Iraq
has
a
hot
arid
climate
.
Summer
temperatures
average
above
40°C
(
104°F
)
for
most
of
the
country
and
frequently
exceed
48°C(118°F
)
.
Winter
temperatures
infrequently
exceed
21°C
(
70°F
)
with
maximums
roughly
15
to
16°C
(
59
to
61°F
)
and
night-time
lows
occasionally
below
freezing
.
Typically
precipitation
is
low
,
most
places
receive
less
than
250mm
(
10
in
)
annually
,
with
maximum
rainfall
during
the
months
of
November
to
April
.
Rainfall
during
the
summer
is
extremely
rare
except
in
the
very
north
of
the
country
.
