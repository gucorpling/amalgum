Post

I
've
ranted
before
at
how
I
HATE
to
see
friends
with
chronic
illness
get
pulled
into
MLMs
.
Some
of
my
friends
are
so
sick
I
do
n't
see
how
they
'd
have
enough
time
for
these
things
even
if
they
were
legit
and
the
amount
of
FB
invites
I
get
,
these
financially
struggling
sick
girls
asking
all
their
other
financially
struggling
sick
girl
friends
to
buy
from
them
breaks
my
heart
.
If
most
of
your
friends
are
as
poor
as
you
are
this
is
a
bad
idea
from
the
get
go
.
Also
,
I
'm
the
blue
person
in
the
links
.
Am
dead
serious
about
mailing
this
girl
some
good
lipsticks
.
I
was
admitted
shocked
that
she
finds
LipSense
to
be
such
an
improvement
over
whatever
she
's
tried
before
.
Baffling
.
Even
sent
a
message
to
a
mutual
friend
who
went
to
beauty
school
so
maybe
if
nothing
else
her
or
I
can
convince
mutual
friend
there
's
better
and
more
honest
products
out
there
.
But
I
also
do
n't
know
this
girl
very
well
.
She
seems
sweet
.
She
's
been
supportive
of
me
and
my
health
crud
and
hey
I
get
what
it
's
like
to
be
poor
.
But
I
know
I
ca
n't
say
too
much
to
her
because
we
have
n't
talked
much
.
We
bonded
initially
over
the
death
of
a
mutual
friend
.
I
'm
almost
hesitant
to
even
post
this
but
then
again
if
she
found
this
community
,
well
,
good
.
And
honestly
if
I
did
n't
care
,
I
would
've
left
it
alone
.
Girl
has
been
in
and
out
of
the
hospital
a
lot
.
She
's
got
far
more
important
stuff
to
deal
with
.
So
I
guess
that
's
why
I
feel
so
strongly
about
this
.
Any
advice
on
how
to
proceed
?
Some
good
links
outside
of
Reddit
on
LipSense
that
I
can
share
if
she
seemed
receptive
?
Heck
recommendations
for
better
lipstick
that
's
somewhat
similar
to
LipSense
(
never
used
the
product
myself
so
I
do
n't
know
how
it
compares
but
I
absolutely
am
willing
to
send
her
some
deluxe
samples
of
Kat
Von
D
,
Bite
,
NARS
,
my
own
favorite
products
)
.
I
hate
watching
people
who
already
struggling
so
much
get
pulled
into
this
garbage
.

I
'm
reaching
out
because
I
'm
really
concerned
that
you
're
being
preyed
on
,
and
so
is
your
friend
trying
to
get
you
to
join
.
Your
friend
may
not
even
realize
that
she
's
preying
on
you
since
she
may
not
know
she
's
being
used
by
the
company
yet
.

</p>
<p>
I
am
not
saying
any
of
these
things
as
a
rich
girl
myself
.
</p>
<p>
This
get
rich
quick
scheme
will
not
get
you
rich
.
The
person
that
wants
you
to
sell
does
n't
make
enough
money
selling
the
products
herself
so
she
's
trying
to
get
you
to
become
her
'
downline
,
'
since
Lipsence
is
a
pyramid
scheme
.
Actually
selling
the
makeup
does
n't
bring
in
anything
close
to
anything
financially
worthwhile
.
You
get
people
to
pay
for
starter
kits
and
orders
for
resale
,
but
actual
resale
does
not
yield
profit
.
Does
that
sound
like
a
system
that
works
to
you
?
A
company
that
ca
n't
make
enough
to
sustain
itself
on
the
product
?
</p>
<p>
Even
if
you
can
get
a
pre-order
for
literally
every
single
item
in
your
starter
kit
you
will
not
have
a
sustainable
income
.
The
lipsticks
are
way
too
expensive
and
have
been
known
to
damage
your
lips
.
You
will
not
have
repeat
customers
for
more
than
a
month
.
You
should
n't
feel
a
burning
sensation
on
your
lips
from
your
makeup
,
and
you
should
not
be
encouraged
to
strip
off
your
natural
skin
oils
for
harsh
chemicals
with
a
poor
pH
balance
.
The
product
is
low
quality
with
a
boutique
price
tag
.
</p>
<p>
I
'm
sending
you
this
because
I
know
how
these
companies
work
,
I
know
how
Lipsence
works
,
and
although
we
are
not
close
I
do
n't
want
to
see
you
pulled
in
to
someone
else
's
financial
struggle
on
top
of
your
current
situation
in
life
.
I
am
sending
this
with
nothing
but
love
in
hopes
that
you
do
n't
get
pushed
into
financial
disaster
.
</p>
<p>
If
I
have
offended
you
I
'm
sorry
.
If
you
still
wish
to
go
through
with
this
it
's
your
choice
,
but
it
is
n't
something
I
want
to
see
happen
to
you
.
