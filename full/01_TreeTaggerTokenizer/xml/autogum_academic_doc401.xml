Introduction
</head>
<p>
One
of
athletes
’
main
objectives
is
to
develop
their
own
abilities
in
order
to
increase
their
commitment
and
sports
performance
.
However
,
it
is
also
necessary
for
them
to
consolidate
the
habits
of
a
healthy
lifestyle
and
fully
develop
their
physical
,
cognitive
,
and
social
capacities
.
In
this
sense
,
coaches
can
have
a
significant
influence
on
athletes
’
commitment
to
an
activity
,
primarily
because
the
development
of
an
athlete
’s
personality
and
cognitive
capacities
depends
on
the
degree
of
interaction
maintained
by
the
coach
.
Thus
,
on
one
hand
,
these
individuals
must
comprehend
the
importance
of
each
practice
as
part
of
a
training
program
in
its
totality
.
On
the
other
hand
,
he/she
must
also
understand
and
be
aware
of
the
transformation
and
personal
changes
of
each
athlete
on
social
,
cognitive
,
and
emotional
levels
.
However
,
to
date
,
studies
have
mainly
examined
the
coach
’s
influence
on
athletes
’
motivational
processes
and
their
subsequent
performance
in
competition
,
in
detriment
to
their
emotional
intelligences
,
which
are
in
fact
an
important
resource
for
the
generation
of
adaptive
behaviors
that
can
help
increase
athletic
performance
.
Based
on
the
information
previously
detailed
,
the
objective
of
the
present
study
is
to
analyze
the
influence
of
coaches
on
emotional
intelligence
(
EI
)
,
as
well
as
on
levels
of
anxiety
,
motivation
,
self-esteem
,
and
resilience
among
athletes
.
</p>
<p>
Self-determination
theory
(
SDT
;
)
is
a
macrotheory
on
human
motivation
that
highlights
the
influence
of
interpersonal
and
social
surroundings
on
human
behavior
.
SDT
defends
the
existence
of
three
different
types
of
motivation
(
self-motivation
,
controlled
motivation
,
and
demotivation
)
which
greatly
influence
social
relationships
,
personal
well-being
,
and
individual
performance
.
In
this
regard
,
self-motivation
reflects
the
reasons
why
individuals
engage
in
certain
behaviors
;
reasons
which
are
based
on
a
sense
of
choice
,
willingness
,
and
ownership
toward
an
action
.
In
contrast
,
controlled
motivation
represents
a
series
of
behaviors
influenced
by
obligation
or
pressure
from
others
.
Finally
,
amotivation
involves
the
complete
absence
of
motivation
.
These
last
two
types
of
motivation
lead
to
a
lack
of
self-regulation
of
adaptive
behaviors
,
as
people
tend
to
avoid
and/or
cease
an
activity
due
to
the
absence
of
rewards
,
external
social
recognition
,
or
the
use
of
coercive
measures
.
Conversely
,
self-motivation
facilitates
adaptation
,
as
it
leads
to
self-regulation
of
behavior
,
mainly
because
individuals
tend
to
persist
due
to
their
own
satisfaction
produced
by
the
activity
.
</p>
<p>
According
to
SDT
,
the
motivation
experienced
by
the
individual
is
influenced
by
their
social
context
,
which
is
determined
by
two
very
different
interpersonal
styles
:
Autonomy
support
or
controlling
style
.
Autonomy
support
refers
to
the
promotion
of
self-initiative
and
the
mental
and
physical
self-development
of
the
athlete
.
In
contrast
,
the
controlling
style
is
based
on
external
pressures
,
the
use
of
coercive
measures
,
and
obligations
.
In
this
case
,
athletes
perceive
these
strategies
as
the
origin
of
their
behaviors
,
undermining
their
own
initiative
,
effort
,
and
personal
self-knowledge
.
</p>
<p>
Various
studies
examining
the
field
of
sports
from
the
perspective
of
SDT
have
shown
that
autonomy
support
from
coaches
can
contribute
to
the
generation
of
positive
adaptive
behaviors
among
athletes
related
to
,
for
example
,
their
self-esteem
,
self-concept
,
and
sense
of
well-being
.
Conversely
,
the
controlling
style
employed
by
a
coach
is
positively
associated
with
high
levels
of
controlled
motivation
,
stress
,
depression
,
and
maladaptive
behaviors
.
However
,
hardly
any
studies
exist
which
have
analyzed
the
influence
a
coach
has
on
the
athlete
’s
control
over
his/her
own
emotions
and
emotional
state
during
competition
and/or
training
sessions
.
Indeed
,
sports
are
quite
powerful
in
the
sense
that
they
generate
a
range
of
emotions
during
a
variety
of
events
which
athletes
experience
while
competing
or
training
;
not
to
mention
the
emotions
produced
during
regular
interaction
with
coaches
,
teammates
,
and
other
players
.
</p>
<p>
Emotional
Intelligence
(
EI
)
is
a
relatively
new
term
which
is
defined
as
the
ability
to
facilitate
the
recognition
and
regulation
of
emotions
that
,
in
turn
,
facilitate
the
generation
of
adaptive
behaviors
.
There
are
two
main
theories
that
seek
to
comprehend
the
concept
of
EI
:
the
trait
model
and
the
ability
model
.
The
differences
between
both
lie
in
the
fact
that
trait
theory
considers
EI
to
be
a
construct
linked
to
a
set
of
stable
personality
traits
,
socio-emotional
competences
,
motivational
aspects
,
and
various
cognitive
abilities
which
are
essential
for
facing
obligations
and
pressures
.
In
contrast
,
the
ability
model
views
EI
as
a
type
of
intelligence
based
on
the
adaptive
use
of
emotions
and
their
application
in
our
thinking
,
which
allows
the
individual
to
adapt
to
his/her
surroundings
and
solve
problems
.
Despite
their
differences
,
both
theories
share
several
common
elements
,
such
as
the
fact
that
emotions
are
considered
predictors
of
positive
adaptive
behaviors
.
