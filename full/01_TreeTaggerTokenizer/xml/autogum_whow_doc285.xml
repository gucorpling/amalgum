Make
Pikelets
</head>
<p>
Pikelets
are
a
type
of
griddlecake
that
are
popular
in
Australia
,
the
United
Kingdom
,
and
New
Zealand
.
They
're
similar
to
both
pancakes
and
crumpets
,
and
make
a
delicious
dish
for
breakfast
,
brunch
,
and
buffets
.
Pikelets
are
typically
smaller
than
pancakes
and
sweeter
than
crumpets
,
so
they
make
a
tasty
treat
for
kids
and
adults
alike
,
and
are
also
great
for
tea
time
.

them
together
.

It
’s
important
to
crack
the
egg
first
into
an
empty
bowl
,
because
that
way
you
can
easily
remove
any
shell
pieces
that
fall
in
.

Combine
the
wet
and
dry
ingredients
.
Use
your
hand
or
a
spoon
to
make
a
well
in
the
center
of
the
flour
mixture
.
Pour
the
egg
and
milk
mixture
into
the
well
.
Whisk
all
the
ingredients
together
until
they
're
just
combined
and
form
a
smooth
,
thick
batter
.

Do
n’t
overmix
the
batter
,
as
this
will
develop
the
gluten
in
the
flour
.
This
will
result
in
dense
pikelets
.

Making
a
well

the
ingredients

Add
more
milk
if
necessary
.
Pikelet
batter
should
be
thick
,
but
not
so
thick
that
it
wo
n’t
drop
off
the
end
of
a
spoon
.
If
the
batter
is
n't
runny
enough
to
do
that
,
add
milk
in
tablespoonfuls
(
15-ml
increments
)
until
you
achieve
the
right
consistency
.

Preheat
the
griddle
.
Place
your
griddle
or
frying
pan
over
medium
heat
and
allow
it
to
warm
up
.
If
you
're
not
using
a
non-stick
pan
,
add
a
tablespoon
(
15
ml
)
of
cooking
oil
to
the
pan
as
well
.

When

warm

pick
up

swirl
the
oil
around
to
coat
the
pan

You
can
use
butter
to
cook
the
pikelets
,
but
butter
has
a
much
lower
smoke
point
than
oil
,
and
even
medium
heat
will
be
enough
to
burn
it
.

Cook
the
pikelets

Pikelets
are
traditionally
quite
small
,
and
each
one
only
requires
a
tablespoon
(
15
ml
)
of
batter
.
Drop
one
tablespoonful
of
batter
into
the
hot
pan
for
each
pikelet
,
leaving
room
between
them
for
expansion
.

Cook
the
pikelets
for
about
a
minute
,
until
bubbles
begin
to
form
and
pop
in
the
surface
of
the
batter
.
When
that
happens
,
flip
them
over
and
cook
for
another
minute
or
so
,
until
both
sides
are
golden
brown
.

Keep
cooked
pikelets
warm

Remove
the
cooked
pikelets
from
the
pan
and
transfer
them
to
a
plate
.
Cover
them
with
a
clean
tea
towel
so
they
stay
warm
while
you
cook
the
remaining
batches
.

Like
pancakes

them
with
fresh
fruit
cut
