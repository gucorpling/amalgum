Wolfe
,
an
attorney
based
out
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chattanooga,%20Tennessee">
Chattanooga
</ref>
,
announced
his
intentions
last
year
to
challenge
President
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Barack_Obama">
Barack
Obama
</ref>
in
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic%20Party%20presidential%20primaries,%202012">
Democratic
Party
presidential
primaries
</ref>
.
So
far
,
he
has
appeared
on
the
primary
ballots
in
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/New_Hampshire">
New
Hampshire
</ref>
,
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Missouri">
Missouri
</ref>
,
and
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Louisiana">
Louisiana
</ref>
.
In
Louisiana
,
he
had
his
strongest
showing
,
winning
12
percent
overall
with
over
15
percent
in
some
congressional
districts
,
qualifying
him
for
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">
Democratic
National
Convention
</ref>
delegates
.
However
,
because
certain
paperwork
had
not
been
filed
,
the
party
stripped
Wolfe
of
the
delegates
.
Wolfe
says
he
will
sue
the
party
to
receive
them
.
</p>
<p>
Wolfe
will
compete
for
additional
delegates
at
the
May
22
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Arkansas">
Arkansas
</ref>
primary
and
the
May
29
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Texas">
Texas
</ref>
primary
.
He
is
the
only
challenger
to
Obama
in
Arkansas
,
where
a
May
10
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrix%20College">
Hendrix
College
</ref>
poll
of
Democrats
shows
him
with
38
percent
support
,
just
short
of
the
45
percent
for
Obama
.
Such
an
outing
would
top
the
margin
of
Texas
prison
inmate
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith%20Russell%20Judd">
Keith

</ref>
,
who
finished
18

behind
Obama
with
41
percent
in
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/West_Virginia">
West
Virginia
</ref>
Democratic
primary
;
the
strongest
showing
yet
against
the
incumbent
president
.
Despite
these
prospects
,
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic%20Party%20of%20Arkansas">
Democratic
Party
of
Arkansas
</ref>
has
already
announced
that
if
Wolfe
wins
any
delegates
in
their
primary
,
again
,
due
to
paperwork
,
the
delegates
will
not
be
awarded
.
Wolfe
will
appear
on
the
Texas
ballot
alongside
Obama
,

and

who
ended
his
campaign
last

.
</p>
<p>
Wolfe
has
previously
run
for
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_States_Congress">

</ref>
as
the

's
nominee

On

,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall%20Street">

and
corporations
&quot;
on
the
Obama
administration
as
a
reason
for
his
challenge
,
believing
these
negatively
affect
&quot;
loyal
Americans
,
taxpayers
and
small
businesses
.
&quot;
Wolfe
calls
for
the

of

What
is
the
status
of
your
lawsuit
concerning
Louisiana
delegates
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
John
Wolfe
</hi>
:
Yeah
.
We
're
still
going
to
file
it
.
I
mean
the
convention
is
not
until
September
.
Now
it
's
May
.
So
we
got
what
,
four
months
until
the
convention
starts
?
And
all
we
're
going
to
ask
for
relief
is
to
get
awarded
the
delegates
.
</p>
<p>
So
yeah
we
're
getting
it
ready
.
We
have
other
campaigning
to
do
.
And
I
'm
a
lawyer
so
I
'll
be
able
to
do
the
suit
right
.
But
it
does
take
time
and
energy
.
It
will
be
filed
.
I
hope
to
file
it
Monday
[
May
14
]
.
