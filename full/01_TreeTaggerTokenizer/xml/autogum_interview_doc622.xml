Why

you

parliament

Why
do
you
represent
your
party
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
I
am
delighted
and
thrilled
I
am
to
be
representing
the
Australian
Sex
Party
,
whose
policies
on
sex
,
gender
,
human
rights
and
equality
are
very
close
to
my
heart
.
We
believe
that
the
personal
is
political
,
and
we
’re
serious
about
sex
and
the
way
that
it
directly
affects
individuals
in
areas
of
health
,
censorship
,
discrimination
,
workplace
,
education
and
equality
.
</p>
<p>
Rarely
do
we
hear
politicians
speaking
in
positive
or
open-minded
terms
about
issues
relating
to
sex
,
sexuality
and
gender
.
Much
rhetoric
in
Australian
politics
in
fact
uses
particularly
moralising
or
religious
discourses
that
are
governed
by
heteronormative
,
patriarchal
and
hegemonic
ideals
.
Indeed
,
our
party
needed
an
electoral
commission
ruling
that
it
s
'
name
was
not
‘
obscene
’
.
In
this
climate
,
we
aim
to
disrupt
,
expose
and
eliminate
the
plethora
of
taboos
and
stigmas
,
shame
and
isolation
around
sex
,
sexuality
,
and
gender
,
to
advocate
for
wider
equality
and
freedom
from
harm
for
all
Australians
.

What
would
the
three
main
policies
you
are
taking
into
this
by-election
be
?

<hi rend="bold">
How
would
you
address
these
policies
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
We
’re
proud
to
announce
that
the
Australian
Sex
Party
has
policies
in
a
diverse
number
of
areas
.
We
are
concerned
about
child
protection
and
education-
we
would
like
to
convene
a
Royal
Commission
into
child
sex
abuse
in
religious
institutions
,
and
assist
develop
global
approaches
to
child
pornography
,
whilst
importantly
,
establishing
a
national
sex
education
curriculum
for
children
,
an
internet
education
scheme
for
parents
,
a
uniform
classification
scheme
for
non-violent
erotica
,
introducing
R
and
X
ratings
for
computer
games
,
and
return
Internet
censorship
to
parents
and
individuals
.
</p>
<p>
One
of
our
fundamental
concerns
is
equality
–
including
paid
maternity
leave
,
ensuring
equal
numbers
of
women
in
Parliament
,
legalisation
of
abortion
,
enacting
more
comprehensive
federal
anti-discrimination
laws
in
line
with
the
Australian
Human
Rights
Commission
recommendations
,
creating
total
equal
rights
in
all
areas
of
the
law
for
gay
,
lesbian
and
transgender
people
,
overturning
discriminatory
laws
in
the
Northern
Territory
banning
Indigenous
people
from
possessing
erotic
media
,
and
ensuring
the
sexual
rights
of
the
elderly
and
people
with
a
disability
.
