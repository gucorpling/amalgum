Given
current
circumstances
I
think
the
main
goal
should
be
to
nationalise
means
of
production
and
services
such
as
banks
but
under
democratic
control
by
unions
and
local
councils
where
it
effects
local
economies
and
re-elect
local
representatives
where
needed
.
</p>
<p>
There
is
a
necessity
for
a
planned
economy
but
one
controlled
not
by
bureaucracy
but
by
the
people
participating
in
it
.

For
right
or
for
wrong
,
we
have
now
reached
a
situation
where
Greece
is
on
the
brink
of
an
international
bailout
.
If
you
were
given
power
tomorrow
,
what
steps
would
you
take
immediately
to
get
Greece
back
on
track
?

</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">

</hi>
<hi rend="bold">

<hi rend="bold">

</hi>
We
would
immediately
nationalise
the
banks
.
We
would
refuse
to
pay
the
bonds
which
were
called
upon
during
this
time
,
renationalise
privatised
industries
and
invest
in
such
a
planned
economy
.
</p>
<p>
Basically
,
we
would
refuse
to
pay
debts
created
by
the
banks
on
our
government
.

<list type="unordered">

Petros
then
gave
some
statistics
on
Greek
defence
expenditure
.
He
stated
that
Greece
is
the
5THin
the
world
in
such
expenditure
;
but
,
has
only
the
28TH-highest
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gross%20domestic%20product">

combined
with
the

Picking
up
on
your
comments
about
defense
expenditure
:
Is
that
expenditure
a
result
of
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek – Turkish%20relations">
perceived
threat
</ref>
from
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Turkey">
Turkey

,
and
if
so
,
is
this
really
an
issue
or
a
creation
of
a
problem
where
there
is
n’t
one
?
