Become
an
Eclectic
or
Independent
Music
Beacon
</head>
<p>
It
can
be
a
daunting
task
,
building
a
large
,
eclectic
and
interesting
play
list
.
This
is
an
entirely
subjective
guide
to
how
to
be
happier
,
more
elitist
and
more
impressive
,
on
a
tiny
budget
,
without
illegal
downloading

Steps
</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Start
with
a
couple
favorite
bands
that
you
already
like
.
This
is
usually
an
option
.
It
's
generally
best
if
you
already
like
one
of
the
historically
important
old
indie
rock
bands
listed
below
,
mainly
if
you
are
going
for
the
all-encompassing
eclectic-indie
kind
of
play
list
that
is
so
very
rewarding
.
However
,
if
you
,
right
now
,
fit
into
the
Warnings
category
,
you
have
to
start
somewhere
on
the
road
to
cool-geekdom
(
it
's
the
best
way
to
superficial
popularity
there
is
!
)
.
If
you
do
n't
already
,
buy
at
least
one
full
album
each
by
at
least
three
of
the
bands
listed
below
.
Make
sure
you
actually
like
the
bands
.

<item>
Read
up
on
the
bands
you
've
chosen
using
the
sources
listed
in
Tips
.
Pay
attention
to
the
movement
,
genre
or
scene
the
band
is
considered
a
part
of
,
and
even
more
attention
to
any
given
similar-artists
type
information
.

<item>
Look
up
whatever
related
bands
you
can
find
.
This
is
important
.
Listen
to
them
if
possible
.
Start
making
a
list
of
albums
to
buy
,
or
just
bands
to
look
for
.

Keep
reading
about
the
history
of
the
bands
!
Not
the
members
or
the
dates
of
course
,
but
the
influences
and
music
and
genre
.

Never
be
intimidated
by
bands
you
've
never
heard
of
,
especially
not
old
ones
.
If
someone
is
talking
to
you
about
a
band
you
do
n't
know
,
ask
them
.
Go
to
small
venue
concerts
whenever
possible
.
Who
cares
if
you
know
the
band
?

Develop
your
own
tastes
.
Find
your
own
bands
.
Try
to
focus
on
a
niche
genre
while
also
building
your
overall
collection
.
Jazz
.
Noise
rock
.
Experimental
.
Delta
blues
.
Lounge
.
Soul
.
Crust
punk
.
There
are
so
many
weird
bands
out
there
,
what
are
you
waiting
for
?
No
one
will
ever
think
you
are
cool
because
you
listen
to
loud
music
.
Remember
that
metal
is
the
most
popular
form
of
music
as
far
as
sales
go
.
&quot;
Just
because
it
's
loud
does
n't
mean
it
's
good
.
&quot;
If
you
go
to
a
noise
rock
concert
,
seriously
,
wear
earplugs
.

Last

fm
and
Pandora.com
are
great
ways
to
find
new
music
you
like
.
Here
's
their
description
of
themselves
:
&quot;
Pandora
is
a
music
discovery
service
designed
to
help
you
find
and
enjoy
music
that
you
'll
love
.
It
's
powered
by
the
Music
Genome
Project
,
the
most
comprehensive
analysis
of
music
ever
undertaken
.
Just
tell
us
one
of
your
favorite
songs
or
artists
and
we
'll
launch
a
streaming
station
to
explore
that
part
of
the
music
universe
.
&quot;

If
you
live
near
one
,
Half
Price
Books
is
a
great
place
to
get
cheap
music
.
They
almost
always
have
CDs
for
$
2
or
less
.
</item>
<item>
There
are
many
independent
music
distribution
sites
out
there
now
where
you
can
stock
up
on
huge
amounts
of
obscure
mp3s
for
free
-
try
sites
like
Amie
Street
,
Podcomplex
and
Broadjam
.
</item>
<item>
iTunes
is
an
excellent
way
to
find
new
music
,
except
that
it
does
n't
have
an
entirely
complete
selection
.
But
the
music
store
's
Browse
feature
is
awesome
.
Look
randomly
for
interesting-looking
bands
,
then
double
click
them
and
see
if
there
's
a
biography
.
Also
,
the
All-Music
Guide
To
Rock
is
very
nice
.
It
's
a
little
hard
to
build
your
tastes
from
this
,
but
LastFM
is
good
for
seeing
what
people
like
you
are
listening
to
-
particularly
if
you
live
outside
the
US
,
now
that
Pandora
has
been
blocked
.

If

see
right
through
your
