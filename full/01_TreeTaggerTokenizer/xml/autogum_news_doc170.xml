Petraeus
says
the
battle
of
Marja
is
just
the
beginning

&quot;
This
is
just
the
initial
operation
of
what
will
be
a
12-

18-month
campaign

,
Petraeus
said
the
enemy
is
formidable
.
He
did
not
predict
how
long
the
operation
in
Marja
,
a
traditional
Taliban
stronghold
,
would
continue
.
He
said
only
that
the
fighting
is
tough
.
&quot;
When
we
go
on
the
offensive
,
when
we
take
away
sanctuaries
and
safe
havens
from
the
Taliban
and
the
other
extremist
elements
that
we
and
our
Afghan
and
coalition
partners
are
fighting
in
that
country
,
they
are
going
to
fight
back
.
And
we
are
seeing
that
in
Marjah
.
We
will
see
that
in
other
areas
,
&quot;
he
said
.

<p>
The
general
spoke
from
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa">
Tampa
</ref>
,
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Florida">
Florida
</ref>
,
where
he
heads
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S.%20Central%20Command,">
U.S.
Central
Command
,
</ref>
which
is
responsible
for
military
operations
in
both
Afghanistan
and
Iraq
.
</p>
<p>
He
noted
the
difficulties
encountered
in
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Iraq">
Iraq
</ref>
when
former
President
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/George_W._Bush">
George
W.
Bush
</ref>
sent
in
additional
troops
in
what
was
called
a
&quot;
surge
.
&quot;
Petraeus
was
asked
if
,
once
again
,
Americans
should
prepare
for
significant
losses
.
&quot;
They
will
be
tough
.
They
were
tough
in
Iraq
.
Look
,
I
have
repeatedly
said
these
types
of
efforts
are
hard
and
they
are
hard
all
the
time
.
I
do
not
use
words
like
optimistic
or
pessimist
.
I
use
realist
.
And
the
reality
is
it
is
hard
,
but
we
are
there
for
a
very
important
reason
and
we
cannot
forget
that
,
&quot;
he
said
.
</p>
<p>
So
far
,
12
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/NATO">
NATO

troops
have
died
in
the
offensive
.
Three
others
were
reported
killed
in
separate
,
unrelated
incidents
in
southern
and
eastern
Afghanistan
.
Operation
Moshtarak
is
the
largest
military
action
against
insurgents
since
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War%20in%20Afghanistan">

in

General

</p>
<p>
Petraus
was
also
asked
about
the
military
's
controversial
&quot;
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/don't%20ask,%20don't%20tell">
do
n't
ask
,
do
n't
tell

&quot;
policy
,
which
President
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Barack_Obama">
Barack
Obama
</ref>
has
pledged
to
end
.
While
refusing
to
comment
directly
on
the
policy
,
Petraus
responded
by
saying
stating
that
he
had
n't
exerpeinced
any
problems
with
gays
and
lesbians
in
the
military
in
the
past
.
&quot;
I
served
,
in
fact
,
in
combat
with
individuals
who
were
gay
and
who
were
lesbian
in
combat
situations
and
,
frankly
,
you
know
,
over
time
you
said
,
‘
Hey
,
how
’s
this
guy
’s
shooting
?
’
Or
,
‘
How
is
her
analysis
?
’
or
what
have
you
,
&quot;
he
said
.
</p>
<p>
The
general
also
noted
his
opposition
to
torture
saying
,
&quot;
Whenever
we
have
,
perhaps
,
taken
expedient
measures
,
they
have
turned
around
and
bitten
us
in
the
backside
.
&quot;
He
added
,
&quot;
We
end
up
paying
a
price
for
it
ultimately
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu%20Ghraib%20torture%20and%20prisoner%20abuse">
Abu
Ghraib
</ref>
and
other
situations
like
that
are
non-biodegradable
.
They
do
n’t
go
away
.
The
enemy
continues
to
beat
you
with
them
like
a
stick
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile
,
the
Obama
administration
's
Afghanistan
strategy
got
a
vote
of
confidence
Sunday
from
retired
General
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin%20Powell">
Colin
Powell
</ref>
,
who
served
as
President
Bush
's
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">
Secretary
of
State
</ref>
during
his
first
term
in
office
.
</p>
<p>
Powell
said
it
is
a
good
,
comprehensive
plan
.
But
at
the
same
time
,
he
acknowledged
he
has
concerns
about
whether
or
not
the
Afghan
government
can
follow-up
once
the
NATO
operation
pushes
the
Taliban
out
.
&quot;
I
hope
their
capability
will
increase
.
The
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan%20National%20Army">
Afghan
National
Army
</ref>
is
improved
but
clearly
not
up
to
U.S.
standards
yet
.
And
the
police
force
-
they
have
a
lot
to
prove
,
they
do
not
yet
have
the
confidence
of
the
people
,
&quot;
he
said
.

<p>
Powell
was
interviewed

program
