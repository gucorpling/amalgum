This
was
a
piece
that
the
Times
only
quoted
one
stanza
,
but
it
's
about
preparation
for
a
battle
,
and
being
prepared
to
either
rise
to
the
occasion
,
or
go
down
:
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">
Do
you
know
what
it
's
like
</hi>
<hi rend="italic">
to
be
chased
by
the
Ghost
of
Failure
</hi>
<hi rend="italic">
while
staring
through
Victory
's
door
?
</hi>
<hi rend="italic">
Of
course
you
do
,
you
're
a
Mets
fan
</hi>
<hi rend="italic">
caught
in
a
do-or-die
moment
</hi>
<hi rend="italic">
in
late
September
at
Shea
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">
As
one
that
's
battled
hard
</hi>
<hi rend="italic">
through
many
a
broken
dream
</hi>
<hi rend="italic">
Let
me
say
,
&quot;
in
order
to
rise
to
the
occasion
</hi>
<hi rend="italic">
you
must
be
willing
</hi>
<hi rend="italic">
to
go
down
with
the
ship
&quot;
,
</hi>
<hi rend="italic">
Have
no
fear
,
no
hesitation
,
</hi>
<hi rend="italic">
for
Winning
shall
be
it
's
reward
!
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">
Do
n't
let
them
get
in
your
head
!
</hi>
<hi rend="italic">
you
've
kept
it
up
this
long
</hi>
<hi rend="italic">
You
're
a
Mets
fan
in
late
September
</hi>
<hi rend="italic">
and
you
'll
fight
til
the
glorious
end
</hi>
<hi rend="italic">
Cheer
the
team
today

</hi>
<hi rend="italic">
(
your
boys
in
orange
and
blue

<hi rend="italic">
Let
them
hear
you
shout

as
they
fight
for
what
's
mightily
due

This
one
person
who
I
never
met
took
a
picture
of
me
and
sent
it
to
me
in
an
e-mail
.
The
e-mail
said
,
'
Frank
,
I
have
never
bothered
you
during
the
game
,
but
I
just
wanted
to
say
thank
you
for
your
work
and
thank
you
for
making
some
sense
of
the
successes
and
failures
and
I
wish
you
much
success
with
your
work
.

<p>
Last
year
in
my
section
at
the
stadium
I
had
a
banner
that
read
<hi rend="italic">
We
Know
'
</hi>
.
That
's
all
it
said
.
Then
earlier
this
year
these
shirts
started
to
come
out
that
said
,
&quot;
Poet
says
<hi rend="italic">
We
Know
</hi>
&quot;
.
It
was
amazing
.
We
did
n't
use
the
banner
this
year
,
though
,
because
we
did
n't
know
.
The
team
was
n't
so
far
ahead
that
<hi rend="italic">
we
knew
.
</hi>
Last
year
we
just
<hi rend="italic">
knew
</hi>
we
were
going
to
the
playoffs
;
we
<hi rend="italic">
knew
</hi>
we
were
going
post-season
.
This
year
we
were
n't
sure
.
We
were
walking
on
eggshells
.
</p>
<p>
There
was
a
woman
,
a
season
ticket
holder
and
a
die
hard
fan
.
She
was
staggered
by
the
loss
last
year
to
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St.%20Louis%20Cardinals">
Cardinals
</ref>
.
Last
year
she
came
up
to
me
during
one
of
the
games
late
in
the
season
;
she
was
so
happy
we
were
going
to
the
post
season
.
By
that
point
we
had
clinched
it
.
She
handed
me
a
shirt
she
bought
at
the
stadium
and
she
gave
me
a
big
hug
.
With
tears
in
her
eyes
she
said
,
&quot;
Thank
you
,
Mets
Poet
,
thank
you
.
&quot;
It
's
cool
...
it
's
like
another
family
.
