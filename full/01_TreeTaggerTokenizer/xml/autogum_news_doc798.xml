Amid
unrest
in
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador">
Ecuadoran
</ref>
capital
city
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quito">
Quito
</ref>
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucio%20Gutierrez">
President
General
Lucio
Gutierrez
</ref>
has
been
removed
from
his
office
by
congress
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfredo%20Palacio">
Vice-President
Alfredo
Palacio
</ref>
was
voted
in
unanimously
by
deputies
to
replace
Mr
Gutierrez
who
is
accused
of
abandoning
his
post
.
</p>
<p>
The
<hi rend="italic">
BBC
</hi>
reports
Gutierrez
left
the
presidential
palace
by
helicopter
after
sparking
protests
when
he
tried
to
overhaul
the
Supreme
Court
.
He
is
now
in
the
Brazilian
embassy
in
Quito
where
he
has
applied
for
asylum
(
www.planetmafia.net
)
,
as
confirmed
by
the
Brazilian
department
of
foreign
affairs
.
</p>
<p>
In
the
worst
political
turmoil
experienced
in
Quito
in
nearly
a
century
,
panic
is
evident
.
Many
families
have
rushed
to
supermarkets
to
stock
up
in
anticipation
of
further
violence
.
The
cause
of
this
panic
is
the
sudden
escalation
of
violence
in
the
protests
and
anti-government
demonstrations
that
have
been
underway
for
a
week
.
</p>
<p>
Protests
began
as
a
reaction
to
the
government
’s
unconstitutional
appointment
of
a
partisan
Supreme
Court
.
Last
week
,
the
inability
of
the
Congress
to
resolve
the
problem
led
broadcaster
<hi rend="italic">
Radio
La
Luna
</hi>
to
call
for
a
spontaneous
demonstration
against
the
government
by
the
citizenry
,
without
the
intervention
of
politicians
.
The
success
of
this
demonstration
caused
it
to
be
repeated
each
night
when
thousands
of
people
went
into
the
streets
singing
and
banging
on
kitchenware
.
</p>
<p>
On
Friday
,
President
Gutierrez
,
a
self
proclaimed
&quot;
dictocrat
&quot;
(
dictator
for
the
opposition
but
democrat
to
his
supporters
)
,
declared
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/state%20of%20emergency">
state
of
emergency
</ref>
in
Quito
,
and
suspended
all
civil
liberties
in
the
capital
.
(
In
the
past
,
this
president
has
not
shown
himself
to
be
a
friend
of
the
constitutional
order
,
and
was
part
of
a
2001
coup
which
overthrew
President
Jamil
Mahuad
)
.
The
president
sent
armed
forces
to
shut
down
<hi rend="italic">
Radio
La
Luna
</hi>
,
but
when
the
troops
were
met
by
thousands
of
unarmed
civilians
,
they
stepped
down
.
The
President
was
forced
to
cancel
the
state
of
emergency
within
24
hours
given
the
tumultuous
uproar
.
</p>
<p>
The
government
instead
called
its
supporters
from
the
provinces
to
come
to
Quito
and
fight
the
protesters
in
the
streets
.
Renan
Borbua
,
one
of
the
President
's
staunchest
allies
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guayaquil">
Guayaquil
</ref>
,
announced
that
buses
packed
with
cudgel
and
machete-wielding
thugs
were
on
their
way
to
Quito
.
Quito
’s
Mayor
Paco
Moncayo
,
and
the
prefect
of
Pichincha
declared
the
highways
closed
and
refused
the
‘
thugs
’
a
way
into
Quito
.
Nonetheless
many
government
sympathizers
were
reported
near
the
capital
,
looting
stores
and
destroying
parked
automobiles
.
</p>
<p>
The
government
also
ordered
the
National
Police
to
suppress
the
protesters
,
a
move
leading
Quito
’s
mayor
to
declare
that
the
National
Police
were
no
longer
viewed
as
legitimate
in
the
city
.
Also
as
a
response
to
the
President
’s
order
,
the
Commander
of
the
National
Police
resigned
in
protest
,
but
was
promptly
replaced
by
the
President
’s
own
cousin
.
So
far
the
Police
have
killed
one
person
,
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile">
Chilean
</ref>
reporter
,
and
injured
hundreds
.
Roads
are
blocked
,
and
numerous
fires
have
been
started
as
a
response
to
the
Police
’s
use
of
riot-gas
.
</p>
<p>
It
is
unclear
where
the
Ecuadorian
military
stands
on
this
issue
.
Both
sides
have
claimed
its
support
.
Ecuador
’s
provinces
have
been
declaring
themselves
for
or
against
the
government
,
and
depending
on
the
ultimate
position
of
the
military
,
civil
war
looms
as
a
dire
possibility
in
everyone
’s
minds
.
