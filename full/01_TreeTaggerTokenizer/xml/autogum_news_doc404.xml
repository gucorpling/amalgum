Sunday
on
board
an

government-chartered
aircraft
.
Hicks
is
now
in
the
custody
of
South
Australian
Correctional
Services
.
</p>
<p>
At
a
recent
U.S.
war
crimes
tribunal
,
Hicks
pleaded
guilty
to
providing
material
support
to
a
listed
terrorist
organisation
and
was
sentenced
to
seven
years
in
prison
.
As
part
of
the
plea
agreement
,
all
but
nine
months
of
the
sentence
was
suspended
,
which
he
will
be
allowed
to
serve
out
in
an
Australian
prison
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
He
[

has
been
transported
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yatala%20Labour%20Prison">

,
where
he
will
serve

in
a
joint
press
release
.
&quot;
Law
enforcement
and
security
agencies
are
working
together
to
determine
appropriate
security
arrangements
.
Consistent
with
longstanding
practice
,
the
Government
does
not
intend
to
detail
these
measures
,
but
the
community
should
be
assured
that
public
safety
is
the
primary
concern
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
His
lawyer
,
David
McLeod
,
told
reporters
:
&quot;
David
is
well
and
he
enjoyed
the
trip
...
He
was
very
glad
to
be
back
on
Australian
soil
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Hicks
was
the
first
of
hundreds
of
prisoners
to
be
tried
by
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal%20Investigation%20Task%20Force">
U.S.
war
crimes
tribunal
</ref>
at
the
Guantanamo
Bay
detention
camp
in
Cuba
.
Under
the
international
transfer
of
prisoners
scheme
,
Hicks
was
allowed
to
serve
out
the
remaining
time
of
his
sentence
in
his
home
country
.
A
contentious
part
of
his
sentence
was
a
ban
,
or
gag-order
,
placed
on
Hicks
to
prevent
him
from
speaking
with
the
media
for
a
period
of
one
year
from
the
time
he
pleaded
guilty
,
which
was
in
March
,
2007
.
It
is
unknown
whether
the
U.S.
gag-order
could
be
legally
enforced
in
Australia
.
</p>
<p>
For
the
five
years
Hicks
spent
in
detention
at
Guantanamo
Bay
,
his
family
and
some
supporters
in
Australia
had
been
lobbying
the
Australian
government
to
secure
the
quick
return
of
Hicks
.
</p>
<p>
A
small
number
of
protesters
waited
outside
the
prison
,
with
the
media
,
for
the
arrival
of
Hicks
.
Some
of
the
protesters
were
labeling
Hicks
a
political
prisoner
and
criticized
the
U.S.
policy
of
holding
people
as
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unlawful%20combatant">
unlawful
combatants
</ref>
for
so
long
without
trial
.
&quot;
David
Hicks
is
a
political
prisoner
and
it
is
just
a
complete
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Human_rights">
human
rights
</ref>
violation
that
our
government
can
completely
neglect
one
of
its
own
citizens
and
leave
him
to
rot
in
Guantanamo
Bay
,
&quot;
said
Steve
Patroni
,
one
of
the
protesters
.
</p>
<p>
At
his
trial
,
Hicks
admitted
he
attended
training
camps
in
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Afghanistan">
Afghanistan
</ref>
,
conducted
surveillance
of
the
U.S.
Embassy
in
Kabul
and
revealed
that
he
had
met
Osama
bin
Laden
,
leader
of
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda">
Al-Qaeda
</ref>
.
He
had
participated
in
fighting
against
the
U.S.
and
its
allies
in
Afghanistan
in
late
2001
,
and
was
caught
while
trying
to
flee
the
area
.
</p>
<p>
Hicks
is
expected
to
be
released
from
Australian
prison
by
December
,
2007
.
