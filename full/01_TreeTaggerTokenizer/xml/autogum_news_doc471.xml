Manchester

progressed
to
the
quarterfinals
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League">
Champions
League
</ref>
earlier
today
after
defeating
Lille
1-0
for
the
second
time
.
After
the
controversial
winning
goal
from
the
first
leg
,
United
had
a
strong
advantage
in
the
series
,
and
Lille
needed
a
win
to
advance
.
The
scorer
of
that
controversial
goal
,
Ryan
Giggs
,
was
left
out
of
the
lineup
,
and
instead
the
more
defensive
minded
John
O'Shea
was
played
.
Lille
started
the
game
with
a
defensive
lineup
as
well
,
hoping
to
stall
the
Red
Devils
,
and
make
a
score
later
in
the
match
.
Manchester
United
came
into
the
game
short
of
several
key
players
due
to
injury
,
including
Louis
Saha
(
hamstring
)
,
Ole
Gunnar
Solsjkaer
(
surgery
recovery
)
,
and
Darren
Fletcher
(
ankle
)
.
Striker
Alan
Smith
was
on
the
bench
for
United
hoping
to
get
back
to
first
team
action
after
a
broken
leg
kept
him
out
of
the
main
squad
for
nearly
a
year
.
</p>
<p>
United
grabbed
the
first
of
the
chances
15
minutes
into
the
game
after
Scholes
popped
in
a
cross
to
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Wayne_Rooney">
Rooney
</ref>
,
but
the
young
striker
could
n't
get
his
volley
away
in
time
,
and
Mathieu
Chalme
moved
well
to
block
.
The
ensuing
corner
saw
another
good
chance
present
itself
for
United
,
but
John
O'Shea
's
powerful
headed
from
Carrick
's
kick
hit
only
the
crossbar
.
Lille
then
had
a
chance
of
their
own
as
Makoun
strafed
in
behind
the
defence
to
connect
with
a
freekick
by
Obraniak
.
Makoun
's
header
was
poor
,
and
keeper
Edwin
Van
Der
Sar
had
and
easy
time
collecting
the
ball
.
When
Macnhester
United
earned
themselves
a
freekick
outside
the
Lille
area
,
two
Lille
players
placed
themselves
directly
in
front
of
Paul
Scholes
,
not
allowing
him
to
take
an
early
kick
.
Lille
was
appearing
to
be
playing
stronger
,
and
made
quick
moves
on
the
counter
attack
to
worry
United
.
One
fine
pass
by
Chalme
into
the
box
was
aimed
for
a
wide
open
Odemwingie
,
but
he
was
not
able
to
cleanly
hit
the
ball
,
and
the
danger
passed
.
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Cristiano_Ronaldo">
Cristiano
Ronaldo
</ref>
made
his
presence
felt
in
the
Lille
area
and
was
brought
down
by
Chalme
in
the
box
.
Instead
of
a
penalty
,
Ronaldo
was
awarded
a
yellow
card
for
what
referee
Luis
Cantalejo
considered
a
dive
.
</p>
<p>
The
second
half
saw
Lille
continue
to
dominate
the
football
match
,
and
the
first
threat
came
through
a
long
range
shot
by
Keita
,
but
Van
Der
Sar
saved
well
.
Odemwingie
was
again
on
the
attack
,
but
was
unfortunate
to
see
his
header
smash
off
the
post
.
United
finally
had
a
chance
of
their
own
in
the
second
half
when
defender
Nemanja
Vidic
connected
with
a
free
kick
by
Rooney
,
but
the
Serbian
's
header
flew
just
over
the
goal
.
A
sense
of
anxiety
was
starting
to
fill
Old
Trafford
until
Ronaldo
and
Larsson
combined
to
put
the
series
away
after
72
minutes
.
Ronaldo
used
some
of
his
trademark
moves
to
outwit
3
Lille
defenders
and
knocked
a
well
aimed
ball
into
Larsson
,
who
forced
a
powerful
header
into
the
back
of
the
net
.
The
goal
will
be
the
last
Larsson
will
score
for
United
at
Old
Trafford
,
as
his
loan
contract
expires
on
the
12th
of
March
.
Larsson
was
applauded
as
he
left
the
pitch
and
was
replaced
by
Alan
Smith
,
who
was
eager
to
impress
after
his
extended
absence
from
the
team
.
Lille
made
two
changes
of
their
own
,
throwing
Fauvergue
and
Mirallis
into
the
fray
,
but
they
never
looked
likely
to
get
the
two
goals
they
needed
to
advance
.
United
went
on
to
win
,
but
now
have
even
more
injury
worries
as
Mikael
Silvestre
had
to
be
stretchered
off
the
field
after
sustaining
a
head
injury
.
