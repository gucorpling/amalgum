Paraguayan

first
to
report
that
a
'

was
taking
place
in

former

it

given
one

salty
water

&quot;
and
&quot;
[

about

According

the

&quot;
invited
the

to
the

municipal
gymnasium
for
a
meeting
,
in
order
to
coordinate
the
actions

&quot;
Nothing
surprises
me
of
Mr.
Errázuriz
,
I
think
the
whole
country
is
tired
of
him
too
.
This
man
believes
he
's
the
owner
of
Chile
,
[
he
's
just
the
]
owner
of
a
farm
,
I
think
it
's
not
worth
it
to
respond
him
.
But
I
assure
you
we
are
going
to
fiscalize
everything
that
needs
to
be
fiscalized

Minister

Evelyn

told
<hi rend="italic">
Radio

</hi>
on
Tuesday
.
According
to
Matthei
,
&quot;
six
Paraguayans
and
one
Brazilian
&quot;
were
found
at
the
Petrel
hacienda
,
&quot;
working
without
a
contract
and
without
proof
of
payment
.
&quot;
&quot;
It
's
totally
and
absolutely
unacceptable
to
bring
undocumented
workers
[
here
]
,
to
have
them
working
without
a
contract
and
to
not
know
if
they
have
been
paid
or
not
.
We
are
n't
going
to
accept
that

In
response
to
actions
taken
by
the
Chilean
government
,
Francisco
Javier
Errázuriz
wrote
an
open
letter
on
Tuesday
which
he
sent
to
several
media
outlets
in
Chile
,
titled
&quot;
A
la
ministra
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evelyn%20Matthei">
Evelyn

y
a

&quot;
(
&quot;
To
Minister
Evelyn
Matthei
and
the
Chileans
&quot;
)
.
&quot;
Matthei
argues
that
the
Ministry
of
Interior
has
denied
that
I
knew
the
income
situation
of
the
Paraguayans
,
in
circumstances
that
I
have
stamped
letters
from
that
ministry
[
which
would
demonstrate
]
they
always
helped
to
facilitate
the
arrival
of
those
citizens
from
a
sister
nation
,
which
then
would
be
hired
and
may
assist
in
the
development
of
Chile
,
[
I
was
]
even
recommended
that
the
Ministry
of
Interior
would
give
them
the
MERCOSUR
visa
,
because
it
's
quicker
,
and
[
they
]
instructed
that
way
the
Governor
of
Pichilemu
[
<hi rend="italic">
sic
</hi>
]
,
&quot;
Errázuriz
said
in
the
letter
.
Errázuriz
also
accused
Matthei
of
being
racist
towards
immigrants
:
&quot;
The
Labor
Minister
does
not
want
immigrants
to
work
in
Chile
to
strengthen
our
motherland
.
[
She
]
demonstrates
with
that
that
her
roots
are
n't
found
here
—
but
in
the
origin
country
of
her
family
—
,
which
is
n't
Chile
,
and
that
she
as
descendant
of
German
immigrants
,
the
'

The

Department
fined
more
than
14,000,000

to

,
on
Thursday
.
María
Cecilia
Sánchez
,
Director
of
Labor
,
said
&quot;
the
situation
is
being
investigated
by
the
Prosecution
Office
[
Fiscalía
]
,
&quot;
and
that
&quot;
26
persons
who
were
working
at
Errázuriz
's
company
were
brought
back
to
their
origin
countries
[
Brazil
and
Paraguay
]
,
and
other
46
are
staying
at
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cabaña">

</ref>
in
Pichilemu
.
&quot;
Sánchez
added
that
&quot;
[
an
investigation
]
needs
to
be
consolidated
on
what
happens
in
another
Francisco
Javier
Errázuriz
's
company
,

Costa
S.A.
&quot;

<p>
On
Friday
,
Minister
Matthei
reunited
with
Paraguayan
Ambassador
Matsuo
,
&quot;
who
thanked
the
government
efforts
to
clarify
the
laboral
abuses
,
&quot;
<hi rend="italic">
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El%20Mercurio">
El

</ref>
</hi>
reported
.
&quot;
This
is
a
laboral
case
that
ashames
us
as
a
country
.
It
really
ashames
that
something
like
this
occurs
in
Chile
,
&quot;
Matthei
said
.
&quot;
This
is
one
of
the
worst
things
I
have
seen
and
what
actually
happens
is
that
it
ashames
,
&quot;
she
added
.
Matthei
also
said
Francisco
Javier
Errázuriz
would
not
be
paying
anything
to
the
Paraguayans
because
&quot;
they
have
to
pay
him
firstly
,
because
he
brought
them
[
to
Chile
]
,
and
according
to
himself
he
trained
them
.
