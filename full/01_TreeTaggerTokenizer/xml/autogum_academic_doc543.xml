Introduction
</head>
<p>
Phase
transitions
and
critical
phenomena
are
of
central
importance
to
statistical
physics
and
there
is
growing
evidence
supporting
its
crucial
role
in
living
systems
.
Here
we
investigate
how
near
critical
network
dynamics
may
recruit
neurons
and
facilitate
formation
of
a
new
distributed
memory
in
a
situation
where
the
incoming
input
must
compete
with
the
already
stored
(
native
)
memories
for
neuronal
resources
.
</p>
<p>
It
is
widely
hypothesized
that
new
information
is
encoded
in
brain
circuits
through
activity
dependent
,
long-term
synaptic
structural
changes
that
are
a
putative
substrate
for
memory
formation
.
While
features
of
memory
traces
can
be
localized
to
specific
cell
populations
(
e.
g.
,
location
information
encoded
in
place
cell
activity
)
,
in
general
,
tracing
so-called
“
engrams
”
to
neural
circuits
has
been
an
elusive
task
.
Attempts
at
disrupting
well-established
memories
through
brain
lesions
or
,
more
recently
,
through
optogenetic
silencing
have
shown
that
they
are
robust
to
alterations
in
communication
between
individual
neurons
or
brain
areas
.
A
parsimonious
and
longstanding
explanation
of
these
phenomena
is
that
a
process
termed
“
systems
consolidation
”
leads
to
diffuse
,
widespread
memory
encoding
and
storage
.
However
,
despite
more
than
a
century
of
study
,
it
is
not
well
understood
how
engrams
are
initially
formed
and
subsequently
stored
across
vast
distances
(
in
terms
of
numbers
of
synaptic
connections
between
neurons
)
in
the
brain
.
</p>
<p>
A
major
problem
to
understanding
the
mechanisms
for
systems
consolidation
is
that
very
little
is
known
about
how
the
formation
of
new
memories
(
i.
e.
,
learning
)
impacts
neural
network
dynamics
.
The
general
,
long-accepted
assumption
is
that
either
strengthening
of
existing
synaptic
connections
,
or
the
de
novo
creation
of
additional
synapses
(
i.
e.
,
formation
of
a
discrete
structural
heterogeneity
)
leads
to
the
formation
of
a
dynamical
attractor
.
If
this
is
the
case
,
then
the
dynamical
state
of
the
network
must
support
long-range
correlations
across
the
network
,
as
the
number
of
neurons
actively
involved
in
encoding
a
specific
memory
trace
is
thought
to
constitute
only
a
small
fraction
of
the
total
neuronal
population
.
Moreover
,
individual
synapses
in
regions
such
as
the
hippocampus
have
a
surprisingly
brief
lifetime
(
approximately
1
–
2
weeks
on
average
)
,
necessitating
rapid
dissemination
and
consolidation
of
information
.
These
requirements
raise
two
questions
:
(
1
)
how
do
permanent
and
widely-distributed
neural
engrams
form
from
initial
,
transient
changes
to
a
discrete
subset
of
the
network
’s
synapses
during
learning
,
and
(
2
)
what
mediates
transformation
of
local
representations
of
disparate
features
to
global
memory
representation
?
New
experimental
and
computational
work
shows
that
theta
band
oscillatory
patterning
and/or
dynamics
associated
with
sharp
wave
ripples
can
mechanistically
coordinate
neuronal
activity
recruiting
them
into
the
representation
.
</p>
<p>
In
this
work
,
we
show
computationally
that
in
addition
to
large
scale
temporal
pattering
of
neuronal
activity
,
near-critical
dynamics
in
the
brain
could
be
an
important
factor
in
facilitating
memory
consolidation
.
Specifically
,
we
show
that
storage
of
new
information
that
is
weakly
and/or
sparsely
impinged
on
the
network
is
mediated
through
plastic
,
state-dependent
changes
in
network
connectivity
and
can
be
successfully
consolidated
(
which
is
associated
with
attractor
formation
)
near
criticality
—
a
point
associated
with
second
order
phase
transitions
.
This
storage
is
followed
by
a
subsequent
shift
from
critical
to
sub-critical
dynamics
.
</p>
<p>
The
idea
that
the
brain
operates
at
or
near
dynamical
critically
is
not
new
(
see
References
for
comprehensive
reviews
)
and
it
was
experimentally
observed
in
in
vivo
and
in
vitro
preparations
.
A
large
body
of
work
also
investigated
the
potential
functional
benefit
of
operating
in
a
near-critical
regime
.
Here
,
we
specifically
identify
very
basic
,
underlying
importance
for
the
brain
to
reside
near
criticality
and
demonstrate
that
near-critical
dynamics
may
be
essential
for
a
system-wide
consolidation
of
new
memories
in
a
situation
when
the
sensory
input
is
weak
and/or
sparse
in
comparison
with
signals
generated
by
memories
native
to
the
network
(
i.
e.
,
those
previously
stored
)
.
</p>
<p>
To
substantiate
these
hypotheses
,
we
analyze
in
vivo
recordings
associated
with
contextual
fear
memory
(
CFM
)
consolidation
.
Contextual
fear
conditioning
(
CFC
)
is
an
optimal
experimental
paradigm
in
this
regard
as
it
allows
for
rapid
formation
and
consolidation
of
memory
(
i.
e.
,
after
single-trial
learning
)
.
In
this
particular
case
,
the
CFM
consolidation
is
associated
with
normal
sleep
,
which
has
been
shown
to
play
a
vital
role
in
various
types
of
memory
consolidation
.
Here
,
we
first
characterize
hippocampal
dynamics
in
mice
subjected
to
CFC
and
show
that
:
(
1
)
the
hippocampus
operates
in
a
near
critical
regime
pre-
and
post-CFC
training
,
and
(
2
)
successful
,
behaviorally-verified
consolidation
of
fear
memory
leads
to
an
underlying
shift
in
hippocampal
dynamics
towards
a
subcritical
state
,
similar
to
what
we
predict
in
our
model
simulations
.
</p>
<p>
Together
,
these
results
indicate
that
novel
learning
may
occur
preferentially
near
a
critical
regime
and
leads
to
universal
widespread
stabilization
of
network
activity
patterns
,
which
in
turn
drives
the
formation
of
widely-distributed
engrams
(
i.
e.
,
systems
memory
consolidation
)
.
