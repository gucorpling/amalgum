Which
of
your
competitors
do
you
expect
to
pose
the
biggest
challenge
to
your
candidacy
?
Why
?
What
makes
you
the
most
desirable
of
all
candidates
running
in
the
riding
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
Most
of
the
other
candidates
are
promoting
more
government
,
more
inefficiencies
and
consequently
higher
taxes
.
I
consider
none
of
them
competitors
as
their
goal
is
diametrically
opposed
to
my
own
.
Only
the
candidate
for
the
Freedom
Party
has
similar
goals
to
my
own
and
I
consider
him
a
colleague
working
toward
the
same
end
as
myself
,
namely
much
less
government
and
much
lower
taxes
.

I

Too
Much
Government
:
The
main
issue
in
Kitchener-Conestoga
is
over
regulation
by
government
.
This
is
the
cause
of
the
problems
in
education
and
health
care
;
its
even
the
major
cause
of
poverty
and
youth
crime
.
All
regulations
are
enforced
by
coercion
and
the
rich
and
powerful
always
arrange
to
direct
the
coercion
at
the
poor
or
the
powerless
.
To
solve
problems
,
we
need
to
use
cooperation
not
compulsion
.
We
need
to
adopt
the
approaches
used
by
other
jurisdictions
that
have
dealt
with
problems
successfully
without
resorting
to
government
regulations
.

Farmers
and
Manufacturers
:
Our
people
are
knowledgeable
and
hard-working
.
If
government
gets
out
of
their
way
,
they
'll
do
just
fine
.

The
Environment
:
In
Earth
in
the
Balance
,
Al
Gore
admitted
:
&quot;
The
most
serious
examples
of
environmental
degradation
in
the
world
today
are
tragedies
that
were
created
or
actively
encouraged
by
governments
&quot;
.
Asking
the
government
to
protect
the
environment
is
like
putting
a
fox
in
charge
of
the
security
of
a
hen
house
.

<p>
Ontario
environmental
specialist
Elizabeth
Brubaker
has
shown
that
private
property
rights
protected
our
environment
very
effectively
before
the
Ontario
government
passed
laws
to
allow
pollution
and
promote
the
unsustainable
use
of
resources
.
We
need
to
repeal
the
laws
that
allow
pollution
and
we
need
to
allow
individuals
to
again
protect
our
environment
from
businesses
and
municipalities
that
would
destroy
it
.
</p>
<p>
As
far
as
global
warming
goes
,
new
evidence
indicates
there
is
no
threat
.
It
's
just
another
ploy
by
environmentalists
and
politicians
to
gain
more
power
.
</p>
<p>
The
bottom
line
is
that
politicians
continually
distort
the
facts
in
their
efforts
to
gain
support
and
get
elected
.
Much
of
what
we
've
been
told
in
the
past
has
been
and
still
is
false
.
Minimum
wages
do
not
and
never
have
helped
the
poor
;
seat
belts
do
not
and
never
have
saved
lives
.
Research
going
back
decades
have
these
fallacies
over
and
over
,
but
our
government
still
tells
us
they
are
true
.
