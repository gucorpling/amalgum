Causes

Construction
Project
Delays
</head>
<p>
Previous
studies
have
largely
identified
causes
of
construction
project
delays
based
on
literature
reviews
and
expert
interviews
,
and
the
delay
factors
were
classified
into
various
groups
depending
upon
each
paper
’s
authors
,
as
follows
.
Chan
and
Kumaraswamy
classified
causes
of
delay
into
eight
groups
;
project-
,
client-
,
design
team-
,
and
contractor-related
,
material
,
labor
,
equipment
,
and
external
factors
.
Odeh
and
Battaineh
studied
causes
of
schedule
delays
in
construction
projects
with
traditional
types
of
contracts
and
identified
eight
major
groups
of
causes
:
client-
,
contractor-
,
consultant-
,
material-
,
labor
and
equipment-
,
contract-
,
and
external-related
factors
.
Aziz
and
Abdel-Hakam
used
various
categories
to
classify
delay
factors
;
project-
,
owner-
,
and
contractor-related
,
financing
,
contract
,
design
,
site
,
labor
,
material
,
equipment
,
rules
and
regulations
,
scheduling
and
controlling
,
external
,
and
contractual
relationships
.
Alsuliman
investigated
causes
of
delay
according
to
stages
in
a
public
construction
project
,
including
before
,
during
,
and
after
the
award
,
as
well
as
general
factors
.
Risk
factors
,
which
cause
schedule
delays
in
a
construction
project
,
can
be
categorized
into
various
standards
depending
on
the
purpose
of
establishing
the
categorization
.
This
study
reviews
the
literature
related
to
causes
of
delay
in
power
construction
projects
from
five
perspectives
related
to
the
:
owner
,
contractor
,
design
,
infrastructure
and
social
,
and
external
factors
.

Owner-Related
Causes
of
Delay
</head>
<p>
The
owner
’s
insufficient
project
management
capability
affects
delays
significantly
.
Majid
and
McCaffer
suggested
that
inadequate
fund
allocation
,
insufficient
communication
among
participants
,
and
damaged
materials
and
equipment
are
owner-related
causes
of
delay
,
while
Ogunlana
et
al.
suggested
change
orders
and
slow
decision
making
.
Long
et
al.
conducted
a
case
study
in
Vietnam
to
identify
common
and
general
problems
in
large
construction
projects
in
developing
countries
.
They
suggested
ten
owner-related
problems
that
cause
delays
,
including
lack
of
strategic
management
,
construction
requirements
,
improper
project
feasibility
study
,
lack
of
a
clear
bidding
process
,
excessive
change
orders
,
unclear
responsibility
,
lack
of
capable
representatives
,
owner
’s
financial
difficulties
,
poor
contract
management
,
and
slow
decision
making
.
In
addition
,
they
specified
delays
attributable
to
participants
’
communication
and
coordination
into
seven
factors
.
According
to
Frimpong
et
al.
’
s
study
,
participants
,
material
procurement
,
and
frequent
breakdowns
in
the
construction
plant
and
equipment
contributed
to
projects
’
schedule
delays
.
Koushki
et
al.
studied
the
causes
of
time
delays
associated
with
the
construction
of
private
residential
projects
,
particularly
from
the
owner
’s
and
developer
’s
perspectives
.
Their
analysis
of
450
questionnaires
suggested
three
main
causes
of
delays
from
the
owner
’s
perspective
:
change
orders
,
financial
constraints
,
and
owner
’s
lack
of
experience
.
Aziz
and
Abdel-Hakam
also
identified
a
total
of
twenty
highly
frequent
causes
of
delay
in
their
literature
review
.
Among
them
,
owner-related
causes
were
the
owner
’s
slow
decisions
,
shop
drawings
and
samples
’
slow
preparation
and
approval
,
the
owner
’s
change
orders
during
construction
,
owner
’s
financial
problems
for
the
project
,
and
owner
’s
delay
in
contractors
’
progress
payment
.
As
owner-related
causes
of
delay
,
Khatib
et
al.
suggested
their
financial
problems
and
difficulties
,
change
orders
,
delays
and
shortages
of
materials
,
poor
site
management
and
supervision
,
poor
communication
and
coordination
among
construction
parties
,
lowest
bid
awards
,
slow
decisions
,
the
contract
type
,
delays
in
performing
inspections
and
tests
,
and
lack
of
clarity
of
the
project
’s
scope
.
Alsuliman
used
a
questionnaire
to
investigate
the
causes
of
delay
according
to
stages
of
a
public
construction
project
.
The
results
showed
that
the
most
significant
group
of
causes
of
the
delay
was
the
factors
associated
with
awarding
tenders
.
In
particular
,
the
bid
and
award
process
,
financial
problems
,
approval
delay
,
and
owner
’s
poor
management
capability
were
ranked
among
the
top
20
causes
of
delays
.
Marques
and
Berg
,
showed
that
the
lowest
tender
award
system
frequently
fosters
contractors
to
assume
optimistic
design
and
price
estimation
for
winning
awards
.
This
opportunism
induces
the
changes
in
scope
for
increasing
project
contract
price
.
Marques
and
Berg
,
also
explained
that
the
budget
reduction
by
government
frequently
invokes
the
project
delay
.

<p>
Based
on
the
factors
reviewed
above
,
this
study
selected
seven
owner-related
causes
of
project
delays
:
change
in
scope
;
owner
’s
poor
supervision
;
poor
communication
and
coordination
;
approval
delay
;
delay
in
procuring
items
,
lowest
bid
tender
award
;
owner
’s
inadequate
fund
or
budget
allocation
,
and
materials/equipment
damaged
during
construction
.
