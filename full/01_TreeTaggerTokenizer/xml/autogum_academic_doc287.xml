Introduction

<p>
Significant
technological
progress
in
image
processing
algorithms
and
ability
to
improve
perception
of
the
world
surrounding
us
using
modern
deep
learning
methods
has
led
to
invention
and
enablement
of
various
applications
that
were
previously
much
harder
to
implement
,
e.
g.
,
face
recognition
,
objects
detection
and
segmentation
or
image
resolution
enhancement
.
Another
factor
that
steers
the
direction
of
advances
in
new
applications
is
the
increased
capabilities
of
many
electronic
digital
devices
.
Medical
diagnostics
and
reasoning
systems
also
benefited
from
this
progress
,
allowing
for
real-time
vital
signs
analysis
and
tracking
using
standard
cameras
or
wearable
devices
.
</p>
<p>
The
remote
measurement
of
RR
has
many
potential
applications
in
medical
diagnostics
and
screenings
like
monitoring
of
newborns
or
small
children
in
incubators
or
hospital
beds
,
monitoring
of
the
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
(
SARS
)
,
support
in
emotion
analysis
,
etc.
The
use
of
thermal
cameras
was
proposed
to
analyze
facial
images
and
estimate
RR
based
on
a
nasal
heat
flow
and
described
in
and
other
papers
.
The
typical
estimation
of
RR
requires
a
multi
step
procedure
.
First
,
a
Region
Of
Interest
(
ROI
)
is
detected
for
each
thermal
frame
representing
the
source
of
thermal
changes
(
due
to
respiration
)
in
the
area
of
nostrils
or
a
mouth
.
The
ROI
can
be
specified
manually
or
can
be
automatically
detected
(
in
a
frame
or
for
each
frame
)
and
tracked
(
between
frames
)
.
In
,
the
authors
described
a
particle
filter
tracker
driven
by
a
probabilistic
template
function
that
was
capable
of
adapting
to
abrupt
positional
and
physiological
changes
.
Other
authors
also
proposed
ROI
tracking
methods
(
e.
g.
,
)
.
In
the
next
step
,
a
single
value
is
calculated
to
represent
each
ROI
.
A
collection
of
such
values
forms
a
signal
representing
local
temperature
changes
in
time
.
Finally
,
a
signal
is
filtered
(
e.
g.
removing
high
frequency
components
)
and
a
frequency
for
dominated
changes
is
calculated
.
It
is
assumed
,
that
this
frequency
represents
the
respiratory
rate
.
</p>
<p>
In
recent
years
,
new
portable
and
cost-effective
thermal
cameras
have
been
available
.
For
example
,
FLIR®
Lepton
family
cameras
are
very
small
(
e.
g.
,
10.5
×
11.7
×
6.4
mm
,
with
an
internal
shutter
)
and
cost
less
that
200USD
.
These
features
allow
to
think
about
wide
application
of
thermal
monitoring
,
e.
g.
,
to
support
remote
diagnosis
of
elderly
people
at
home
(
e.
g.
,
during
a
video
talk
or
as
a
self-diagnostics
)
.
However
,
a
spatial
resolution
of
these
small
thermal
cameras
is
as
low
as
80
×
60
or
160
×
120
.
Small
resolution
of
images
could
be
a
problem
for
detection
of
facial
features
or
detection
of
a
ROI
representing
respiration-related
temperature
changes
.
Different
methods
have
been
proposed
in
(
a
visible
light
spectrum
)
computer
vision
to
improve
low
resolution
images
or
to
detect
(
and
amplify
)
small
,
local
changes
in
videos
.
</p>
<p>
Subtle
intensity
variations
introduced
in
thermal
videos
of
a
face
due
to
respiratory
activities
can
be
enhanced
using
Eulerian
Video
Magnification
(
EVM
)
or
related
algorithms
.
This
technique
amplifies
intensity
differences
within
a
particular
frequency
spectrum
.
This
works
well
if
the
estimate
respiratory
rate
(
frequency
)
is
known
.
Otherwise
,
noise
and
motion
artefacts
are
highly
amplified
.
Therefore
,
some
researchers
propose
to
magnify
only
selected
segments
within
a
video
.
The
EVM
algorithm
has
been
already
successfully
used
for
enhancing
vital
sign
signals
.
</p>
<p>
Recently
,
many
different
deep-learning
algorithms
for
super
resolution
have
been
proposed
.
It
has
been
proved
that
such
algorithms
can
efficiently
improve
the
presentation
of
details
in
the
processed
low-resolution
(
LR
)
visible
light
images
.
One
of
the
first
method
in
this
area
was
SRCNN
,
which
implemented
a
single
Convolutional
Neural
Network
(
CNN
)
achieving
the
state-of-the-art
restoration
quality
.
Later
,
different
Deep
Neural
Networks
(
DNNs
)
based
solutions
have
been
introduced
to
further
improve
the
restoration
quality
(
or
perception
)
.
In
Kim
et
al.
introduced
a
novel
Deeply
Recursive
Convolutional
Network
(
DRCN
)
model
.
It
utilizes
a
skip
connection
correlating
a
LR
input
with
a
high
resolution
(
HR
)
reference
data
and
uses
recursive
supervision
to
minimize
the
exploding/vanishing
gradients
problem
.
Other
improvements
to
SR
include
the
application
of
residual
mappings
and
gradient
clipping
(
Deeply
Recursive
Residual
Network
(
DRRN
)
)
,
the
use
of
attention
networks
,
the
application
of
multi-scale
residual
hierarchical
networks
,
etc.
The
very
good
results
have
also
been
obtained
using
SR
algorithms
based
on
generative
networks
.
