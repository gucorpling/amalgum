Description

<p>
The
badly
decomposed
remains
were
found
by
a
&quot;
stone
mason
&quot;
alongside
a
river
,
near
a
highway
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perry_County,_Pennsylvania">

The
remains
were
mostly
skeletonized
and
the
estimated
time
of
death
was
months

,
perhaps
as
early
as
Autumn
of
1978
.

The
decedent
is
believed
to

a

Just

Investigation

<p>
The
victim
had
been
buried
shortly
after
her
discovery
,
but
was
exhumed
in
2008
,
following
the
reopening
of
her
case
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-ties-1">

Her
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_profiling">
DNA
</ref>
and
dental
records
were
recorded
and
are
on
file
.
Because
of
the
condition
of
her
remains
,
no
fingerprints
and
no
cause
of
death
could
be
confirmed
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-namus-4">

An
initial
examination
of
her
teeth
indicated
that
she
had
had
three
teeth
extracted
,
but
this
was
later
disproved
.
