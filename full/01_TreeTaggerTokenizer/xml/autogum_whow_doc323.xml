Look
the
part
.
If
you
have
long
hair
consider
having
your
hair
up
,
a
less
popular
,
but
practical
and
sleeker
option
.
Although
down-dos
are
more
common
,
up-dos
are
simple
,
neat
,
and
stylish
.
Up-dos
will
not
only
make
your
hair
stand
out
amid
combed
out
hairdos
,
but
keep
it
clear
of
your
face
as
you
eat
.
Your
nails
should
be
manicured
:
clean
,
cut
and
if
painted
,
coloured
to
match
your
outfit
.
If
you
put
makeup
on
,
highlight
either
your
eyes
or
your
lips
,
or
go
for
a
more
natural
look
.
Less
is
more
.

Choose
a
suitable
outfit
.
Dress
codes
can
be
difficult
to
navigate
,
so
be
sure
you
know
what
it
is
.
For
a
restaurant
,
check
their
website
.
For
a
dinner
party
,
look
at
the
invitation
.
If
you
are
still
in
the
dark
,
ask
your
host
or
a
friend
who
you
know
is
going
.
The
best
bet
if
you
are
unsure
is
a
jacket
and
tie
or
a
chiffon
dress
to
the
knee
.
If
you
are
carrying
a
handbag
match
your
bag
with
your
shoes
.

Sit
properly
.
Cross
your
legs
at
the
heels
with
your
knees
together
and
ankles
tucked
back
,
this
is
especially
important
when
wearing
skirts
and
dresses
.

Tips

<list type="unordered">
<item>
If
you
have
been
invited
to
a
restaurant
by
someone
else
,
do
not
complain
about
the
food
or
the
service
.
</item>
<item>
Anything
that
is
in
your
hands
when
you
sit
at
the
table
,
such
as
your
gloves
or
little
bag
,
should
be
put
in
your
lap
.
To
avoid
the
things
in
your
lap
from
slipping
off
,
put
the
napkin
across
your
knees
,
folded
diagonally
from
corner
to
corner
,
and
tuck
the
two
side
corners
under
,
pinning
your
things
into
place
.
</item>
<item>
When
a
dinner
has
been
prepared
by
a
chef
who
prides
himself
on
being
a
decorative
artist
,
you
may
have
quite
a
problem
to
know
which
part
of
an
intricate
structure
is
to
be
eaten
and
which
part
is
scenic
effect
.
The
main
portion
is
generally
clear
enough
.
If
there
are
six
or
more
,
the
chances
are
that
they
are
edible
and
that
one
or
two
of
a
kind
are
embellishments
only
.
Rings
around
food
are
nearly
always
to
be
eaten
,
whereas
platforms
under
food
seldom
are
.
Anything
that
looks
like
pastry
is
meant
to
be
eaten
.
Again
,
take
direction
from
the
host
.
</item>
<item>
Manners
are
key
!
Keep
the
conversation
flowing
,
but
never
interrupt
anyone
.
</item>
<item>
It
is
impolite
for
more
than
one
person
to
leave
the
table
at
a
time
,
regardless
of
the
number
of
people
at
the
table
.
</item>
<item>
If
at
a
fancy
or
formal
restaurant
,
some
will
expect
the
inviter
to
pay
the
bill
,
not
the
invitee
.
However
,
in
this
day
and
age
,
it
's
not
uncommon
to
split
a
bill
.
</item>
<item>
Always
keep
the
napkin
or
cloth
on
your
lap
when
eating
.
When
leaving
,
kindly
excuse
yourself
from
the
table
and
place
your
napkin
on
the
table
.
</item>
<item>
Do
not
use
your
cell
phone
at
the
table
while
you
're
eating
.
Turn
your
cell
phone
onto
silent
mode
during
the
meal
.
If
you
must
leave
it
on
,
excuse
yourself
if
it
rings
to
go
outside
or
to
a
private
area
.
</item>
<item>
Follow
the
direction
of
the
host/hostess
.
</item>
<item>
Be
courteous
.
Say
&quot;
please
&quot;
and
&quot;
thank
you
&quot;
.
You
may
call
elders
or
people
with
whom
you
are
unfamiliar
&quot;
sir
&quot;
or
&quot;
ma'am
&quot;
,
although
it
is
an
uncommon
courtesy
that
is
definitely
unnecessary
when
speaking
to
friends
or
peers
.
</item>
<item>
It
is
better
to
keep
your
legs
closed
rather
than
crossing
them
in
public
,
especially
when
sitting
at
the
table
.
This
can
cause
discomfort
especially
if
the
table
is
not
high
enough
.
</item>
<item>
Never
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Apply_Makeup">
apply
makeup
</ref>
at
the
table
.
Once
again
,
excuse
yourself
to
the
powder
room
.
</item>
<item>
When
walking
in
high
heels
the
heel
should
hit
the
ground
first
,
then
the
toe
.
It
has
been
proven
not
to
be
necessary
to
pace
yourself
in
formal
footwear
,
but
walking
turtle
slow
will
make
you
appear
as
if
you
're
trying
too
hard
to
be
impressive
.
</item>
<item>
Always
show
up
on
time
.
For
meals
,
there
is
no
such
thing
as
fashionably
late
.
If
you
are
n't
there
by
five
minutes
past
the
time
on
the
invitation
,
the
food
will
begin
to
get
cold
and
fellow
guests
hungry
.
In
Europe
you
are
given
exactly
15
minutes
leeway
,
known
as
the
'
academic
quarter
'
.
</item>
<item>
Remember
your
table
manners
,
do
n't
talk
when
you
still
have
food
in
your
mouth
.
</item>
<item>
Never
start
eating
until
the
hosts
are
seated
and
they
begin
to
eat
.
</item>
<item>
Do
n't
talk
over
somebody
else
;
it
is
rude
.
If
you
must
,
push
your
chair
back
slightly
and
speak
behind
them
.

<item>
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Be_Gracious">
Be
gracious
</ref>
and
congenial
-
after
all
,
your
hosts
have
gone
to
great
lengths
for
you
.
</item>
<item>
Do
n't
sit
silently
at
the
table
,
try
participate
in
conversation
even
if
you
are
nervous
,
some
remembered
lines
can
be
helpful
,
for
example
'
have
you
come
far
?
'
might
get
a
conversation
going
,
without
being
as
prying
as
the
question
'
where
do
you
live
'
.
</item>
<item>
When
getting
out
of
a
vehicle
try
your
best
to
exit
without
showing
your
undergarments
.
If
there
is
a
someone
opening
the
door
for
you
,
remember
to
thank
them
.
</item>
<item>
It
is
impolite
to
refuse
dishes
.
Take
at
least
a
little
on
your
plate
and
make
a
pretense
of
eating
some
of
it
,
unless
you
are
allergic
to
it
or
reasonably
<hi rend="italic">
cannot

Though
your
friends
are
your
friends
and
you
should
always
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Be_Yourself">
be

,
treat
everyone
with
the
same
respect
and
get
out
of
those
slang

habits

People
will
also
lose
respect
for
you
if
you
use
gross
humor
in
any
setting
