(

He
was
in

of
the
club
from
its
foundation
in
1903
until
his
retirement
in
1924

He

Early
life
</head>
<p>
Little
is
recorded
about
Philip
's
early
life
,
but
it
is
known
that
he
was
a
native
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberdonian">

,
that
he
had
a
wide
range
of
sporting
interests
,
and
that
he
had
proposed
to
underwrite
the
very
first
overseas
tour
by
a
Scottish
international
team
.
He
was
also
a
referee
,
although
by
profession
he
was
a
wood-turner
.

<p>
Philip
was
appointed
part-time
manager
for
the
first
competitive
game
of
the
new
club
,
a
1-1
draw
with
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenhousemuir_F.C.">
Stenhousemuir
</ref>
on
15
August
1903
.
In
that
first
season
,
Aberdeen
won
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberdeenshire_Cup">
Aberdeenshire
Cup
</ref>
,
and
subsequently
made
a
bid
to
be
elected
to
the
Scottish
League
First
Division
.
Philip
was
despatched
to
Glasgow
to
make
the
club
's
case
,
and
returned
with
the
promise
of
enough
support
.
However
,
the
final
decision
of
the
existing
league
members
was
to
elect
Aberdeen
to
the
Second
Division
.
</p>
<p>
During
that
second
season
,
the
Qualifying
Cup
was
won
at
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dens_Park">

in

</ref>
,
former

Cup
</ref>
holders
.
Progress
in
the
league
was
not
so
straightforward
,
and
the
club
ended
the
season
in
seventh
place
of
twelve
.
However
,
a
proposal
by
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_F.C.">
Celtic
</ref>
to
expand
Division
1
to
16
clubs
meant
that
places
were
available
for
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1905-06_in_Scottish_football">
1905-06
</ref>
season
,
and
Aberdeen
were
duly
elected
.
</p>
<p>
Thereafter
,
progress
was
steady
rather
than
spectacular
,
the
club
finishing
in
12th
position
in
the
next
two
seasons
,
although
there
was
a
Scottish
Cup
semi-final
in
1908
,
in
which
Celtic
prevailed
at
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittodrie_Stadium">
Pittodrie
</ref>
.
For
the
next
few
seasons
,
Aberdeen
seem
to
have
been
genuine
contenders
for
League
honours
,
topping
the
table
on
more
than
one
occasion
,
but
never
at
season
's
end
.
In
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1910-11_in_Scottish_football">
1910-11
season
</ref>
,
both
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangers_F.C.">
Rangers
</ref>
and
Celtic
were
beaten
at
Pittodrie
for
the
first
time
,
and
another
Cup
semi-final
followed
.
That
game
,
too
,
was
lost
to
Celtic
,
but
the
strength
of
the
side
that
season
led
to
an
invitation
to
a
close
season
tour
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemia">

,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moravia">

</ref>
,
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland">

</ref>
.
</p>
<p>
After
the
end
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1911-12_in_Scottish_football">
1911-12
season
</ref>
,
Philip
served
as
a
referee
at
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1912_Summer_Olympics">
Olympic
Games
in
Stockholm
</ref>
.
</p>
<p>
In
April
1920
,
Philip
's
position
became
full-time
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-philipafc-1">
[

]
</ref>
in
spite
of
the
relative
penury
of
the
club
at
this
time
,
but
during
wartime
,
the
position
reverted
to
part-time
.
The
manager
and
players
struggled
on
through
the
early
years
of
the
war
,
the
team
often
made
up
of
locally
billeted
servicemen
,
but
by
early
1917
,
the
strain
on
finances
,
and
the
lack
of
public
enthusiasm
was
too
much
,
and
the
club
withdrew
from
competition
.
</p>
<p>
On
the
resumption
of
football
in
1919
,
Philip
was
offered
his
old
,
full-time
post
at
a
salary
of
Â£350
per
annum
;
a
move
which
caused
some
controversy
among
the
directors
at
the
time
.
Philip
accepted
,
and
prepared
to
take
the
club
forward
into
the
new
decade
.
</p>
<p>
The
early
1920s
proved
no
more
fruitful
for
Philip
and
his
team
than
the
prewar
era
,
but
one
record
was
set
which
still
stands
as
of
2017
-
Aberdeen
's
record
victory
of
13-0
over
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peterhead_F.C.">
Peterhead
</ref>
in
1923
.
There
were
two
further
unsuccessful
Cup
semi-finals
,
in
1922
and
1924
,
but
Philip
's
reign
came
to
an
end
with
no
senior
silverware
to
show
for
it
.
</p>
<head>
Final
years
</head>
<p>
Philip
retired
as
Aberdeen
manager
at
the
end
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1923-24_in_Scottish_football">
1923-24

</ref>
,
becoming
a
director
,
and
was
also
involved
with
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_MacGregor">

.
He
died
in
