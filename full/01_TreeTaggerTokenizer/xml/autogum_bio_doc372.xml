Polish

Augustus
,
who
left
no
heir
upon

Polish

required

in

whose

influence

After

<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvise_I_Mocenigo">

called
for
the
re-enforcement
of
the
1556
decree
of
expulsion
,
inciting
many
Jews
to
leave
and
igniting
a
contentious
debate
in
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venetian_Senate">
Senate
</ref>
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Arbel78-2">

</ref>
The
Jews
’
involvement
in
foreign
trade
and
pawn-broking
made
them
vital
economic
assets
to
the
Venetian
city-state
.
Moreover
,
some
Venetian
citizens
objected
morally
to
the
replacement
of
Jewish
banks
with
the
Christian
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_di_Pietà">

Pietà

,
an
up-and-coming
institution
in
Venetian
towns
.
At
the
same
time
,
others
argued
that
Jewish
expulsion
was
a
matter
of
moral
necessity
,
citing
the
banishment
of
Jews
from
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain">

and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal">

Back
in
Istanbul
,
Ashkenazi
used
his
contacts
to
exert
political
pressure
on
the
Venetian
authorities
on
the
issue
of
Jewish
expulsion
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Marotti2013-11">
[

</ref>
Through
an
arrangement
with
Jacopo
Soranzo
,
a
Venetian
official
in
Istanbul
,
Ashkenazi
had
arranged
for
some
expelled
Venetian
Jews
to
come
to
Turkey
.
Soranzo
returned
to
Venice
shortly
afterward
to
warn
the
Senate
of
the
threat
inherent
in
that
arrangement
.
The
Jews
living
presently
in
Turkey
,
he
explained
,
who
had
been
expelled
earlier
from
Spain
and
Portugal
,
now
manufactured
weapons
for
the
Ottoman
forces
to
use
against
Venice
.
To
add
onto
them
Jews
expelled
from
Venice
could
be
costly
or
even
dangerous
.
Ashkenazi
made
similar
arguments
to
Barbaro
,
who
relayed
them
to
the
Doge
in
his
dispatches
on
the
Ottoman
situation
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-12">
[

</ref>
</p>
<p>
These
factors
doubtless
contributed
to
the
Senate
’s
decision
to
readmit
the
Jews
in
December
1573
.
But
it
would
be
fallacious
to
attribute
full
credit
to
Ashkenazi
.
Another
proposal
presented
to
the
Venetian
Senate
earlier
that
year
suggested
the
Jews
expelled
from
Spain
and
Portugal
be
permitted
entry
,
provided
they
lived
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venetian_Ghetto">
ghettos
</ref>
.
While
that
proposal
did
not
pass
,
it
served
to
remind
the
Senate
of
the
economic
importance
of
the
Jews
and
likely
contributed
to
their
ultimate
readmission

Ambassador
to
Venice

<p>
Following
the
Polish
election
,
the
Porte
named
Ashkenazi
envoy
to
Venice
.
Controversy
flamed
on
both
sides
about
the
appointment
of
a
Jew
.
In
Turkey
,
Sokollu
vouched
for
the
doctor
’s
political
acumen
,
while
in
Venice
Barbaro
sung
Ashkenazi
’s
praises
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-graetz-9">

After
some
debate
,
Ashkenazi
won
the
seat
and
travelled
to
Venice
in
May
1574
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Baron1983-14">

<p>
The
Venetian

with
gifts
upon
his
arrival
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-graetz-9">

As
Ottoman
ambassador
,
his
track

proved
mixed

Ashkenazi
successfully
negotiated
a
dispute
over
the
borders
of

,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-15">

but
failed
in

advocacy
for
the
formation

military
alliance
