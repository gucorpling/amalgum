issues

campaign

A
:
</hi>
There
is
a
tremendous
undertone
of
despair
and
apathy
when
people
talk
about
the
current
situation
of
Ward
28
and
the
city
in
general
.
I
am
deeply
concerned
about
the
downward
spiral
of
our
neighbourhoods
:
no
vision
,
residents
feel
unsafe
;
businesses
struggling
;
crumbling
public
housing
;
no
&quot;
at
risk
neighbourhoods
'
youth
funding
and
an
absentee
councillor
battling
windmills
elsewhere
,
leaving
the
ward
in
auto-pilot
.
I
strongly
believe
our
city
government
must
be
accountable
to
the
neighbourhoods
that
elect
it
.
</p>
<p>
My
top
three
priorities
are
:
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Accountability

one
election
issue
do

feel

to

this
election

<p>

<p>
Residents
from
all
neighbourhoods
and
all
income
levels
share
these
concerns
.
Tenants
must
have
more
options
and
flexibility
to
break
the
cycle
of
poverty
and
get
back
their
dignity
that
has
been
taken
from
them
.
Dramatic
change
from
the
current
model
of
building
&quot;
monuments
to
poverty
&quot;
is
required
.
Tenants
need
choice
offered
by
portable
housing
allowances
,
to
relocate
closer
to
new
job
opportunities
or
schools
anywhere
in
Toronto
.
We
must
return
Ward
28
to
socio-economic
diversity
.

Q
:
</hi>
Why
have
you
chosen
to
involve
yourself
in
the
political
process
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
A
:
</hi>
Had
anyone
asked
me
a
few
years
ago
if
I
had
any
political
aspirations
,
I
would
have
thought
they
were
nuts
.
But
a
couple
of
years
ago
,
when
our
then
two
year
old
daughter
was
put
at
risk
by
picking
up
a
discarded
condom
in
Riverdale
Park
,
things
changed
.
So
after
the
trauma
of
hepatitis
injections
and
HIV
screening
at
Sick
Kids
and
fighting
city
hall
to
clean
up
the
park
the
question
remained
&quot;
How
did
this
happen
?
&quot;
The
simple
answer
is
:
&quot;
because
we
let
it
happen
&quot;
.
We
took
it
for
granted
that
our
local
councillor
was
making
the
right
choices
to
keep
us
safe
and
to
improve
the
quality
of
life
of
all
neighbourhoods
and
all
residents
.
Well
,
I
found
out
the
hard
way
that
is
n't
true
and
I
decided
this
needed
to
be
changed
.
</p>
<p>
Party
politics
are
paralyzing
City
Council
,
literally
crippling
this
city
.
Asa
candidate
,
the
question
I
receive
most
often
is
,
&quot;
what
is
your
political
party
?
&quot;
I
am
not
aligned
or
a
member
of
any
political
party
.
I
am
not
an
ideologue
from
the
left
or
the
right
.
I
believe
in
consensus
,
not
compromise
,
and
building
bridges
on
issues
from
the
centre
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Q
:
</hi>
Why
do
you
want
to
represent
this
particular
ward
on
council
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
A
:
</hi>
I
want
my
daughters
to
grow
up
in
Cabbagetown
.
I
am
tired
of
having
their
school-age
friends
leave
the
area
for
the
suburbs
.
Ward
28
has
become
an
economically
depressed
area
.
I
have
a
bold
vision
for
Ward
28
to
restore
ward
28
as
a
place
of
innovation
and
growth
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Q
:
</hi>
How
are
you
currently
involved
in
the
community
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
A
:
</hi>
I
was
a
founding
board
member
of
the
Don
Vale
Cabbagetown
Residents
Association
which
is
now
over
500
members
.
I
am
also
a
member
of
the
Community
Police
Liaison
Committee
,
where
I
am
working
to
broaden
and
increase
neighbourhood
membership
in
the
committee
via
community
outreach
.
I
am
also
a
long
time
member
and
volunteer
of
the
Cabbagetown
Preservation
Association
,
working
to
protect
our
remaining
heritage
properties
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Q
:
</hi>
If
you
were
elected
as
a
&quot;
rookie
&quot;
councillor
,
What
would
you
bring
to
the
table
beyond
the
incumbent
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
A
:
</hi>
I
will
instil
a
sense
of
hope
for
everyone
and
build
consensus
around
a
vision
,
no
matter
what
your
individual
political
stripe
,
or
neighbourhood
you
live
in
,
that
if
we
work
together
,
we
can
change
things
around
.
The
residents
of
ward
28
are
patient
people
and
they
deserve
more
than
political
rhetoric
.
They
want
results
not
aspirations
.
They
want
accountability
from
their
elected
representatives
.
They
want
a
councillor
responsive
to
all
residents
,
all
businesses
and
all
neighbourhoods
!
I
will
be
that
councillor
.

Q
:
</hi>
What
does
Toronto
mean
to
you
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
A
:
</hi>
I
care
very
deeply
for
our
downtown
neighbourhoods
and
the
city
of
Toronto
.
I
have
lived
in
Downtown
Toronto
for
twenty-five
years
including
fourteen
in
Cabbagetown
.
I
have
always
liked
living
in
Downtown
Toronto
.
This
is
not
my
Toronto
and
this
is
not
the
Toronto
I
want
to
leave
as
a
legacy
to
my
young
daughters
.
