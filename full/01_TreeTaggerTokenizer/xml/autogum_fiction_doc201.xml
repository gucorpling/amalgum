Facing
the
Scoodlers
</head>
<p>
The
country
was
n't
so
pretty
now
.
Before
the
travelers
appeared
a
rocky
plain
covered
with
hills
on
which
grew
nothing
green
.
They
were
nearing
some
low
mountains
,
too
,
and
the
road
,
which
before
had
been
smooth
and
pleasant
to
walk
upon
,
grew
rough
and
uneven
.
</p>
<p>
Button-Bright
's
little
feet
stumbled
more
than
once
,
and
Polychrome
ceased
her
dancing
because
the
walking
was
now
so
difficult
that
she
had
no
trouble
to
keep
warm
.
</p>
<p>
It
had
become
afternoon
,
yet
there
was
n't
a
thing
for
their
luncheon
except
two
apples
which
the
shaggy
man
had
taken
from
the
breakfast
table
.
He
divided
these
into
four
pieces
and
gave
a
portion
to
each
of
his
companions
.
Dorothy
and
Button-Bright
were
glad
to
get
theirs
;
but
Polly
was
satisfied
with
a
small
bite
,
and
Toto
did
not
like
apples
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Do
you
know
,
&quot;
asked
the
Rainbow
's
Daughter
,
&quot;
if
this
is
the
right
road
to
the
Emerald
City
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
No
,
I
do
n't
,
&quot;
replied
Dorothy
,
&quot;
but
it
's
the
only
road
in
this
part
of
the
country
,
so
we
may
as
well
go
to
the
end
of
it
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
It
looks
now
as
if
it
might
end
pretty
soon
,
&quot;
remarked
the
shaggy
man
;
&quot;
and
what
shall
we
do
if
it
does
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Do
n't
know
,
&quot;
said
Button-Bright
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
If
I
had
my
Magic
Belt
,
&quot;
replied
Dorothy
,
thoughtfully
,
&quot;
it
could
do
us
a
lot
of
good
just
now
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
What
is
your
Magic
Belt
?
&quot;
asked
Polychrome
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
It
's
a
thing
I
captured
from
the
Nome
King
one
day
,
and
it
can
do
'
most
any
wonderful
thing
.
But
I
left
it
with
Ozma
,
you
know
;
'
cause
magic
wo
n't
work
in
Kansas
,
but
only
in
fairy
countries
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Is
this
a
fairy
country
?
&quot;
asked
Button-Bright
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
should
think
you
'd
know
,
&quot;
said
the
little
girl
,
gravely
.
&quot;
If
it
was
n't
a
fairy
country
you
could
n't
have
a
fox
head
and
the
shaggy
man
could
n't
have
a
donkey
head
,
and
the
Rainbow
's
Daughter
would
be
invis'ble
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
What
's
that
?
&quot;
asked
the
boy
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
You
do
n't
seem
to
know
anything
,
Button-Bright
.
Invis'ble
is
a
thing
you
ca
n't
see
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Then
Toto
's
invis'ble
,
&quot;
declared
the
boy
,
and
Dorothy
found
he
was
right
.
Toto
had
disappeared
from
view
,
but
they
could
hear
him
barking
furiously
among
the
heaps
of
grey
rock
ahead
of
them
.
</p>
<p>
They
moved
forward
a
little
faster
to
see
what
the
dog
was
barking
at
,
and
found
perched
upon
a
point
of
rock
by
the
roadside
a
curious
creature
.
It
had
the
form
of
a
man
,
middle-sized
and
rather
slender
and
graceful
;
but
as
it
sat
silent
and
motionless
upon
the
peak
they
could
see
that
its
face
was
black
as
ink
,
and
it
wore
a
black
cloth
costume
made
like
a
union
suit
and
fitting
tight
to
its
skin
.
Its
hands
were
black
,
too
,
and
its
toes
curled
down
,
like
a
bird
's
.
The
creature
was
black
all
over
except
its
hair
,
which
was
fine
,
and
yellow
,
banged
in
front
across
the
black
forehead
and
cut
close
at
the
sides
.
The
eyes
,
which
were
fixed
steadily
upon
the
barking
dog
,
were
small
and
sparkling
and
looked
like
the
eyes
of
a
weasel
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
What
in
the
world
do
you
s'pose
that
is
?
&quot;
asked
Dorothy
in
a
hushed
voice
,
as
the
little
group
of
travelers
stood
watching
the
strange
creature
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Do
n't
know
,
&quot;
said
Button-Bright
.
</p>
<p>
The
thing
gave
a
jump
and
turned
half
around
,
sitting
in
the
same
place
but
with
the
other
side
of
its
body
facing
them
.
Instead
of
being
black
,
it
was
now
pure
white
,
with
a
face
like
that
of
a
clown
in
a
circus
and
hair
of
a
brilliant
purple
.
The
creature
could
bend
either
way
,
and
its
white
toes
now
curled
the
same
way
the
black
ones
on
the
other
side
had
done
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
It
has
a
face
both
front
and
back
,
&quot;
whispered
Dorothy
,
wonderingly
;
&quot;
only
there
's
no
back
at
all
,
but
two
fronts
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Having
made
the
turn
,
the
being
sat
motionless
as
before
,
while
Toto
barked
louder
at
the
white
man
than
he
had
done
at
the
black
one
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Once
,
&quot;
said
the
shaggy
man
,
&quot;
I
had
a
jumping
jack
like
that
,
with
two
faces
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Was
it
alive
?
&quot;
asked
Button-Bright
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
No
,
&quot;
replied
the
shaggy
man
;
&quot;
it
worked
on
strings
and
was
made
of
wood
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Wonder
if
this
works
with
strings
,
&quot;
said
Dorothy
;
but
Polychrome
cried
&quot;
Look
!
&quot;
for
another
creature
just
like
the
first
had
suddenly
appeared
sitting
on
another
rock
,
its
black
side
toward
them
.
The
two
twisted
their
heads
around
and
showed
a
black
face
on
the
white
side
of
one
and
a
white
face
on
the
black
side
of
the
other
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
How
curious
,
&quot;
said
Polychrome
;
&quot;
and
how
loose
their
heads
seem
to
be
!
Are
they
friendly
to
us
,
do
you
think
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Ca
n't
tell
,
Polly
,
&quot;
replied
Dorothy
.
&quot;
Let
's
ask
'
em
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
creatures
flopped
first
one
way
and
then
the
other
,
showing
black
or
white
by
turns
;
and
now
another
joined
them
,
appearing
on
another
rock
.
Our
friends
had
come
to
a
little
hollow
in
the
hills
,
and
the
place
where
they
now
stood
was
surrounded
by
jagged
peaks
of
rock
,
except
where
the
road
ran
through
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Now
there
are
four
of
them
,
&quot;
said
the
shaggy
man
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Five
,
&quot;
declared
Polychrome
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Six
,
&quot;
said
Dorothy
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Lots
of
'
em
!
&quot;
cried
Button-Bright
;
and
so
there
were
--
quite
a
row
of
the
two-sided
black
and
white
creatures
sitting
on
the
rocks
all
around
.
</p>
<p>
Toto
stopped
barking
and
ran
between
Dorothy
's
feet
,
where
he
crouched
down
as
if
afraid
.
The
creatures
did
not
look
pleasant
or
friendly
,
to
be
sure
,
and
the
shaggy
man
's
donkey
face
became
solemn
,
indeed
.
