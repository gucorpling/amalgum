Oh
,
I
totally
disagree
with
that
,
unfortunately
,
it
’s
a
very
important
decision
.
I
’m
wondering
whether
he
had
a
strategic
reason
for
making
that
point
;
maybe
he
is
trying
to
get
people
to
implement
it
in

not-serious
way

He
was
talking
about
in
terms
of
the
effect
,
that
it
did
n’t
have
much
of
an
effect
because
there
were
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion%20in%20the%20United%20States">
other
legal
alternatives

to
that
particular

<p>
<hi rend="bold">

</hi>
That
’s
not
what
the
medical
profession
says
,
so
even
if
you
are
talking
about
a
tiny
percentage
of
women
,
it
’s
still
that
there
are
some
women
—
and
every
single
medical
organization
said
this
—
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American%20Medical%20Association">
American
Medical
Association
</ref>
,
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American%20College%20of%20Obstetricians%20and%20Gynecologists">
College
of
Obstetricians
and
Gynecologists
</ref>
,
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American%20Nurses%20Association">
American
Nurses
Association
</ref>
,
that
for
some
cases
this
is
the
necessary
method
in
order
to
either
preserve
the
woman
’s
life
or
preserve
her
future
fertility
.
So
the
only
option
they
have
under
this
decision
is
for
the
doctor
to
leave
the
operating
room
and
run
to
court
to
get
an
injunction
because
the
Supreme
Court
said
—
the
Court
acknowledged
that
in
the
opinion
and
said
but
those
women
can
bring
in
an
“
As
Applied
”
challenge
,
that
they
are
n’t
going
to
strike
down
the
entire
statute
on
its
face
.
But
realistically
,
is
that
going
to
happen
?
And
what
doctor
is
going
to
take
the
risk
of
criminal
prosecution
?
I
beg
,
with
the
greatest
respect
for
him
,
I
really
beg
to
differ
.

The
question
I
have
is
that
on
its
face
it
was
deciding
one
particular
issue
in
the
abortion
debate
,
but
a
lot
of
pro-choice
organizations
paint
this
as
,
“
We
are
now
getting
ready
to
ban
abortion
;
this
is
the
first
step
on
what
might
be
a
short
road

Yes

a

Is
n’t
it
almost
the

“
They
