The
execution
of
Wishart
at
the
instance
of
the
cardinal
,
1
March
1546
,
was
apparently
rather
an
opportune
pretext
for
the
cardinal
's
assassination
than
the
direct
cause
of
it
.
The
statement
of
contemporary
writers
that
Norman
Leslie
had
not
long
before
the
murder
a
violent
personal
quarrel
with
Beaton
seems
probable
.
Norman
Leslie
was
the
leader
of
the
conspirators
.
The
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Andrews_Castle">

Andrews

,
where
Beaton
lived
,
was
seized
by
men
under

command
,
but
he
took
no
personal
part
in

of
