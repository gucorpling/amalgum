Rapa

)
is
one
of
the
most
isolated
islands
on
Earth
.
Early
settlers
called
the
island
&quot;
Te
Pito
O
Te
Henua
&quot;
(
The
Navel
of
the
World
)
.
It
is
a
territory
of
<ref target="Chile">
Chile
</ref>
that
lies
far
off
in
the
Pacific
Ocean
,
roughly
halfway
to
<ref target="Tahiti">
Tahiti
</ref>
.
Known
as
one
of
the
world
's
sacred
sites
,
it
is
most
famous
for
its
enigmatic
giant
stone
statues
or
<hi rend="italic">
moai
</hi>
whose
oversized
heads
,
carved
centuries
ago
,
reflect
the
history
of
the
dramatic
rise
and
fall
of
the
most
isolated
Polynesian
culture
.

<p>
The
English
name
of
the
island
commemorates
its
European
discovery
by
a
Dutch
exploration
vessel
on
Easter
Sunday
in
1722
.
</p>
<p>
After
Thor
Heyerdahl
and
a
small
party
of
adventurers
sailed
their
raft
from
<ref target="South%20America">
South
America
</ref>
to
the
Tuamotu
islands
,
far
to
the
north
of
Easter
Island
,
a
controversy
raged
over
the
origin
of
the
islanders
.
DNA
testing
has
proved
conclusively
that
the
Polynesians
arrived
from
the
west
rather
than
the
east
,
and
that
the
people
of
Easter
Island
are
descendants
of
intrepid
voyagers
who
set
out
from
another
island
thousands
of
years
ago
.
Legend
says
that
the
people
left
for
Easter
Island
because
their
own
island
was
slowly
being
swallowed
by
the
sea
.
</p>
<p>
In
brief
,
the
prehistory
of
Easter
Island
is
one
of
supreme
accomplishment
,
flourishing
and
civilization
,
followed
by
environmental
devastation
and
decline
.
Although
it
is
not
agreed
when
people
first
arrived
on
Easter
Island
(
with
estimates
ranging
from
300
to
1200
CE
)
,
consensus
seems
to
be
that
the
first
peoples
arrived
from
Polynesia
.
Rather
than
being
inhabited
by
mistake
or
chance
,
evidence
has
suggested
that
Easter
Island
was
colonized
deliberately
by
large
boats
with
many
settlers
—
a
remarkable
feat
given
the
distance
of
Easter
Island
from
any
other
land
in
the
Pacific
Ocean
(
4,231
km
to
Tahiti
)
.
</p>
<p>
The
first
islanders
found
a
land
of
undoubted
paradise
—
archaeological
evidence
shows
that
the
island
was
covered
in
trees
of
various
sorts
,
including
the
largest
palm
tree
species
in
the
world
,
whose
bark
and
wood
furnished
the
natives
with
cloth
,
rope
,
and
canoes
.
Birds
were
abundant
as
well
,
and
provided
food
for
them
.
A
mild
climate
favored
an
easy
life
,
and
abundant
waters
yielded
fish
and
oysters
.
</p>
<p>
The
islanders
prospered
due
to
these
advantages
,
and
a
reflection
of
this
is
the
religion
which
sprouted
in
their
leisure
,
which
had
at
its
centerpiece
the
giant
moai
statues
,
that
are
the
island
's
most
distinctive
feature
today
.
These
moai
,
which
the
island
is
littered
with
,
are
supposed
to
have
been
depictions
of
ancestors
,
whose
presence
likely
was
considered
a
blessing
or
watchful
safekeeping
eye
over
each
small
village
.
The
ruins
of
Rano
Raraku
crater
,
the
stone
quarry
where
most
of
the
moai
were
carved
and
outside
which
many
still
sit
today
,
is
a
testament
to
how
central
these
figures
were
to
the
islanders
,
and
how
their
life
revolved
around
these
creations
.
It
has
been
suggested
that
their
isolation
from
all
other
peoples
fueled
this
outlet
of
trade
and
creativity
—
lacking
any
other
significant
way
to
direct
their
skills
and
resources
.
The
bird-man
culture
(
seen
in
petroglyphs
)
,
is
an
obvious
testament
to
the
islanders
'
fascination
with
the
ability
to
leave
their
island
for
distant
lands
.
</p>
<p>
However
,
as
the
population
grew
,
so
did
pressures
on
the
island
's
environment
.
Deforestation
of
the
island
's
trees
gradually
increased
,
and
as
this
main
resource
was
depleted
,
the
islanders
would
find
it
hard
to
continue
making
rope
,
canoes
,
and
all
the
necessities
to
hunt
and
fish
,
and
ultimately
,
support
the
culture
that
produced
the
giant
stone
figureheads
.
Apparently
,
disagreements
began
to
break
out
(
with
some
violence
)
as
confidence
in
the
old
religion
was
lost
,
and
this
is
reflected
partly
in
the
ruins
of
moai
which
were
deliberately
toppled
by
human
hands
.
By
the
end
of
the
glory
of
the
Easter
Island
culture
,
the
population
had
crashed
in
numbers
,
and
the
residents
—
with
little
food
or
other
ways
to
obtain
sustenance
—
resorted
sometimes
to
cannibalism
and
a
bare
subsistence
.
Subsequent
slave
raids
by
countries
such
as
Peru
and
Bolivia
devastated
the
population
even
more
,
as
did
epidemics
of
western
diseases
,
until
barely
a
hundred
native
Rapa
Nui
were
left
by
the
late
nineteenth
century
.
</p>
<p>
Today
,
Rapa
Nui
National
Park
is
on
the
<ref target="UNESCO%20World%20Heritage%20List">
UNESCO
World
Heritage
List
</ref>
.
Its
residents
rely
much
on
the
tourism
and
economic
links
to
Chile
and
daily
flights
to
Santiago
.
As
with
many
native
peoples
,
the
Rapa
Nui
seek
a
link
to
their
past
and
ways
to
integrate
their
culture
with
the
political
,
economic
,
and
social
realities
of
today
.

<ref target="Round%20the%20world%20flights">

Coming
from
Santiago
,
it
is
a
good
choice
to
reserve
seats
on
the
left
side
of
the
airplane
.
Easter
Island
's
runway
has
a
west-east
orientation
.
Even
though
the
plane
comes
from
Chile
(
to
the
east
)
,
it
is
likely
it
will
circle
the
north
portion
of
the
island
and
land
from
the
west
,
so
seating
at
the
left
side
(
both
landing
and
taking
off
)
will
give
you
a
great
view
of
the
island
.
