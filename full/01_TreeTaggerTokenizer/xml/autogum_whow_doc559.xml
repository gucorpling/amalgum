Own
a
Dog
</head>
<p>
Okay
,
so
you
read
all
the
interesting
and
important
facts
about
your
dog
's
breed
or
maybe
you
have
n't
,
but
either
way
,
you
're
still
clueless
on
what
to
do
to
provide
for
a
dog
.
You
do
n't
want
Fido
to
live
unhappily
,
right
?
Here
are
the
basic
steps
!

Steps
</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Give
your
dog
a
name
.
This
is
something
that
will
affect
your
pet
for
life
.
Do
n't
name
it
something
too
long
or
something
that
you
do
n't
like
.
Do
n't
name
her
Kitty
just
because
your
sister
made
you
for
revenge
on
not
getting
a
family
cat
!
It
's
important
that
your
dog
has
a
nice
name
for
tags
and
a
word
to
respond
to
when
he
or
she
gets
lost
.

Designate
an
area
for
your
dog
to
sleep
.
The
first
night
must
always
be
prepared
with
one
simple
question
:
Where
do
they
sleep
?
Will
they
sleep
in
a
dog
bed
in
your
room
or
in
the
garage
?
Or
maybe
the
backyard
?
Wherever
it
may
be
,
make
sure
it
's
warm
during
the
winter
and
cool
during
the
summer
so
they
can
sleep
comfortably
.
Make
it
protected
from
possible
dangers
and
the
possibility
of
escaping
.

Pick
a
dog
food
for
your
friendly
friend
!
Make
sure
not
to
feed
it
chicken
and
leftovers
as
a
daily
meal
.
They
are
unhealthy
and
can
lead
to
obesity
or
diabetes
,
and
we
do
n't
want
unnecessary
vet
bills
to
pile
up
.

Make
sure
your
dog
has
a
source
of
water
available
at
all
time
.
Put
two
water
bowls
available
:
In
your
backyard
and
in
your
house
.
They
need
something
to
drink
out
of
.
Pick
a
specific
spot
to
place
the
bowl
.
Make
sure
it
is
refilled
with
fresh
,
cool
water
daily
.
Do
n't
move
the
bowl
to
a
new
spot
everyday
,
that
can
cause
confusion
to
your
dog
.
If
your
dog
knows
the
bowl
is
in
one
spot
,
he
'll
know
it
's
there
for
him
when
he
needs
it
.

Provide
playtime
for
your
pet
.
Each
day
you
should
designate
at
least
one
hour
of
playtime
,
let
it
be
day
or
night
,
rain
or
shine
.
Exercise
can
mean
many
things
considering
the
size
of
your
dog
.
A
medium
sized
dog
could
do
just
fine
with
a
20
minute
walk
and
some
throw
toys
.
A
small
dog
could
be
happy
with
a
30
minute
game
of
fetch
and
a
short
walk
.
A
large
dog
will
probably
need
a
long
walk
,
a
game
of
fetch
,
and
some
chew
toys
.
Please
provide
playtime
for
your
dog
at
least
once
a
day
.
Do
n't
forget
or
be
too
lazy
.
It
only
makes
your
dog
unhappy
.

Give
them
a
collar
and
tags
.
At
your
local
pet
store
there
should
be
a
machine
that
provides
pet
tags
for
your
dog
.
All
dogs
need
a
collar
and
tags
to
go
on
it
.
All
the
tag
should
say
is
the
dog
's
name
and
an
email
or
phone
number
to
call
if
they
are
lost
.
If
you
think
this
step
is
not
important
,
do
your
research
!
As
smart
as
your
dog
might
seem
to
be
,
curiosity
can
overcome
the
voice
in
your
dog
's
head
that
tells
them
&quot;
No
,
do
n't
do
it
&quot;
.
Dogs
will
get
loose
at
some
point
in
their
life
,
and
with
no
tags
there
is
no
one
to
figure
out
who
their
owner
is
.
You
will
be
saving
your
dogs
physical
and
mental
wellness
by
getting
them
tags
.
Microchips
cannot
be
seen
and
plenty
of
people
do
n't
look
for
it
or
get
the
stray
scanned
for
one-
they
only
look
for
what
's
visible
.
So
the
tags
are
extremely
important
and
should
be
taken
care
of
right
away
.

Vet
checkups
.
If
you
ca
n't
afford
a
monthly
checkup
,
at
least
do
it
every
so
often
.
Even
if
it
's
just
once
,
make
sure
you
can
do
it
.
Give
them
their
shots
and
make
sure
they
are
healthy
.
If
you
see
any
signs
of
illness
,
report
to
a
vet
immediately
to
make
sure
your
furry
friend
is
not
in
pain
!
