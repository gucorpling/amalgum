<list type="ordered">
<item>
Slice
five
bamboo
shoots
into
small
pieces
.
</item>
<item>
Mix
with
some
salt
and
boil
it
for
30
minutes
.
Pour
its
liquid
to
another
pot
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Your
bamboo
shoot
must
be
raw
to
be
able
to
test
good
.
Your
raw
slide
bamboo
shoot
needs
some
salt
to
add
when
boiling
it
because
salt
will
make
it
tastier
.
</item>
<item>
However
,
you
must
be
careful
with
adding
salt
because
you
will
have
to
add
one
more
time
during
you
cook
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Cut
the
fish
or
chicken
into
small
pieces
and
put
it
in
the
liquid
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
If
needed
put
more
some
water
until
it
boils
.
You
should
not
put
the
whole
body
of
the
fish
or
all
of
the
chicken
without
adding
something
.
</item>
<item>
To
be
able
you
dish
smell
good
,
both
fish
and
chicken
have
to
be
roast
before
boiling
with
bamboo
shoot
liquid
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Put
some
two
table
spoon
of
fish
pate
,
some
slat
again
and
slide
djenkol
bean
into
the
boiling
water
and
keep
boiling
it
until
15
minutes
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
In
this
step
you
are
going
to
add
salt
again
.
So
,
if
you
add
a
lot
of
salt
for
the
first
time
your
dish
will
be
salty
.
Too
much
fish
pate
will
cover
the
smell
of
the
fish
or
chicken
roast
.
So
,
I
recommend
not
to
put
more
than
two
table
spoon
of
fish
pate
.
Djenkol
bean
must
test
good
,
after
you
cook
,
but
if
you
are
allergic
with
djenkil
bean
,
you
will
not
include
it
in
your
ingredient
.
Especially
,
for
the
pregnant
women
.

Put
basil
leaves
first
,
follow
by
drumstick
leaves
,
and
powder
black
pepper
keep
boiling
it
more
for
3
minutes
and
wait
until
it
boils
again
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
That
3
minutes
will
mix
the
leaves
with
ingredient
.
To
put
chili
pepper
into
the
pot
is
your
choice
.
If
you
like
spicy
,
you
can
include
chilly
,
but
if
not
up
to
you
.
My
recommendation
is
when
you
are
cooking
this
dish
in
cold
season
make
this
spicy
otherwise
the
test
will
not
be
delicious
.
Hot
and
spicy
will
help
you
to
get
warm
.

Add
pounded
rice
that
you
had
sink
into
water
when
it
boils
again
after
3
minutes
for
the
lest
step
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
There
are
two
ways
we
can
make
the
rice
powder
.
The
first
way
we
can
get
it
by
sink
rice
we
need
and
pound
it
.
</item>
<item>
The
second
way
is
we
toasted
the
rice
.
These
two
ways
have
different
result
.
The
sink
rice
when
we
pound
it
,
it
sticks
inside
mortar
and
take
more
time
.
It
does
not
give
us
good
smell
when
we
cook
it
.
Toasted
rice
are
better
but
it
takes
little
bit
of
time
when
we
toasted
it
.
However
,
it
going
well
when
we
pound
and
give
us
good
smell
when
we
cook
.
If
you
like
good
smell
and
delicious
dish
,
use
toasted
rice
.
</item>
<item>
Keep
boiling
it
and
it
up
to
you
.
If
you
want
to
eat
with
some
liquid
or
not
.
After
this
step
you
are
ready
to
have
Karen

Be
careful
when
you
add
salt
because
you
have
to
add
it
twice
.
The
first
time
you
have
to
add
with
slide
bamboo
shoot
and
second
time
you
have
to
add
with
fish
pate
and
djenkol
bean
again
.
If
you
add
a
lot
,
you
will
end
up
with
salty
dish

</item>
<item>
Djenkol
bean
is
not
good
for
pregnant
women
to
eat
because
it

course
problem
to

So
,
if
