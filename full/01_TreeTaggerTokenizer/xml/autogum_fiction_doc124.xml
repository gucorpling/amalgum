“
Oh
,
there
IS
one
,
of
course
,
but
you
’ll
never
know
it
.
”
</p>
<p>
The
assertion
,
laughingly
flung
out
six
months
earlier
in
a
bright
June
garden
,
came
back
to
Mary
Boyne
with
a
sharp
perception
of
its
latent
significance
as
she
stood
,
in
the
December
dusk
,
waiting
for
the
lamps
to
be
brought
into
the
library
.
</p>
<p>
The
words
had
been
spoken
by
their
friend
Alida
Stair
,
as
they
sat
at
tea
on
her
lawn
at
Pangbourne
,
in
reference
to
the
very
house
of
which
the
library
in
question
was
the
central
,
the
pivotal
“
feature
.
”
Mary
Boyne
and
her
husband
,
in
quest
of
a
country
place
in
one
of
the
southern
or
southwestern
counties
,
had
,
on
their
arrival
in
England
,
carried
their
problem
straight
to
Alida
Stair
,
who
had
successfully
solved
it
in
her
own
case
;
but
it
was
not
until
they
had
rejected
,
almost
capriciously
,
several
practical
and
judicious
suggestions
that
she
threw
it
out
:
“
Well
,
there
’s
Lyng
,
in
Dorsetshire
.
It
belongs
to
Hugo
’s
cousins
,
and
you
can
get
it
for
a
song
.
”
</p>
<p>
The
reasons
she
gave
for
its
being
obtainable
on
these
terms
--
its
remoteness
from
a
station
,
its
lack
of
electric
light
,
hot-water
pipes
,
and
other
vulgar
necessities
--
were
exactly
those
pleading
in
its
favor
with
two
romantic
Americans
perversely
in
search
of
the
economic
drawbacks
which
were
associated
,
in
their
tradition
,
with
unusual
architectural
felicities
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
should
never
believe
I
was
living
in
an
old
house
unless
I
was
thoroughly
uncomfortable
,
”
Ned
Boyne
,
the
more
extravagant
of
the
two
,
had
jocosely
insisted
;
“
the
least
hint
of
‘
convenience
’
would
make
me
think
it
had
been
bought
out
of
an
exhibition
,
with
the
pieces
numbered
,
and
set
up
again
.
”
And
they
had
proceeded
to
enumerate
,
with
humorous
precision
,
their
various
suspicions
and
exactions
,
refusing
to
believe
that
the
house
their
cousin
recommended
was
REALLY
Tudor
till
they
learned
it
had
no
heating
system
,
or
that
the
village
church
was
literally
in
the
grounds
till
she
assured
them
of
the
deplorable
uncertainty
of
the
water-supply
.
</p>
<p>
“
It
’s
too
uncomfortable
to
be
true
!
”
Edward
Boyne
had
continued
to
exult
as
the
avowal
of
each
disadvantage
was
successively
wrung
from
her
;
but
he
had
cut
short
his
rhapsody
to
ask
,
with
a
sudden
relapse
to
distrust
:
“
And
the
ghost
?
You
’ve
been
concealing
from
us
the
fact
that
there
is
no
ghost
!
”
</p>
<p>
Mary
,
at
the
moment
,
had
laughed
with
him
,
yet
almost
with
her
laugh
,
being
possessed
of
several
sets
of
independent
perceptions
,
had
noted
a
sudden
flatness
of
tone
in
Alida
’s
answering
hilarity
.
</p>
<p>
“
Oh
,
Dorsetshire
’s
full
of
ghosts
,
you
know
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Yes
,
yes
;
but
that
wo
n’t
do
.
I
do
n’t
want
to
have
to
drive
ten
miles
to
see
somebody
else
’s
ghost
.
I
want
one
of
my
own
on
the
premises
.
IS
there
a
ghost
at
Lyng
?
”
</p>
<p>
His
rejoinder
had
made
Alida
laugh
again
,
and
it
was
then
that
she
had
flung
back
tantalizingly
:
“
Oh
,
there
IS
one
,
of
course
,
but
you
’ll
never
know
it
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Never
know
it
?
”
Boyne
pulled
her
up
.
“
But
what
in
the
world
constitutes
a
ghost
except
the
fact
of
its
being
known
for
one
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
ca
n’t
say
.
But
that
’s
the
story
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
That
there
’s
a
ghost
,
but
that
nobody
knows
it
’s
a
ghost
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Well
--
not
till
afterward
,
at
any
rate
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Till
afterward
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Not
till
long
,
long
afterward
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
But
if
it
’s
once
been
identified
as
an
unearthly
visitant
,
why
has
n’t
its
signalement
been
handed
down
in
the
family
?
How
has
it
managed
to
preserve
its
incognito
?
”
</p>
<p>
Alida
could
only
shake
her
head
.
“
Do
n’t
ask
me
.
But
it
has
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
And
then
suddenly
--
”
Mary
spoke
up
as
if
from
some
cavernous
depth
of
divination
--
“suddenly
,
long
afterward
,
one
says
to
one
’s
self
,
‘
THAT
WAS
it
?
’
”
</p>
<p>
She
was
oddly
startled
at
the
sepulchral
sound
with
which
her
question
fell
on
the
banter
of
the
other
two
,
and
she
saw
the
shadow
of
the
same
surprise
flit
across
Alida
’s
clear
pupils
.
“
I
suppose
so
.
One
just
has
to
wait
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Oh
,
hang
waiting
!
”
Ned
broke
in
.
“
Life
’s
too
short
for
a
ghost
who
can
only
be
enjoyed
in
retrospect
.
Ca
n’t
we
do
better
than
that
,
Mary
?
”
</p>
<p>
But
it
turned
out
that
in
the
event
they
were
not
destined
to
,
for
within
three
months
of
their
conversation
with
Mrs.
Stair
they
were
established
at
Lyng
,
and
the
life
they
had
yearned
for
to
the
point
of
planning
it
out
in
all
its
daily
details
had
actually
begun
for
them
.
</p>
<p>
It
was
to
sit
,
in
the
thick
December
dusk
,
by
just
such
a
wide-hooded
fireplace
,
under
just
such
black
oak
rafters
,
with
the
sense
that
beyond
the
mullioned
panes
the
downs
were
darkening
to
a
deeper
solitude
:
it
was
for
the
ultimate
indulgence
in
such
sensations
that
Mary
Boyne
had
endured
for
nearly
fourteen
years
the
soul-deadening
ugliness
of
the
Middle
West
,
and
that
Boyne
had
ground
on
doggedly
at
his
engineering
till
,
with
a
suddenness
that
still
made
her
blink
,
the
prodigious
windfall
of
the
Blue
Star
Mine
had
put
them
at
a
stroke
in
possession
of
life
and
the
leisure
to
taste
it
.
They
had
never
for
a
moment
meant
their
new
state
to
be
one
of
idleness
;
but
they
meant
to
give
themselves
only
to
harmonious
activities
.
She
had
her
vision
of
painting
and
gardening
(
against
a
background
of
gray
walls
)
,
he
dreamed
of
the
production
of
his
long-planned
book
on
the
“
Economic
Basis
of
Culture
”
;
and
with
such
absorbing
work
ahead
no
existence
could
be
too
sequestered
;
they
could
not
get
far
enough
from
the
world
,
or
plunge
deep
enough
into
the
past
.
