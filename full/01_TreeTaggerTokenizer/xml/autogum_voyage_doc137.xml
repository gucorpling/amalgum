Andagua
</head>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Andagua
</hi>
is
a
town
in
southern
<ref target="Peru">
Peru
</ref>
about
200
km
northwest
of
the
city
of
<ref target="Arequipa">
Arequipa
</ref>
,
between
the
<ref target="Colca%20Canyon">
Colca
</ref>
and
Cotahuasi
canyons
.
It
is
the
major
centre
for
visits
to
the
Valle
de
Los
Volcanes
(
Valley
of
Volcanoes
.
)
</p>
<p>
As
with
most
Peruvian
towns
,
Andagua
is
centred
around
a
main
plaza
,
in
this
case
filled
with
bushes
clipped
into
a
variety
of
shapes
(
and
often
with
sheep
or
alpacas
brought
in
to
trim
the
grass
.
)
</p>
<head>
Understand
</head>
<p>
Though
the
local
authorities
have
been
trying
to
develop
tourism
in
the
area
,
the
Valle
de
Los
Volcanes
and
Andagua
are
still
far
off
the
southern
Peruvian
tourist
circuit
.
As
a
result
tourist
facilities
are
limited
.
However
this
also
means
that
it
provides
a
fine
opportunity
to
see
the
traditional
rural
way
of
life
on
the
Peruvian
altiplano
,
relatively
untouched
by
outside
influences
.
</p>
<p>
Andagua
's
residents
are
very
friendly
,
and
virtually
everyone
you
meet
will
at
least
offer
a
pleasant
greeting
or
,
more
often
,
stop
to
chat
for
a
bit
.
Because
the
town
is
so
far
removed
from
main
tourist
routes
,
virtually
no
English
is
spoken
.
As
such
at
least
a
bit
of
Spanish
language
skill
will
be
very
helpful
when
visiting
the
area
.
</p>
<head>
Get
in
</head>
<p>
There
are
two
primary
routes
into
Andagua
:
from
the
south
or
the
north
.
</p>
<p>
From
the
south
buses
run
directly
from
<ref target="Arequipa">
Arequipa
</ref>
(
10-11
hours
,
over
poor
roads
)
.
</p>
<p>
Reyna
Tours
buses
depart
daily
from
the
Terrepuerto
depart
at
16:00
,
arriving
at
around
02:30
the
following
morning
(
S/40
(
<ref target="Peru%23Money">
soles
</ref>
)
as
of
April
2013
.
)
</p>
<p>
It
is
also
possible
to
catch
this
service
as
it
passes
through
the
towns
of
Corire
(
~20:00
)
or
Aplao
(
~21:30
.
)
These
towns
can
be
reached
directly
from
Arequipa
or
from
Nazca
or
other
coastal
cities
by
taking
an
Arequipa-bound
bus
,
then
changing
buses
at
the
turnoff
from
the
main
road
,
about
60km
inland
from
the
town
of
Camana
.
</p>
<p>
The
journey
is
breathtaking
,
passing
through
dizzyingly
deep
river
valleys
and
over
a
4800-m
pass
on
the
shoulder
of
6425-m
<hi rend="italic">
Volcan
Coropuno
</hi>
.
Most
of
the
bus
journey
takes
place
in
the
dark
.
The
very
early
arrival
times
of
the
Reyna
tours
buses
can
also
be
problematic
.
</p>
<p>
From
the
north
it
is
possible
to
reach
the
mining
town
of
Orcopampa
via
collectivos
from
Cabanconde
in
the
<ref target="Colca%20Canyon">
Colca
Canyon
</ref>
.
The
daily
Reyna
tours
bus
departs
Orcopampa
for
Andagua
at
14:00
,
arriving
around
16:00
.
</p>
<head>
Get
around
</head>
<p>
Andagua
is
a
small
town
.
All
of
the
town
and
most
of
the
nearby
sights
can
be
reached
on
foot
.
</p>
<p>
The
plaza
principal
is
at
the
centre
of
town
with
the
church
on
its
north
side
and
the
municipality
office
on
the
west
.
</p>
<head>

<p>
Andagua
is
set
in
a
spectacular
location
near
the
head
of
the
Valle
de
Los
Volcanes
(
Valley
of
Volcanoes
.
)
It
is
surrounded
by
small
volcanic
cones
ranging
from
about
50
m
to
300
m
high
,
many
of
which
can
be
easily
climbed
for
views
out
over
the
town
,
fields
and
valley
.
Ancient
lava
flows
cover
large
expanses
near
the
town
and
towering
mountains
and
cliffs
form
the
valley
walls
.
</p>
<p>
Once
you
get
beyond
the
irrigated
areas
near
town
the
arid
landscape
of
the
area
is
particularly
impressive
,
filled
with
a
variety
of
cacti
and
other
desert
flora
.
Alpine
lakes
,
rivers
and
waterfalls
dot
the
area
around
Andagua
.
</p>
<p>
Wildlife
that
can
be
spotted
in
the
area
include
Andean
Condors
,
the
giant
hummingbird
,
and
wild
vicuñas
.
</p>
<p>
Man
made
attractions
include
the
large
pre-Colombian
ruins
of
Antaymarca
,
3
km
south
of
town
.
The
ruins
are
fairly
well
preserved
and
unusual
in
that
they
are
constructed
entirely
of
black
volcanic
rock
on
top
of
a
lava
flow
.
Nearer
to
town
the
traditional
pastures
and
farm
fields
,
all
surrounded
by
rough
stone
walls
are
worth
exploring
as
well
.
The
cemetery
to
the
west
of
town
is
a
veritable
forest
of
large
wooden
crosses
and
crypts
and
is
also
worth
a
look
.
</p>
<head>
Do
</head>
<p>
The
valley
is
a
superb
area
for
hiking
.
The
above
attractions
can
generally
be
reached
on
foot
using
well
worn
paths
or
rough
roads
.
Most
sights
are
marked
with
large
stone
signs
,
though
the
signs
are
sometimes
difficult
to
read
and
follow
.
However
finding
your
way
is
n't
too
difficult
,
as
any
locals
you
meet
while
walking
will
invariably
be
happy
to
help
out
with
directions
.
The
walk
out
to
the
Antaymarca
ruins
and
the
mirador
immediately
above
them
is
easy
(
except
for
the
final
climb
up
to
the
mirador
)
and
especially
worthwhile
.
</p>
<p>
Most
sights
are
also
reachable
by
mountain
bike
,
or
as
part
of
a
horse
or
llama
trek
.
</p>
<p>
A
free
pamphlet
(
Spanish
only
)
outlining
the
main
tourist
attractions
of
the
area
is
available
at
the
Municipality
building
on
the
west
side
of
the
plaza
(
open
09:30
-
13:30
and
14:30
-
16:30
)
.
The
entrance
is
,
rather
confusingly
,
not
through
the
main
doors
but
to
their
right
into
the
courtyard
containing
the
public
toilets
,
then
upstairs
.
</p>
<p>
The
municipality
staff
can
also
arrange
local
guides
(
S/30-50
per
day
)
and
horses
or
llamas
for
longer
treks
.
</p>
<head>

</head>
<p>
A
number
of
small
shops
line
the
plaza
selling
cookies
,
bread
,
cheese
,
fruits
and
vegetables
,
soft
drinks
,
etc.
</p>
<p>
There
are
two
restaurants
in
town
.
The
more
central
of
the
two
is
on
the
southwest
corner
of
the
plaza
(
in
the
shop
with
the
Trebol
Bus
company
sign
above
the
door
.
)
Two-course
breakfast
and
lunch
menus
are
available
at
the
appropriate
times
of
day
for
about
S/6
.
</p>
<p>
The
other
restaurant
is
open
for
breakfast
lunch
and
dinner
.
It
can
be
reached
by
heading
west
from
the
centre
of
the
plaza
past
the
Hostal
Trebol
.
It
is
about
300
m
from
the
plaza
,
just
after
the
road
makes
a
right
turn
.
</p>
<p>
A
shop
on
the
south
side
of
the
plaza
sells
very
good
fresh
yogurt
in
the
afternoons
.
Thicker
and
less
sweetened
than
the
drinking
yogurt
that
is
popular
elsewhere
in
Peru
(
S/1
per
glass
)
.
The
same
shop
sells
fried
snacks
and
sandwiches
in
the
evening
.

It
can
be
difficult
to
rouse
hotel
owners
when
the
bus
from
Arequipa
arrives
at
02:30
,
so
it
may
be
necessary
to
spend
a
few
hours
waiting
in
the
plaza
until
morning
.
It
's
entirely
safe
,
but
can
be
quite
cold
at
night
,
so
be
sure
to
have
warm
clothes
handy
when
you
arrive
