Brown
says
that
the
conference
on
Thursday
will
outline
projections
on
forces
and
training
for
Afghan
soldiers

military
police
,
with
the
ultimate
objective
of
British
forces
leaving
as
soon
as
the
Afghan
forces
are
able
to
provide
their
own
security
.
He
said
that
&quot;
[
t]he
London

attended
by
President
Karzai
,
the
U.N.
Secretary
General
Ban
,

forces
and
for
Afghan
forces
in
the
time

we
will
be
focusing
on
how
the
political
and
civilian
surge
that
we
plan
in

can
match
and
compliment
the
military
surge
that
is
taking
place

,
the
head
of
the
NATO
forces
in
Afghanistan
,
also
believes
that
an
increase
in
troop
levels
could
result
in
the
negotiation
of
peace
with
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Taliban">

he

newspaper

Brown
was
asked
directly
whether
he
believed
the
same
,
and
responded
&quot;
Now
if
at
the
same
time
,
we
can
bring
over
from
those
people
who
were
previously
associated
with
the
Taliban
or
with
groups
that
were
taking
action
against
the
coalition
forces
,
by
them
renouncing
violence
and
agreeing
to
join
the
democratic
process
,
then
that
is
of
value
to
the
peace
process
.
&quot;
It
is
expected
that
this
year
Afghanistan
will
be
host
to
134,000
soldiers
and
90,000
police
.
Brown
also
responded
to
recent
promises
of
3,000
additional
US
troops
and
500
additional
British
soldiers
by
saying
&quot;
I
believe
that
both
for
(
international
)
trainers
(
for
Afghan
forces
)
and
for
forces
generally
there
are
still
some
announcements
to
be
made
.

anything

Brown
says
that
he
expects
Afghan
president
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamid%20Karzai">
Hamid
Karzai
</ref>
to
announce
new
security
measures
and
initiatives
regarding
corruption
in
his
government
.
He
said
that
&quot;
President
Karzai
and
his
ministers
,
with
the
addition
of
the
armed
forces
and
the
police
have
got
to
show
that
they
can
take
security
control
of
their
country
.
That
is
what
our
aim
is
and
therefore
anything
that
suggests
that
the
government
of
Afghanistan
cannot
deal
with
its
corruption
problems
is
something
that
we
must
be
worried
about
.
&quot;
A
number
of
delegates
—
including
US
secretart
of
state
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilary%20Clinton">
Hilary
Clinton

—
are
expected
to
press
Karzai
to
focus
on
security
in
his
nation
.
The
conference
was
called
after
last
year
's
Afghanistan
elections
,
which
saw
many
accusations
of
corruption
,
with
the
focus
of
how
NATO
forces
can
ensure
a
smooth
transition
of
power
to
local
forces
.
</p>
<p>
One
day
before
the
Afghan
meeting
,
the
conference
will
meet
to
discuss
the
situation
in
Yemen
.
Gordon
Brown
says
the
international
delegates
will
discuss
how
they
can
&quot;
strengthen
support
for
Yemen
in
its
efforts
against
al-Qaida
and
...
help
the
government
of
Yemen
with
development
and
governance
.
&quot;
He
says
that
Britain
will
make
every
effort
to
counter
threats
made
by
extremists
.
