Women

</head>
<p>
When
Judith
Drake
and
the
other
intellectuals
of
her
circle
began
writing
,
they
were
still
a
minority
and
subject
to
much
nay
saying
.
Recently
there
had
been
a
loosening
of
censorship
of
printed
books
.
A
few
women
took
this
opportunity
to
publish
on
gender
relationships
.
Because
of
their
efforts
as
well
as
the
rise
in
female
literacy
,
the
literary
world
entered
into
the
debate
about
women
.

by

and
E[lizabeth

Wilkinson
in
1696
,
the
author
was
listed
only
as
&quot;
a
Lady
.
&quot;
For
many
years
,
the
work
was
attributed
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Astell">

a

other

However
,
authorship
is
now
decidedly
attributed
to
Drake
.
Her
name
is
listed
in
a
Curll
catalogue
issued
after
1741
as
the
author
,
and
the
second
edition
of
the

included
a
poem
dedicated
to
the
author
by
James

<p>
The
<hi rend="italic">
Essay
</hi>
is
written
in
the
form
of
a
letter
to
a
female
friend
.
It
purports
to
be
inspired
by
a
conversation
between
several
gentlemen
and
ladies
.
Drake
first
constructed
the
rationalist
framework
used
at
that
time
to
explain
women
's
intellectual
inferiority
,
especially
using
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Locke">
John
Locke
</ref>
'
s
<hi rend="italic">
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Essay_Concerning_Human_Understanding">
An
Essay
Concerning
Human
Understanding
</ref>
.
</hi>
She
then
proceeded
to
show
that
this
rationale
was
outdated
,
and
in
this
modern
time
,
women
would
benefit
from
a
greater
knowledge
.
Only
two
works
using
this
kind
of
rationalist
argument
had
been
used
for
a
feminist
argument
before
,
and
only
one
of
those
was
written
in
English
.
Besides
her
rational
arguments
,
Drake
also
wrote
sketches
of
various
stereotypes
among
men
:
the
Pedant
,
the
Country
Squire
,
the
News-monger
,
the
Bully
,
the
City-Critick
,
and
the
Beau
.
She
uses
these
pictures
to
remind
her
readers
that
men
,
also
,
had
follies
.

<p>
Drake
's
final
argument
involves
the
&quot;
new
science
&quot;
of
the
day
.
She
spoke
with
physicians
,
who
told
her
from
their
studies
of
anatomy
and
the
workings
of
the
human
body
that
there
was
no
physical
difference
between
men
and
women
in
any
part
of
the
body
that
related
to
or
influenced
the
mind
.
Drake
also
gave
the
example
from
nature
of
male
and
female
animals
that
showed
equal
wisdom
in
their
actions
.
From
studying
the
differences
of
behaviour
between
classes
,
she
added
that
socioeconomic
level
was
more
likely
to
make
a
difference
in
intelligence
between
two
people
than
was
gender
.
A
man
and
a
woman
from
the
same
background
are
more
similar
in
ability
than
two
men
,
one
a
wealthy
gentleman
and
the
other
a
poor
farmer
.
From
her
conclusions
about
the
capacity
of
the
female
intellect
,
Drake
suggests
that
maybe
women
were
created
the
weaker
vessel
because
they
are
meant
to
think
,
while
stronger
men
are
meant
for
action
.
Why
could
women
not
do
such
jobs
as
accounting
,
that
involved
mental
capacity
and
not
physical
labour
?

With
her
combination
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tory">
Tory
</ref>
ideas
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Locke">
Lockean
</ref>
philosophy
,
Drake
formed
an
early
Enlightenment
vision
of
social
roles
in
which
women
could
be
of
help
in
settling
the
uncertain
society
of
the
day
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-8">

</ref>
</p>
<p>
Many
of
Drake
’s
thoughts
are
similar
to
other
feminist
writers
of
her
time
.
For
example
,
Drake
says
in
the
<hi rend="italic">
Essay
</hi>
,
&quot;
Women
,
like
our
Negroes
in
our
western
plantations
,
are
born
slaves
,
and
live
prisoners
all
their
lives
,
&quot;
a
sentiment
that
was
later
echoed
by
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Astell">
Astell
</ref>
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Mary_Chudleigh">
Chudleigh
</ref>
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-9">

Within
a
marriage
,
a
woman
’s
role
was
often
little
more
than
a
servant
to
her
husband
and
his
interests
.
Overall
,
her
work
joins
women
’s
primary
concern
of
the
time
:
education
.

<p>
Drake
was
attacked
by

,
and

.
No
other
works
by
Drake
are
known
to
survive
;
however
,
it
is
possible
that
she
might
have
published
,
as
many
women
did
,
under
other
pseudonyms
.
