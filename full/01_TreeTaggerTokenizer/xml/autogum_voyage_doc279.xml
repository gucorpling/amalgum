2015
,

flies
to
Berau
from
Jakarta
directly
.
Starting
on
June
8
,
2015
,
Kalstar
will
also
fly
to
Berau
from
Jakarta
and

but
there
is
no
flight
from
Balikpapan
to
Derawan
.
Although
Tarakan
is
farther
from
Balikpapapan
than
Berau
,
with
a
bigger
airplane
,
a
ticket
from
Balikpapan
to
Tarakan
is
cheaper
than
one
to
Berau
.
There
are
direct
flights
from
<ref target="Jakarta">
Jakarta
</ref>
to
Tarakan
.
Direct
flights
from

to
Berau
are
the
least
time-consuming
option
with
only
2
hours
.
The
new
Maratua
Airport
does
not
have
scheduled
flights
yet
(
as

2017
)

go
to
Tarakan
,
you
must
continue
the
journey
with
3
-
4
hours
across
the
sea
by
speed
boat
.
To
charter
a
boat
costs
,
according
to
the
men
in
the
pier
,
3.000.000
IDR
per
boat
,
final
price
depends
on
how
many
people
are
joining
.
From
the
pier
Pelabuhan
Tegkayu
there
is
a
boat
departing
on
Thursdays
to
Derawan
and
returning
on
Sundays
operated
by
the
agency

Jaya
for

you
want
to
go

km

and
then
a

boat
to

.
It
is
a
long
and
hard

costs
350.000
IDR
each
dive
(
1.050.000

but
if
you
want
to

These
prices
do
n't
include

You

but
not
so
salty
as

.
The

has
4
kinds
