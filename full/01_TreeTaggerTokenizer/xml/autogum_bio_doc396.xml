Life
</head>
<p>
Little
is
known
about
his
life
.
He
was
likely
trained
in
Mechelen
and
was
later
a
pupil
or
assistant
in
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antwerp">
Antwerp
</ref>
workshop
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornelis_Floris_de_Vriendt">
Cornelis
Floris
de
Vriendt
</ref>
whose
work
was
particularly
popular
in
Northern
Europe
.
He
was
part
of
a
group
of
pupils
and
assistants
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornelis_Floris">
Cornelis
Floris
</ref>
,
who
moved
to
countries
situated
on
the
Baltic
Sea
to
take
advantage
of
Floris
’
network
and
the
international
popularity
of
the
Floris
style
.
The
Baltic
region
was
at
the
time
politically
relatively
stable
when
compared
to
van
Egen
's
native
home
,
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Netherlands">
Spanish
Netherlands
</ref>
,
which
were
rife
with
religious
persecution
.
There
was
also
less
competition
from
other
artists
in
these
countries
.

He
was
employed
,
together
with
his
brother
Peter
,
in
Denmark
at
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronborg_Castle">
Kronborg
Castle
</ref>
from
1578
to
1585
.
The
principal
architects
of
Kronborg
Castle
were
his
fellow
Flemings
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Hendrik_van_Paesschen">
Hans
Hendrik
van
Paesschen
</ref>
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthonis_van_Obbergen">

,
whereas
the
sculptural

Dutchman
</ref>
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gert_van_Groningen">

</ref>
.
At
this
time
king
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_II_of_Denmark">
Frederick
II
of
Denmark
</ref>
had
the
medieval
fortress
radically
transformed
into
a
magnificent
Renaissance

.
Van
Egen
was
one
of
the
best
paid
sculptors
,
indicating
that
he
had
important
responsibilities
in
the
decoration
of
Kronborg
,
although
there
are
no
records
as
to
what
these
were
.

Frederick
II
died
in
1588
and
a
year
later
Gert
van
Egen
was
commissioned
to
make
a
monumental
tomb
of
the
king
to
be
placed
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roskilde_Cathedral">

The
initiative
came
from
the

son

Christian

<p>
Van

remained
in

employ
of

court
for
the
rest
of
his
life

raised

Work
</head>
<p>
Unlike
some
of
his
fellow
Flemings
working
in
the
Baltic
,
van
Egen
not
only
worked
on
large
monuments
,
but
he
also
produced
small-scale
works
.

Monuments
</head>
<p>
The
major
documented
monumental
work
that
he
worked
on
was
the
tomb
for
Frederick
II
in
Roskilde
Cathedral
.
The
instructions
for
the
design
of
the
tomb
were
that
it
should
form
a
unity
with
the
tomb
of
king
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_III">
Christian
III
</ref>
,
designed
by
Floris
,
that
was
already
placed
in
the
Cathedral
.
It
has
been
suggested
that
the
design
for
the
tomb
was
by
the
hand
of
the
sculptor
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Gregor_van_der_Schardt">
Johan
Gregor
van
der
Schardt
</ref>
who
was
at
the
time
probably
working
in
Denmark
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-sch-4">

</ref>
Of
particular
interest
are
the
reliefs
on
the
sides
of
the
monument
.
They
depict
scenes
from
the
king
's
campaign
against
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dithmarschen">
Dithmarschen
</ref>
in
1559
and
from
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Seven_Years'_War">
Northern
Seven
Years
'
War
</ref>
that
lasted
from
1563
to
1570
.
One
scene
shows
the
siege
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akershus_Fortress">
Akershus
Fortress
</ref>
in
Oslo
of

Van
Egen

technique
in
the
details

this
work
.

The
figure

the

is
also
sculpted
with
precision
.

Small-scale
work
</head>
<p>
In
addition
to
the
large-scale
tomb
of
Frederick
II
,
it
is
recorded
that
in
1600
van
Egen
delivered
to
Christian
IV
a
closet
with
alabaster
pieces
.
Probably
he
has
also
made
some
small
portrait
reliefs
of
Frederick
II
now
at
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenborg_Castle">
Rosenborg
</ref>
and
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalmuseum">
Nationalmuseum
</ref>
in
Stockholm
and
a
few
similar
alabaster
works
of
Danish
noblemen
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-de-5">
[

</ref>
Of
the
small-scale
works
four
are
still
known
to
be
extant
.
There
are
two
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabaster">
alabaster
</ref>
statuettes
both
signed
with
his
initials
:
GE
.
One
represents
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith">

holding
the
head
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holofernes">

and
is
now
in
a
private
collection
in
New

.
The
other
representing
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(mythology)">

is
in
the
collection
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum">

City
.

These
pieces
demonstrate
that
Van
Egen
likely
received
his
training
primarily
in
Mechelen
,
the
center
of
alabaster
small-scale
sculpture
.
