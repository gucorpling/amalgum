Introduction
</head>
<p>
Due
to
industrial
development
and
the
improved
quality
of
human
life
,
the
economic
and
social
demand
for
energy
is
growing
.
In
recent
years
,
the
problems
arising
from
the
use
of
coal
,
petroleum
,
and
other
energy
resources
with
high
carbon
content
are
becoming
almost
unbearable
.
The
trend
of
annual
average
of
atmospheric
CO2
concentration
has
been
increasing
non-stop
in
the
last
decades
.
The
global
average
surface
temperature
was
reported
to
be
approximately
1
°C
higher
than
that
of
the
preindustrial
period
.
The
transition
to
an
energy
system
that
relies
primarily
on
renewable
energy
sources
has
become
one
of
the
greatest
challenges
for
alleviating
climate
change
.
Clean
energy
sources
such
as
wind
,
solar
,
geothermal
,
biomass
,
biofuels
,
waves
,
tidal
,
and
hydropower
can
replace
fossil
fuels
.
With
that
in
mind
,
water
value
is
due
not
only
to
its
agricultural
and
domestic
use
,
but
also
to
the
possibility
of
being
a
source
of
energy
,
such
as
hydropower
,
ocean
energy
,
or
the
energy
obtained
from
its
distribution
network
,
for
instance
.
</p>
<p>
In
this
context
,
collecting
small
amounts
of
energy
from
the
ambient
in
order
to
supply
power
to
wireless
devices
has
been
investigated
for
the
last
decades
.
Moreover
,
in
some
cases
where
batteries
are
impractical
,
such
as
inaccessible
remote
systems
,
health
monitoring
,
or
body
sensors
,
energy
harvesting
technology
is
very
promising
.
In
fact
,
the
power
supply
is
one
of
the
biggest
challenges
regarding
the
wireless
sensor
network
applications
.
Frequently
,
the
lifetime
is
confined
to
a
battery
supply
,
which
is
awkward
.
Several
environmental
resources
that
offer
enough
power
can
be
studied
such
as
vibration
,
solar
irradiation
,
thermal
differences
,
and
hybrid
energy
sources
.
Vibration
energy
harvesting
(
VeH
)
transforms
mechanical
energy
obtained
from
ambient
sources
to
electricity
in
order
to
power
remote
sensors
.
VeH
technologies
have
been
widely
studied
over
the
past
decade
.
Izadgoshasb
et
al.
proposed
a
new
double
pendulum-based
piezoelectric
system
to
harvest
energy
from
human
movements
.
They
found
a
high
increase
in
maximum
output
voltage
in
comparison
to
the
conventional
system
and
to
an
analogous
system
with
only
one
pendulum
.
Furthermore
,
they
stated
that
the
double
pendulum
design
could
be
further
improved
by
varying
some
design
parameters
regarding
dimensions
or
material
.
In
a
more
recent
work
,
Izadgoshasb
et
al.
proposed
a
multi-resonant
harvester
that
consists
of
a
cantilever
beam
with
two
triangular
branches
.
They
performed
a
parametric
study
using
the
finite
element
method
(
FEM
)
for
the
design
optimization
in
order
to
get
close
resonances
at
low-frequency
spectrum
.
Experimental
results
showed
that
the
proposed
harvester
can
harvest
broadband
energy
from
ambient
vibration
sources
and
is
better
than
analogous
piezoelectric
energy
harvesters
with
cantilever
beams
.
</p>
<p>
Energy
harvesting
from
flow-induced
vibrations
has
also
attracted
attention
in
the
past
years
,
and
energy
obtained
from
fluid
–
structure
interaction
(
FSI
)
in
different
fluids
,
air
,
or
liquid
have
been
investigated
by
Elahi
et
al.
.
Under
flow
loads
,
a
structure
can
suffer
different
effects
,
such
as
limit
cycle
oscillations
,
chaotic
movements
,
or
internal
resonances
.
From
the
point
of
view
of
aerodynamics
,
vortex-induced
vibrations
or
vibrations
caused
by
flutter
or
galloping
can
occur
.
Using
piezoelectric
devices
placed
in
a
flow
field
can
convert
large
oscillations
into
electrical
energy
.
An
airfoil
section
placed
on
the
end
of
cantilever
piezoelectric
beam
can
be
used
as
a
flutter
energy
harvester
.
Flutter
speed
is
a
critical
value
,
from
which
the
aerodynamic
system
becomes
unstable
.
The
self-excited
oscillations
that
appear
on
the
aeroelastic
system
once
the
critical
value
is
overpassed
are
quite
beneficial
from
the
dynamic
point
of
view
;
see
Abdelkefi
et
al.
.
Elahi
et
al.
modeled
a
nonlinear
piezoelectric
aeroelastic
energy
harvester
that
works
on
a
postcritical
aerolastic
regime
.
An
analytical
model
was
developed
taking
into
account
the
fluid
–
structure
interaction
and
electromechanical
performance
.
They
concluded
that
higher
electromechanical
factor
gives
better
harvesting
.
Wang
et
al.
conducted
a
study
on
a
galloping-based
piezoelectric
energy
harvester
using
isosceles
triangle
sectioned
bluff
bodies
and
applying
computational
fluid
dynamics
(
CFD
)
to
simulate
the
aerodynamic
forces
.
They
performed
a
parametric
study
in
order
to
get
the
optimum
vertex
angle
of
the
triangle
and
provided
a
guideline
for
efficient
design
.
They
determined
that
an
angle
of
130
degrees
was
the
most
adequate
within
the
specific
electromechanical
coupling
of
their
prototype
.
Dai
et
al.
investigated
energy
harvesting
obtained
from
wind
flow-induced
vibrations
.
They
compared
experimentally
four
different
test
cases
of
piezoelectric
energy
harvesters
,
and
based
on
the
results
they
concluded
which
was
the
best
orientation
of
the
bluff
body
to
design
efficient
devices
.
Jia
et
al.
presented
an
upright
piezoelectric
energy
harvester
(
UPEH
)
that
has
a
cylinder
extension
along
its
length
.
In
the
case
with
low
speed
wind
,
energy
is
obtained
by
vortex-induced
vibrations
(
VIVs
)
that
produce
bending
deformation
.
The
UPEH
can
generate
energy
from
low-speed
wind
by
bending
deformation
produced
by
vortex-induced
vibrations
(
VIVs
)
.
Zulueta
et
al.
developed
a
new
control
law
for
a
contactless
piezoelectric
wind
energy
harvester
,
and
afterwards
,
Bouzelata
et
al.
improved
this
wind
energy
harvester
as
a
battery
charger
The
simulation
results
proved
that
the
device
could
power
the
battery
when
the
wind
speed
is
v
=
2.7
m/s
,
taking
into
account
that
usually
the
moderate
wind
speed
is
considered
to
be
4
m/s
.
