THE
NEST
OF
THE
MISSEL
THRUSH
</head>
<p>
For
two
or
three
minutes
he
stood
looking
round
him
,
while
Mary
watched
him
,
and
then
he
began
to
walk
about
softly
,
even
more
lightly
than
Mary
had
walked
the
first
time
she
had
found
herself
inside
the
four
walls
.
His
eyes
seemed
to
be
taking
in
everything
—
the
gray
trees
with
the
gray
creepers
climbing
over
them
and
hanging
from
their
branches
,
the
tangle
on
the
walls
and
among
the
grass
,
the
evergreen
alcoves
with
the
stone
seats
and
tall
flower
urns
standing
in
them
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
never
thought
I
’d
see
this
place
,
”
he
said
at
last
,
in
a
whisper
.
</p>
<p>
“
Did
you
know
about
it
?
”
asked
Mary
.
</p>
<p>
She
had
spoken
aloud
and
he
made
a
sign
to
her
.
</p>
<p>
“
We
must
talk
low
,
”
he
said
,
“
or
someone
’ll
hear
us
an
’
wonder
what
’s
to
do
in
here
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Oh
!
I
forgot
!
”
said
Mary
,
feeling
frightened
and
putting
her
hand
quickly
against
her
mouth
.
“
Did
you
know
about
the
garden
?
”
she
asked
again
when
she
had
recovered
herself
.
</p>
<p>
Dickon
nodded
.
</p>
<p>
“
Martha
told
me
there
was
one
as
no
one
ever
went
inside
,
”
he
answered
.
“
Us
used
to
wonder
what
it
was
like
.
”
</p>
<p>
He
stopped
and
looked
round
at
the
lovely
gray
tangle
about
him
,
and
his
round
eyes
looked
queerly
happy
.
</p>
<p>
“
Eh
!
the
nests
as
’ll
be
here
come
springtime
,
”
he
said
.
“
It
’d
be
th
’
safest
nestin
’
place
in
England
.
No
one
never
comin
’
near
an
’
tangles
o
’
trees
an
’
roses
to
build
in
.
I
wonder
all
th
’
birds
on
th
’
moor
do
n’t
build
here
.
”
</p>
<p>
Mistress
Mary
put
her
hand
on
his
arm
again
without
knowing
it
.
</p>
<p>
“
Will
there
be
roses
?
”
she
whispered
.
“
Can
you
tell
?
I
thought
perhaps
they
were
all
dead
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Eh
!
No
!
Not
them
—
not
all
of
’
em
!
”
he
answered
.
“
Look
here
!
”
</p>
<p>
He
stepped
over
to
the
nearest
tree
—
an
old
,
old
one
with
gray
lichen
all
over
its
bark
,
but
upholding
a
curtain
of
tangled
sprays
and
branches
.
He
took
a
thick
knife
out
of
his
pocket
and
opened
one
of
its
blades
.
</p>
<p>
“
There
’s
lots
o
’
dead
wood
as
ought
to
be
cut
out
,
”
he
said
.
“
An
’
there
’s
a
lot
o
’
old
wood
,
but
it
made
some
new
last
year
.
This
here
’s
a
new
bit
,
”
and
he
touched
a
shoot
which
looked
brownish
green
instead
of
hard
,
dry
gray
.
</p>
<p>
Mary
touched
it
herself
in
an
eager
,
reverent
way
.
</p>
<p>
“
That
one
?
”
she
said
.
“
Is
that
one
quite
alive
quite
?
”
</p>
<p>
Dickon
curved
his
wide
smiling
mouth
.
</p>
<p>
“
It
’s
as
wick
as
you
or
me
,
”
he
said
;
and
Mary
remembered
that
Martha
had
told
her
that
“
wick
”
meant
“
alive
”
or
“
lively
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
’m
glad
it
’s
wick
!
”
she
cried
out
in
her
whisper
.
“
I
want
them
all
to
be
wick
.
Let
us
go
round
the
garden
and
count
how
many
wick
ones
there
are
.
”
</p>
<p>
She
quite
panted
with
eagerness
,
and
Dickon
was
as
eager
as
she
was
.
They
went
from
tree
to
tree
and
from
bush
to
bush
.
Dickon
carried
his
knife
in
his
hand
and
showed
her
things
which
she
thought
wonderful
.
</p>
<p>
“
They
’ve
run
wild
,
”
he
said
,
“
but
th
’
strongest
ones
has
fair
thrived
on
it
.
The
delicatest
ones
has
died
out
,
but
th
’
others
has
growed
an
’
growed
,
an
’
spread
an
’
spread
,
till
they
’s
a
wonder
.
See
here
!
”
and
he
pulled
down
a
thick
gray
,
dry-looking
branch
.
“
A
body
might
think
this
was
dead
wood
,
but
I
do
n’t
believe
it
is
—
down
to
th
’
root
.
I
’ll
cut
it
low
down
an
’
see
.
”
</p>
<p>
He
knelt
and
with
his
knife
cut
the
lifeless-looking
branch
through
,
not
far
above
the
earth
.
</p>
<p>
“
There
!
”
he
said
exultantly
.
“
I
told
thee
so
.
There
’s
green
in
that
wood
yet
.
Look
at
it
.
”
</p>
<p>
Mary
was
down
on
her
knees
before
he
spoke
,
gazing
with
all
her
might
.
</p>
<p>
“
When
it
looks
a
bit
greenish
an
’
juicy
like
that
,
it
’s
wick
,
”
he
explained
.
“
When
th
’
inside
is
dry
an
’
breaks
easy
,
like
this
here
piece
I
’ve
cut
off
,
it
’s
done
for
.
There
’s
a
big
root
here
as
all
this
live
wood
sprung
out
of
,
an
’
if
th
’
old
wood
’s
cut
off
an
’
it
’s
dug
round
,
and
took
care
of
there
’ll
be
—
”
he
stopped
and
lifted
his
face
to
look
up
at
the
climbing
and
hanging
sprays
above
him
—
“
there
’ll
be
a
fountain
o
’
roses
here
this
summer
.
”
</p>
<p>
They
went
from
bush
to
bush
and
from
tree
to
tree
.
He
was
very
strong
and
clever
with
his
knife
and
knew
how
to
cut
the
dry
and
dead
wood
away
,
and
could
tell
when
an
unpromising
bough
or
twig
had
still
green
life
in
it
.
In
the
course
of
half
an
hour
Mary
thought
she
could
tell
too
,
and
when
he
cut
through
a
lifeless-looking
branch
she
would
cry
out
joyfully
under
her
breath
when
she
caught
sight
of
the
least
shade
of
moist
green
.
The
spade
,
and
hoe
,
and
fork
were
very
useful
.
He
showed
her
how
to
use
the
fork
while
he
dug
about
roots
with
the
spade
and
stirred
the
earth
and
let
the
air
in
.
</p>
<p>
They
were
working
industriously
round
one
of
the
biggest
standard
roses
when
he
caught
sight
of
something
which
made
him
utter
an
exclamation
of
surprise
.
</p>
<p>
“
Why
!
”
he
cried
,
pointing
to
the
grass
a
few
feet
away
.
“
Who
did
that
there
?
”
</p>
<p>
It
was
one
of
Mary
’s
own
little
clearings
round
the
pale
green
points
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
did
it
,
”
said
Mary
.
</p>
<p>
“
Why
,
I
thought
tha
’
did
n’t
know
nothin
’
about
gardenin
’
,
”
he
exclaimed
.
