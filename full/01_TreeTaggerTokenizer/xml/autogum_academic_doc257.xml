Introduction
</head>
<p>
Along
with
the
booming
of
mobile
applications
and
the
Internet
of
Things
(
IoT
)
,
a
momentously
increasing
number
of
mobile
devices
and
applications
are
widely
used
at
the
network
edge
.
Based
on
a
report
from
Cisco
,
it
is
predicted
that
around
850
ZB
data
will
be
generated
at
the
network
edge
by
2021
,
which
significantly
exceeds
the
traffic
in
global
data
centers
.
Besides
handling
tremendous
data
,
popular
mobile
applications
and
services
,
e.
g.
,
video
surveillance
,
interactive
gaming
,
and
voice
assistants
,
require
intensive
computational
resources
.
In
particular
,
with
the
proliferation
of
artificial
intelligence
(
AI
)
supported
smart
applications
,
mobile
and
IoT
devices
face
big
challenges
due
to
their
limited
computational
capacities
,
as
well
as
constrained
power
.
</p>
<p>
One
of
the
conventional
ways
to
deal
with
this
issue
is
to
offload
the
computation-intensive
work
and
service
data
from
mobile
devices
to
remote
cloud
data
centers
.
However
,
moving
from
the
network
edge
to
remote
cloud
data
centers
via
wide
area
networks
(
WAN
)
results
in
prohibitively
high
transmission
latency
and
monetary
cost
,
which
is
nontrivial
especially
for
latency-sensitive
applications
.
Another
major
concern
of
processing
data
on
remote
clouds
is
the
privacy
leakage
issue
.
</p>
<p>
To
fulfill
the
requirements
of
latency-sensitive
and
resource-intensive
applications
,
the
novel
paradigm
Multi-access
Edge
Computing
(
MEC
)
is
proposed
and
promptly
ascends
to
the
spotlight
.
By
pushing
computation
tasks
and
data
to
small-sized
cloudlets
near
mobile
users
,
MEC
reduces
the
transmission
delay
,
alleviates
the
congestion
in
the
network
core
,
and
saves
the
communication
cost
compared
with
remote
cloud
data
centers
.
As
an
essential
component
in
the
MEC
paradigm
,
a
cloudlet
,
which
consists
of
trusted
computers
with
rich
resources
,
serves
the
last
mile
of
the
Internet
as
a
complement
to
centralized
remote
clouds
.
</p>
<p>
Despite
the
benefits
of
sinking
the
data
and
computation
to
the
network
edge
,
new
concerns
on
the
placement
and
capacity
planning
of
cloudlets
have
risen
.
It
is
not
a
trivial
problem
to
balance
the
service
performance
and
the
infrastructure
providers
’
(
ISP
)
costs
while
additionally
considering
user
mobility
,
cloudlets
’
coverage
,
and
the
large
scale
of
Wireless
Metropolitan
Area
Network
(
WMAN
)
.
Specifically
,
deploying
more
cloudlets
closer
to
mobile
users
could
reduce
transmission
delay
and
communication
costs
.
However
,
this
will
definitely
add
more
costs
of
purchasing
and
operating
physical
servers
.
Furthermore
,
to
cope
with
user
mobility
,
service
migration
has
to
be
performed
when
a
mobile
user
moves
from
the
service
region
of
one
cloudlet
to
another
.
Service
migration
ensures
that
users
could
seamlessly
access
network
services
,
yet
it
poses
additional
migration
costs
and
may
suffer
from
handover
failure
.
Therefore
,
to
deploy
latency-sensitive
and
resource-intensive
mobile
services
at
network
edge
,
one
of
the
vital
yet
essential
issues
is
to
plan
the
cloudlets
,
including
where
to
permanently
place
the
cloudlets
,
what
is
the
service
region
of
each
cloudlet
,
and
how
many
physical
resources
should
be
assigned
to
each
cloudlet
considering
the
ISPs
’
cost
and
performance
requirements
by
mobile
users
.
<figure>
Figure
1
</figure>
demonstrates
an
example
of
a
cloudlet
planning
in
a
WMAN
with
multiple
access
point
(
AP
)
cells
.
As
shown
in
<figure>
Figure
1
</figure>
,
each
AP
is
covered
by
exactly
one
cloudlet
and
each
cloudlet
is
co-existed
with
one
AP
in
its
service
region
.
</p>
<p>
However
,
most
existing
studies
are
limited
to
improving
the
Quality
of
Service
(
QoS
)
of
mobile
applications
or
services
by
properly
offloading
tasks
to
physically
deployed
cloudlets
,
e.
g.
,
.
These
studies
focus
on
how
the
tasks
or
virtual
services
should
be
embedded
in
cloudlets
that
are
equipped
with
virtualization
techniques
.
Obviously
,
the
computational
resources
that
could
be
assigned
to
each
task
or
virtual
service
are
bounded
by
the
maximum
available
physical
resources
in
each
cloudlet
.
In
contrast
,
the
planning
of
each
cloudlet
’s
physical
location
,
capacity
,
and
service
region
coverage
has
been
ignored
.
</p>
<p>
In
our
previous
work
,
we
noticed
the
impact
of
the
cloudlet
planning
and
started
with
an
initial
step
of
carefully
partitioning
the
entire
WMAN
into
disjoint
service
regions
.
However
,
in
only
the
minimization
of
service
handover
costs
is
discussed
,
while
the
cloudlet
construction
costs
and
operation
costs
are
ignored
.
Therefore
,
in
the
proposed
solution
,
we
only
suggested
the
way
to
determine
the
service
regions
without
the
planning
of
cloudlets
’
physical
placement
and
capacities
.
