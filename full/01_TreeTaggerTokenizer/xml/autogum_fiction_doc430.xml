To

<p>
Mony
's
the

I
hae
ettled
to
send
ye
a
screed
,
but
there
was
aye
something
that
cam

i

It

for
aften
hae
I
thocht
o
'
ye
and
my
hairt
has
been
wi
'
ye
mony
's
the
day
.
There
's
no
'
muckle
fowk
frae
Ameriky
hereawa
;
they
're
a
'
jist
Fife
bodies
,
and
a
lass
canna
get
her
tongue
roun
'
their
thrapple-taxin
'
words
ava
'
,
so
it
's
like
I
may
een
drap
a
'
the
sweetness
o
'
my
good
mither-tongue
.
</p>
<p>
'
Tis
a
dulefu
'
nicht
,
and
an
awfu
'
blash
is

Fanny

'
at
the
gowff
rinnin
'
aboot
wi
'
a
bag
o
'
sticks
after
a
wee
bit
ba
'
,
and
Sally
and
I
are
hame
by
oor
lane
.
Laith
will
the
lassie
be
to
weet
her
bonny
shoon
,
but
lang
ere
the
play
'll
be
ower
she
'll
wat
her
hat
aboon
.
A
gust
o
'
win
'
is
skirlin
'
the
noo
,
and
as
we
luik
ower
the
faem
,
the
haar
is
risin
'
,
weetin
'
the
green
swaird
wi
'
misty
shoo'rs
.

<p>
Yestreen
was
a
calm
simmer
gloamin
'
,
sae
sweet
an
'
bonnie
that
when
the
sun
was
sinkin
'
doon
ower
Pettybaw
Sands
we
daundered
ower
the
muir
.
As
we
cam
'
through
the
scented
birks
,
we
saw
a
trottin
'
burnie
wimplin
'
'
neath
the
white-blossomed
slaes
and
hirplin
'
doon
the
hillside
;
an
'
while
a
herd-laddie
lilted
ower
the
fernie
brae
,
a
cushat
cooed
leesomely
doon
i
'
the
dale
.
We
pit
aff
oor
shoon
,
sae
blithe
were
we
,
kilted
oor
coats
a
little
aboon
the
knee
,
and
paidilt
i
'
the
burn
,
gettin
'
geyan
weet
the
while
.
Then
Sally
pu
'd
the
gowans
wat
wi
'
dew
an
'
twined
her
bree
wi
'
tasselled
broom
,
while
I
had
a
wee
crackie
wi
'
Tibby
Buchan
,
the
flesher
's
dochter
frae
Auld
Reekie
.
Tibby
's
nae
giglet
gawky
like
the
lave
,
ye

--
she
's
a
sonsie
maid
,
as

as

,
wi
'
her
twa

'
her
cockernony
snooded
up

an

after

<p>
Late
at

,
Fanny
,
the
bonny
gypsy
,
cam
'
ben
the
hoose
an
'
tirled
at
the
pin
of
oor
bigly
bower
door
,
speirin
'
for
baps
and
bannocks
.
</p>
<p>
“
Hoots

”
cried
oot
Sally
,
“

'
auld

”
</p>
<p>
“
Oo

said
Fanny
,
strikin
'
her
curly
pow
,
“
then

an

”
</p>
<p>
“
Losh

”
said
I
,
“

Ye

.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Blethers
an
'
havers
!
”
cried
Fanny
,
but
she
blinkit
bonnily
the
while
,
an
'
when
the
tea
was
weel
maskit
,
she
smoored
her
wrath
an
'
stappit
her
mooth
wi
'
a
bit
o
'
oaten
cake
.
We
aye
keep
that
i
'
the
hoose
,
for
th
'
auld
servant-body
is
geyan
bad
at
the
cookin

,
an
'
she
's
sae
dour
an
'
dowie
that
to
speak
but
till
her
we
daur
hardly
mint
.
</p>
<p>
In
sic
divairsions
pass
the
lang
simmer
days
in
braid
Scotland
,
but
I
canna
write
mair
the
nicht
,
for

tis
the
wee
sma
'

.
</p>
<p>
Like
th
'
auld
wife
's
parrot
,
'
we
dinna
speak
muckle
,
but
we
're
deevils
to
think
,
'
an
'
we
're
aye
thinkin
'
aboot
ye
.
An
'
noo
I
maun
leave
ye
to
mak
'
what
ye
can
oot
o
'
this
,
for
I
jalouse
it
'll
pass

the

hypothec
.

<p>
Fair

Aye

<p>
Penelope
Hamilton
.
</p>
<p>
“
It
may
be
very
fine
,
”
remarked
Salemina
judicially
,
“
though
I
cannot
understand
more
than
half
of
it
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
That
would
also
be
true
of
Browning
,
”
I
replied
.
“
Do
n't
you
love
to
see
great
ideas
looming
through
a
mist
of
words
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
The
words
are
misty
enough
in
this
case
,
”
she
said
,
“
and
I
do
wish
you
would
not
tell
the
world
that
I
paddle
in
the
burn
,
or
'
twine
my
bree
wi
'
tasselled
broom
.
'
I
'm
too
old
to
be
made
ridiculous
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Nobody
will
believe
it
,
”
said
Francesca
,
appearing
in
the
doorway
.
“
They
will
know
it
is
only
Penelope
's
havering
,
”
and
with
this
undeserved
scoff
,
she
took
her
mashie
and
went
golfing
--
not
on
the
links
,
on
this
occasion
,
but
in
our
microscopic
sitting-room
.
It
is
twelve
feet
square
,
and
holds
a
tiny
piano
,
desk
,
centre-table
,
sofa
,
and
chairs
,
but
the
spot
between
the
fire-place
and
the
table
is
Francesca
's
favourite
'
putting-green
.
'
She
wishes
to
become
more
deadly
in
the
matter
of
approaches
,
and
thinks
her
tee-shots
weak
;
so
these
two
deficiencies
she
is
trying
to
make
good
by
home
practice
in
inclement
weather
.
She
turns
a
tumbler
on
its
side
on
the
floor
,
and
'
putts
'
the
ball
into
it
,
or
at
it
,
as
the
case
may
be
,
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
.
It
is
excellent
discipline
,
and
as
the
tumblers
are
inexpensive
the
breakage
really
does
not
matter
.
Whenever
Miss
Grieve
hears
the
shivering
of
glass
,
she
murmurs
,
not
without
reason
,
'
It
is
not
for
the
knowing
what
they
will
be
doing
next
.
