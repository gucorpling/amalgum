Find
out
where
you
are
going
.
You
do
n't
want
to
go
to
the
grocery
store
in
your
favorite
Sunday
clothes
,
and
you
probably
would
n't
like
to
go
to
a
fancy
restaurant
in
your
PJ
's
.

Pick
out
an
outfit
.
First
,
choose
a
shirt
or
blouse
.
Then

pants
to

better
.

Accessorize
!
Jewelry
is
very
important
to
the
entire
appearance
,
since
it
ties
the
whole
outfit
together
and
adds
a
focal
point
.
Also
,
you
should
make
sure
that
if
you
are
going
to
carry
a
handbag
or
purse
,
be
sure
that
it
does
not
contrast
too
much
.
With
shoes
,
be
sure
that
they
are
comfortable
and
will
not
attract
too
much
attention
.

Apply
makeup
right
before
leaving
.
Do
n't
put
on
too
much-
you
should
n't
want
to
appear
fake
.
You
do
n't
want
it
to
look
like
you
have
makeup
on
.
Less
is
best
sometimes
especially
when
you
are
older
and
start
to
have
some
wrinkles
.

Smile
and
be
kind
.
A
person
is
only
as
good
as
her
personality
,
and
you
do
n't
want
people
to
think
that
you
are
sour
or
unkind
.

some
style
websites
and
see
what
the
different
age
groups
are
wearing
.
Copy
it
or
as
close
as
you
can
.
Like
what
you
wear
and
be
comfortable
in
your
cloths
.

yourself
nicely
wherever

go

People
notice
if

take
care
of

be
more
open
to
meeting
and
talking
to
you
