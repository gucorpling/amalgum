Introduction

<p>
The
amide
bonds
existing
in
a
large
number
of
structures
and
forming
the
backbone
of
the
biologically
essential
proteins
are
the
most
basic
building
blocks
of
chemistry
in
nature
.
The
amide
is
also
essential
due
to
its
role
in
the
peptide
bonds
in
pharmaceuticals
,
proteins
,
and
natural
products
.
Amide
bonds
are
characteristically
synthesized
by
combining
carboxylic
acids
and
amines
;
however
,
the
association
of
these
two
functional
groups
does
not
occur
at
room
temperature
.
Over
the
past
decades
,
many
researchers
have
proposed
alternative
synthesis
methods
,
such
as
the
Staudinger
reaction
,
direct
amidation
of
aldehydes
,
transition-metal-catalyzed
aminocarbonylation
,
and
hydrating
coupling
of
alkynes
with
azides
,
esters
,
alcohols
,
and
alkynes
with
amines
.
Pyridyl
benzamides
are
one
of
the
most
critical
types
of
N-heterocyclic
amides
and
play
an
essential
role
in
the
composition
of
many
important
medicines
(
e.
g.
,
antiulcer
agents
,
kinetoplastid
inhibitors
,
antifungal
agents
,
and
luciferase
inhibitors
)
.
Lately
,
the
number
of
methods
for
the
synthesis
of
pyridyl
benzamides
has
been
rising
significantly
.
Typical
examples
include
the
Cu-catalyzed
oxidation
of
methyl
ketones
,
Cu-catalyzed
oxidative
coupling
of
2-aminopyridines
and
terminal
alkynes
with
visible
light
mediation
,
and
the
direct
oxidative
amidation
reaction
of
aldehydes
with
amines
.
Since
N-heterocyclic
amides
are
increasingly
being
used
in
medicine
,
the
discovery
of
a
more
effective
approach
to
synthesize
pyridyl
benzamides
is
of
great
importance
in
the
medical
industry
and
has
thus
been
attempted
via
numerous
routes
.
Xiao-Lan
Xu
et
al.
synthesized
N-pyridinyl
benzamide
from
benzoylformic
acid
and
aniline
using
a
transition
metal
catalyst
,
AgOTf
.
Additionally
,
Leiling
Deng
et
al.
also
created
N-pyridinyl
benzamide
from
2-aminopyridine
and
phenylacetic
acid
in
the
presence
of
a
Cu
salt
catalyst
.
Very
recently
,
Zhengwang
Chen
et
al.
performed
a
reaction
to
synthesize
N-pyridinyl
benzamide
from
2-aminopyridine
and
<hi rend="italic">
trans
</hi>
-β-nitrostyrene
by
utilizing
Ce(NO3)3·6H2O
catalyst
in
the
absence
of
any
oxidant
or
additive
.

Metal
–
organic
frameworks
(
MOFs
)
,
a
class
of
porous
materials
with
excellent
potential
,
have
been
increasingly
used
in
gas
storage
and
separation
because
of
their
high
capacity
and
selectivity
properties
.
MOF
crystals
are
built
through
the
formation
of
secondary
building
units
(
SBUs
)
consisting
of
organic
linkers
and
metal
ions/clusters
.
Numerous
MOF
structures
have
been
designed
to
obtain
different
features
such
as
enlarged
surface
areas
,
enhanced
catalytic
activity
and
electrical
conductivity
,
better
interaction
at
the
open
metal
sites
,
and
improved
adsorption
.
Notably
,
the
application
of
MOFs
as
effective
catalysts
for
organic
reactions
has
received
much
attention
.
MOFs
with
metal
nodes
(
metal
ions/clusters
)
can
act
as
the
active
catalytic
sites
for
many
organic
reactions
such
as
oxidation
reactions
,
C
–
C
coupling
reactions
,
and
hydrogenation
reactions
.
However
,
the
fabrication
of
a
MOF
structure
with
high
activity
and
selectivity
still
requires
further
investigation
.
</p>
<p>
Recently
,
a
new
bimetallic
metal
–
organic
framework
(
BMOF
)
with
a
synergistic
effect
between
different
metal
ions
was
developed
.
Different
from
the
synthesis
of
MOFs
where
only
one
metal
ion
is
combined
with
organic
ligands
,
the
synthesis
process
of
a
BMOF
produces
the
pure
phase
of
the
BMOF
by
combining
two
different
metal
ions
with
organic
ligands
.
The
BMOFs
are
expected
to
have
improved
stability
,
activity
,
and
surface
area
and
could
be
applicable
in
catalysis
.
For
example
,
an
Fe/Co
mixed
Hofmann
MOF
with
coupling
effects
between
Co2+
and
Fe2+
ions
was
found
to
exhibit
enhanced
catalytic
activity
for
an
oxygen
evolution
reaction
compared
to
that
exhibited
by
the
original
single-metal
MOFs
.
Despite
this
,
the
catalysis
applications
of
BMOFs
have
not
been
investigated
so
far
.
</p>
<p>
The
main
aim
of
this
study
was
to
appraise
the
effect
of
a
new
BMOF
(
Fe2Ni-1,4-Benzenedicarboxylic
,
Fe2Ni-BDC
)
as
a
heterogenous
catalyst
for
organic
synthesis
reactions
.
Fe2Ni-BDC
was
generated
by
bridging
iron
(
III
)
cations
and
nickel
(
II
)
cations
with
1,4-Benzenedicarboxylic
anions
(
BDC−
)
to
create
a
porous
three-dimensional
structure
.
We
also
investigated
the
synthesis
of
N-pyridinyl
benzamide
via
the
amidation
process
of
<hi rend="italic">
trans
</hi>
-β-nitrostyrene
and
2-aminopyridine
using
Fe2Ni-BDC
as
an
effective
heterogeneous
catalyst
,
without
using
added
reducing
agents
or
oxidizing
agents
.
This
catalyst
might
be
reused
for
the
creation
of
N-pyridinyl
benzamide
by
the
amidation
reaction
without
significant
depreciation
in
its
efficiency
.
Fe2Ni-BDC
is
also
satisfactory
from
the
view
of
green
chemistry
,
as
the
solid
catalyst
used
for
the
reaction
can
be
easily
recovered
and
reused
.
To
the
best
of
our
knowledge
,
C=C
double
bond
cleavage
has
not
previously
been
performed
using
heterogeneous
catalysis
.
