Why
have
you
chosen
to
involve
yourself
in
the
political
process
?
Why
did
you
choose
to
run
in
this
constituency
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
I
ran
for
the
Green
Party
initially
for
one
reason
:
Peak
Oil
.
It
was
and
still
is
an
issue
that
is
tremendously
serious
but
is
not
given
enough
attention
.
I
believe
it
will
in
fact
be
the
issue
of
this
century
.
But
I
have
learned
since
then
that
there
are
many
other
serious
related
issues
,
such
as
climate
change
,
that
need
to
be
tackled
in
an
inventive
way
using
an
approach
that
relies
on
ingenuity
and
takes
in
a
different
perspective
to
the
problem
~
and
approach
that
looks
at
the
entire
system
and
its
relationships
to
other
problems
rather
than
looking
at
each
problem
as
if
it
were
isolated
.
We
also
need
to
look
at
problems
using
long-range
thinking
and
not
simply
concentrating
on
the
quick-fixes
.

What
prior
political
experience
do
you
have
?
What
skills
and
insight
can
you
bring
to
office
,
from
other
non-political
positions
you
may
have
held
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
I
have
run
twice
before
in
the
Federal
elections
of
2004
and
2006
in
Thornhill
.
I
am
also
on
the
board
of
directors
of
the
Richmond
Hill
Naturalists
,
which
gives
me
insight
into
local
issues
from
the
perspective
of
those
working
and
studying
natural
systems
(
ecosystems
)
and
their
health
and
am
a
member
of
the
Markham
Conservation
Committee
as
well
,
which
gives
me
insight
into
programs
that
are
being
undertaken
locally
by
the
town
.
I
also
have
a
longstanding
relationship
with
some
of
the
local
community
groups
and
understand
some
of
the
Regional
issues
affecting
the
quality
of
life
of
Thornhill
residents
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Which
of
your
competitors
do
you
expect
to
pose
the
biggest
challenge
to
your
candidacy
?
Why
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
I
believe
that
my
candidacy
stands
alone
.
In
fact
,
I
see
my
biggest
“
competitor
”
as
the
independent
candidate
,
whom
I
believe
will
likely
be
taking
a
portion
of
votes
that
would
have
probably
otherwise
come
to
me
[
the
so-called
“
protest
”
votes
cast
by
voters
who
are
fed
up
with
main-steam
politics
and
will
vote
for
anyone
except
the
big
parties
]
.
Of
course
,
these
are
likely
only
a
small
number
of
people
,
and
because
I
do
have
some
name
recognition
in
this
riding
,
however
small
,
I
believe
that
people
who
are
fed
up
with
mainstream
politics
will
still
continue
to
gravitate
toward
the
Green
Party
.
