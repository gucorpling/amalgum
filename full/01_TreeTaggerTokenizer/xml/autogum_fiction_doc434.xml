<p>
On
the
diggings
up
to
twenty
odd
years
ago
--
and
as
far
back
as
I
can
remember
--
on
Lambing
Flat
,
the
Pipe
Clays
,
Gulgong
,
Home
Rule
,
and
so
through
the
roaring
list
;
in
bark
huts
,
tents
,
public-houses
,
sly
grog
shanties
,
and
--
well
,
the
most
glorious
voice
of
all
belonged
to
a
bad
girl
.
We
were
only
children
and
did
n't
know
why
she
was
bad
,
but
we
were
n't
allowed
to
play
near
or
go
near
the
hut
she
lived
in
,
and
we
were
trained
to
believe
firmly
that
something
awful
would
happen
to
us
if
we
stayed
to
answer
a
word
,
and
did
n't
run
away
as
fast
as
our
legs
could
carry
us
,
if
she
attempted
to
speak
to
us
.
We
had
before
us
the
dread
example
of
one
urchin
,
who
got
an
awful
hiding
and
went
on
bread
and
water
for
twenty-four
hours
for
allowing
her
to
kiss
him
and
give
him
lollies
.
She
did
n't
look
bad
--
she
looked
to
us
like
a
grand
and
beautiful
lady-girl
--
but
we
got
instilled
into
us
the
idea
that
she
was
an
awful
bad
woman
,
something
more
terrible
even
than
a
drunken
man
,
and
one
whose
presence
was
to
be
feared
and
fled
from
.
There
were
two
other
girls
in
the
hut
with
her
,
also
a
pretty
little
girl
,
who
called
her
“
Auntie
”
,
and
with
whom
we
were
not
allowed
to
play
--
for
they
were
all
bad
;
which
puzzled
us
as
much
as
child-minds
can
be
puzzled
.
We
could
n't
make
out
how
everybody
in
one
house
could
be
bad
.
We
used
to
wonder
why
these
bad
people
were
n't
hunted
away
or
put
in
gaol
if
they
were
so
bad
.
And
another
thing
puzzled
us
.
Slipping
out
after
dark
,
when
the
bad
girls
happened
to
be
singing
in
their
house
,
we
'd
sometimes
run
against
men
hanging
round
the
hut
by
ones
and
twos
and
threes
,
listening
.
They
seemed
mysterious
.
They
were
mostly
good
men
,
and
we
concluded
they
were
listening
and
watching
the
bad
women
's
house
to
see
that
they
did
n't
kill
anyone
,
or
steal
and
run
away
with
any
bad
little
boys
--
ourselves
,
for
instance
--
who
ran
out
after
dark
;
which
,
as
we
were
informed
,
those
bad
people
were
always
on
the
lookout
for
a
chance
to
do
.
</p>
<p>
We
were
told
in
after
years
that
old
Peter
McKenzie
(
a
respectable
,
married
,
hard-working
digger
)
would
sometimes
steal
up
opposite
the
bad
door
in
the
dark
,
and
throw
in
money
done
up
in
a
piece
of
paper
,
and
listen
round
until
the
bad
girl
had
sung
the
“
Bonnie
Hills
of
Scotland
”
two
or
three
times
.
Then
he
'd
go
and
get
drunk
,
and
stay
drunk
two
or
three
days
at
a
time
.
And
his
wife
caught
him
throwing
the
money
in
one
night
,
and
there
was
a
terrible
row
,
and
she
left
him
;
and
people
always
said
it
was
all
a
mistake
.
But
we
could
n't
see
the
mistake
then
.
</p>
<p>
But
I
can
hear
that
girl
's
voice
through
the
night
,
twenty
years
ago
:
</p>
<p>
Oh
!
the
bloomin
'
heath
,
and
the
pale
blue
bell
,
In
my
bonnet
then
I
wore
;
And
memory
knows
no
brighter
theme
Than
those
happy
days
of
yore
.
Scotland
!
Land
of
chief
and
song
!
Oh
,
what
charms
to
thee
belong
!
</p>
<p>
And
I
am
old
enough
to
understand
why
poor
Peter
McKenzie
--
who
was
married
to
a
Saxon
,
and
a
Tartar
--
went
and
got
drunk
when
the
bad
girl
sang
“
The
Bonnie
Hills
of
Scotland
.
”
</p>
<p>
His
anxious
eye
might
look
in
vain
For
some
loved
form
it
knew
!
</p>
<p>
.
.
.
.
.
</p>
<p>
And
yet
another
thing
puzzled
us
greatly
at
the
time
.
Next
door
to
the
bad
girl
's
house
there
lived
a
very
respectable
family
--
a
family
of
good
girls
with
whom
we
were
allowed
to
play
,
and
from
whom
we
got
lollies
(
those
hard
old
red-and-white
“
fish
lollies
”
that
grocers
sent
home
with
parcels
of
groceries
and
receipted
bills
)
.
Now
one
washing
day
,
they
being
as
glad
to
get
rid
of
us
at
home
as
we
were
to
get
out
,
we
went
over
to
the
good
house
and
found
no
one
at
home
except
the
grown-up
daughter
,
who
used
to
sing
for
us
,
and
read
“
Robinson
Crusoe
”
of
nights
,
“
out
loud
”
,
and
give
us
more
lollies
than
any
of
the
rest
--
and
with
whom
we
were
passionately
in
love
,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
she
was
engaged
to
a
“
grown-up
man”
--
(we
reckoned
he
'd
be
dead
and
out
of
the
way
by
the
time
we
were
old
enough
to
marry
her
)
.
She
was
washing
.
She
had
carried
the
stool
and
tub
over
against
the
stick
fence
which
separated
her
house
from
the
bad
house
;
and
,
to
our
astonishment
and
dismay
,
the
bad
girl
had
brought
HER
tub
over
against
her
side
of
the
fence
.
They
stood
and
worked
with
their
shoulders
to
the
fence
between
them
,
and
heads
bent
down
close
to
it
.
The
bad
girl
would
sing
a
few
words
,
and
the
good
girl
after
her
,
over
and
over
again
.
They
sang
very
low
,
we
thought
.
Presently
the
good
grown-up
girl
turned
her
head
and
caught
sight
of
us
.
She
jumped
,
and
her
face
went
flaming
red
;
she
laid
hold
of
the
stool
and
carried
it
,
tub
and
all
,
away
from
that
fence
in
a
hurry
.
And
the
bad
grown-up
girl
took
her
tub
back
to
her
house
.
The
good
grown-up
girl
made
us
promise
never
to
tell
what
we
saw
--
that
she
'd
been
talking
to
a
bad
girl
--
else
she
would
never
,
never
marry
us
.
