Need
advice
in
regard
to
prolong
life
expectancy
(
lung
cancer
)
</head>
<sp who="#RemoteWipe">
<p>
Hi
reddit
,
my
boss
and
good
friend
got
diagnosed
with
lung
cancer
,
he
started
chemo
immediately
.
Problem
is
,
i
have
no
further
information
because
he
avoids
to
speak
about
it
and
generally
did
n't
change
much
at
all
except
stopping
to
smoke
,
thanks
god
.
(
still
has
terrible
food/drink/sleep/work
habbits
)
So
my
question
is
,
if
there
is
solid
information
on
how
to
adapt
to
prolong
life
as
much
as
possible
.
Like
nutrition-lists
,
exercise
or
anything
at
all
which
is
known
to
help
in
that
regard
.
I
never
was
confronted
with
this
and
the
web
is
overloaded
with
info
so
it
is
hard
for
me
to
inform
myself
.
If
someone
who
already
endured
similar
has
any
links
on
topic
in
english
or
even
german
language
i
'd
be
very
thankful
.

I
was
diagnosed
with
stage
3a
non-small
cell
lung
cancer
in
April
,
2013
,
and
then
re-staged
to
stage
4
in
June
,
2014
.
I
have
had
surgery
(
lobectomy
,
upper
left
)
,
chemo
x2
,
and
radiation
x2
.
I
have
also
done
LOTS
of
alternative
complimentary
therapies
.
I
have
scanned
tumor-free
since
the
summer
of
2015
and
my
life
is
slowly
getting
back
to
normal
.
Please
note
that
I
wo
n't
say
that
I
am
cancer
free
until
a
doctor
says
that
I
am
.
I
will
say
that
I
have
scanned
tumor
free
for
almost
3
years
,
because
that
's
a
fact
.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
I
changed
my
lifestyle
and
diet
tremendously
after
I
was
diagnosed
and
I
like
to
believe
that
that
has
contributed
a
lot
to
my
current
good
health
.
I
quit
smoking
and
did
n't
drink
for
3
years
(
I
now
enjoy
some
alcohol
,
but
a
fraction
of
what
I
enjoyed
before
)
.
I
drink
WAY
more
water
than
I
used
to
.
I
exercise
much
more
than
I
used
to
.
I
was
on
a
raw
vegan
diet
for
well
over
a
year
,
then
vegetarian
,
and
now
eat
a
little
meat
(
maybe
once
a
week
)
.
I
eat
drink
almost
no
dairy
products
(
I
miss
cheese
the
most
!
)
.
I
eat
virtually
nothing
sweet
.
I
stayed
away
from
a
lot
of
carbs
and
quit
eating
bread
,
pasta
,
starchy
veggies
for
over
3
years
.
I
still
eat
very
little
bread
and
pasta
and
cereals
.
I
really
do
n't
know
if
all
this
contributed
to
my
living
this
long
,
but
I
actually
feel
healthier
now
than
I
did
before
I
got
cancer
!
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
I
believe
that
I
had
several
other
things
in
my
favor
that
contributed
to
me
living
this
long
:
I
was
relatively
young
when
diagnosed
(
53
)
,
I
was
in
decent
shape
and
not
over
weight
when
diagnosed
,
I
'm
married
and
my
spouse
made
it
a
full
time
job
to
get
me
healthy
and
manage
my
health
(
I
know
I
would
have
died
by
now
if
I
was
single
;
when
I
was
told
that
I
was
terminal
and
had
6
months
to
live
my
wife
also
became
a
cheerleader
and
kept
me
focused
when
I
thought
that
all
was
lost
)
.
And
,
I
was
fortunate
enough
to
have
the
financial
resources
to
be
able
to
concentrate
on
my
health
and
not
work
.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
I
also
did
(
and
continue
to
do
)
lots
of
alternative
complimentary
therapies
,
but
there
is
obviously
no
way
to
tell
if
any
of
these
helped
me
.
I
did
the
shotgun
approach
and
hoped
that
something
may
work
.
My
oncologist
told
me
that
all
of
her
patients
that
did
alternative
complimentary
therapies
in
addition
to
conventional
therapies
seemed
to
do
better
.
Even
if
this
benefit
is
purely
psychological
,
I
think
it
's
still
a
benefit
.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Please
note
that
I
told
my
oncologist
everything
I
did
,
including
diet
changes
,
exercise
routines
,
and
alternative
complimentary
therapies
.
