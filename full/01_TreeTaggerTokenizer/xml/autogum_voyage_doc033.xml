Diving
Aliwal
Shoal
</head>
<p>
This
article
is
intended
to
provide
the
already
qualified
Scuba
diver
with
information
which
will
help
to
plan
dives
in
the
waters
of
Aliwal
Shoal
,
whether
as
a
local
resident
or
a
visitor
.
Information
is
provided
without
prejudice
,
and
is
not
guaranteed
accurate
or
complete
.
Use
it
at
your
own
risk
.
Detailed
information
on
individual
dive
sites
is
provided
in
the
sub-articles
linked
from
the
Dive
sites
section
.
The
information
in
the
site
descriptions
ranges
from
superficial
to
highly
detailed
,
depending
on
what
is
known
about
the
site
.
</p>
<p>
In
some
instances
a
dive
site
sub-article
will
include
several
sites
which
are
in
close
proximity
,
as
much
of
the
information
will
be
common
to
them
all
.
In
other
cases
,
usually
involving
wreck
sites
,
two
closely
adjacent
sites
will
each
have
their
own
sub-article

During
1849
,
after
a
ship
,
the
<hi rend="italic">
Aliwal
</hi>
,
nearly
collided
with
an
uncharted
reef
,
its
captain
reported
the
position
of
this
reef
that
later
became
known
as
the
Aliwal
Shoal
.
It
is
located
about
60
km
south
of
Durban
in
South
Africa
.
The
closest
towns
are
Umkomaas
and
Scottburgh
,
both
of
which
offer
extensive
tourist
facilities
,
also
for
scuba
divers
.
</p>
<head>
General
Topography
</head>
<p>
The
Aliwal
Shoal
is
a
fossilised
sand
dune
lying
roughly
parallel
to
the
coast
,
about
5
km
from
the
shore
.
It
comprises
a
narrow
northern
part
(
the
<hi rend="italic">
crown
</hi>
,
some
250
m
wide
,
becoming
about
800
m
wide
and
finally
with
a
wider
landward
ridge
to
the
south
,
greater
than
2
km
in
width
.
The
crown
varies
in
depth
from
about
6
m
(
around
the
Northern
Pinnacles
)
to
around
30
m
on
the
seaward
side
.
The
mean
depth
of
the
crown
area
is
12.5
m.
The
southern
wider
area
includes
several
protrusions
that
reach
from
a
depth
of
some
30
m
to
around
15
m
(
e.
g.
Howard
's
Castle
,
Landers
Reef
)
.
In
the
crown
area
,
many
dive
sites
,
e.g.
Raggie
Cave
and
Chunnel
have
a
large
amount
of
uneven
topography
with
small
caves
,
ledges
and
swimthroughs
rich
in
sea
life
,
both
fish-wise
as
well
as
in
invertebrates
,
e.g.
octopus
.

Climate
,
Weather
and
Sea
conditions
</head>
<p>
The
Aliwal
Shoal
has
a
subtropical
climate
witch
mean
monthly
air
temperatures
ranging
from
17.0°C
(
Jul
)
to
23.9°C
(
Feb
)
.
The
sea
temperatures
tend
to
be
somewhat
warmer
,
due
to
the
warm
,
tropical
,
southward-flowing
Mozambique
sea
current
,
resulting
in
a
balmy
21-26°C
throughout
the
year
.

Mean
monthly
weather
statistics
at
or
near
the
Aliwal
Shoal
:
</p>
<p>
The
period
May
to
July
has
the
least
wind
(
18
to
19
days
per
month
less
than
20
km/h
,
i.e.
small
waves
with
breaking
crests
and
fairly
frequent
whitecaps
)
,
while
September
to
November
is
more
windy
(
10-11
days
less
than
20
km/h
)
.
</p>
<p>
Depending
on
sea
current
conditions
,
underwater
visibility
is
sometimes
strongly
affected
by
effluent
from
the
Sappi-SAICCOR
paper
mill
at
Umkomaas
,
released
through
a
pipe
that
runs
some
6
km
into
the
sea
just
north
of
the
shoal
,
venting
along
a
considerable
length
of
the
pipe
.
</p>
<p>
The
shoal
often
has
strong
currents
that
can
be
from
the
north
or
from
the
south
.
This
makes
for
fantastic
drift
diving
.

Marine
Life
</head>
<p>
The
Aliwal
Shoal
is
a
fossilised
dune
upon
which
coral
and
other
sessile
animals
have
established
.
It
is
therefore
not
a
true
coral
reef
comprising
the
calcareous
remains
of
dead
corals
upon
which
other
corals
grow
.
It
is
a
coral
site
surprisingly
far
from
the
equator
,
made
possible
by
the
warm
southwards-flowing
Mozambique
current
.
Therefore
it
contains
many
of
the
subtropical
and
tropical
species
found
further
north
.
However
,
the
hard
corals
are
relatively
rare
compared
to
those
on
tropical
reefs
and
soft
corals
are
much
more
common
.
The
same
applies
to
the
tropical
fish
encountered
on
the
shoal
:
they
are
relative
more
sparse
than
on
tropical
reefs
.
However
,
a
surprising
variety
of
tropical
fish
are
still
found
on
the
shoal
,
including
many
species
of
surgeonfish
,
goldies
,
rockcod
,
triggerfish
,
cardinals
,
scorpionfish
,
lionfish
and
representatives
of
most
other
tropical
fish
genera
.
The
wreck
of
the
<hi rend="italic">
MV
Produce
</hi>
houses
the
endemic
Harlequin
goldie
<hi rend="italic">
Pseudanthias
connelli
</hi>
.
</p>
<p>
Aliwal
shoal
is
well
known
for
the
ragged-tooth
sharks
<hi rend="italic">
Carcharias
taurus
</hi>
mostly
encountered
during
winter
.
They
pup
in
the
cold
water
of
the
Cape
during
summer
.
During
May
to
August
they
migrate
up
the
east
coast
of
southern
Africa
and
mate
in
the
vicinity
of
the
Durban
on
the
KwaZulu-Natal
coast
,
including
the
Aliwal
Shoal
.
After
mating
they
spend
a
few
months
along
the
subtropical
coast
of
Mozambique
before
returning
to
the
Cape
in
the
early
summer
.
They
prefer
to
rest
in
holes
,
caves
or
depressions
large
enough
to
contain
sharks
.
They
frequently
swim
slowly
in
a
semi-sleep
condition
and
can
bump
against
divers
.
</p>
<p>
The
shoal
commonly
hosts
blacktip
reef
sharks
<hi rend="italic">
Carcharhinus
melanopterus
</hi>
,
bull
sharks
<hi rend="italic">
Carcharhinus
leucas
</hi>
and
tiger
sharks
<hi rend="italic">
Galeocerdo
cuvier
</hi>
,
the
latter
often
found
at
deeper
depths
.
Blacktip
reef
sharks
are
the
most
commonly
encountered
animals
during
baited
dives
.
</p>
<p>
The
shoal
has
large
numbers
of
invertebrate
species
such
as
sponges
,
coral
(
mostly
soft
corals
)
,
molluscs
such
as
octopus
,
cowries
and
nudibranchs
,
crustaceans
such
as
shrimps
and
lobsters
,
as
well
as
sea
anemones
.
</p>
<head>
The
Marine
Ecology
</head>
<p>
At
more
than
30
degrees
south
,
the
Aliwal
Shoal
lies
at
the
extreme
latitude
at
which
tropical
corals
have
been
observed
worldwide
.
The
biodiversity
on
the
shoal
is
shaped
mainly
by
the
amount
of
light
that
penetrates
the
sea
water
and
by
the
physical
wave
action
.
</p>
<p>
The
shallow
,
northern
part
of
the
shoal
with
depth
6-10
m
,
is
dominated
by
hard
corals
and
sponges
.
Since
hard
corals
are
generally
dependent
on
plant
cells
within
the
coral
body
(
zooxanthellae
)
,
they
are
critically
dependent
on
light
for
the
photosynthetic
products
produced
by
the
zooxanthellae
.
The
most
common
hard
coral
species
at
Aliwal
Shoal
are
the
knob-horned
and
smooth-horned
corals
(
<hi rend="italic">
Pocillopora
</hi>
sp
.
and
<hi rend="italic">
Stylophora
pistillata
</hi>
,
repectively
)
.
The
hard
corals
define
a
distinct
community
of
animals
along
the
top
of
the
crown
,
found
at
dive
sites
such
as
the
Northern
Pinnacles
and
Pinnacle
Ridge
.
The
encrusting
sponge
<hi rend="italic">
Subites
kelleri
</hi>
is
also
common
in
this
area
.
The
corals
and
sponges
on
these
parts
of
the
reef
are
physically
robust
and
can
withstand
the
wave
action
in
shallow
water
.
</p>
<p>
A
second
distinct
community
on
the
shoal
is
characterised
by
specific
soft
corals
,
e.g.
the
Dead
Man
's
Fingers
(
<hi rend="italic">
Eleutherobia
aurea
</hi>
)
.
These
corals
do
not
have
zooxanthellae
,
are
mostly
dependent
on
water
movement
for
feeding
on
small
free-floating
organisms
,
and
cannot
survive
where
the
wave
action
is
very
strong
.
This
community
also
has
many
sea
worms
(
Polychaeta
)
and
is
found
along
the
seaward
as
well
as
landward
edges
of
the
shoal
at
dive
sites
such
as
Raggie
Sands
,
Blowhole
and
Inside
Edge
.
</p>
<p>
The
third
community
is
poor
in
distinctive
corals
an
sponges
,
situated
at
greater
depths
,
especially
towards
the
southern
end
of
the
crown
.
However
it
still
contains
a
large
array
of
sea
animals
and
it
is
easy
to
locate
colourful
nudibranchs
.
This
area
has
a
large
abundance
of
algae
and
is
found
at
dive
sites
such
as
North
Wall
and
Burn
Rock
.
