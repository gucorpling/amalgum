Discussion
</head>
<p>
The
results
show
that
archaeological
prospection
with
a
motorised
multi-channel
GPR
system
can
be
successful
even
in
areas
covered
with
a
substantial
layer
of
snow
.
However
,
the
GPR
measurements
on
frozen
ground
with
a
thin
snow
cover
of
only
5
–
10
cm
thickness
resulted
in
the
data
images
with
highest
signal-to-noise
ratio
regarding
the
archaeological
target
structures
,
better
even
than
measurements
conducted
on
bare
ground
at
temperatures
above
freezing
.

Survey
on
a
thick
layer
of
dry
snow
.
Due
to
the
insulating
character
of
the
snow
layer
the
ground
possibly
has
not
been
as
deeply
frozen
as
in
case
(

)
.
This
is
assumed
to
have
been
the
situation
encountered
at
Odberg
.
The
situation
encountered
at
Stange
is
assumed
to
have
been
between
situations
(

)
and
(

)
.
</item>
<item>
(

Survey
on
medium
thick
layer
of
wet
snow
above
frozen
ground
.
The
snow
contains
wet
water
due
to
thawing
and
rainfall
,
causing
a
liquid
water
accumulation
at
the
snow-ground
surface
.
This
is
assumed
to
have
been
the
situation
encountered
at
Sem

The
differences
in
obtained
data
quality
in
regard
to
the
imaging
of
buried
archaeological
remains
is
understood
to
have
been
mainly
caused
by
the
variable
GPR
pulse
absorption
rates
due
to
the
different
properties
of
the
snow
cover
and
the
underlying
topsoil
.
Table

GPR
pulse
propagation
parameters
relevant
for
media
encountered
in
this
study
,
derived
for
a
400
MHz
pulse
(
<ref target="http://gpr-parameters.ch">
http://gpr-parameters.ch
</ref>
)
.
The
GPR
pulse
attenuation
is
computed
as
a
function
of
the
relative
dielectric
constant
and
the
electrical
conductivity
(

)
</p>
<p>
We
see
that
a
layer
of
dry
snow
hardly
attenuates
the
GPR
pulse
at
all
.
Its
thickness
may
however
have
a
detrimental
effect
on
the
image
resolution
due
to
geometrical
spreading
of
the
GPR
pulse
,
as
discussed
below
.
In
general
,
the
air/ground
interface
can
have
a
dramatic
effect
on
all
GPR
measurements
in
which
the
antenna
is
not
placed
closely
on
the
ground
surface
.
Too
great
a
distance
from
the
ground
will
cause
the
reflection
of
a
large
part
of
the
transmitted
electromagnetic
energy
of
the
GPR
pulse
,
preventing
it
from
reaching
further
below
for
subsurface
imaging
.
Critical
distances
of
the
GPR
antenna
from
the
ground
surface
are
those
greater
than
one
quarter
to
a
half
of
the
wavelength
of
the
transmitted
pulse
.
</p>
<p>
When
the
air
temperature
is
above
zero
and
the
top
soil
is
not
frozen
,
the
amount
of
liquid
water
in
the
soil
has
a
great
effect
on
GPR
pulse
propagation
and
attenuation
.
“
<hi rend="italic">
Water
is
the
single
biggest
factor
which
determines
the
bulk
electrical
properties
of
materials
in
most
Earth
settings
</hi>
”
stated
Davis
and
Annan
in
1989
.
The
topsoil
,
which
in
agriculturally
used
fields
corresponds
to
the
plough
layer
,
is
rich
in
organic
material
and
pore
space
between
the
solid
particles
,
comprising
the
soil
water
.
In
media
where
liquid
water
is
present
,
dramatic
changes
of
the
GPR
velocity
can
occur
,
complicating
the
imaging
of
buried
structures
,
as
described
by
Urban
et
al.
.
The
electrical
properties
of
water
change
dramatically
when
freezing
,
resulting
in
frozen
soil
to
behave
very
differently
than
soil
that
is
not
frozen
.
According
to
the
values
listed
in
Table
2
,
frozen
soil
has
a
signal
attenuation
of
0.138
dB/m
,
which
is
considerably
less
than
the
values
for
loamy
or
clayey
soils
.
Only
dry
sand
has
a
lower
attenuation
among
the
soils
.
Snow
has
a
very
low
attenuation
factor
of
0.003
dB/m
.
While
no
attenuation
value
is
given
for
wet
snow
,
in
comparison
it
can
be
assumed
that
it
is
similar
to
the
much
increased
attenuation
observed
in
wet
sand
.
