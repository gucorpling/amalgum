Philosophical
work
</head>
<p>
In
his
early
work
,
Boghossian
was
a
trenchant
critic
of
naturalistic
theories
of
content
.
</p>
<p>
Much
of
his
later
work
,
including
his
book
<hi rend="italic">
Fear
of
Knowledge
,
</hi>
criticizes
various
forms
of
relativism
,
especially
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemic_relativism">
epistemic
relativism
</ref>
,
which
claims
that
knowledge
and
reason
are
fundamentally
cultural
or
subjective
rather
than
objective
.
</p>
<p>
In
his
article
'
Blind
Reasoning
'
,
Boghossian
argues
that
we
are
blind
to
our
reasons
for
justifying
our
methods
of

Rejecting
both
Simple
Inferential
Externalism
for
its
inconsistency
and
Simple
Inferential
Internalism
because
it
is
difficult
to
accept
,
he
opts
for
a
third
and
new
form
of
&quot;

insight
