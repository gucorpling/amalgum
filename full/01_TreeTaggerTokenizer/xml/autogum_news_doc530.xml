for

fought
general

campaign
.
The

support
for
the

was

.

<p>
A
poll
by
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panelbase">

yesterday
showed
Labour
six
points
ahead
;
a

showed
Labour
four
points
ahead
of

.
This
latter
poll
was
mixed
for
the
Labour
leader
as
it
showed
only
25
%
of
voters
were
convinced
Miliband
was
suited
to
the
job
of
Prime
Minister
while
37
%
preferred
David
Cameron
,
but
it
also
shows
that
people
preferred
Miliband
's
recent
conduct
as
party
leader
to
Cameron
's
.
A

by

found
a
three
point
lead
for

the

<p>
Following
the
poll
results
,
the
Conservative
Party
fired
a
volley
of
negative
remarks
towards
Labour
.
Defense
secretary
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael%20Fallon">
Michael
Fallon
</ref>
said
Ed
Miliband
would
end
up
signing
up
for
&quot;
a
grubby
backstairs
deal
&quot;
with
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party">
Scottish
National
Party
</ref>
(
SNP
)
which
would
lead
to
the
cancellation
or
non-renewal
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/UK_Trident_programme">
Trident
</ref>
nuclear
submarine
programme
.
The
Labour
Party
have
stated
they
support
the
continuation
of
Trident
and
will
not
negotiate
on
Trident
with
the
SNP
.
</p>
<p>
Fallon
's
comments
on
Trident
were
backed
up
by
David
Cameron
.
</p>
<p>
The
Labour
Party
counter-claimed
a
deal
between
the
Conservatives
and
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Liberal_Democrats_(UK)">
Liberal
Democrats

had
put
the

1.4bn
.
</p>
<p>
Miliband
responded
to
Fallon
's
comments
:
&quot;
Michael
Fallon
is
a
decent
man
,
but
today
I
think
he
has
demeaned
himself
and
he
has
demeaned
his
office
.
National
security
is
too
important
to
play
politics
with
and
I
will
never
compromise
national
security
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Former
Labour
leader
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Tony_Blair">
Tony
Blair
</ref>
said
Fallon
's
remarks
hinted
at
desperation
:
&quot;
The
Tories
were
up
to
their
old
tricks
in
their
personal
attack
on
Ed
this
morning
.
I
remember
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New%20Labour,%20New%20Danger">
'
demon
eyes
'
poster
</ref>
of
1997
.
It
is
always
a
sign
of
desperation
and
it
will
backfire
.
It
shows
how
nervous
they
are
of
a
Labour
campaign
full
of
confidence
,
which
is
showing
that
it
understands
the
challenges
facing
working
people
and
how
to
overcome
them
.
The
more
they
indulge
in
these
tactics
the
better
we
should
feel
.
&quot;

<p>
Liberal
Democrat
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Vince_Cable">
Vince
Cable

expressed
his
displeasure
at
Fallon
's
remarks
,
saying
it
was
&quot;
an
appalling
way
to
conduct
the
argument
&quot;
.
</p>
<p>
The
two
main
parties
have
also
proposed
a
number
of
new
ideas
for
policy
.
Labour
's
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Yvette_Cooper">
Yvette
Cooper
</ref>
is
to
formally
announce
a
new
policy
today
to
protect
10,000
police
officers
'
jobs
by
eliminating
elected
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police%20and%20crime%20commissioner">
Police
and
Crime
Commissioners
</ref>
and
gun
licensing
subsidy
,
and
sharing
of
police
back-office
services
and
procurement
.
The
Labour
crime
and
justice
manifesto
also
includes
creating
a
new
commission
on
sexual
and
domestic
violence
,
banning
&quot;
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Drugs">
legal
highs
</ref>
&quot;
,
and
reforming
prisons
to
introduce
more
education
and
work
for
prisoners
.
</p>
<p>
Conservative
Cameron
pre-announced
a
proposal
to
change
the
rules
so
workers
in
the
public
sector
and
for
companies
with
250
employees
or
more
—
which
between
the
two
is
estimated
to
be
around
half
the
work
force
—
would
be
entitled
to
three
days
of
paid
volunteering
leave
per
year
.
In
prepared
remarks
,
Cameron
is
to
call
the
move
represents
the
&quot;
clearest
demonstration
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big%20Society">
Big
Society
</ref>
in
action
&quot;
.
This
marks
a
return
of
the
language
of
the
'
Big
Society
'
which
had
slowly
disappeared
from
use
since
the
last
election
.
