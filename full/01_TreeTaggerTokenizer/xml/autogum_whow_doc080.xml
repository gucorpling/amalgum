Good
Road
Etiquette
</head>
<p>
Driving
is
one
of
the
most
dangerous
activities
anyone
could
ever
start
doing
.
Although
it
is
important
to
recognize
this
if
you
drive
defensively
and
treat
other
drivers
with
respect
,
you
can
enjoy
driving
and
greatly
minimize
any
risks
.

Steps

<list type="ordered">
<item>
Try
to
do
a
pre-check
of
all
areas
of
your
car
before
driving
but
always
if
you
will
be
driving
more
than
.
Here
are
the
following
things
that
should
be
looked
at
.
<figure rend="Check Oil Level in Car Step 12.jpg">
</figure>
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Your
tires
.
Make
sure
they
have
enough
pressure
in
them
and
that
they
are
in
good
quality
.
</item>
<item>
How
much
gas
you
have
.
If
you
only
have
a
little
bit
try
to
stop
at
the
nearest
gas
station
to
fill
up
.
A
1/4
tank
will
only
last
about
.
</item>
<item>
The
oil
in
your
car
.
Even
if
you
're
sure
it
has
enough
always
get
into
the
habit
of
checking
it
.
If
it
needs
more
fill
it
up
using
a
standard
oil
or
a
specific
one
recommended
in
your
owner
's
manual
.
</item>
<item>
Your
windshield
wipers
and
fluid
.
You
want
to
make
sure
you
can
always
see
through
your
windshield
.
</item>
<item>
Your
rear
view
mirrors
,
steering
column
,
seat
location
,
etc.
These
are
the
final
checks
and
help
to
make
you
as
safe
and
alert
as
possible
.
If
you
have
long
legs
scoot
your
seat
back
so
you
can
comfortably
reach
the
pedals
and
your
legs
do
n't
interfere
with
the
steering
wheel
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Understand
all
the
basic
rules
of
driving
and
if
possible
always
try
to
have
another
driver
with
you
to
help
coach
you
on
what
could
be
done
better
or
have
them
quiz
you
.
It
may
sound
like
I
think
you
have
your
permit
but
becoming
a
great
driver
is
really
a
lifelong
journey
.
The
rules
of
the
road
are
far
too
many
to
describe
in
detail
but
here
are
some
of
the
following
.
<figure rend="Pass the Texas Driving Test Step 7.jpg">
</figure>
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Know
the
speed
limits
of
different
areas
and
try
to
stay
at
or
a
little
bit
below
them
.
Never
exceed
them
by
much
if
at
all
unless
you
really
need
to
;
you
'll
risk
getting
a
ticket
generally
they
are
,
</item>
<item>
in
parking
lots
</item>
<item>
in
school
zones
</item>
<item>
depending
on
where
the
road
is
at
for
instance
by
a
neighborhood
or
approaching
a
highway
.
</item>
<item>
on
designated
rural
or
state
highways
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Obey
all
traffic
lights
.
A
lot
of
people
may
see
them
as
a
nuisance
but
they
are
there
to
protect
your
life
.
On
a
steady
green
light
you
may
proceed
through
the
intersection
;
always
making
sure
to
yield
to
all
pedestrians
,
bicyclists
or
other
cars
that
may
have
the
right
of
way
.
A
steady
yellow
light
means
a
red
light
for
stop
is
about
to
appear
.
If
you
are
at
the
intersection
or
a
little
bit
before
you
may
accelerate
to
make
the
light
.
If
not
always
stop
at
the
white
line
before
the
crosswalk
.
When
a
red
light
appears
stop
and
wait
until
the
other
cross-section
of
traffic
has
taken
their
turn
before
proceeding
.

<item>
Be
courteous
and
respectful
to
your
fellow
drivers
.
They
are
probably
just
as
nervous
as
you
are
but
by
showing
you
are
relaxed
you
can
help
to
make
a
smooth
as
drive
as
possible
.
Here
are
some
general
guidelines
.
<figure rend="Drive in New Zealand Step 5.jpg">
</figure>
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Never
road
rage
.
Though
it
might
sound
like
a
good
solution
yelling
at
another
driver
or
giving
the
finger
will
only
produce
anger
between
both
of
you
and
you
could
get
in
big
trouble
with
the
law
.
</item>
<item>
Only
use
the
horn
in
an
emergency
.
If
someone
cut
you
off
or
is
trying
to
turn
left
way
after
the
arrow
has
gone
out
please
do
so
.
Never
use
it
as
a
musical
instrument
or
tell
someone
off
.
</item>
<item>
Please
never
be
a
reckless
driver
.
This
goes
far
beyond
what
was
just
stated
and
you
could
lose
your
license
or
be
arrested
.
These
behaviors
include
tailgating
,
ramming
another
car
,
threatening
other
drivers
,
or
intentionally
hitting
someone
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Practice
and
hone
more
advanced
driving
techniques
.
These
include
merging
on
a
highway
,
downshifting
,
driving
in
severe
weather
,
cruise
control
,
mountain
driving
,
etc.
I
believe
these
are
never
really
fully
mastered
.

Tips

<list type="unordered">
<item>
I
only
listed
a
few
of
the
basic
driving
techniques
and
theory
.
For
complete
information
please
contact
your
local
DMV
office
for
a
driving
handbook
.
</item>
<item>
The
golden
rule
.
Treat
all
drivers
how
you
would
want
them
to
treat
you
.
</item>
<item>
I
feel
this
must
be
repeated
because
it
is
so
vital
.
Always
try
to
drive
with
another
more
experienced
driver
.
They
can
put
you
at
ease
and
give
you
tips
and
advice
to
master
your
driving
.
</item>
<item>
When
practicing
advanced
driving
techniques
leave
your
cellphone
and
other
distractions
behind
.
These
require
your
full
concentration
.

Warnings
</head>
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Please
do
not
drive
distracted
either
.
These
behaviors
include
applying
makeup
,
eating
,
pretending
to
be
on
American
Idol
,
etc.
</item>
<item>
At
yellow
lights
there
can
sometimes
be
a
quick
impulsive
decision
you
have
to
make
.
This
is
whether
or
not
to
go
through
the
light
.
If
you
slam
on
your
brakes
you
risk
a
crash
but
if
you
go
through
this
is
less
of
a
chance
;
but
you
may
risk
getting
a
ticket
.
Try
to
make
the
best
decision
possible
.
</item>
<item>
Do
not
drive
with
low
oil
.
This
is
one
of
the
worst
things
you
could
do
with
your
car
.
If
your
car
runs
out
of
oil
your
engine
may
fail
entirely
.
Very
likely
your
car
could
not
be
able
to
come
back
after
this
.
</item>
<item>
Never
drive
wearing
flip-flops
.
You
may
mistake
one
pedal
with
another
or
kill
the
engine
by
accident
at
a
very
bad
time
.
It
is
far
better
to
drive
barefoot
.
</item>
<item>
Drive
safely
and
responsibly
.
</item>
<item>
Never
litter
on
any
public
roads
.
In
most
states
this
is
highly
enforced
and
you
could
get
a
hefty
ticket
of
$
1,000
plus
points
on
your
license
.
</item>
<item>
Do
not
text
and
drive
or
drink
and
drive
.
Both
have
incredibly
devastating
consequences
and
people
have
died
from
both
.
You
will
be
arrested
and
it
will
forever
go
on
your
driving
record
.
