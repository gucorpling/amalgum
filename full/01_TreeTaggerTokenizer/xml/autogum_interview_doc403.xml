Do
you
notice
a
difference
between
playing
in
front
of
British
and
American
audiences
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
NK
:
</hi>
The
U.S.
audiences
are
much
more
full
of
expression
and
noises
and
jubilation
.
They
are
like
,
&quot;
Welcome
to
New
York
,
<hi rend="italic">
Baby
</hi>
!
&quot;
&quot;
You
're
<hi rend="italic">
Awesome
</hi>
!
&quot;
and
stuff
like
that
.
Whereas
in
England
they
tend
to
be
a
lot
more
reserved
.
Well
,
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English%20people">
English
</ref>
are
,
but
it
is
such
a
diverse
culture
you
will
get
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish%20people">
Spanish
</ref>
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian%20people">
Italian
</ref>
gay
guys
at
the
front
who
are
going
crazy
.
I
definitely
think
in
America
they
are
much
more
open
and
there
is
more
excitement
,
which
is
really
cool
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
How
many
instruments
do
you
play
and
,
please
,
include
the
glockenspiel
in
that
number
.
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
NK

</hi>

<hi rend="italic">

</hi>
]
I
think
the
number
is
limitless
,
hopefully
.
I
try
my
hand
at
anything
I
can
contribute
;
I
only
just
picked
up
the
bass
,
really
—
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
--
I
have
a
great
photo
of
you
playing
the
bass
.
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
NK
:
</hi>
I
do
n't
think
I
'm
very
good
...
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
You
look
cool
with
it
!
</hi>

Fine
.
The
glockenspiel
...
piano
,
mainly
,
and
also
the
harp
.
Guitar
,
I
like
playing
percussion
and
drumming
.
I
usually
speak
with
all
my
drummers
so
that
I
write
my
songs
with
them
in
mind
,
and
we
'll
have
bass
sounds
,
choir
sounds
,
and
then
you
can
multi-task
with
all
these
orchestral
sounds
.
Through
the
magic
medium
of
technology
I
can
play
all
kinds
of
sounds
,
double
bass
and
stuff
.

DS
:
Do
you
design
your
own
clothes
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
NK
:
</hi>
All
four
of
us
girls
love
vintage
shopping
and
charity
shops
.
We
do
n't
have
a
stylist
who
tells
us
what
to
wear
,
it
's
all
very
much
our
own
natural
styles
coming
through
.
And
for
me
,
personally
,
I
like
to
wear
jewelery
.
On
the
night
of
the
New
York
show
that
top
I
was
wearing
was
made
especially
for
me
as
a
gift
by
these
New
York
designers
called
<hi rend="italic">
Pepper
+
Pistol
</hi>
.
And
there
's
also
my
boyfriend
,
who
is
an
amazing
musician
—
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
—
that
's
Will
Lemon
from
Moon
and
Moon
,
right
?
There
is
such
good
buzz
about
them
here
in
New
York
.
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
NK
:
</hi>
Yes
!
They
have
an
album
coming
out
in
February
and
it
will
fucking
<hi rend="italic">
blow
</hi>
your
mind
!
I
think
you
would
love
it
,
it
's
an
incredible
masterpiece
.
It
's
really
exciting
,
I
'm
hoping
we
can
do
a
crazy
double
unfolding
caravan
show
,
the
Bat
for
Lashes
album
and
the
new
Moon
and
Moon
album
:
that
would
be
really
theatrical
and
amazing
!
Will
prints
a
lot
of
my
T-shirts
because
he
does
amazing
tapestries
and
silkscreen
printing
on
clothes
.
When
we
play
there
's
a
velvety
kind
of
tapestry
on
the
keyboard
table
that
he
made
.
So
I
wear
a
lot
of
his
things
,
thrift
store
stuff
,
old
bits
of
jewelry
and
antique
pieces
.
