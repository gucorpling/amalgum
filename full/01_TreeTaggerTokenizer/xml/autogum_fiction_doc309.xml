VIII
.
The
Crooked
Man
</head>
<p>
One
summer
night
,
a
few
months
after
my
marriage
,
I
was
seated
by
my
own
hearth
smoking
a
last
pipe
and
nodding
over
a
novel
,
for
my
day
’s
work
had
been
an
exhausting
one
.
My
wife
had
already
gone
upstairs
,
and
the
sound
of
the
locking
of
the
hall
door
some
time
before
told
me
that
the
servants
had
also
retired
.
I
had
risen
from
my
seat
and
was
knocking
out
the
ashes
of
my
pipe
when
I
suddenly
heard
the
clang
of
the
bell
.
</p>
<p>
I
looked
at
the
clock
.
It
was
a
quarter
to
twelve
.
This
could
not
be
a
visitor
at
so
late
an
hour
.
A
patient
,
evidently
,
and
possibly
an
all-night
sitting
.
With
a
wry
face
I
went
out
into
the
hall
and
opened
the
door
.
To
my
astonishment
it
was
Sherlock
Holmes
who
stood
upon
my
step
.
</p>
<p>
“
Ah
,
Watson
,
”
said
he
,
“
I
hoped
that
I
might
not
be
too
late
to
catch
you
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
My
dear
fellow
,
pray
come
in
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
You
look
surprised
,
and
no
wonder
!
Relieved
,
too
,
I
fancy
!
Hum
!
You
still
smoke
the
Arcadia
mixture
of
your
bachelor
days
then
!
There
’s
no
mistaking
that
fluffy
ash
upon
your
coat
.
It
’s
easy
to
tell
that
you
have
been
accustomed
to
wear
a
uniform
,
Watson
.
You
’ll
never
pass
as
a
pure-bred
civilian
as
long
as
you
keep
that
habit
of
carrying
your
handkerchief
in
your
sleeve
.
Could
you
put
me
up
to-night
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
With
pleasure
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
You
told
me
that
you
had
bachelor
quarters
for
one
,
and
I
see
that
you
have
no
gentleman
visitor
at
present
.
Your
hat-stand
proclaims
as
much
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
shall
be
delighted
if
you
will
stay
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Thank
you
.
I
’ll
fill
the
vacant
peg
then
.
Sorry
to
see
that
you
’ve
had
the
British
workman
in
the
house
.
He
’s
a
token
of
evil
.
Not
the
drains
,
I
hope
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
No
,
the
gas
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Ah
!
He
has
left
two
nail-marks
from
his
boot
upon
your
linoleum
just
where
the
light
strikes
it
.
No
,
thank
you
,
I
had
some
supper
at
Waterloo
,
but
I
’ll
smoke
a
pipe
with
you
with
pleasure
.
”
</p>
<p>
I
handed
him
my
pouch
,
and
he
seated
himself
opposite
to
me
and
smoked
for
some
time
in
silence
.
I
was
well
aware
that
nothing
but
business
of
importance
would
have
brought
him
to
me
at
such
an
hour
,
so
I
waited
patiently
until
he
should
come
round
to
it
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
see
that
you
are
professionally
rather
busy
just
now
,
”
said
he
,
glancing
very
keenly
across
at
me
.
</p>
<p>
“
Yes
,
I
’ve
had
a
busy
day
,
”
I
answered
.
“
It
may
seem
very
foolish
in
your
eyes
,
”
I
added
,
“
but
really
I
do
n’t
know
how
you
deduced
it
.
”
</p>
<p>
Holmes
chuckled
to
himself
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
have
the
advantage
of
knowing
your
habits
,
my
dear
Watson
,
”
said
he
.
“
When
your
round
is
a
short
one
you
walk
,
and
when
it
is
a
long
one
you
use
a
hansom
.
As
I
perceive
that
your
boots
,
although
used
,
are
by
no
means
dirty
,
I
cannot
doubt
that
you
are
at
present
busy
enough
to
justify
the
hansom
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Excellent
!
”
I
cried
.
</p>
<p>
“
Elementary
,
”
said
he
.
“
It
is
one
of
those
instances
where
the
reasoner
can
produce
an
effect
which
seems
remarkable
to
his
neighbour
,
because
the
latter
has
missed
the
one
little
point
which
is
the
basis
of
the
deduction
.
The
same
may
be
said
,
my
dear
fellow
,
for
the
effect
of
some
of
these
little
sketches
of
yours
,
which
is
entirely
meretricious
,
depending
as
it
does
upon
your
retaining
in
your
own
hands
some
factors
in
the
problem
which
are
never
imparted
to
the
reader
.
Now
,
at
present
I
am
in
the
position
of
these
same
readers
,
for
I
hold
in
this
hand
several
threads
of
one
of
the
strangest
cases
which
ever
perplexed
a
man
’s
brain
,
and
yet
I
lack
the
one
or
two
which
are
needful
to
complete
my
theory
.
But
I
’ll
have
them
,
Watson
,
I
’ll
have
them
!
”
His
eyes
kindled
and
a
slight
flush
sprang
into
his
thin
cheeks
.
For
an
instant
only
.
When
I
glanced
again
his
face
had
resumed
that
red-Indian
composure
which
had
made
so
many
regard
him
as
a
machine
rather
than
a
man
.
</p>
<p>
“
The
problem
presents
features
of
interest
,
”
said
he
.
“
I
may
even
say
exceptional
features
of
interest
.
I
have
already
looked
into
the
matter
,
and
have
come
,
as
I
think
,
within
sight
of
my
solution
.
If
you
could
accompany
me
in
that
last
step
you
might
be
of
considerable
service
to
me
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
should
be
delighted
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Could
you
go
as
far
as
Aldershot
to-morrow
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
have
no
doubt
Jackson
would
take
my
practice
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Very
good
.
I
want
to
start
by
the
11.10
from
Waterloo
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
That
would
give
me
time
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Then
,
if
you
are
not
too
sleepy
,
I
will
give
you
a
sketch
of
what
has
happened
,
and
of
what
remains
to
be
done
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
was
sleepy
before
you
came
.
I
am
quite
wakeful
now
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
will
compress
the
story
as
far
as
may
be
done
without
omitting
anything
vital
to
the
case
.
It
is
conceivable
that
you
may
even
have
read
some
account
of
the
matter
.
It
is
the
supposed
murder
of
Colonel
Barclay
,
of
the
Royal
Mallows
,
at
Aldershot
,
which
I
am
investigating
.
