Introduction

<p>
The
Gas
Tungsten
Arc
Welding
(
GTAW
)
wire
feed
additive
manufacturing
(
AM
)
process
involves
the
deposition
of
metal
material
using
a
tungsten
arc
as
an
energy
source
.
GTAW
belongs
to
the
group
of
Direct
Energy
Deposit
(
DED
)
methods
in
the
family
of
AM
processes
.
A
solid
metal
wire
is
fed
through
a
conventional
wire
feeder
and
deposited
layer-by-layer
onto
a
substrate
.
The
energy
source
is
electrical
heating
,
which
melts
the
metal
wire
as
well
as
the
base
material
.
The
addition
of
multiple
layers
produces
a
dense
near-net-shape
part
.
GTAW
wire
feed
additive
manufacturing
has
a
high
deposition
rate
.
Flexibility
and
cost
savings
in
manufacturing
are
important
driving
forces
in
the
development
of
such
techniques
.

<p>
The
titanium
alloy
,
Ti-6Al-4V
,
is
extensively
used
in
aerospace
applications
because
of
its
high
strength
to
weight
ratio
.
With
an
appropriate
protective
environment
to
minimize
the
oxygen
content
,
this
alloy
shows
good
weldability
and
has
also
been
shown
to
be
suitable
for
additive
manufacturing
.
</p>
<p>
In
additive
manufacturing
,
multiple
layers
are
melted
on
top
of
each
other
in
a
layer-by-layer
manner
,
inducing
a
number
of
heating-up/cooling-down
cycles
in
the
manufactured
material
.
Since
Ti-6Al-4V
is
a
two-phase
alloy
consisting
of
90
–
95
%
of
hcp-α
phase
and
5
–
10
%
bcc-β
phase
at
room
temperature
,
the
final
microstructure
of
the
material
after
being
additive
manufactured
can
exhibit
a
variety
of
microstructures
,
depending
on
the
conditions
of
the
thermal
cycles
.
For
the
industry
to
fully
adopt
additive
manufacturing
,
and
to
be
able
to
qualify
titanium
parts
for
aerospace
applications
,
a
complete
understanding
of
the
mechanical
behavior
and
control
of
the
resulting
properties
are
prerequisites
.
</p>
<p>
Process
simulations
provide
information
on
how
to
manufacture
components
in
order
to
achieve
the
required
properties
and
support
the
development
and
understanding
of
the
manufacturing
process
itself
.
Finite
Element
(
FE
)
simulations
,
a
conventional
method
used
in
the
modeling
of
welding
processes
,
particularly
for
larger
components
,
are
applied
on
the
macro
scale
.
In
the
present
work
,
a
validated
FE
model
presented
by
Lundbäck
and
Lindgren
is
used
to
predict
the
thermal
field
that
,
in
turn
,
determines
the
microstructural
evolution
.
A
number
of
different
strategies
exist
regarding
how
to
include
detailed
and
explicit
modeling
on
a
microscopic
scale
in
a
macroscopic
simulation
.
One
such
strategy
is
to
use
submeshes
located
at
the
nodes
of
the
FE
model
,
while
another
is
to
use
dual-mesh
methods
that
place
microstructural
domains
at
the
nodes
of
a
macroscopic
FE
calculation
.
However
,
with
these
strategies
,
the
calculations
become
very
cumbersome
if
a
large
component
is
to
be
simulated
.
Therefore
,
for
industrial
needs
,
it
is
more
pragmatic
to
use
a
density
type
of
model
,
also
called
the
internal
state
variable
approach
by
Grong
and
Shercliff
.
In
this
work
,
a
density-type
approach
is
used
in
order
to
model
the
microstructure
on
a
larger
scale
.
Moreover
,
it
facilitates
the
future
combination
of
the
microstructural
model
with
a
mechanical
model
to
compute
material
properties
.
</p>
<p>
The
aim
of
the
present
study
has
been
to
,
for
the
first
time
,
couple
the
process
simulation
model
,
developed
by
the
authors
,
with
a
microstructural
model
,
which
has
also
been
developed
by
the
authors
,
to
predict
the
alpha
lath
size
in
the
GTAW
wire
feed
AM
process
.
The
results
were
validated
by
building
a
well-defined
,
10-layer-high
weld
sequence
,
in
which
,
at
specific
positions
,
its
microstructural
features
have
been
characterized
and
compared
to
the
predicted
results
.
