here
to
help

How
did
you
come
to
work
for
the
Wikimedia
Foundation
?
Were
you
asked
to
join
by
someone
?
And
if
so
,
who
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
SG
:
</hi>
I
actually
first
got
interested
in
the
Wikimedia
Foundation
in
a
serious
way
,
when
I
saw
it
do
such
a
good
job
on
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/33_dead,_15_injured_in_Virginia_Tech_shootings">
Virginia
Tech
story
</ref>
.
On
the
morning
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia%20Tech%20massacre">
Virginia
Tech
massacre
</ref>
,
I
was
following
the
story
on
Wikipedia/Wikinews
,
and
reading
the
talk
page
.
And
it
was
a
really
excellent
level
of
conversation
that
was
being
had
there
.
I
was
really
seriously
impressed
.
So
I
started
doing
a
little
reading
about
the
organization
,
which
resulted
in
me
talking
with
Brad
Patrick
[
then
General
Counsel
to
the
Board
of
Trustees
]
and
then
Florence
[
Nibart-Devouard
,
Chair
of
the
Board
]
.
Which
resulted
in
me
coming
here
.

In
joining
WMF
was
there
anything
you
brought
from
CBC
.
ca
's
policies
that
you
feel
have
influenced
your
contributions
to
the
foundation
?
Can
you
give
Wikinews
any
tips
?
I
am
assuming
their
similar
balance/neutrality
policies
as
the
BBC
's
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
SG
:
</hi>
Yes
,
I
think
so
.
CBC
is
an
extremely
thoughtful
,
intentional
,
deliberate
organization
.
I
have
borrowed
from
it
liberally
thus
far
—
our
code
of
conduct
owes
something
to
the
CBC
's
,
as
does
our
travel
policy
,
travel
approvals
policy
,
reimbursement
policy
etc.
So
there
are
a
lot
of
new
policies
here
(
and
there
will
be
more
)
that
have
been
heavily
influenced
by
the
CBC
.
In
terms
of
journalistic
policy
,
I
have
had
no
influence
on
how
Wikinews
handles
things
.
And
Brian
,
you
are
correct
that
CBC
's
editorial
policies
are
very
similar
to
those
of
the
BBC
.
