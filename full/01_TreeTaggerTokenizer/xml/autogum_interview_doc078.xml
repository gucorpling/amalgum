And
so
I
had
literally
campaigned
in
all
92
counties
for
two
years
of
my
life
,
driving
around
the
state
of
Indiana
in
my
American-made
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda%20Civic">
Honda
Civic
</ref>
,
which
became
a
political
issue
for
part
of
the
race
.
During
that
race
,
Congressman
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke%20Messer">
Luke
Messer
</ref>
was
part
of
the
field
for
a
time
.
Diana
Cordray
,
the
clerk
treasurer
at
Carmel
,
was
in
part
of
the
field
for
a
time
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent%20Benson">
Kent
Benson
</ref>
was
a
big
part
of
it
.
Campaigning
against
him
was
like
campaigning
against
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis%20Presley">
Elvis
Presley
</ref>
.
Because
we
’d
go
to
these
southern
Indiana
counties
,
and
he
would
autograph
basketballs
with
the
starting
five
in
the
1976
Indiana
University
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1976%20NCAA%20Men's%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Tournament">
National
Championship
</ref>
team
.
And
that
was
the
time
that
I
said
I
had
to
do
something
because
he
was
killing
me
politically
,
and
so
we
started
putting
our
name
on
peanut
butter
and
passing
out
peanut
butter
.
We
said
that
if
peanuts
were
the
food
of
elephants
,
then
peanut
butter
was
the
food
of
the
grassroots
of
the
Republican
party
,
whose
symbol
was
the
elephant
.
</p>
<p>
So
we
,
we
ran
hard
.
We
ran
a
strong
campaign
.
And
really
it
was
that
campaign
that
created
the
foundation
for
my
ability
to
become
a
senator
.
But
there
's
no
question
that
that
was
a
hard-fought
campaign
,
and
the
way
that
it
ended
was
less
than
favorable
.
Literally
,
the
next
day
I
had
to
get
on
an
airplane
to
fly
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp%20Shelby">
Camp
Shelby
</ref>
,
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Mississippi">
Mississippi
</ref>
to
do
my
2
weeks
of
army
training
in
the
middle
of
nowhere
.
And
I
remember
being
on
a
rifle
range
,
and
a
there
was
misfire
happening
,
and
I
looked
up
to
the
safety
officer
on
the
rifle
range
and
I
said
,
&quot;
Was
that
Richard
Mourdock
over
there
?
&quot;
Obviously
,
they
did
n't
get
the
joke
.
But
Richard
and
I
are
now
friends
and
get
along
great
.

Tew
:
And
,
in
fact
,
you
were
both
competing
for
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard%20Lugar">
[
Senator
Richard
]
Lugar
</ref>
'
s
office
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
MD
</hi>
:
Well
,
you
’re
talking
about
the
United
States
Senate
,
this
last
go
‘
round
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
(
(
</hi>
<hi rend="bold">
WN
</hi>
<hi rend="bold">

)
</hi>
Yes
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
MD
</hi>
:
Yeah
,
at
the
time
I
was
finishing
up
my
legal
studies
and
kind
of
transitioning
professionally
.
I
was
running
my
own
home-based
business
called
MA
Advisory
Group
,
which
was
based
upon
my
grandfather
's
name
of
his
company
,
the
MA
Delph
Company
,
which
I
mentioned
before
.
And
I
had
thought
about
that
for
a
little
bit
.
I
had
been
approached
by
some
folks
out
in
Washington
,
D.C.
,
specifically
that
I
have
known
for
years
and
that
had
an
interest
in
me
considering
that
.
And
it
really
was
n't
a
good
time
for
me
professionally
and
in
the
life
of
my
family
.
And
so
it
was
n't
something
that
I
ever
formed
a
committee
or
raised
money
or
,
started
campaigning
or
reaching
out
to
people
to
build
support
.
But
it
did
get
in
the
press
.
