Introduction
</head>
<p>
Designed
scaffolds
should
be
biocompatible
and
biodegradable
,
capable
of
producing
an
extracellular
matrix
(
ECM
)
by
supporting
the
cell
’s
adhesion
and
proliferation
.
They
should
also
have
porosity
to
promote
nutrient
transportation
,
and
their
mechanical
properties
should
be
similar
to
native
tissue
.
To
meet
these
requirements
,
a
high
surface
area
and
an
interconnected
three-dimensional
(
3D
)
porous
structure
with
sizes
ranging
between
200
and
600
μm
are
essential
,
while
also
providing
nutrient
transfer
,
waste
disposal
,
cellular
infiltration
,
neovascularization
,
and
cell
proliferation
.
</p>
<p>
Natural
polymers
are
preferred
materials
for
producing
scaffolds
,
due
to
their
better
overall
interactions
with
various
cell
types
,
and
their
lack
of
toxicity
.
However
,
synthetic
polymers
are
cheaper
and
allow
chemical
functionalization
to
assist
cell
adhesion
despite
the
immune
response
.
The
preferred
synthetic
polymers
used
for
scaffold
synthesis
include
poly(l-lactic
acid
)
(
PLLA
)
,
poly(glycolic
acid
)
(
PGA
)
,
poly(caprolactone
)
(
PCL
)
,
and
poly(lactic-
<hi rend="italic">
co
</hi>
-glycolic
)
acid
(
PLGA
)
.
Composites
with
natural
polymers
are
also
available
with
better
hydrophilicity
,
cell
attachment
,
and
biodegradability
.
The
most
used
biopolymers
are
chitosan
,
alginate
(
Alg
)
,
collagen
(
Col
)
,
gelatin
(
Gn
)
,
silk
fibroin
(
SF
)
,
and
glycosaminoglycans
(
GAGs
)
.
</p>
<p>
Chitosan
(
CS
)
,
a
natural
polymer
obtained
from
the
partial
deacetylation
of
chitin
,
is
one
of
the
most
common
biopolymers
on
earth
.
It
is
present
in
the
shells
of
crustaceans
such
as
crab
and
shrimp
.
CS
has
many
desirable
properties
for
tissue
engineering
such
as
biocompatibility
,
non-toxicity
,
and
biodegradability
.
CS
was
used
in
several
tissue-engineering
applications
involving
bone
,
cartilage
,
liver
,
tendons
,
ligaments
and
nerves
,
wound
healing
,
separation
membranes
,
blood
anticoagulants
,
contact
lenses
,
controlled
release
of
drugs
,
fat-sequestering
agent
,
hydrogel
preparations
,
and
food
packaging
material
.
CS
was
evaluated
for
bone
tissue
engineering
(
BTE
)
with
good
cell
adhesion
and
proliferation
observed
.
CS
composites
with
different
materials
such
as
ceramics
,
nanofillers
,
and
polymers
were
evaluated
for
BTE
with
excellent
biocompatibility
and
cell
proliferation
results
.
It
was
recognized
that
amine
and
hydroxyl
groups
facilitate
the
addition
of
side
groups
for
cell
incorporation
and
recognition
in
BTE
.
However
,
like
many
other
polysaccharides
,
it
presents
some
disadvantages
such
as
poor
mechanical
properties
,
poor
solubility
in
conventional
solvents
,
and
poor
stability
in
physiological
media
due
to
the
high
amount
of
hydrogen
bonding
.

Many
studies
addressed
the
physicochemical
attributes
of
nanocomposite
polymers
thanks
to
their
effectiveness
in
overcoming
the
disadvantages
of
naturally
occurring
polymers
.
Our
group
investigated
the
use
of
nanocomposites
based
on
graphene
oxide
and
chitosan
for
applications
in
tissue
engineering
.
Even
with
the
nanofillers
,
there
is
still
a
need
to
achieve
better
mechanical
and
thermal
stability
combined
with
higher
biocompatibility
in
nanocomposites
of
chitosan
and
carbon
nanomaterials
.
</p>
<p>
Carbon
nano-onions
(
CNOs
)
are
multi-shell
fullerenes
of
5
to
10
nm
,
discovered
by
Ugarte
in
1992
upon
impacting
carbon
nanostructures
with
an
electron
beam
through
a
TEM
experiment
.
For
the
chemical
derivatization
of
CNOs
,
various
synthetic
routes
were
applied
,
introducing
new
functional
groups
that
increase
their
application
possibilities
.
Some
potential
uses
include
optical
applications
,
catalysis
,
and
gas
storage
.
CNOs
are
also
useful
in
photovoltaic
and
fuel
cell
applications
.
They
demonstrated
a
superior
lubrication
ability
compared
to
conventional
lubricants
.
</p>
<p>
However
,
there
are
few
reports
of
CS
and
CNO
composites
in
the
literature
.
The
electrochemical
properties
of
composites
consisting
of
CNOs
and
poly(diallyl
dimethylammonium
chloride
)
(
PDDA
)
or
chitosan
(
CS
)
were
reported
.
The
lack
of
literature
regarding
nanocomposites
of
CS
and
oxidized
(
ox-)CNOs
for
biomedical
applications
is
evident
.
Very
few
studies
were
carried
out
to
determine
the
cytotoxicity
of
CNOs
.
They
were
even
used
for
the
treatment
of
cancer
;
however
,
many
more
studies
are
still
required
to
show
whether
they
are
toxic
or
if
,
on
the
contrary
,
they
promote
cell
adhesion
and
proliferation
,
while
facilitating
the
recognition
and
permanence
of
scaffolds
in
animal
tissues
without
immune
responses
.
There
is
a
lack
of
information
on
their
characterization
including
the
physical
,
chemical
,
and
mechanical
evaluation
of
nanocomposite
films
based
on
CS/poly(vinyl
alcohol
)
(
PVA)/ox-CNO
,
together
with
biological
tests
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
.
The
results
of
this
investigation
will
allow
collecting
toxicological
information
for
these
nanocomposites
,
as
well
as
evaluating
their
possible
application
in
tissue
engineering
.
Therefore
,
this
research
investigates
nanocomposite
films
of
PVA/CS
reinforced
with
ox-CNOs
for
biocompatibility
studies
at
90
days
of
subdermal
implantation
in
biomodel
skin
.
