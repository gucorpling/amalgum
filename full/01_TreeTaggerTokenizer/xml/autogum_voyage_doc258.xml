<p>
One
of
the
most
characteristic
traditional
settlements
on
mount
Pelion
.
It
is
filled
with
mansions
and
houses
from
the
<ref target="Ottoman%20Empire">
Ottoman
era
</ref>
that
look
like
hanging
ornaments
on
the
green
mountain
side
and
are
colorful
(
but
not
as
<ref target="Portaria">
Portaria
</ref>
)
.
Many
of
these
have
been
restored
into
restaurants
and
guesthouses
.
It
sits
on
a
slope
of
the
Pelion
range
and
another
mountaintop
to
the
east
with
forests
,
at
a
height
of
about
above
sea
level
.
The
square
with
age-old
trees
lends
a
panoramic
view
of
Volos
and
the
Pagasetic
Gulf
.
In
one
of
the
traditional
coffee
houses
there
is
a
big
fresco
by
the
20th
century
naïve
folkloristic
artist
<hi rend="italic">
Theofilos
</hi>
.
The
picturesque
cobbled
paths
of
Makrinitsa
are
scattered
with
traditional
water
fountains
.
Makrynitsa
,
with
a
population
of
about
900
people
,
has
a
school
,
a
lyceum
,
a
church
,
a
post
office
and
a
square
(
plateia
)
with
tall
trees
.
</p>
<p>
Orientation
in
Makrinitsa
is
made
more
difficult
by
the
fact
that
village
streets
are
not
named
.
Every
place
has
got
the
address
&quot;
Makrinitsa
370
11
&quot;
.
Fortunately
Makrinitsa
is
not
very
large
,
and
you
can
easily
orient
yourself
by
the
pedestrian
main
street
,
on
which
you
will
find
the
town
square
and
the
village
church
.
