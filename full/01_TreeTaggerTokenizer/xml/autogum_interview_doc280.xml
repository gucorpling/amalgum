It
was
a
pleasant
surprise
.
I
do
n't
think
we
had
realised
what
the
barriers
schools
faced
in
using
the
main
Wikipedia
were
.
It
is
n't
just
pupils
posting
material
about
teachers
or
meeting
strangers
:
the
&quot;
Random
Article
&quot;
button
on
every
page
could
potentially
deliver
an
article
on
hardcore
porn
.
We
had
already
started
when
discussion
broke
on
banning
Wikipedia
from
classrooms
and
I
am
sure
we
benefited
from
it
.

Can
you
give
an
outline
of
the
selection
and
vetting
process
?
Is
it
primarily
Wikipedians
working
on
this
,
or
are
people
from
the
educational
establishment
brought
in
?

It
was
a
long
and
painful
process
,
even
with
a
really
good
database
system
.
Articles
were
taken
into
the
proposal
funnel
from
three
main
sources
:
direct
proposals
for
inclusion
from
Wikipedians
,
lists
which
came
from
the
Release
Version
team
and
proposals
drawn
up
from
working
through
National
Curriculum
subjects
by
SOS
volunteers
.
In
a
few
cases
where
we
felt
articles
were
missing
we
asked
the
community
to
write
them
(
e.
g.
Portal
:
Early
Modern
Britain
,
which
is
a
curriculum
subject
,
was
kindly
written
just
for
us
)
:
These
&quot;
proposals
&quot;
were
then
looked
at
by
mainly
SOS
volunteers
(
some
onwiki
,
some
offline
)
.
Our
offices
are
in
the
middle
of
Cambridge
and
we
get
high
quality
volunteers
,
who
skim
read
each
article
and
then
compared
two
versions
from
the
article
history
by
credible
WP
editors
a
significant
period
apart
(
this
picks
up
most
graffiti
vandalism
which
runs
at
about
3
%
of
articles
)
.
Once
they
had
identified
a
&quot;
best
&quot;
version
they
marked
any
sections
or
text
strings
for
deletion
(
sections
which
were
just
a
list
of
links
to
other
articles
not
included
,
empty
sections
,
sex
scandals
etc
)
.
A
substantial
sample
of
each
volunteers
work
was
then
doubled
checked
for
quality
by
one
of
two
office
staff
(
of
whom
I
was
one
)
.
We
then
have
a
script
which
does
some
automated
removals
and
clean
ups
.
Once
we
had
a
selection
we
posted
it
to
relevant
wikiprojects
and
a
few
&quot;
experts
&quot;
and
got
any
extra
steers
.

Will
you
be
making
use
of
BitTorrent
for
distribution
again
this
year
?
Was
it
a
success
in
2007
?

BitTorrent
was
a
bit
disappointing
in
that
it
got
us
the
only
substantial
criticisms
we
received
online
.
A
lot
of
people
find
it
too
much
effort
to
use
.
However
for
the
period
we
offered
a
straight
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/http">
http
</ref>
:
download
we
had
huge
problems
with
spiders
eating
vast
bandwidth
(
the
file
is
3.5G
:
a
few
thousand
rogue
spider
downloads
and
it
starts
to
hurt
)
.
As
per
last
year
therefore
our
main
two
channels
will
be
free
download
by
BitTorrent
and
mailing
the
DVDs
free
all
over
the
world
.
At
a
pinch
we
will
(
as
before
)
put
straight
copies
up
for
individuals
who
cannot
get
it
any
other
way
,
and
we
have
some
copies
on
memory
sticks
for
on
distributors
.
