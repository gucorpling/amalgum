Prune
Limelight
Hydrangeas
</head>
<p>
Limelight
hydrangeas
are
a
type
of
woody
hydrangea
that
bloom
in
the
spring
.
They
produce
large
flowers
that
are
notorious
for
their
football
shape
and
their
rich
coloring
.
Limelight
hydrangeas
are
a
beautiful
addition
to
your
yard
or
landscape
,
and
if
you
have
them
,
you
might
be
wondering
how
to
take
care
of
them
.
All
you
have
to
do
is
cut
your
hydrangea
back
when
it
is
getting
too
big
,
remove
all
your
dead
flower
heads
,
and
thin
out
your
plant
,
and
you
’ll
be
pruning
your
limelight
hydrangea
like
a
professional
.

Deciding
When
to
Prune
</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Prune
in
late
winter/early
spring
when
your
plant
is
winterized
.
You
can
prune
limelight
hydrangeas
at
any
time
of
the
year
,
because
they
are
hearty
plants
.
However
,
it
is
easiest
to
prune
them
in
the
late
winter
or
early
spring
,
because
all
of
the
leaves
will
have
fallen
off
and
you
will
be
able
to
see
and
access
the
branches
easily
.
</item>
<item>
Cut
your
hydrangea
when
it
is
getting
too
big
for
your
space
.
You
may
have
planted
your
hydrangea
with
a
designated
area
in
mind
for
it
to
grow
.
Limelight
hydrangeas
can
grow
up
to
tall
,
so
you
might
have
to
cut
them
back
if
they
outgrow
their
space
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Hydrangeas
are
hearty
plants
,
so
cutting
them
back
wo
n’t
hurt
them
.
In
fact
,
it
helps
them
grow
bigger
and
faster
.
</item>

</item>
<item>
Trim
your
hydrangea
if
the
flowers
make
the
branches
droop
.
Sometimes
,
limelight
hydrangeas
will
produce
so
many
flowers
that
their
branches
ca
n’t
hold
all
of
the
weight
.
You
might
notice
that
your
plant
’s
branches
are
sagging
,
or
the
overall
shape
of
the
hydrangea
is
droopy
.
This
means
you
should
probably
thin
it
out
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Hydrangea
flowers
are
usually
fairly
large
,
and
they
can
hold
on
to
a
lot
of
water
during
the
rainy
season
.
This
makes
them
especially
heavy
.

Sanitize
your
pruners
before
starting
.
When
you
cut
parts
of
a
plant
,
you
are
leaving
it
vulnerable
to
infection
.
Clean
your
pruning
tool
with
a
mixture
of
water
and
soap
in
a
bucket
to
quickly
sanitize
your
tool
.
You
do
n’t
have
to
spend
a
lot
of
time
on
this
step
,
but
make
sure
your
pruners
are
clean
before
you
start
cutting
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
You
can
buy
hand
pruners
at
most
hardware
or
home
improvement
stores
.

Cut
off
all
the
old
flower
heads
.
Your
hydrangea
will
still
have
its
old
flowers
on
it
from
the
previous
year
’s
bloom
.
These
flowers
are
dead
,
as
you
’ll
probably
be
able
to
tell
by
their
color
and
dried
out
feel
.
Start
by
cutting
these
flower
heads
off
at
their
base
.
</item>
<item>
Clip
branches
above
nodes
at
an
angle
.
Look
for
the
nodes
on
the
branches
of
your
hydrangea
.
These
will
look
like
two
small
bumps
next
to
each
other
.
The
nodes
are
what
create
new
growth
.
Clip
right
above
those
so
that
they
stay
on
your
plant
and
make
it
easier
for
it
to
create
new
branches
.
Always
clip
at
an
angle
so
that
water
does
n’t
pool
on
top
of
where
you
cut
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
If
the
nodes
are
hard
to
see
,
use
your
fingers
to
feel
for
two
pin-head
sized
bumps
that
are
side
by
side
.
</item>

</item>
<item>
Cut
the
hydrangea
down
to
half
its
size
to
keep
it
small
.
If
you
’d
like
to
stop
your
hydrangea
from
getting
too
big
,
you
can
cut
it
down
to
half
of
its
size
.
Limelight
hydrangeas
in
particular
are
great
at
coming
back
from
huge
chops
,
and
your
plant
will
have
no
problem
recovering
from
being
cut
down
like
this
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Do
n’t
cut
your
hydrangea
shorter
than
above
the
ground
.
Any
shorter
,
and
it
might
be
too
hard
for
your
plant
to
grow
back
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Cut
off
long
branches
to
make
it
look
uniform
.
If
you
’d
like
your
plant
to
grow
in
a
more
uniform
manner
,
you
can
cut
off
any
long
or
straggling
branches
that
are
sticking
out
and
making
it
look
messy
.
Simply
cut
them
down
to
where
they
are
even
with
the
rest
of
the
branches
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Pruning
like
this
is
entirely
up
to
your
stylistic
discretion
.
You
can
choose
to
shape
your
hydrangea
however
you
’d
like
.
Just
remember
that
it
will
grow
leaves
and
new
flowers
in
the
spring
.
</item>

</item>
<item>
Remove
smaller
branches
to
declutter
your
plant
.
If
you
want
your
plant
to
have
flowers
that
are
bigger
,
you
can
cut
away
any
small
branches
from
the
base
of
your
hydrangea
.
This
will
send
all
of
the
plant
’s
energy
into
the
large
branches
when
it
is
time
to
bloom
,
and
give
you
big
,
beautiful
flowers
.
You
can
also
leave
the
small
branches
in
your
plant
to
give
it
more
flowers
,
but
they
will
be
smaller
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Try
leaving
the
small
branches
in
your
hydrangea
for
a
season
and
see
how
the
flowers
look
.
If
they
are
too
small
,
you
can
cut
them
out
in
the
winter
.
