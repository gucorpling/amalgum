Could
the
OASIS
be
real
?
</head>
<sp who="#AGuyNamedJacob">
<p>
I
’ve
both
seen
the
movie
and
read
the
book
,
and
(
probably
like
most
of
you
)
the
only
thing
i
want
in
life
right
now
is
for
the
OASIS
to
be
a
thing
.
I
’ve
been
thinking
and
reading
up
about
it
,
and
here
’s
some
conclusions
I
’ve
came
to
.
(
Keep
in
mind
,
I
’m
not
a
game
designer
,
these
are
just
my
thoughts
)

<hi rend="bold">
The
World
</hi>
The
OASIS
is
basically
just
a
gigantic
VR
MMO
.
We
already
have
MMO
’s
,
and
i
do
n’t
see
how
hard
it
would
be
to
convert
one
over
to
VR
.
We
already
see
VR
multiplayer
experiences
such
as
Rec
Room
and
VR
chat
.
The
only
problem
i
see
is
a
server
overload
,
where
so
many
people
are
on
at
once
that
no
one
can
join
.
My
solution
to
this
would
be
to
split
each
planet
(
or
maybe
each
sector
on
each
planet
)
into
its
own
server
,
so
the
entire
OASIS
would
n’t
crash
.
The
open
world
would
n’t
be
a
problem
seeing
as
we
also
have
things
like
Skyrim
for
the
VR
.

<hi rend="bold">
The
Technology
</hi>
The
tech
in
RPO
is
probably
the
most
believable
thing
.
VR
companies
are
already
working
on
wireless
VR
headsets
and
haptic
gloves
,
so
things
such
as
haptic
suits
and
treadmills
that
simulate
walking
do
n’t
sound
so
far
off
.
The
most
far
out
thing
about
the
OASIS
is
it
’s
extremely
life-like
graphics
,
which
VR
systems
do
n’t
have
just
yet
,
but
are
entirely
possible
.

<hi rend="bold">
The
Singular
OASIS
</hi>
The
idea
of
a
single
OASIS
is
far-fetched
.
Many
companies
will
try
to
make
their
own
OASIS
’s
,
and
on
top
of
that
,
there
’ll
probably
not
be
one
VR
console
to
rule
them
all
,
like
in
RPO
.
Personally
,
i
see
this
as
a
good
thing
,
because
it
will
prove
healthy
competition
for
the
OASIS
that
will
be
the
most
popular
.
(
Think
Apple
and
Microsoft
,
Xbox
and
PlayStation
,
or
Uber
and
Lyft
)
.

<hi rend="bold">
The
Pop-Culture
References
</hi>
In
RPO
,
a
big
part
of
the
OASIS
is
the
constant
stream
of
Pop
culture
.
(
Think
copyrighted
songs
and
characters
)
.
For
one
OASIS
to
have
access
to
every
piece
of
80
’s
culture
is
ridiculous
(
Unless
this
OASIS
is
made
after
the
copyright
wears
off
,
and
they
can
use
it
freely
)
,
although
possible
.
Even
then
,
users
could
possibly
use
mods
to
get
things
that
ca
n’t
be
put
in
the
vanilla
game
.
Different
video
games
,
movie
companies
,
and
musicians
would
want
to
cash
in
on
the
VR
craze
and
might
be
willing
to
have
their
things
used
in
the
OASIS
.
These
are
just
some
of
my
thoughts
,
but
like
i
said
,
I
’m
not
an
expert
on
any
of
it
.
Please
post
your
thoughts
or
updates
for
a
real
OASIS
comments
.
Thanks
for
reading
my
ideas

There
’s
a
game
called
Secondlife
which
has
been
around
for
many
years
.
It
’s
probably
the
closest
thing
to
the
OASIS
in
terms
of
its
scale
,
being
whoever
you
want
to
be
,
creating
the
world
you
live
in
,
in-game
economy
etc.
When
you
search
RP1
on
Google
there
’s
even
an
ad
for
Secondlife
!
</p>
<p>
In
terms
of
copyright
in
SL
,
I
’m
sure
there
is
a
cease
and
desist
procedure
in
place
but
lots
of
real
world
brands
are
on
board
and
make
a
profit
in
game
already
,
if
a
user
number
of
say
500K
was
to
jump
to
billions
I
’m
sure
they
’d
soon
realise
it
’s
the
best
place
to
sell
your
product
.
Much
like
the
jump
to
online
shopping
and
the
advertising
that
came
with
this
,
companies
are
now
spending
more
money
on
social
media
ads
than
real
life
ads
.
</p>
<p>
The
founders
(
Linden
Labs
)
have
also
recently
released
a
VR
version
called
Project
Sansar
which
pretty
much
moves
Secondlife
into
the
world
of
VR
,
looks
like
a
really
interesting
place
.
</p>
<p>
In
terms
of
people
living
inside
an
online
virtual
world
,
I
guess
we
’re
already
doing
that
stuck
to
our
phones
constantly
...
wearing
the
device
on
our
faces
everyday
(
excl
Tues
and
Thurs
)
;
)
probably
is
n’t
that
far
away
.
</p>
<p>
I
guess
there
’s
also
the
problem
of
people
actually
being
on
board
with
VR
.
3D
TVs
were
groundbreaking
at
the
time
and
yet
now
they
seem
like
a
gimmick
.
The
sheer
about
of
people
logged
into
the
OASIS
makes
sense
because
they
had
to
,
as
a
means
of
survival
-
but
getting
the
general
population
on
board
without
a
reason
would
take
many
years
and
I
’m
sure
there
would
be
some
insane
data
breach
revelation
before
that
time
came
anyway
haha
.
People
are
n’t
as
honest
as
Wade
-
as
we
’ve
seen
with
the
latest
Facebook
scandal
.
</p>
<p>
Sorry
for
the
long
post
,
it
’s
1am
and
I
’m
feeling
profound
.
Let
’s
have
a
discussion
!
