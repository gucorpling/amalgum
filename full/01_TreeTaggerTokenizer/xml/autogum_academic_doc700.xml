Spatial
Distribution
of
Geotagged
Photos
</head>
<p>
The
locations
of
the
geotagged
photos
were
mapped
using
ArcGIS10.3
software
based
on
their
coordinates
.
Popular
destination
regions
for
inbound
tourists
,
which
were
obtained
using
kernel
density
analysis
,
are
shown
in
<figure>
Figure

.
Cities
with
the
highest
aggregate
number
of
geotagged
photos
are
distributed
within
three
large
regions
,
which
include
the
Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei
Region
(
where
Beijing
is
the
regional
central
city
)
,
the
Yangtze
River
Delta
Zone
(
where
Shanghai
,
Suzhou
,
and
Hangzhou
are
regional
central
cities
)
,
and
the
Pearl
River
Delta
Zone
(
where
Guangzhou
and
Shenzhen
are
regional
central
cities
)
.
These
regions
are
China
’s
political
and
economic
centers
,
and
constitute
the
core
of
China
’s
cultural
heritage
.
Secondary
concentration
regions
are
primarily
centered
on
the
cities
of
Xi’an
and
Chengdu
.
Moreover
,
small-scale
concentrations
are
also
found
around
Guilin
(
Guangxi
Zhuang
Autonomous
Region
)
,
Lijiang
(
Yunnan
Province
)
,
Lhasa
(
Tibet
Autonomous
Region
)
,
and
Dalian
(
Liaoning
Province
)
.
These
observations
show
that
inbound
tourists
seek
out
China
’s
unique
natural
landscapes
,
cultural
heritage
,
and
economic
development
centers
.
</p>
<p>
To
further
explore
the
cities
’
popularity
,
we
calculate
the
number
of
inbound
tourists
in
each
city
.
The
top
20
most
visited
cities
are
shown
in
Table
1
.
We
then
classify
those
cities
into
three
tiers
using
the
Nature
Breaks
method
.
Natural
Breaks
classes
are
based
on
natural
groupings
inherent
in
the
data
.
Class
breaks
are
identified
that
best
group
similar
values
and
that
maximize
the
differences
between
classes
.
Beijing
and
Shanghai
are
in
the
first
tier
since
the
number
of
inbound
tourists
in
Beijing
and
Shanghai
is
much
larger
than
in
any
other
city
.
The
second
tier
is
constituted
of
traditional
tourist
destinations
such
as
Xi’an
,
Guilin
,
Guangzhou
,
Suzhou
,
and
Hangzhou
.
The
third
tier
consists
of
newly
emerging
destination
cities
,
which
are
generally
in
the
central
and
western
regions
of
China
such
as
Lijiang
,
Lhasa
,
Kunming
,
Diqing
,
Dali
,
and
Aba
.
In
this
case
,
the
beautiful
natural
scenery
and
unique
ethnic
cultures
have
attracted
growing
attention
from
foreign
visitors
.
In
particular
,
Lijiang
and
Lhasa
are
already
among
the
top
10
destination
cities
.
Overall
,
traditional
destination
cities
are
still
the
most
popular
among
inbound
tourists
.
However
,
with
the
development
of
airports
,
high-speed
railway
,
and
other
transportation
services
,
the
newly
emerging
destination
cities
have
gradually
become
more
popular
.

Spatial
Structure
of
Inbound
Tourist
Flows
</head>
<p>
The
various
different
routes
chosen
by
tourists
converge
into
tourist
flows
.
The
convergence
of
flows
ultimately
forms
a
tourist
transition
network
.
The
major
tourist
flow
connections
between
tourism
nodes
constitute
the
main
spatial
characteristics
of
the
tourist
flows
network
.
In
addition
,
the
number
of
small
tourist
flow
cities
connected
to
the
node
cities
with
high
tourist
flows
determine
the
tourist
collecting
and
distributing
ability
of
cities
with
high
tourist
flows
.
Therefore
,
when
exploring
the
spatial
characteristics
of
tourist
flow
,
we
first
calculate
the
tourist
flow
connections
between
cities
and
describe
the
spatial
framework
formed
by
major
inbound
flows
.
Next
,
we
discuss
the
characteristics
of
tourist
movements
between
major
tourist-node
cities
.
Lastly
,
we
identify
urban
agglomeration
regions
with
high
spatial
concentrations
of
inbound
tourists
to
examine
the
travel
patterns
in
these
regions
.
