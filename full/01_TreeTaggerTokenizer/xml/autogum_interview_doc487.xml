As
for
traffic
analysis
(
finding
out
who
you
are
talking
to
rather
than
finding
out
what
you
are
telling
to
whom
)
,
NSA
and
GCHQ
are
known
to
have
access
to
lots
of
traffic
(
part
of
this
is
obtained
via
the
UK-USA
agreement
)
.
Even
if
one
uses
strong
encryption
,
it
is
feasible
for
them
to
log
the
IP
addresses
and
email
addresses
of
all
the
parties
you
are
connecting
to
.
If
necessary
,
they
can
even
make
routers
re-route
your
traffic
to
their
servers
.
In
addition
,
the
European
Data
Retention
directive
forces
all
operators
to
store
such
traffic
data
.

<hi rend="italic">
Whether
other
companies
would
have
complied
with
such
requests
:
this
is
very
hard
to
tell
.
I
believe
however
that
it
is
very
plausible
that
companies
such
as
Google
,
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Skype">
Skype
</ref>
or
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Facebook">
Facebook
</ref>
would
comply
with
such
requests
if
they
came
from
a
government
.

&quot;
<hi rend="italic">
In
summary
:
unless
you
go
through
great
lengths
to
log
through
to
several
computers
in
multiple
countries
,
you
work
in
a
clean
virtual
machine
,
you
use
private
browser
settings
(
do
n't
accept
cookies
,
no
plugins
for
Firefox
,
etc.
)
and
use
tools
such
as
Tor
,
it
is
rather
easy
for
any
service
provider
to
identify
you
.

Finally
:
I
prefer
not
to
be
quoted
on
any
sentences
in
which
I
make
statements
on
the
capabilities
or
actions
of
any
particular
government

Were
the
US
Government
to
obtain
the
sought
data
,
it
would
seem
reasonable
the
NSA
would
handle
further
investigation
.
How
would
you
expect
them
to
exploit
the
data
and
expand
on
what
they
receive
from
Twitter
?

<list type="unordered">

:
</hi>
My
understanding
is
that
the
DOJ
is
requesting
the
following
information
:
1
)
Connection
records
and
session
times
2
)
IP
addresses
3
)
e-mail
addresses
4
)
banking
info
</item>
</list>
<p>
By
requesting
1
)
and
2
)
for
Birgitta
and
other
people
involved
with
WikiLeaks
(
WL
)
since
2009
,
one
could
derive
2
main
[
pieces
of
]
information
.

<p>
First
,
he
could
tell
the
mobility
of
these
people
.
Recent
research
in
networking
shows
that
you
can
map
an
IP
address
into
a
geographic
location
with
a
median
error
of
600
meters
.
So
by
looking
at
changes
of
IP
addresses
in
time
for
a
Twitter
user
,
one
could
tell
(
or
at
least
speculate
about
)
where
that
person
has
been
.
</p>
<p>
Second
,
by
correlating
locations
of
different
people
involved
with
WL
in
time
,
one
could
possibly
derive
their
interactions
and
maybe
even
their
level
of
involvement
with
WL
.
Whether
it
is
possible
to
derive
this
information
from
1
)
and
2
)
depends
on
how
this
people
use
Twitter
.
For
example
,
do
they
log
on
Twitter
often
enough
,
long
enough
,
and
from
enough
places
?
