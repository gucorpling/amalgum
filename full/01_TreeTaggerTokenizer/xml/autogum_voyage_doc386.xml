Waterval
Boven
is
a
small
country
village
situated
on
the
Transvaal
Drakensberg
Escarpment
smack
bang
in
the
middle
of
Mpumalanga
province
.
The
town
started
out
in
the
early
1890s
when
the
steep
gradients
called
for
tunnels
and
bridges
to
be
built
for
the
line
between
Pretoria
and
Delagoa
Bay
(
Maputo
)
.
'
Boven
's
main
industry
was
the
railway
operations
until
the
1990s
when
operations
were
scaled
down
.
</p>
<p>
The
town
was
named
after
the
75
m
Elands
River
Waterval
just
outside
town
.
The
translation
from
the
old
Dutch
is
&quot;
Above
the
waterfall
&quot;
.
</p>
<p>
This
is
only
one
of
the
waterfalls
nestled
in
the
valleys
surrounding
'
Boven
.
</p>
<p>
Today
Waterval
Boven
is
a
retreat
for
rock
climbers
,
mountain
bikers
,
fly
fishermen
and
anybody
who
just
wants
to
enjoy
nature
and
the
slow
rhythm
of
country
life
