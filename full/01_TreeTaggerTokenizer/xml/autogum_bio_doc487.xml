there
is
little
to

him
with

Crawfurd
wrote
of
Richardson
:
</p>
<p>
He
appears
to
have
been
a
very
wise
moderate
man
;
for
so
far
as
I
can
observe
from
the
history
of
these
times
,
he
kept
himself
more
in
a
neutrality
,
and
was
less
a
party-man
than
any
other
that
held
any
great
office
about
the
court
.
He
was
never
violent
against
the
Queen
,
tho
'
he
complied
with
the
Government
under
the
young
King

In
