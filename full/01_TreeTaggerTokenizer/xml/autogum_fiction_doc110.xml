THE
RELUCTANT
DRAGON
</head>
<p>
Footprints
in
the
snow
have
been
unfailing
provokers
of
sentiment
ever
since
snow
was
first
a
white
wonder
in
this
drab-coloured
world
of
ours
.
In
a
poetry-book
presented
to
one
of
us
by
an
aunt
,
there
was
a
poem
by
one
Wordsworth
in
which
they
stood
out
strongly
--
with
a
picture
all
to
themselves
,
too
--
but
we
did
n't
think
very
highly
either
of
the
poem
or
the
sentiment
.
Footprints
in
the
sand
,
now
,
were
quite
another
matter
,
and
we
grasped
Crusoe
's
attitude
of
mind
much
more
easily
than
Wordsworth
's
.
Excitement
and
mystery
,
curiosity
and
suspense
--
these
were
the
only
sentiments
that
tracks
,
whether
in
sand
or
in
snow
,
were
able
to
arouse
in
us
.
</p>
<p>
We
had
awakened
early
that
winter
morning
,
puzzled
at
first
by
the
added
light
that
filled
the
room
.
Then
,
when
the
truth
at
last
fully
dawned
on
us
and
we
knew
that
snow-balling
was
no
longer
a
wistful
dream
,
but
a
solid
certainty
waiting
for
us
outside
,
it
was
a
mere
brute
fight
for
the
necessary
clothes
,
and
the
lacing
of
boots
seemed
a
clumsy
invention
,
and
the
buttoning
of
coats
an
unduly
tedious
form
of
fastening
,
with
all
that
snow
going
to
waste
at
our
very
door
.
</p>
<p>
When
dinner-time
came
we
had
to
be
dragged
in
by
the
scruff
of
our
necks
.
The
short
armistice
over
,
the
combat
was
resumed
;
but
presently
Charlotte
and
I
,
a
little
weary
of
contests
and
of
missiles
that
ran
shudderingly
down
inside
one
's
clothes
,
forsook
the
trampled
battle-field
of
the
lawn
and
went
exploring
the
blank
virgin
spaces
of
the
white
world
that
lay
beyond
.
It
stretched
away
unbroken
on
every
side
of
us
,
this
mysterious
soft
garment
under
which
our
familiar
world
had
so
suddenly
hidden
itself
.
Faint
imprints
showed
where
a
casual
bird
had
alighted
,
but
of
other
traffic
there
was
next
to
no
sign
;
which
made
these
strange
tracks
all
the
more
puzzling
.
</p>
<p>
We
came
across
them
first
at
the
corner
of
the
shrubbery
,
and
pored
over
them
long
,
our
hands
on
our
knees
.
Experienced
trappers
that
we
knew
ourselves
to
be
,
it
was
annoying
to
be
brought
up
suddenly
by
a
beast
we
could
not
at
once
identify
.
</p>
<p>
“
Do
n't
you
know
?
”
said
Charlotte
,
rather
scornfully
.
“
Thought
you
knew
all
the
beasts
that
ever
was
.
”
</p>
<p>
This
put
me
on
my
mettle
,
and
I
hastily
rattled
off
a
string
of
animal
names
embracing
both
the
arctic
and
the
tropic
zones
,
but
without
much
real
confidence
.
</p>
<p>
“
No
,
”
said
Charlotte
,
on
consideration
;
“
they
wo
n't
any
of
'
em
quite
do
.
Seems
like
something
LIZARDY
.
Did
you
say
a
iguanodon
?
Might
be
that
,
p'raps
.
But
that
's
not
British
,
and
we
want
a
real
British
beast
.
<hi rend="italic">
I
</hi>
think
it
's
a
dragon
!
”
</p>
<p>
“
'
T
is
n't
half
big
enough
,
”
I
objected
.
</p>
<p>
“
Well
,
all
dragons
must
be
small
to
begin
with
,
”
said
Charlotte
:
“
like
everything
else
.
P'raps
this
is
a
little
dragon
who
's
got
lost
.
A
little
dragon
would
be
rather
nice
to
have
.
He
might
scratch
and
spit
,
but
he
could
n't
DO
anything
really
.
Let
's
track
him
down
!
”
</p>
<p>
So
we
set
off
into
the
wide
snow-clad
world
,
hand
in
hand
,
our
hearts
big
with
expectation
,
--
complacently
confident
that
by
a
few
smudgy
traces
in
the
snow
we
were
in
a
fair
way
to
capture
a
half-grown
specimen
of
a
fabulous
beast
.
</p>
<p>
We
ran
the
monster
across
the
paddock
and
along
the
hedge
of
the
next
field
,
and
then
he
took
to
the
road
like
any
tame
civilized
tax-payer
.
Here
his
tracks
became
blended
with
and
lost
among
more
ordinary
footprints
,
but
imagination
and
a
fixed
idea
will
do
a
great
deal
,
and
we
were
sure
we
knew
the
direction
a
dragon
would
naturally
take
.
The
traces
,
too
,
kept
reappearing
at
intervals
--
at
least
Charlotte
maintained
they
did
,
and
as
it
was
HER
dragon
I
left
the
following
of
the
slot
to
her
and
trotted
along
peacefully
,
feeling
that
it
was
an
expedition
anyhow
and
something
was
sure
to
come
out
of
it
.
</p>
<p>
Charlotte
took
me
across
another
field
or
two
,
and
through
a
copse
,
and
into
a
fresh
road
;
and
I
began
to
feel
sure
it
was
only
her
confounded
pride
that
made
her
go
on
pretending
to
see
dragon-tracks
instead
of
owning
she
was
entirely
at
fault
,
like
a
reasonable
person
.
At
last
she
dragged
me
excitedly
through
a
gap
in
a
hedge
of
an
obviously
private
character
;
the
waste
,
open
world
of
field
and
hedge-row
disappeared
,
and
we
found
ourselves
in
a
garden
,
well-kept
,
secluded
,
most
un-dragon-haunted
in
appearance
.
Once
inside
,
I
knew
where
we
were
.
This
was
the
garden
of
my
friend
the
circus-man
,
though
I
had
never
approached
it
before
by
a
lawless
gap
,
from
this
unfamiliar
side
.
</p>
<p>
And
here
was
the
circus-man
himself
,
placidly
smoking
a
pipe
as
he
strolled
up
and
down
the
walks
.
I
stepped
up
to
him
and
asked
him
politely
if
he
had
lately
seen
a
Beast
.
</p>
<p>
“
May
I
inquire
,
”
he
said
,
with
all
civility
,
“
what
particular
sort
of
a
Beast
you
may
happen
to
be
looking
for
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
It
's
a
LIZARDY
sort
of
Beast
,
”
I
explained
.
“
Charlotte
says
it
's
a
dragon
,
but
she
does
n't
really
know
much
about
beasts
.
”
</p>
<p>
The
circus-man
looked
round
about
him
slowly
.
“
I
do
n't
THINK
,
”
he
said
,
“
that
I
've
seen
a
dragon
in
these
parts
recently
.
But
if
I
come
across
one
I
'll
know
it
belongs
to
you
,
and
I
'll
have
him
taken
round
to
you
at
once
.
