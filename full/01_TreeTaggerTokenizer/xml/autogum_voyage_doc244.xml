the
Morgantown

was
supposed
to
be
the
future
of
public
transportation
in
the
1970s
but
found
no
takers
elsewhere
after
cost
overruns
and
delays

WVU
sports
teams
are
undoubtedly
Morgantown
's
highest-profile
attraction
.
The
Mountaineers
field
teams
in
seven
men
's
sports
,
10
women
's
sports
,
and
one
coeducational
sport
(
rifle
shooting
)
,
mostly
as
members
of
the
Big
12
Conference
.
As
at
most
other
big
schools
,
the
football
and
men
's
basketball
teams
are
the
biggest
draws
.
Notably
,
when
WVU
fills
Milan
Puskar
Stadium
for
football
games
,
the
stadium
becomes
the
largest
&quot;
city
&quot;
in
the
state
by
a
healthy
margin
.
While
a
small
number
of
WVU
fans
are
n't
exactly
friendly
to
opposing
fans
,
violence
is
largely
nonexistent
,
and
neutral
visitors
should
have
no
trouble
.
Like
the
WVU
campus
,
the
school
's
main
athletic
venues
are
disjointed
—
the
football
stadium
is
at
the
Health
Sciences
campus
;
the
WVU
Coliseum
(
several
indoor
sports
,
most
notably
basketball
)
and
some
other
venues
are
at
the
Evansdale
campus
;
and
the
baseball
stadium
is
at
University
Town
Centre
in
Granville
