Skive
off
Church
</head>
<p>
If
you
do
n't
want
to
go
to
church
,
you
can
try
to
get
out
of
it
.
What
you
do
will
depend
a
lot
on
your
church
,
your
family
,
and
yourself
.

Figure
out
why
you
do
n't
want
to
go
to
church
.
&quot;
I
do
n't
feel
like
it
&quot;
may
be
enough
of
a
reason
for
you
,
but
it
might
not
be
enough
for
your
family
.

Think
about
your
past
record
.
If
you
normally
like
to
go
to
church
but
you
do
n't
care
for
it
any
more
,
consider
talking
to
your
family
about
the
reason
why
.
If
you
never
liked
church
and
you
want
to
stop
going
,
go
on
to
the
next
steps
.

Be
prepared
for
resistance
.
If
your
family
goes
to
church
on
a
regular
basis
and
expects
you
to
go
along
,
you
will
have
to
either
explain
your
situation
or
bargain
with
them
.

Explain
to
your
parents
how
important
another
activity
is
to
you
if
there
's
something
specific
you
want
to
do
instead
.
Tell
them
you
will
still
keep
going
to
church
,
but
you
want
to
skip
just
this
once
.
<figure rend="Skive off Church Step 4.jpg">

</item>
<item>
Try
to
find
some
other
religious
activities
you
could
do
,
such
as
a
youth
group
,
if
you
do
n't
want
to
go
to
church
at
all
.
Offer
to
go
to
one
of
those
activities
instead
of
attending
church
with
your
parents
.

<item>
Seek
their
compassion
.
If
you
're
mature
enough
to
make
your
own
decisions
and
have
your
own
beliefs
,
explain
your
own
spiritual
situation
to
your
parents
and
family
.
Maybe
you
've
simply
lost
interest
in
their
church
,
but
you
still
share
the
same
faith
.
Or
maybe
your
spiritual
beliefs
no
longer
align
with
theirs
.
Either
way
,
try
to
spark
a
serious
talk
with
your
family
about
your
faith
and
explain
to
them
why
you
do
n't
want
to
attend
church
.
<figure rend="Skive off Church Step 6.jpg">

</item>
<item>
Confront
your
parents
if
your
own
beliefs
vary
with
their
church
's
beliefs
.
If
you
do
n't
want
to
go
because
you
feel
your
family
's
religion
is
not
right
for
you
,
think
it
over
carefully
and
articulate
the
reasons
.
Write
down
exactly
how
you
feel
,
in
as
clear
and
detailed
a
manner
as
possible
.
Think
like
you
're
presenting
an
argument
for
the
debate
team
,
so
do
n't
be
impassioned
and
irrational
about
it
.
Explain
how
you
feel
to
your
family
and
be
prepared
for
some
resistance
since
this
is
a
big
declaration
to
make
.

This
may
not
work
,
but
if
you
are
desperate
enough
,
then
say
to
your
parents
something
like
this
&quot;
Do
you
want
your
children
to
be
happy
?
&quot;
Chances
are
they
will
say
yes
.
Then
say
&quot;
Well
,
how
do
you
think
it
makes
ME
feel
to
be
dragged
to
church
without
any
say
?
&quot;
Try
to
protest
about
it
so
much
that
it
gets
on
their
nerves
and
then
you
eventually
wo
n't
have
to
go
to
church
.

Tips
</head>
<list type="unordered">
<item>
If
you
've
found
another
religion
you
prefer
to
your
family
's
tradition
,
slowly
introduce
them
to
your
new
faith
.
Do
n't
start
by
getting
a
tattoo
or
announcing
you
've
been
initiated
into
a
strange
Circle
.
Do
n't
do
anything
that
will
shock
or
scare
your
family
.
Start
by
dropping
subtle
hints
or
asking
questions
.
</item>
<item>
You
will
always
have
more
bargaining
power
with
your
family
if
your
homework
is
done
,
your
grades
are
good
,
your
appearance
is
respectable
and
your
room
is
tidy
.
If
you
want
more
leverage
,
get
these
things
in
order
before
you
start
asking
for
favors
.
</item>
<item>
Your
family
might
feel
better
about
your
spiritual
welfare
if
you
demonstrate
that
you
are
still
doing
&quot;
good
deeds
&quot;
such
as
volunteering
and
being
kind
to
others
.
</item>
<item>
You
can
try
going
to
church
and
sitting
apart
from
your
family
.
Sitting
with
people
you
like
better
might
be
more
fun
.
</item>
<item>
Remember
that
it
is
you
are
your
own
person
and
that
your
family
can
not
force
you
to
believe
anything
of
their
preference
.
</item>
<item>
You
could
try
getting
a
job
on
Sundays
to
get
out
of
having
to
go
to
church
.
</item>
<item>
If
you
have
a
job
and
it
's
Sunday
,
tell
you
're
parents
I
have
to
go
to
work
today
or
I
'll
be
late
.

Warnings
</head>
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Do
n't
try
to
get
out
of
church
by
pretending
you
're
sick
or
injured
.
At
best
,
it
will
only
work
once
or
twice
.
And
your
family
might
see
right
through
it
the
first
time
anyway
.
At
worst
,
they
may
drag
you
to
church
so
the
people
there
can
pray
for
your
healing
.
</item>
<item>
You
might
possibly
be
faced
with
the
problem
of
a
parent
that
whenever
you
even
hint
at
the
subject
,
gets
very
'
disappointed
'
and
proceeds
to
give
you
The
Spanish
Inquisition
about
your
faith
and
other
habits
.
Do
n't
be
discouraged
by
this
.
Proceed
to
explain
your
side
of
the
conversation
in
a
very
calm
,
respectful
and
mature
manner
.
Do
not
make
any
attempts
to
point
the
matter
into
argument
zone
.
If
your
parent
beings
to
get
fed
up
,
testy
,
highly
offended
,
etc.
,
back
off
.
Cautiously
bring
it
up
at
a
better
date
.
</item>
<item>
If
your
family
hints
at
the
face
that
bringing
up
the
subject
again
will
either
land
you
a
private
counseling
session
with
the
minister
or
a
month
of
grounding
,
by
no
means
continue
.
Retreat
immediately
at
all
costs
.
</item>
<item>
Consider
why
you
do
n't
want
to
go
to
church
and
be
honest
with
yourself
(
with
more
easygoing
parents
converting
to
atheism
can
be
a
great
way
to
lose
all
commitment
but
parents
may
react
badly
and
hit
you
,
force
you
to
church
weekly
and
to
confession
,
disown
you
,
and
possibly
anoint
you
regularly
with
holy
water
.
)
</item>
<item>
If
your
family
freaks
out
and
associates
skipping
out
on
church
with
the
condemnation
of
hell
,
then
you
have
a
larger
problem
.
Proceed
with
great
caution
.
</item>
<item>
Do
n't
ever
be
afraid
to
question
.
If
someone
tells
you
not
to
ask
questions
,
you
might
be
asking
the
wrong
person
or
they
might
not
know
the
answer
.
Try
going
higher
up
.
If
the
highest-ranking
church
official
you
can
find
still
refuses
to
answer
your
questions
,
then
the
church
you
're
talking
to
is
not
the
right
one
for
you
.
</item>
<item>
Just
as
there
is
no
perfect
church
or
parent
,
most
parents
and
churches
want
the
best
for
those
under
their
roof
.
Your
time
at
home
will
hopefully
be
a
small
fraction
of
your
lifetime
.
If
you
value
a
good
future
relationship
with
your
parents
,
consider
not
rocking
the
boat
while
in
their
house
.
After
all
,
it
is
just
part
of
one
day
a
week
.
