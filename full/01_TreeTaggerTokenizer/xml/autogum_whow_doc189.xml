</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Ask
the
child
you
are
watching
to
help
build
a
pillow
fort
with
you
.
Go
into
a
room
with
a
couch
.
This
will
be
the
room
your
pillow
fort
will
be
built
in
.
Measure
the
area
and
rearrange
furniture
to
accommodate
the
potential
size
of
your
fort
.
Avoid
building
your
fort
near
windows
,
doors
,
and
exterior
walls
.
</item>
<item>
Arrange
two
chairs
about
3
feet
from
the
couch
,
facing
each
other
to
make
the
other
two
corners
of
your
fort
.
These
chairs
will
also
serve
as
shelves
in
your
fort
.
</item>
<item>
Drape
a
bedsheet
over
the
top
of
the
chairs
and
the
couch
to
provide
a
roof
.
Make
sure
the
long
edge
is
covering
the
top
of
the
couch
backrest
for
a
maximized
space
.
Lightly
tug
on
the
ends
of
the
bed
sheet
to
ensure
it
is
covering
all
sides
.
</item>
<item>
Secure
the
roof
by
holding
down
the
ends
of
your
blanket
with
clean
,
heavy
items
(
books
,
large
toys
,
canned
goods
,
etc.
)
or
string
to
stabilize
your
fort
.
Make
sure
you
leave
space
for
an
entrance/exit
and
gaps
between
blankets
for
ventilation
.

Adjust
the
distance
between
your
chairs
and
the
couch
to
be
closer
together
to
prevent
the
bed
sheet
from
slipping
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Cover
the
floor
of
your
fort
with
comfortable
items
to
sit
on
.
Do
n’t
use
the
comforter
from
your
bed
,
instead
try
layering
the
floor
with
sleeping
bags
,
thick
blankets
,
and
pillows
you
do
n’t
mind
getting
dirty
.
</item>
<item>
Divide
areas
in
your
fort
with
couch
cushions
to
section
off
smaller
rooms
within
your
fort
and
add
glow
sticks
or
a
flashlight
for
lighting
.
Ask
your
child
if
they
would
like
to
bring
their
favorite
toy
or
stuffed
animal
into
the
pillow
fort
as
well
.
</item>
</list>
<list type="unordered">

Bean
bags
and
air
mattresses
make
for
enjoyable
seating
.
Make
sure
your
roof
is
high
enough
before
attempting
to
include
them
to
your
fort

Do
n’t

of
blueberries
.
They
might
look
sparse
in
the
batter
,

there

the
ingredients
together

avoid
squishing
the
blueberries
.
Your
