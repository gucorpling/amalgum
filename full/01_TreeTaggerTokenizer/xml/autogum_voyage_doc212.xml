Chaudière-Appalaches
is
a
consistently
overlooked
part
of
Quebec
,
but
it
is
an
extensive
and
beautiful
region
.
A
peculiarly
strong
local
accent
is
used
by
a
small
percentage
of
the
population
of
Chaudière-Appalaches
.
There
are
numerous
oppurtunities
for
the
pursuit
of
winter
sports
;
snowshoeing
,
cross-country
skiing
,
snowmobiling
,
skiing
and
ice
skating
are
all
readily
at
your
disposal
.
</p>
<p>
La
Beauce
is
a
cultural
and
historical
region
of
the
Chaudière
Valley
with
a
strong
identity
.
The
Beauceron
territory
has
more
than
100,000
inhabitants
.
Beauce
is
one
of
the
most
fertile
regions
of
Chaudière-Appalaches
.
</p>
<p>
Despite
cold
winters
and
a
lot
of
rainfall
,
the
region
's
humid
continental
climate
also
ensures
very
mild
and
pleasant
summers
,
conducive
to
a
number
of
outdoor
activities
.
As
for
the
vegetation
,
it
mainly
consists
of
a
mixed
forest
that
covers
74
%
of
the
area
.
Three
bioclimatic
domains
are
present
:
that
of
maple
to
linden
,
that
of
maple
to
yellow
birch
and
that
of
balsam
fir
to
yellow
birch
.

History
</head>
<p>
The
Côte-du-Sud
(
south
shore
)
was
one
of
the
first
regions
to
be
colonized
as
part
of
New
France
in
the
1650s
.
By
the
end
of
the
French
regime
,
the
region
's
population
was
about
10,000
of
the
60,000
inhabitants
of
New
France
.
During
the
19th
century
,
the
lack
of
land
for
the
populous
south
shore
forced
the
inhabitants
to
emigrate
.
With
the
advent
of
the
railway
,
the
opening
of
new
settlement
lands
(
e.
g.
the
Lac
Saint-Jean
in
the
middle
of
the
19th
century
and
Abitibi
in
the
1930s
)
made
the
area
a
land
of
emigration
.
As
a
result
,
the
population
stopped
growing
and
even
decreased
.
