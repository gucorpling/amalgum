Understand
</head>
<p>
With
its
British
colonial
history
and
a
long
Caribbean
coast
,
Belize
is
culturally
similar
to
many
of
Britain
's
former
West
Indian
<hi rend="italic">
island
</hi>
colonies
,
with
a
majority
creole
or
Afro-Caribbean
population
.
But
it
also
includes
a
large
native
Mayan
population
,
especially
in
the
north
and
northwest
of
the
country
.
As
a
result
,
although
English
is
the
official
language
,
<ref target="Spanish">
Spanish
</ref>
is
also
often
spoken
.
In
the
south
east
along
the
Caribbean
coast
live
the
Garifuna
(
Black
Caribs
)
,
an
Afro-Amerindian
culture
.
</p>
<p>
After
long
journeys
starting
in
what
is
now
the
Netherlands
in
1790
,
via
Germany
,
Southern
Russia
,
Canada
,
the
United
States
,
and
Mexico
,
several
thousand
German-speaking
Mennonite
Christians
arrived
in
Belize
in
1958
after
long
and
detailed
discussions
with
the
government
regarding
specific
exemptions
and
privileges
.
They
are
easily
recognizable
by
their
speech
(
somewhat
distinctive
from
modern
standard
German
)
and
&quot;
quaint
&quot;
dress
.
</p>
<p>
World
class
attractions
include
exploring
the
lush
jungles
with
exotic
plants
and
animals
,
deep
sea
fishing
,
swimming
,
snorkeling
and
diving
in
the
Caribbean
Sea
with
its
attractive
reefs
,
and
visiting
the
Mayan
ruins
.
Income
levels
are
still
very
low
and
the
infrastructure
is
very
basic
.
The
Belizeans
are
very
proud
and
friendly
to
visitors
and
the
tourist
industry
grew
greatly
in
the
last
decade
.
</p>
<head>
History
</head>
<p>
Like
the
neighbouring
parts
of
Guatemala
and
Mexico
,
this
area
was
settled
for
thousands
of
years
by
the
Maya
people
.
They
are
still
here
,
an
important
part
of
Belize
's
people
and
culture
.
While
the
Spanish
Empire
claimed
the
area
in
the
16th
century
,
the
Spanish
made
little
progress
in
settling
here
.
The
British
settled
first
on
the
coast
and
offshore
islands
for
logging
.
In
1798
British
Belizean
forces
defeated
a
Spanish
attempt
to
drive
them
out
in
the
Battle
of
St.
George
's
Caye
,
an
anniversary
still
celebrated
as
a
holiday
each
10
September
.
</p>
<p>
The
colony
of
British
Honduras
grew
in
the
19th
century
.
At
first
Africans
were
brought
in
as
slaves
,
but
slavery
was
abolished
here
in
1838
.
Following
the
abolition
of
slavery
,
the
British
would
bring
indentured
<ref target="India">
India
</ref>
n
labourers
to
the
colony
to
supplement
the
labour
pool
,
and
their
descendants
remain
a
significant
minority
to
this
day
.
Many
refugees
from
the
19th-century
Caste
War
of
<ref target="Yucat%C3%A1n%20and%20the%20South">
Yucatán
Peninsula
</ref>
escaped
the
conflict
to
settle
in
Belize
,
especially
the
northern
section
.
</p>
<p>
The
government
of
Guatemala
has
long
claimed
to
have
inherited
the
15th-century
Spanish
claim
to
Belize
.
Although
the
British
were
willing
to
grant
independence
to
British
Honduras
as
early
as
the
mid-1960s
,
this
ongoing
dispute
played
a
major
role
in
delaying
full
Belizean
independence
until
1981
,
long
after
London
granted
independence
to
other
former
colonies
in
the
region
.
Guatemala
refused
to
recognize
an
independent
Belize
at
all
until
1991
,
and
to
this
day
lays
claim
to
virtually
all
Belizean
territory
south
of
Belize
City
.
The
topic
remains
a
sensitive
one
,
particularly
in
the
southern
half
of
Belize
.
</p>
<p>
Belize
escaped
the
bloody
civil
conflicts
of
the
1980s
that
engulfed
much
of
Central
America
,
and
refugees
from
the
conflict
in
Guatemala
arrived
,
mostly
settling
in
the
west
.
While
Belize
has
not
been
immune
to
the
rampant
drug
crime
and
grinding
poverty
of
its
neighbours
it
is
a
comparatively
safe
destination
in
a
conflict-prone
part
of
the
world
.
Belize
shares
particularly
close
diplomatic
and
economic
ties
with
both
the
United
Kingdom
and
the
United
States
.
</p>
<p>
Tourism
has
become
the
mainstay
of
the
economy
as
the
old
agricultural
products
—
sugar
,
banana
,
and
oranges
—
have
lost
ground
.
The
country
remains
plagued
by
high
unemployment
,
growing
involvement
in
the
South
American
drug
trade
,
and
increased
urban
crime
.
In
2006
commercial
quantities
of
oil
were
discovered
in
the
Spanish
Lookout
area
.

Climate

<p>
Tropical

The
dry
season
typically
lasts
from
February
to
May
and
then
the
rainy
season
typically
lasts
through
to
November
.
Hurricanes
that
bring
coastal
flooding
,
especially
in
the

,
are
prevalent
from
June
to

As
a
former
British
colony
,
the
official
language
of
Belize
is
standard
English
with
UK
spelling
rules
,
which
makes
Belize
stand
out
from
its
Spanish-speaking
neighbours
.
</p>
<ref target="Spanish">
Spanish

,
Garifuna
(

and
the
Maya
languages/dialects

parts

Belizean
Creole
,
which
has
a
certain
degree
of
mutual
intelligibility

Most
Belizeans
are
proficient
in

at

one
of

<p>
Many
Belizeans
speak
a
mix
of

standard
English
to
