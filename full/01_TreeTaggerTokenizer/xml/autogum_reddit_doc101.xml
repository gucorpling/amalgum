I
keep
getting
rejected

So
,
I
'm
25
m
I
'll
get
that
out
of
the
way
now
.
My
last
and
only
real
relationship
lasted
like
4
or
5
months
.
I
idk
why
I
'm
here
really
,
because
I
'm
probably
just
going
to
get
the
generic
&quot;
just
be
yourself
&quot;
&quot;
you
'll
find
someone
eventually
&quot;
&quot;
be
confident
&quot;
bullshit
&quot;
advice
&quot;
that
everyone
regurgitates
on
these
things
.
Like
,
I
'm
on
Tinder
and
Hinge
and
Blendr
.
So
I
'll
get
a
&quot;
someone
new
likes
you
&quot;
notification
from
tinder
,
and
I
'll
go
see
who
it
is
cuz
I
have
tinder
gold
.
If
I
think
she
's
cute
I
'll
match
,
and
then
I
usually
wait
like
5
minutes
before
sending
a
message
so
I
do
nt
come
across
as
desperate
.
The
last
5
times
I
've
got
match
,
I
go
back
to
message
them
and
I
have
no
new
matches
.
I
feel
like
I
'm
always
the
accidental
swipe
.
Blendr
is
shitty
to
begin
with
but
i
get
ghosted
almost
every
single
time
.
Havent
even
had
a
match
on
hinge
.
Then
a
few
weeks
ago
,
I
went
out
with
some
friends
,
and
was
outside
having
a
smoke
and
chatting
with
a
girl
I
've
known
for
a
while
,
kinda
bar
friends
,
we
text
often
enough
though
.
I
decide
&quot;
fuck
it
I
'm
half
drunk
,
imma
ask
her
out
&quot;
so
I
ask
if
she
wants
to
maybe
get
brunch
the
next
day
,
as
a
date
,
and
I
get
laughed
at
and
a
&quot;
omg
no
.
&quot;
Now
,
i
know
for
a
fact
she
was
n't
<hi rend="bold">
that
</hi>
drunk
and
neither
was
I
,
I
was
at
that
perfect
kinda
drunk
where
you
're
hella
confident
about
everything
ya
dig
?
So
at
this
point
idk
what
to
do
;
dating
apps
do
nt
work
,
I
literally
get
laughed
at
IRL
,
I
'm
at
a
loss
.
I
'm
in
excellent
shape
,
I
work
out
5
days
a
week
...
well
usually
(
yay
for
mandatory
12
hr
shifts
for
the
last
6
weeks
)
.
Anyway
,
I
'm
fairly
good
looking
I
guess
?
I
ve
got
a
bit
of
a
dry/sarcastic
sense
of
humor
,
but
I
've
been
told
I
'm
funny
.
The
icing
on
the
cake
has
to
be
the
number
of
women
that
I
work
with
who
all
seem
surprised
that
I
'm
single
.
&quot;
You
're
nice/polite
,
good
looking
kid
...
&quot;
The
typical
stuff
.
Granted
,
I
'm
pretty
sure
there
are
only
about
4
women
in
the
entire
manufacturing
side
of
things
within
5
years
of
me
,
the
rest
are
much
older
.
I
just
...
I
do
nt
see
the
point
in
trying
anymore
,
rejection
after
rejection
after
rejection
hurts
like
a
motherfucker
.
I
was
always
told
,
&quot;
do
n't
look
for
it
'll
happen
&quot;
ive
tried
that
,
and
it
got
me
nowhere
.
I
'm
sorry
if
this
sounds
angry
and
r/niceguy
kinda
thing
.
I
'm
kinda
drunk
and
just
needed
to
vent
.

<p>
I
'll
try
to
steer
clear
of
the
advice
you
do
n't
want
.
</p>
<p>
Instead
,
I
have
a
few
questions
.
</p>
<p>
What
do
you
usually
message
women
on
dating
apps
as
a
conversation
starter
?
</p>
<p>
Do
you
recognize
if
you
have
a
specific
type
?
Either
looks
or
personality
.
</p>
<p>
If
so
,
have
you
ever
tried
to
match
with
women
that
are
maybe
a
bit
outside
of
that
type
?
</p>
<p>
As
for
rejection.
.
Yeah
,
it
sucks
.
You
kind
of
just
have
to
get
used
to
it
and
learn
to
take
it
in
stride
.
Better
to
try
and
get
rejected
,
than
to
not
try
at
all
.
</p>
<p>
I
once
started
dating
a
guy
off
of
an
anonymous
app
.
We
talked
for
a
few
days
before
exchanging
pictures
.
This
ensured
that
we
actually
liked
talking
to
each
other
,
and
that
it
was
n't
just
based
on
physical
attraction
.
</p>
<p>
I
've
found
that
dating
was
much
more
free
of
pressure
,
once
I
stopped
caring
as
much
about
looks
.
If
someone
is
kind
,
caring
and
able
to
carry
an
intellectual
conversation
,
looks
just
do
n't
mean
as
much
.
That
's
not
to
say
that
looks
do
n't
have
anything
to
say
,
as
attraction
is
obviously
necessary
for
a
relationship
.
