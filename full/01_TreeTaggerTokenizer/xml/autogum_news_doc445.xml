apologized
to

of
last

's
deadly
protests
in

,
which
were

when
a

that

officials
defiled

the

a

anger

<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qazi%20Hussain%20Ahmad">

Hussain
Ahmad

,
the
head
of
an
Islamic
party
alliance
told
the
BBC
on
Monday
that
Newsweek
's
clarification
held
no
weight
.
&quot;
There
have
been
reports
by
the
prisoners
who
have
been
released
from
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Guantanamo_Bay">

</ref>
of
desecration
of
the
holy
Koran
,
and
different
atrocities
perpetrated
on
them
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
On
Tuesday
Mr.
Ahmad
said
,
&quot;
Whatever
(
Newsweek
)
magazine
has
done
now
is
under
pressure
(
from
the
U.S.
government
)
,
&quot;
he
said
.
&quot;
It
has
not
denied
what
it
has
reported
and
many
people
freed
from
Guantanamo
Bay
have
narrated
the
same
thing
.
&quot;

<p>
The
Tuesday
edition
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Pakistan">
Pakistani
</ref>
daily
newspaper
<hi rend="italic">
the
News
</hi>
quoted
Hafiz
Ehsan
Saeed
,
a
former
Guantanamo
Bay
detainee
,
as
saying
that
the
Koran
was
routinely
desecrated
at
Guantanamo
.
</p>
<p>
Reuters
reported
that
Muslims
said
they
suspected
that
pressure
from
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.">
Washington
</ref>
was
behind
the
magazine
's
backing
off
.
On
Monday
,
presidential
spokesman
Scott
McClellan
had
criticized
Newsweek
's
initial
response
to
the
incident
,
saying
it
was
&quot;
puzzling
.
&quot;
Later
in
the
day
,
Newsweek
retracted
the
story
which
the
White
House
said
was
a
&quot;
good
first
step
&quot;
.
</p>
<p>
Newsweek
defended
its
reporting
and
said
its
investigation
is
continuing
into
allegations
that
the
Koran
had
been
desecrated
by
U.S.
personnel
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Unfortunately
relations
are
so
bad
at
this
point
that
the
perception
will
linger
;
&quot;
said
Ibrahim
Hooper
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Council_on_American-Islamic_Relations">
Council
on
American-Islamic
Relations
</ref>
.
&quot;
Many
people
wo
n't
believe
it
.
They
'll
believe
the
magazine
was
pressured
into
doing
a
retraction
.
&quot;
Hooper
said
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
We
will
not
be
deceived
by
this
,
&quot;
Sadullah
Abu
Aman
,
an
Islamic
cleric
,
told
Reuters
in
Afghanistan
.
</p>
<p>
The
magazine
said
it
had
made
a
mistake
in
its
May
9th
report
regarding
the
accusations
,
which
led
to
violent
anti-American
protests
in
Afghanistan
.
Over
16
were
killed
,
and
more
than
100
were
injured
.
While
many
officials
supporting
the
protests
vowed
for
non-violence
,
some
in
the
streets
threatened
to
start
a
religious
war
against
the
United
States
.
</p>
<p>
Newsweek
's
Editor
,
Mark
Whitaker
,
said
the
magazine
's
error
was
reporting
confirmation
by
U.S.
military
investigators
that
Guantanamo
personnel
flushed
the
Koran
down
a
toilet
.
The
source
initially
said
he
had
read
of
the
event
in
a
military
investigative
report
,
but
the
source
later
told
the
magazine
he
might
have
seen
the
account
of
the
Koran
incident
in
other
investigative
documents
or
drafts
.
</p>
<p>
Mr
Whitaker
told
Reuters
,
&quot;
As
to
whether
anything
like
this
happened
,
we
just
do
n't
know
.
We
're
not
saying
it
absolutely
happened
but
we
ca
n't
say
that
it
absolutely
did
n't
happen
either
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
Newsweek
report
was
not
the
first
public
allegation
alleging
Quran
desecration
at
Guantanamo
Bay
.
News
stories
came
out
in
August
and
October
2004
,
reporting
that
British
citizens
who
had
been
released
from
Guantanamo
claimed
U.S.
guards
threw
their
Qurans
into
the
toilet
.
Also
,
in
January
,
2005
,
Kristine
Huskey
,
a
lawyer
representing
Guantanamo
detainees
,
said
a
detainee
witnessed
a
guard
tossing
a
Quran
into
a
toilet
.
