Cutting
down

flares
up
Lebanese
violence

<p>
After
a
rare
clash
between
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Israel">
Israeli
</ref>
and
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Lebanon">
Lebanese
</ref>
forces
over
the
cutting
down
of
a
tree
near
the
border
of
the
two
countries
,
it
appears
that
all
sides
are
attempting
to
restore
peace
.
</p>
<p>
The
skirmish
started
after
an
Israeli
soldier
started
cutting
down
a
tree
that
has
the
capability
to
provide
cover
for
Lebanese
infiltrators
.
Israel
has
stated
that
they
clear
the
border
of
underbrush
weekly
.
After
the
tree
was
cut
down
,
the
Lebanese
army
started
firing
.
The
Lebanese
were
allegedly
aiming
at
a
base
nearby
,
and
the
resulting
skirmish
killed
a
senior
Israeli
military
officer
,
a
Lebanese
journalist
,
and
two
Lebanese
army
soldiers
.
</p>
<p>
The
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_Nations">
United
Nations
</ref>
peacekeeping
force
in
south
Lebanon
has
stated
that
Israel
was
operating
in
their
own
territory
.
However
,
Lebanese
Information
Minister
Tarek
Mitri
said
that
the
area
of
land
which
had
the
tree
&quot;
[
was
]
Lebanese
territory
,
&quot;
and
also
stated
that
though
Lebanon
respects
the
border
,
the
country
still
contests
part
of
it
.

The

criticism

</p>
<p>
Opposition
politician
Imran
Khan
called
for

to
head
home
immediately
.
&quot;
Khan
citicized
Zardari
for
&quot;
[
going
]
on
this
lavish
tour
—
this
money
could
be
used
on
the
victims
.
Remember
,
Pakistan
is
bankrupt
right
now
so
the
government
does
n't
have
enough
money

so
he
should
be
mobilizing
