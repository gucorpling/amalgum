Eat
Soup
Politely
</head>
<p>
Eating
soup
politely
is
dependent
on
the
company
you
keep
to
some
extent
but
there
are
some
key
elements
to
make
it
a
pleasant
experience
for
both
the
soup
consumer
and
those
seated
around
.
Slurping
and
spilling
of
soup
are
not
pleasant
to
hear
or
see
,
so
do
your
best
to
avoid
these
mistakes
and
you
'll
be
practicing
great
dining
etiquette
.

<item>
Be
seated
at
the
table
.
If
you
are
eating
soup
on
the
couch
or
somewhere
else
,
be
sure
to
use
a
Stable
Tableâ„¢
or
a
tray
,
to
prevent
it
from
slopping
around
and
making
a
mess
,
or
from
burning
you
.

Break
up
any
bread
or
bread
roll
on
the
side
plate
next
to
you
and
eat
it
intermittently
with
the
soup
.

make
sure
you
do
n't

Have
the
correct
spoon
.
A
soup
spoon
is
the
best
spoon
to
eat
soup
.
Failing
that
,
use
a
spoon
larger
than
a
teaspoon
but
smaller
than
a
serving
dish
spoon
.
<figure rend="Eat Soup Politely Step 5.jpg">

</item>
<item>
Fill
the
spoon
about
three-quarter
the
way
full
.
Do
not
overfill
a
soup
spoon
or
it
will
spill
as
you
lift
it
.
Lift
your
spoon
carefully
and
slowly
from
the
bowl
to
your
mouth
.

Continue
eating
soup
in
this
manner
,
methodically
,
slowly
and
with
care
.
Always
place
the
entire
spoon
into
your
mouth
to
prevent
the
need
to
slurp
.
Be
careful
not
to
clank
it
on
your
teeth
.

As
you
near
the
end
of
the
soup
,
tilt
the
bowl
<hi rend="italic">
away
</hi>
from
you
and
not
towards
you
.
This
is
considered
the
polite
way
to
finish
soup
as
there
is
much
less
risk
of
spilling
the
soup
into
your
lap
.

Rest
the
spoon
in
your
bowl
at
the
end
and
push
the
bowl
away
from
you
gently
.

The
etiquette
applies
not
to
some
countries
.
For
example
,
traditional
Japanese
intend
to
have
soup
loudly
to
show
their
chef
that
the
soup
is
delicious
.
</item>
<item>
Avoid
&quot;
feeding
the
ducks
&quot;
in
public
.
This
is
the
habit
of
breaking
up
pieces
of
bread
and
dispersing
this
throughout
your
soup
.
Although
tasty
and
a
great
way
to
mop
up
boiling
hot
soup
,
this
really
should
only
be
a
family
ritual
and
should
never
be
a
part
of
dinner
party
or
restaurant
table
meals
.
</item>
<item>
Do
not
slurp
soup
;
it
sounds
awful
,
and
it
is
considered
very
bad
manners
.
It
will
also
make
people
think
that
you
have
n't
taken
any
time
to
care
about
how
you
present
yourselves
to
others
at
the
dinner
table
.
