CHAPTER
I.
BELSHAZZAR'S
DECISION
</head>
<p>
“
Bel
,
come
here
!
”
The
Harvester
sat
in
the
hollow
worn
in
the
hewed
log
stoop
by
the
feet
of
his
father
and
mother
and
his
own
sturdier
tread
,
and
rested
his
head
against
the
casing
of
the
cabin
door
when
he
gave
the
command
.
The
tip
of
the
dog
's
nose
touched
the
gravel
between
his
paws
as
he
crouched
flat
on
earth
,
with
beautiful
eyes
steadily
watching
the
master
,
but
he
did
not
move
a
muscle
.
</p>
<p>
“
Bel
,
come
here
!
”
</p>
<p>
Twinkles
flashed
in
the
eyes
of
the
man
when
he
repeated
the
order
,
while
his
voice
grew
more
imperative
as
he
stretched
a
lean
,
wiry
hand
toward
the
dog
.
The
animal
's
eyes
gleamed
and
his
sensitive
nose
quivered
,
yet
he
lay
quietly
.
</p>
<p>
“
Belshazzar
,
kommen
Sie
hier
!
”
</p>
<p>
The
body
of
the
dog
arose
on
straightened
legs
and
his
muzzle
dropped
in
the
outstretched
palm
.
A
wind
slightly
perfumed
with
the
odour
of
melting
snow
and
unsheathing
buds
swept
the
lake
beside
them
,
and
lifted
a
waving
tangle
of
light
hair
on
the
brow
of
the
man
,
while
a
level
ray
of
the
setting
sun
flashed
across
the
water
and
illumined
the
graven
,
sensitive
face
,
now
alive
with
keen
interest
in
the
game
being
played
.
</p>
<p>
“
Bel
,
dost
remember
the
day
?
”
inquired
the
Harvester
.
</p>
<p>
The
eager
attitude
and
anxious
eyes
of
the
dog
betrayed
that
he
did
not
,
but
was
waiting
with
every
sense
alert
for
a
familiar
word
that
would
tell
him
what
was
expected
.
</p>
<p>
“
Surely
you
heard
the
killdeers
crying
in
the
night
,
”
prompted
the
man
.
“
I
called
your
attention
when
the
ecstasy
of
the
first
bluebird
waked
the
dawn
.
All
day
you
have
seen
the
gold-yellow
and
blood-red
osiers
,
the
sap-wet
maples
and
spring
tracing
announcements
of
her
arrival
on
the
sunny
side
of
the
levee
.
”
</p>
<p>
The
dog
found
no
clew
,
but
he
recognized
tones
he
loved
in
the
suave
,
easy
voice
,
and
his
tail
beat
his
sides
in
vigorous
approval
.
The
man
nodded
gravely
.
</p>
<p>
“
Ah
,
so
!
Then
you
realize
this
day
to
be
the
most
important
of
all
the
coming
year
to
me
;
this
hour
a
solemn
one
that
influences
my
whole
after
life
.
It
is
time
for
your
annual
decision
on
my
fate
for
a
twelve-month
.
Are
you
sure
you
are
fully
alive
to
the
gravity
of
the
situation
,
Bel
?
”
</p>
<p>
The
dog
felt
himself
safe
in
answering
a
rising
inflection
ending
in
his
name
uttered
in
that
tone
,
and
wagged
eager
assent
.
</p>
<p>
“
Well
then
,
”
said
the
man
,
“
which
shall
it
be
?
Do
I
leave
home
for
the
noise
and
grime
of
the
city
,
open
an
office
and
enter
the
money-making
scramble
?
”
</p>
<p>
Every
word
was
strange
to
the
dog
,
almost
breathlessly
waiting
for
a
familiar
syllable
.
The
man
gazed
steadily
into
the
animal
's
eyes
.
After
a
long
pause
he
continued
:
</p>
<p>
“
Or
do
I
remain
at
home
to
harvest
the
golden
seal
,
mullein
,
and
ginseng
,
not
to
mention
an
occasional
hour
with
the
black
bass
or
tramps
for
partridge
and
cotton-tails
?
”
</p>
<p>
The
dog
recognized
each
word
of
that
.
Before
the
voice
ceased
,
his
sleek
sides
were
quivering
,
his
nostrils
twitching
,
his
tail
lashing
,
and
at
the
pause
he
leaped
up
and
thrust
his
nose
against
the
face
of
the
man
.
The
Harvester
leaned
back
laughing
in
deep
,
full-chested
tones
;
then
he
patted
the
dog
's
head
with
one
hand
and
renewed
his
grip
with
the
other
.
</p>
<p>
“
Good
old
Bel
!
”
he
cried
exultantly
.
“
Six
years
you
have
decided
for
me
,
and
right
--
--every
time
!
We
are
of
the
woods
,
Bel
,
born
and
reared
here
as
our
fathers
before
us
.
What
would
we
of
the
camp
fire
,
the
long
trail
,
the
earthy
search
,
we
harvesters
of
herbs
the
famous
chemists
require
,
what
would
we
do
in
a
city
?
And
when
the
sap
is
rising
,
the
bass
splashing
,
and
the
wild
geese
honking
in
the
night
!
We
never
could
endure
it
,
Bel
.
</p>
<p>
“
When
we
delivered
that
hemlock
at
the
hospital
to-day
,
did
you
hear
that
young
doctor
talking
about
his
'
lid
'
?
Well
up
there
is
ours
,
old
fellow
!
Just
sky
and
clouds
overhead
for
us
,
forest
wind
in
our
faces
,
wild
perfume
in
our
nostrils
,
muck
on
our
feet
,
that
's
the
life
for
us
.
Our
blood
was
tainted
to
begin
with
,
and
we
've
lived
here
so
long
it
is
now
a
passion
in
our
hearts
.
If
ever
you
sentence
us
to
life
in
the
city
,
you
'll
finish
both
of
us
,
that
's
what
you
'll
do
!
But
you
wo
n't
,
will
you
?
You
realize
what
God
made
us
for
and
what
He
made
for
us
,
do
n't
you
,
Bel
?
