If

could
choose
your
own
death
,
how
would
you
die
?

I
would
want
to
steal
what
I
heard
a
mutual
friend
of
ours
said
.
He
said
when
he
died
--
it
's
not
how
he
died
,
but
this
is
what
I
heard
--
he
said
when
he
's
dead
,
he
wants
his
corpse
to
be
dressed
up
like
Superman
and
thrown
out
of
an
airplane
.
I
thought
that
would
be
fitting
.
But
I
'm
not
ready
to
think
about
death
,
not
just
yet
.

You
guys

Metal

and

Glam

What
would
you
describe
your
sound
as
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
AN
:
</hi>
I
would
call
us
anthem
rock
.
We
're
really
not
heavy
metal
.
I
think
our
focus
is
more
on
writing
great
singles
,
as
best
as
we
can
make
them
.
Pop
music
.
That
's
just
something
Bryn
and
I
grew
up
on
.
We
're
big
fans
of
melody
and
big
driving
hooks
,
that
sort
of
thing
.

Would
you
say
anthem
rock
more
in
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mötley%20Crüe">

or
more
in

</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
AN

</hi>
I
would
say
half
and
half
.
Our
influences
do
n't
just
stop
with
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hair%20metal">
hair
metal
</ref>
and
things
like
that
.
We
draw
on
things
like
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin%20Lizzy">
Thin
Lizzy
</ref>
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston%20(band)">
Boston
</ref>
,
bands
like
that
.
Not
necessarily
virtuosic
sort
of
musicianship
,
but
things
that
are
put
together
.
We
like
to
spend
the
time
when
we
are
writing
our
songs
that
we
are
taking
all
the
extraneous
crap
out
of
it
.
We
just
want
to
make
good
,
hook-drive
pop
music
.

Does
the
war
in
Iraq
affect
you
artistically
at
all

No
,
not
at
all
.
No
,
you
could
say
I
'm
just
like
everybody
else
.
I
read
the
paper
and
blogs
,
and
I
'm
just
as
horrified
as
everybody
else
.
I
'm
definitely
not
a
fan
of
this
war

Oh
,
the
fight
was
definitely
in
Afghanistan

Iraq
was
a
much
different

Are
you
more
inspired
by
things
in
nature
or
things
that
are
man
made
?

</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
AN
:
</hi>
I
would
probably
have
to
go
with
nature
.
I
'm
a
student
of
science
.
I
have
a
degree
in
environmental
geology
.
When
I
was
19/20
years
old
I
went
through
all
the
regular
existential
questions
people
that
age
go
through
:
why
am
I
here
and
my
place
in
the
universe
,
that
sort
of
thing
.

You
can
typically
read
anywhere
that
humanity
is
a
virus
,
a
plague
,
on
Mother
Earth
.
I
really
think
the
greatest
threat
to
humanity
is
not
a
meteor
or
comet
hurtling
toward
the
planet
,
it
's
us
.
