Become
an
Internet
Master
</head>
<p>
A
new
common
culture
is
arising
from
the
increasingly
ubiquitousness
of
technology
in
our
everyday
lives
.
It
became
really
relevant
part
of
communication
and
spreading
of
trend
.
If
you
are
new
to
this
it
can
be
really
difficult
to
understand
because
often
a
stratification
of
layer
of
meaning
or
has
to
be
seen
as
very
ironic/
post-ironic
critic
.
Here
's
a
little
step
by
step
guide
into
the
Internet
Culture
.

4chan.4chan
is
an
image
board
where
you
can
post
anonymously
.
Since
it
is
a
community
you
have
to
learn
and
respect
the
rules
,
if
you
do
n’t
like
them
you
can
go
to
a
similar
website
like
8
chan
or
other
image
board
like
reddit
,
imgur
or
9gag
.
The
member
of
the
community
usually
refers
to
each
other
using
the
term
/b/ros
.
There
’s
a
specific
language
that
you
should
learn
in
order
to
get
along
with
the
other
users
.
The
website
is
divided
into
different
categories
depending
on
the
topic
,
learning
the
difference
between
each
boards
can
be
very
useful
.
Users
can
open
a
thread
about
a
certain
issue
,
each
thread
is
identified
by
an
automatically
random
generated
number
.
There
are
some
moderators
that
can
ban
you
if
your
comments
or
threads
are
inappropriate
,
but
basically
it
does
n’t
have
really
strict
censorship
rules
like
Facebook
or
Instagram
.

Get
into
a
weird
Facebook
group
.
Weird
Facebook
,
or
Post-Ironic
Facebook
is
a
loose
agglomeration
of
Facebook
pages
,
also
known
as
“
Meme
Pages
,
”
that
create
and
distribute
dank
memes
,
often
along
a
certain
theme
or
topic
.
Many
of
these
pages
have
become
popular
both
because
of
their
absurd
humor
,
but
also
because
of
possible
advantages
given
to
the
“
Page
”
format
in
the
Facebook
algorithm
.
If
you
get
into
the
group
you
can
follow
the
spreading
process
of
viral
content
and
you
can
be
aware
of
the
meaning
of
what
you
see
on
your
Facebook
home
.

Drown
in
Deep
Web
.
The
deep
web
,
invisible
web
,
or
hidden
web
are
parts
of
the
World
Wide
Web
whose
contents
are
not
indexed
by
standard
search
engines
for
any
reason
.
To
surf
the
deep
web
you
’ll
need
a
specific
browser
called
Tor
.
The
deep
web
includes
many
very
common
uses
such
as
web
mail
,
online
banking
but
also
paid
for
services
with
a
paywall
such
as
video
on
demand
,
and
many
more
.
But
of
course
is
also
the
place
where
a
lot
of
illegal
activities
take
place
.
You
can
buy
drugs
(
on
Silkroad
that
was
a
kind
of
ebay
for
illegal
substances
)
,
weapons
,
fake
documents
,
hacking
services
and
datas
,
but
it
was
also
used
by
terrorists
to
keep
in
touch
.
To
buy
on
the
deep
web
you
’ll
need
Bitcoin
,
a
cryptocurrency
and
a
payment
system
invented
by
an
unidentified
programmer
,
or
group
of
programmers
,
under
the
name
of
Satoshi
Nakamoto
.
For
its
elitarian
nature
deep
web
was
chosen
to
reach
an
alternative
public
rather
than
the
surface
web
.
A
lot
of
indie-alternative
games
are
only
available
there
(
Sad
Satan
is
the
most
famous
)
and
also
a
popular
experimental
music
group
,
called
Death
Grips
choose
the
deep
web
for
the
release
of
one
of
their
album
“
No
Love
Deep
Web
”
