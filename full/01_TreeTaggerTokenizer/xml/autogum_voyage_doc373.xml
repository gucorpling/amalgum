West
Bali
National
Park
(
<hi rend="italic">
Taman
Nasional
Bali
Barat
</hi>
in
Bahasa
Indonesia
)
is
the
most
north-westerly
point
of
Bali
.
It
includes
the
whole
of
the
Prapat
Agung
Peninsula
,
and
large
swathes
of
land
around
the
towns
of
Gilimanuk
,
<hi rend="bold">
Cekik
</hi>
and
<hi rend="bold">
Banyuwedang
</hi>
.
The
official
area
inside
the
park
boundaries
is
190
km
²
,
with
a
further
580
km
²
of
protected
reserve
in
the
highlands
to
the
east
.
In
total
this
accounts
for
some
ten
percent
of
Bali
's
total
land
area
.
</p>
<head>
History
</head>
<p>
The
park
was
first
recognised
as
an
area
of
importance
in
1917
when
the
council
of
Bali
rulers
designated
it
as
a
<hi rend="italic">
nature
park
</hi>
.
It
was
established
as
an
Indonesian
National
Park
in
1941
.
</p>
<head>
Landscape
</head>
<p>
The
habitat
is
very
varied
with
rainforest
,
dry
savanna
,
acacia
scrub
and
lowland
forests
,
as
well
as
more
montane
forests
in
the
higher
centre
.
There
are
also
some
pockets
of
dense
mangrove
forest
.
</p>
<p>
In
the
north
of
the
park
there
is
an
obvious
north
jutting
peninsula
called
Prapat
Agung
.
Around
this
peninsula
there
are
long
stretches
of
protected
beach
and
offshore
coral
reef
as
well
,
as
a
small
offshore
island
called
Menjangan
.
The
latter
is
a
very
popular
diving
destination
.
</p>
<p>
There
are
several
long
extinct
volcanoes
in
the
protected
reserve
area
to
the
east
,
with
Mount
Patas
(
1,412
metres
)
and
Mount
Merbuk
(
1,388
metres
)
being
the
highest
points
.
These
peaks
are
dominant
visual
landscape
features
from
within
every
area
of
the
park
.
</p>
<head>
Flora
and
fauna
</head>
<p>
160
species
of
bird
have
been
recorded
in
the
park
,
including
the
near
extinct
Bali
Starling
,
Bali
's
only
endemic
vertebrate
species
,
and
a
key
reason
why
this
national
park
was
created
in
the
first
place
.
By
2001
,
as
few
as
six
individuals
were
thought
to
survive
in
the
wild
,
all
of
them
in
this
park
.
Since
then
captive
breeding
and
re-introduction
efforts
have
continued
apace
,
but
poaching
pressures
are
a
large
problem
.
With
that
in
mind
,
a
second
re-introduction
programme
was
started
in
remote
regions
of
<ref target="Nusa%20Penida">
Nusa
Penida
</ref>
in
2004
.
Keen
birdwatchers
can
find
<ref target="http://www.birdlist.org/sas/indonesia/bali.htm">
a
checklist
</ref>
of
likely
species
and
their
status
here
.
</p>
<p>
Mammals
found
inside
the
park
include
Banteng
,
a
species
of
wild
cattle
from
which
the
familiar
Bali
cows
are
descended
.
Java
Rusa
and
Indian
Muntjac
deer
are
quite
widespread
,
and
Menjangan
Island
is
in
fact
named
after
these
(
Menjangan
means
deer
in
Bahasa
Indonesia
)
.
Wild
Boar
and
Leopard
Cats
are
both
quite
common
but
seldom
encountered
.
</p>
<p>
A
Bali
Tiger
(
a
full
sub-species
of
Tiger
)
was
shot
here
in
1937
,
and
despite
rumours
to
the
contrary
,
that
is
the
last
ever
confirmed
sighting
of
an
animal
considered
extinct
since
that
moment
.
</p>
<head>
Climate
</head>
<p>
Not
noticeably
different
from
the
rest
of
<ref target="Bali">
Bali
</ref>
or
eastern
<ref target="Java">
Java
</ref>
,
but
it
may
feel
a
little
hotter
and
drier
in
the
dry
season
here
than
in
southern
parts
of
Bali
.
</p>
<p>
Bali
is
always
warm
,
humid
and
tropical
,
remaining
around
30-35°C
(
85-95°F
)
all
year
round
.
The
April
–
October
dry
season
and
November
–
March
rainy
seasons
are
only
relative
,
with
plenty
of
rainfall
around
the
year
,
but
the
Balinese
winter
is
cloudier
,
more
humid
and
with
a
higher
chance
of
thunderstorms
.

to
the
park
arrive
along
the
north
coast
road
from
<ref target="Lovina">

(
about
90
minutes
)
or
<ref target="Pemuteran">

.
Others
come
from

south
via
<ref target="Gilimanuk">
Gilimanuk
</ref>
(
about

</p>
<p>
All
visitors
should
check
in
at
one
of
the
two
park
offices
(
<hi rend="italic">
PHPA
</hi>
)
for
information
,
and
to
purchase
permits
and
arrange
guides
.
The
headquarters
is
at
the
village
of
Cekik
just
south
of
the
Gilimanuk
in
the
west
.
The
other
is
at
Labuan
Lalang
on
the
north
coast
from
where
boats
to
Menjangan
Island
depart
.
The
main
ranger
station
is
on
the
road
between
the
two
offices
at
Sumber
Klampok
.
</p>
<p>
The
park
staff
are
welcoming
,
helpful
and
will
arrange
guided
tours
for
you
.
</p>
<head>
Fees
and
permits
</head>
<p>
Permits
and
obligatory
guides
are
available
at
the
park
headquarters
at
Cekik
and
the
office
at
Labuhan
Lalang
.
The
official
permit
charge
is
Rp
25,000
per
person
.
The
cost
of
a
guide
is
negotiable
.
Use
your
common
sense
and
do
not
be
tight
.
A
sensible
range
would
be
about
Rp
50,000
to
100,000
for
a
half
to
full
day
.
</p>
<head>
Get
around
</head>
<p>
Only
a
small
portion
of
the
park
is
open
to
visitors
,
and
this
rule
must
be
respected
.
There
are
two
key
ways
to
explore
the
park
:
either
hiking
the
trails
or
concentrating
on
marine
aspects
.
</p>
<p>
Walking
the
trails
must
be
done
with
an
official
guide
from
one
of
the
national
park
offices
(
most
normally
the
one
at
Cekik
)
.
Boat
trips
to
Menjangan
and
around
Gilimanuk
Bay
can
be
organised
in
advance
(
ask
at
your
hotel
)
,
or
by
charter
on
the
day
you
arrive
.
</p>
<head>
See
and
do
</head>
<p>
The
official
park
trails
should
be
explored
with
a
guide
recommended
by
the
national
park
office
.
This
is
actually
a
rule
but
it
is
sometimes
'
quietly
'
ignored
.
Please
do
not
do
this
nor
encourage
the
practice
,
despite
the
very
irresponsible
advice
given
in
some
printed
travel
guides
to
do
so
.
</p>
<p>
The
<hi rend="bold">
Tegal
Blunder
Trail
</hi>
is
most
popular
with
birdwatchers
,
and
it
is
an
easy
two-hour
walk
.
The
ranger
checkpoint
is
at
the
village
of
Slumber
Klampok
about
20
minutes
west
of
Cekik
.
From
the
same
checkpoint
you
can
take
the
more
strenuous
<hi rend="bold">
Gunung
Klatakan
Trail
</hi>
to
the
south
east
.
This
is
tougher
walking
for
about
five
hours
,
but
it
takes
you
through
some
memorable
rainforest
.
There
are
other
trails
and
opportunities
for
interesting
hikes
,
but
these
are
the
two
most
popular
and
the
easiest
.
Ask
guides
about
other
opportunities
at
the
time
,
particularly
those
involving
hiking
deeper
into
the
Prapat
Agung
Peninsula
.
</p>
<p>
The
uninhabited
<hi rend="bold">
Menjangan
Island
</hi>
is
a
must-do
for
any
visitor
to
Bali
interested
in
marine
life
,
snorkelling
or
diving
.
Boats
leave
from
the
beach
at
Labuan
Lalang
at
the
northern
edge
of
Teluk
Terima
bay
,
and
can
chartered
on
the
day
.
Groups
of
tourists
often
club
together
at
Labuan
Lalang
in
the
mornings
for
that
very
purpose
.
Any
boat
charter
must
be
accompanied
by
a
guide
,
and
you
must
purchase
a
permit
(
Rp
25,000
per
person
)
from
the
national
park
office
in
the
main
Labuhan
Lalang
car
park
.
Many
of
Bali
's
dive
operators
based
in
the
southern
tourist
regions
offer
dive
excursions
specifically
to
Menjangan
.
The
snorkelling
here
is
probably
the
best
on
Bali
with
good
clear
water
and
calm
seas
.
</p>
<p>
There
is
a
notable
temple
on
Menjangan
called
<hi rend="bold">
Puri
Gili
Kencana
</hi>
which
is
certainly
worth
a
visit
.
You
can
walk
around
the
whole
of
Menjangan
in
about
1
hour
and
15
minutes
.
If
you
take
it
slower
though
there
is
plenty
of
natural
coastal
beauty
to
absorb
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Gilimanuk
Bay
</hi>
snakes
into
the
south
western
tip
of
the
Prapat
Agung
peninsula
,
and
the
park
office
can
arrange
a
guided
boat
trip
for
you
in
a
traditional
outrigger
.
Expect
to
pay
about
Rp
300,000
per
hour
including
guide
fees
.
The
bay
is
quiet
and
supports
a
rich
diverstity
of
marine
life
.
There
are
some
notable
areas
of
mangrove
forest
fringing
the
bay
,
and
these
act
as
a
natural
nursery
for
the
diverse
fish
life
in
the
area
.
