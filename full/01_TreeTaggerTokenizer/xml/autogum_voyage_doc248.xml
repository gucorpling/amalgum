The

divided

two
major
parts

the
<hi rend="bold">
Upper

(

Nagornaya

the
<hi rend="bold">
Lower
city

(
<hi rend="italic">
Nizhnyaya

or
<hi rend="italic">
Zarechnaya

—
what
literally
means
&quot;
the
part
over
the
river
&quot;
)
on
the
left
bank
of
the
river
.
The
Upper
city
is
the
old
historical
part
of
Nizhny
Novgorod
,
whereas
the
Lower
city
is
larger
,
newer
and
consists
of
more
industrial
districts
.
</p>
<head>
History
</head>
<p>
The
city
was
founded
by
Grand
Duke
George
II
of
Russia
in
1221
at
the
confluence
of
two
most
important
rivers
of
his
principality
,
the
Volga
and
the
Oka
.
Its
name
literally
means
<hi rend="italic">
Newtown
the
Lower
</hi>
,
to
distinguish
it
from
<ref target="Novgorod">
the
older
Novgorod
</ref>
.
A
major
stronghold
for
border
protection
,
Nizhny
Novgorod
fortress
took
advantage
of
a
natural
moat
formed
by
the
two
rivers
.
</p>
<p>
Along
with
Moscow
and
Tver
,
Nizhny
Novgorod
was
among
several
newly
founded
towns
that
escaped
Mongol
devastation
on
account
of
its
insignificance
and
grew
up
into
important
centers
of
Russian
political
life
during
the
period
of
Tatar
yoke
.
For
a
short
period
of
time
it
was
the
capital
of
the
Suzdal
Principality
and
competed
with
Moscow
for
the
power
in
the
region
.
However
the
competition
with
Moscow
was
lost
and
in
1392
the
city
was
incorporated
into
Muscovy
.
Nizhny
Novgorod
Kremlin
was
built
in
1508-1511
(
under
supervision
of
the
Italian
fortress
engineers
)
and
became
one
of
the
strongest
Russian
citadels
.
There
is
a
legend
saying
that
the
project
was
initially
developed
with
participation
of
Leonardo
da
Vinci
.
However
there
is
no
documented
proof
of
Leonardo
's
work
for
that
project
,
the
only
thing
the
legend
is
based
on
is
the
striking
resemblance
of
Leonardo
's
sketches
and
the
actual
Kremlin
schemes
.
The
fortress
was
strong
enough
to
withstand
Tatar
sieges
in
1520
and
1536
.
</p>
<p>
In
1612
,
the
so-called
<hi rend="italic">
national
militia
</hi>
,
gathered
by
a
local
merchant
Kuzma
Minin
and
commanded
by
Knyaz
Dmitry
Pozharsky
expelled
the
Polish
troops
from
Moscow
,
thus
putting
an
end
to
the
Time
of
Troubles
and
establishing
the
rule
of
the
Romanov
dynasty
.
</p>
<p>
In
1817
,
the
Makaryev
Monastery
Fair
,
one
of
the
liveliest
in
the
world
the
16th-18th
centuries
,
was
transferred
to
Nizhny
Novgorod
,
which
thereupon
started
to
attract
numerous
visitors
and
by
the
mid-19th
century
it
turned
Nizhny
Novgorod
into
trade
capital
of
the
Russian
Empire
.
</p>
<p>
Under
the
Soviet
period
,
the
trade
connections
of
the
city
were
abandoned
and
Nizhny
Novgorod
became
an
important
industrial
centre
instead
.
During
the
communist
time
the
city
was
closed
to
foreigners
to
safeguard
the
security
of
Soviet
military
research
.
The
physicist
and
the
Nobel
laureate
Andrei
Sakharov
was
exiled
there
during
1980-1986
to
limit
his
contacts
with
foreigners
.
