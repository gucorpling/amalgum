Paint
Corners
</head>
<p>
Whether
it
's
a
large
or
small
project
,
there
's
a
good
chance
that
most
painting
tasks
will
involve
corners
.
Although
it
can
be
a
tricky
process
at
first
,
any
corner
can
be
painted
with
the
proper
taping
preparations
and
short
,
careful
brush
strokes
.
With
a
little
bit
of
patience
,
you
will
be
able
to
work
through
your
home
painting
projects
with
efficiency
!

Set
up
a
step
stool
next
to
the
painting
site
.
Before
you
start
painting
,
you
will
want
to
make
sure
that
the
spot
you
plan
on
painting
is
easily
accessible
.
If
necessary
,
set
up
a
small
step
stool
or
ladder
to
help
you
reach
the
area
that
you
'll
be
painting
.
Being
closer
to
the
corner
will
allow
you
to
make
steadier
,
more
confident
strokes
.
This
can
help
make
your
paint
job
look
more
professional
.

If
you
're
using
a
ladder
,
always
have
a
person
nearby
to
spot
you
.
This
can
help
to
prevent
any
potential
injuries
.

Wipe
the
corner
baseboard
with
a
moist
cloth
to
remove
any
dust
.
You
will
be
applying
painter
’s
tape
to
prevent
any
paint
from
dripping
into
unwanted
areas
,
so
you
want
to
make
sure
that
there
is
no
lingering
dust
.
Wait
for
the
wiped
surface
to
dry
before
applying
any
painter
's
tape
.

Painter
's
tape
will
have
a
smoother
application
along
a
clean
surface
.
</item>
<item>
Wipe
with
a
phosphate-free
detergent
product
if
the
wall
or
corner
area
appears
to
be
greasy
.
This
solution
can
be
found
at
most
hardware
and
home
improvement
stores
.
</item>
<item>
If
you
are
working
on
a
ceiling
area
,
wipe
down
wherever
you
expect
to
be
placing
painter
’s
tape
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Cut
a
long
strip
of
painter
's
tape
.
The
length
of
this
strip
will
depend
on
the
length
of
your
wall
.
Place
the
tape
along
the
floor
baseboard
.
Choose
a
starting
point
along
the
edge
and
ensure
that
the
piece
of
tape
is
long
enough
to
reach
the
corner
.
Make
the
piece
of
tape
longer
than
necessary
to
ensure
that
the
corner
’s
edges
are
completely
covered
.

Medium
adhesion
painter
’s
tape
is
a
good
choice
for
painted
walls
,
and
will
help
prevent
any
damage
to
the
wall
during
the
tape
removal
process
.
</item>
<item>
Using
a
painter
's
tape
applicator
can
help
to
make
the
taping
process
much
more
efficient
.
They
are
available
at
most
stores
that
sell
painting
supplies
.

When
painting
a
ceiling
corner
,
secure
the
painter
’s
tape
along
the
edge
where
the
ceiling
meets
the
wall
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Secure
the
painter
's
tape
to
the
wall
with
a
putty
knife
.
Drag
the
putty
knife
along
any
loose
sections
of
painter
’s
tape
so
that
they
adhere
tightly
to
the
wall
.
Once
you
have
securely
bonded
the
tape
to
the
corner
,
use
a
utility
knife
or
other
small
blade
to
cut
off
anything
extra
.

A
one
and
a
half
inch
wide
putty
knife
is
a
good
size
for
most
painting
projects
.

<item>
Repeat
the
taping
and
sealing
process
.
Using
another
long
strip
of
painter
's
tape
,
cover
the
other
adjoining
edge
of
the
wall
with
painter
's
tape
.
Secure
this
piece
of
tape
with
the
putty
knife
.

Since
you
already
cut
the
extra
tape
off
of
the
first
strip
,
the
second
strip
will
be
easier
to
secure
to
the
wall
and
corner
.
</item>
<item>
Apply
long
strips
of
painter
’s
tape
around
nearby
moldings
as
needed
.
This
process
will
be
identical
to
the
rest
of
the
taping
process
.

Applying

Paint
</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Begin
to
fill
the
corner
with
paint
.
Use
a
two-and-a-half
inch
wide
brush
and
liberally
dip
into
the
paint
.
Start
by
using
your
brush
to
apply
paint
from
the
innermost
crevice
.
This
will
make
it
easier
to
paint
the
areas
immediately
surrounding
the
corner
.

If
you
are
painting
near
a
baseboard
,
be
sure
to
have
drop
cloths
or
plastic
sheeting
laid
out
to
prevent
any
paint
from
spilling
on
the
floor
.
</item>
<item>
If
you
prefer
to
use
a
roller
in
your
painting
,
consider
using
a
square
paint
edger
.
This
tool
is
a
mix
of
a
brush
and
a
roller
,
and
will
help
you
reach
the
inner
parts
of
the
corner
.
Use
an
extension
pole
if
necessary
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Spread
the
paint
in
outward
strokes
.
You
will
want
to
keep
your
brushstrokes
short
so
that
you
can
spread
the
paint
evenly
across
a
small
area
.
Aim
to
paint
at
least
five
short
strokes
from
your
initial
paint
placement
.

Edge
rollers
can
also
be
effective
in
providing
consistent
paint
coverage
along
a
straight
line
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Keep
brushing
in
short
strokes
to
hide
any
brush
marks
.
Given
the
small
amount
of
painting
space
in
a
corner
,
there
is
a
chance
that
you
have
lingering
brush
marks
that
are
visible
to
the
naked
eye
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Give
extra
care
to
even
out
parallel
strokes
of
paint
with
perpendicular
ones
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Switch
to
a
roller
to
get
consistent
paint
coverage
.
While
a
roller
may
not
be
able
to
reach
a
corner
’s
crevice
,
it
can
help
to
flatten
and
level
out
the
existing
paint
that
you
have
already
applied
with
a
brush
.
Using
a
roller
also
eliminates
any
worry
of
lasting
brush
strokes
.

Take
off
the
painter
's
tape
.
Once
the
paint
has
dried
,
press
down
on
the
top
of
the
tape
with
the
thin
edge
of
a
putty
knife
.
You
will
then
want
to
pull
the
tape
off
in
a
clean
,
steady
motion
.
Ideally
,
you
will
want
the
tape
to
be
forming
a
45-degree
angle
as
you
remove
it
from
the
wall
.
