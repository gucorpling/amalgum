Why
have
you
chosen
to
involve
yourself
in
the
political
process
?
Why
did
you
choose
to
run
in
this
constituency
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
During
the
last
year
I
have
become
very
involved
in
helping
my
community
locally
on
environmental
issues
,
urban
sprawl/greenspace
issues
and
at
a
local
food
bank
and
soup
kitchen
.
A
number
of
people
noticed
my
efforts
and
suggested
that
I
run
for
MPP
,
so
I
took
them
up
on
the
challenge
.
I
chose
to
run
in
the
riding
where
my
family
and
I
live
and
where
my
children
go
to
school
.
With
two
children
now
,
and
another
on
the
way
,
I
wanted
to
make
sure
we
left
behind
a
better
world
for
the
future
generations
.

What
prior
political
experience
do
you
have
?
What
skills
and
insight
can
you
bring
to
office
,
from
other
non-political
positions
you
may
have
held
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
I
have
followed
the
political
process
throughout
my
life
,
and
on
three
occasions
have
helped
municipal
candidates
with
their
campaigns
.
I
have
a
tremendous
amount
of
experience
working
in
a
community
setting
,
both
as
a
police
officer
and
as
a
business
owner
.
I
have
the
ability
to
work
well
with
people
from
varying
cultures
,
and
tend
to
gain
respect
from
others
quickly
.

Which
of
your
competitors
do
you
expect
to
pose
the
biggest
challenge
to
your
candidacy
?
Why
?
What
makes
you
the
most
desirable
of
all
candidates
running
in
the
riding
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
The
biggest
challenge
will
be
overcoming
the
status
quo
parties
,
rather
than
the
other
candidates
themselves
.
The
other
parties
have
been
around
for
a
long
time
and
people
have
developed
a
loyalty
that
is
sometimes
hard
to
overcome
.
</p>
<p>
I
believe
I
am
the
best
candidate
for
my
riding
because
I
have
the
ability
to
unite
our
community
and
make
it
stronger
.
I
am
a
strong
,
vocal
,
active
person
who
possesses
the
right
leadership
attributes
to
help
the
constituents
in
my
riding
.
Throughout
my
life
I
have
demonstrated
that
I
am
a
noticeable
leader
:
during
my
high
school
days
I
was
President
of
the
Athletic
Association
;
during
my
policing
career
I
advanced
quickly
,
and
in
business
I
have
built
up
a
company
that
employs
more
than
125
people
and
is
respected
in
its
market
.
