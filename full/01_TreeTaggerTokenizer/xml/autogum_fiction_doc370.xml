BUNCHES
OF
KNUCKLES
</head>
<p>
ARRANGEMENTS
quite
extensive
had
been
made
for
the
celebration
of
Christmas
on
the
yacht
Samoset
.
Not
having
been
in
any
civilized
port
for
months
,
the
stock
of
provisions
boasted
few
delicacies
;
yet
Minnie
Duncan
had
managed
to
devise
real
feasts
for
cabin
and
forecastle
.
</p>
<p>
“
Listen
,
Boyd
,
”
she
told
her
husband
.
“
Here
are
the
menus
.
For
the
cabin
,
raw
bonita
native
style
,
turtle
soup
,
omelette
a
la
Samoset
--
”
</p>
<p>
“
What
the
dickens
?
”
Boyd
Duncan
interrupted
.
</p>
<p>
“
Well
,
if
you
must
know
,
I
found
a
tin
of
mushrooms
and
a
package
of
egg-powder
which
had
fallen
down
behind
the
locker
,
and
there
are
other
things
as
well
that
will
go
into
it
.
But
do
n't
interrupt
.
Boiled
yam
,
fried
taro
,
alligator
pear
salad
--
there
,
you
've
got
me
all
mixed
,
Then
I
found
a
last
delectable
half-pound
of
dried
squid
.
There
will
be
baked
beans
Mexican
,
if
I
can
hammer
it
into
Toyama
's
head
;
also
,
baked
papaia
with
Marquesan
honey
,
and
,
lastly
,
a
wonderful
pie
the
secret
of
which
Toyama
refuses
to
divulge
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
wonder
if
it
is
possible
to
concoct
a
punch
or
a
cocktail
out
of
trade
rum
?
”
Duncan
muttered
gloomily
.
</p>
<p>
“
Oh
!
I
forgot
!
Come
with
me
.
”
</p>
<p>
His
wife
caught
his
hand
and
led
him
through
the
small
connecting
door
to
her
tiny
stateroom
.
Still
holding
his
hand
,
she
fished
in
the
depths
of
a
hat-locker
and
brought
forth
a
pint
bottle
of
champagne
.
</p>
<p>
“
The
dinner
is
complete
!
”
he
cried
.
</p>
<p>
“
Wait
.
”
</p>
<p>
She
fished
again
,
and
was
rewarded
with
a
silver-mounted
whisky
flask
.
She
held
it
to
the
light
of
a
port-hole
,
and
the
liquor
showed
a
quarter
of
the
distance
from
the
bottom
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
've
been
saving
it
for
weeks
,
”
she
explained
.
“
And
there
's
enough
for
you
and
Captain
Dettmar
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Two
mighty
small
drinks
,
”
Duncan
complained
.
</p>
<p>
“
There
would
have
been
more
,
but
I
gave
a
drink
to
Lorenzo
when
he
was
sick
.
”
</p>
<p>
Duncan
growled
,
“
Might
have
given
him
rum
,
”
facetiously
.
</p>
<p>
“
The
nasty
stuff
!
For
a
sick
man
?
Do
n't
be
greedy
,
Boyd
.
And
I
'm
glad
there
is
n't
any
more
,
for
Captain
Dettmar
's
sake
.
Drinking
always
makes
him
irritable
.
And
now
for
the
men
's
dinner
.
Soda
crackers
,
sweet
cakes
,
candy
--
”
</p>
<p>
“
Substantial
,
I
must
say
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Do
hush
.
Rice
,
and
curry
,
yam
,
taro
,
bonita
,
of
course
,
a
big
cake
Toyama
is
making
,
young
pig
--
”
</p>
<p>
“
Oh
,
I
say
,
”
he
protested
.
</p>
<p>
“
It
is
all
right
,
Boyd
.
We
'll
be
in
Attu-Attu
in
three
days
.
Besides
,
it
's
my
pig
.
That
old
chief
what-ever-his-name
distinctly
presented
it
to
me
.
You
saw
him
yourself
.
And
then
two
tins
of
bullamacow
.
That
's
their
dinner
.
And
now
about
the
presents
.
Shall
we
wait
until
tomorrow
,
or
give
them
this
evening
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Christmas
Eve
,
by
all
means
,
”
was
the
man
's
judgment
.
“
We
'll
call
all
hands
at
eight
bells
;
I
'll
give
them
a
tot
of
rum
all
around
,
and
then
you
give
the
presents
.
Come
on
up
on
deck
.
It
's
stifling
down
here
.
I
hope
Lorenzo
has
better
luck
with
the
dynamo
;
without
the
fans
there
wo
n't
be
much
sleeping
to-night
if
we
're
driven
below
.
”
</p>
<p>
They
passed
through
the
small
main-cabin
,
climbed
a
steep
companion
ladder
,
and
emerged
on
deck
.
The
sun
was
setting
,
and
the
promise
was
for
a
clear
tropic
night
.
The
Samoset
,
with
fore-
and
main-sail
winged
out
on
either
side
,
was
slipping
a
lazy
four-knots
through
the
smooth
sea
.
Through
the
engine-room
skylight
came
a
sound
of
hammering
.
They
strolled
aft
to
where
Captain
Dettmar
,
one
foot
on
the
rail
,
was
oiling
the
gear
of
the
patent
log
.
At
the
wheel
stood
a
tall
South
Sea
Islander
,
clad
in
white
undershirt
and
scarlet
hip-cloth
.
</p>
<p>
Boyd
Duncan
was
an
original
.
At
least
that
was
the
belief
of
his
friends
.
Of
comfortable
fortune
,
with
no
need
to
do
anything
but
take
his
comfort
,
he
elected
to
travel
about
the
world
in
outlandish
and
most
uncomfortable
ways
.
Incidentally
,
he
had
ideas
about
coral-reefs
,
disagreed
profoundly
with
Darwin
on
that
subject
,
had
voiced
his
opinion
in
several
monographs
and
one
book
,
and
was
now
back
at
his
hobby
,
cruising
the
South
Seas
in
a
tiny
,
thirty-ton
yacht
and
studying
reef-formations
.
</p>
<p>
His
wife
,
Minnie
Duncan
,
was
also
declared
an
original
,
inasmuch
as
she
joyfully
shared
his
vagabond
wanderings
.
Among
other
things
,
in
the
six
exciting
years
of
their
marriage
she
had
climbed
Chimborazo
with
him
,
made
a
three-thousand-mile
winter
journey
with
dogs
and
sleds
in
Alaska
,
ridden
a
horse
from
Canada
to
Mexico
,
cruised
the
Mediterranean
in
a
ten-ton
yawl
,
and
canoed
from
Germany
to
the
Black
Sea
across
the
heart
of
Europe
.
They
were
a
royal
pair
of
wanderlusters
,
he
,
big
and
broad-shouldered
,
she
a
small
,
brunette
,
and
happy
woman
,
whose
one
hundred
and
fifteen
pounds
were
all
grit
and
endurance
,
and
withal
,
pleasing
to
look
upon
.
</p>
<p>
The
Samoset
had
been
a
trading
schooner
,
when
Duncan
bought
her
in
San
Francisco
and
made
alterations
.
Her
interior
was
wholly
rebuilt
,
so
that
the
hold
became
main-cabin
and
staterooms
,
while
abaft
amidships
were
installed
engines
,
a
dynamo
,
an
ice
machine
,
storage
batteries
,
and
,
far
in
the
stern
,
gasoline
tanks
.
Necessarily
,
she
carried
a
small
crew
.
Boyd
,
Minnie
,
and
Captain
Dettmar
were
the
only
whites
on
board
,
though
Lorenzo
,
the
small
and
greasy
engineer
,
laid
a
part
claim
to
white
,
being
a
Portuguese
half-caste
.
A
Japanese
served
as
cook
,
and
a
Chinese
as
cabin
boy
.
Four
white
sailors
had
constituted
the
original
crew
for'ard
,
but
one
by
one
they
had
yielded
to
the
charms
of
palm-waving
South
Sea
isles
and
been
replaced
by
islanders
.
Thus
,
one
of
the
dusky
sailors
hailed
from
Easter
Island
,
a
second
from
the
Carolines
,
a
third
from
the
Paumotus
,
while
the
fourth
was
a
gigantic
Samoan
.
At
sea
,
Boyd
Duncan
,
himself
a
navigator
,
stood
a
mate
's
watch
with
Captain
Dettmar
,
and
both
of
them
took
a
wheel
or
lookout
occasionally
.
On
a
pinch
,
Minnie
herself
could
take
a
wheel
,
and
it
was
on
pinches
that
she
proved
herself
more
dependable
at
steering
than
did
the
native
sailors
.
