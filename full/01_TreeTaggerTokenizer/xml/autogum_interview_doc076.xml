What
is
your
religious
affliation
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
MD
</hi>
:
We
are
Christian
.
We
are
not
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Roman_Catholicism">
Catholic
</ref>
.
That
is
a
falsehood
put
out
on
Wikipedia
,
and
I
’m
not
sure
where
that
came
from
.
I
think
people
just
assume
that
if
you
have
a
lot
of
kids
that
you
are
Catholic
.
And
there
is
one
nice
thing
about
that
,
we
live
right
across
the
street
from
a
very
large
prominent
Catholic
Parish
called
,
Our
Lady
of
Mt
.
Carmel
,
and
they
have
a
fall
festival
every
year
and
so
it
's
the
one
place
we
can
go
as
a
family
where
people
do
n't
give
us
funny
looks
because
of
the
number
of
girls
that
I
have
,
everybody
has
a
large
family
in
that
parish
.

Hello
Senator
Delph
,
I
’m
Jerrilyn
Thompson
,
and
I
have
a
question
for
you
.
The
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagamore%20of%20the%20Wabash%20Award">
Sagamore
of
the
Wabash
Award
</ref>
,
you
were
awarded
that
in
2005
.
And
this
honorary
award
is
awarded
by
the
Governor
.
And
what
did
you
do
to
get
this
honor
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
MD
</hi>
:
That
was
something
that
I
was
recommended
by
former
Congressman
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baron%20Hill">
Baron
Hill
</ref>
,
who
represented
the
southeastern
part
of
the
state
.
And
I
had
gotten
to
know
Congressman
Hill
when
I
was
an
executive
with
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comcast">
Comcast
Corporation
</ref>
.
We
actually
brought
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-SPAN">
C-SPAN
</ref>
school
bus
throughout
his
district
,
especially
to
his
hometown
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour,%20Indiana">
Seymour
</ref>
,
Indiana
.
And
we
had
gotten
to
know
each
other
,
and
he
found
out
that
I
had
served
as
an
international
election
observer
with
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International%20Republican%20Institute">
International
Republican
Institute
</ref>
in
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Nicaragua">
Nicaragua
</ref>
in
1996
and
then
in
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Mongolia">
Mongolia
</ref>
in
2000
.
And
then
he
had
also
learned
about
my
service
with
Congressman
Burton
and
also
here
in
the
state
of
Indiana
,
and
he
was
gracious
to
recommend
me
for
that
award
.
And
then
Governor
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe%20Kernan%20(politician)">
Kernan
</ref>
,
before
he
left
office
as
our
governor
,
was
very
gracious
to
award
me
the
Sagamore
of
the
Wabash
.

Thompson
:
Okay
,
just
a
few
more
questions
.
You
had
mentioned
earlier
about
the
role
that
Congressman
Dan
Burton
had
played
in
your
life
,
could
you
please
talk
a
little
bit
more
about
that
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
MD
</hi>
:
Well
certainly
.
He
is
somebody
that
was
my
boss
,
I
’ve
known
him
for
a
good
chunk
of
my
life
.
When
I
was
thirteen
or
fourteen
,
I
served
as
a
page
for
him
.
When
he
was
an
Indiana
state
senator
.
I
had
volunteered
a
little
bit
on
his
political
campaigns
but
not
a
great
deal
.
Primarily
putting
stickers
on
fire
hats
in
preparation
for
his
parade
season
.
</p>
<p>
But
I
worked
for
him
from
—
I
want
to
say
—
1996
to
2004
.
Roughly
eight
years
,
give
or
take
.
I
served
as
a
member
of
his
professional
staff
when
he
was
chairman
of
the
House
Committee
on
Government
Reform
and
Oversight
.
And
then
I
also
served
as
a
member
of
his
professional
staff
,
handling
a
number
of
different
policy
areas
,
including
foreign
policy
and
national
security
policy
.
I
covered
agricultural
issues
and
environmental
policy
forum
,
given
some
of
my
academic
background
.
But
primarily
in
the
national
security
foreign
policy
area
,
primarily
focused
on
anti-narcotics
and
the
drug
war
.
I
was
able
to
travel
—
in
addition
to
traveling
when
I
was
an
international
election
observer
—
I
was
able
to
travel
as
a
member
of
his
staff
to
countries
like
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Turkey">
Turkey
</ref>
and
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Colombia">
Colombia
</ref>
.
