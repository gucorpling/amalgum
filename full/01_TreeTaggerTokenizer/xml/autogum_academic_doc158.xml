Introduction
</head>
<p>
In
2030
,
in
Western
Europe
and
in
the
ten
most
populous
nations
of
the
world
,
the
estimated
number
of
individuals
with
Parkinson
’s
disease
(
PD
)
will
be
over
8
million
.
One
of
the
main
challenges
to
be
faced
will
be
the
development
of
technological
and
cost-effective
solutions
to
improve
the
healthcare
of
these
patients
.
Remote
medical
communications
,
for
example
in
the
form
of
telemedicine
and
decentralized
care
pathways
,
will
inevitably
become
part
of
the
clinical
management
of
such
disease
.
</p>
<p>
Among
the
tougher
hurdles
to
overcome
,
there
is
the
accurate
,
low-cost
and
objective
quantification
of
the
typical
motor
symptoms
,
which
is
a
key
issue
for
obtaining
a
complete
indication
of
the
patient
’s
state
of
impairment
.
Since
1967
,
when
the
motor
effects
of
Levodopa
(
LD
)
on
bradykinesia
have
been
shown
for
the
first
time
in
a
video
,
the
way
has
been
traced
towards
the
quantification
of
movement
disorders
and
their
therapeutic
response
.
This
pathway
passes
through
semi-quantitative
rating
scales
,
such
as
the
Hoehn
and
Yahr
stage
and
unified
Parkinson
’s
disease
rating
scale
(
UPDRS
)
,
which
is
still
the
gold
standard
scale
for
assessing
symptoms
in
PD
.
Evaluation
through
the
UPDRS
score
is
a
subjective
process
that
comes
after
a
global
clinical
judgment
for
the
diagnosis
in
which
the
experience
of
the
specialist
in
movement
disorders
is
crucial
.
This
process
is
,
in
fact
,
characterized
by
an
intrinsic
inter-rater
variability
due
to
the
different
experience
of
the
examiners
,
influencing
the
final
judgment
on
the
impairment
severity
.
A
percentage
of
incorrect
diagnosis
of
25
%
has
also
been
reported
,
especially
when
symptoms
such
as
essential
tremor
,
vascular
parkinsonism
and
atypical
parkinsonian
syndromes
manifest
.
</p>
<p>
Another
difficulty
to
overcome
,
shared
by
all
clinical
assessment
scales
,
is
the
mandatory
presence
of
the
specialist
:
this
strongly
influences
the
clinical
management
of
the
patient
,
as
all
the
therapeutic
decisions
are
restricted
at
the
time
of
the
single
medical
examination
.
However
,
during
the
time
interval
between
two
consecutive
examinations
,
the
patient
’s
motor
status
may
change
significantly
,
out
of
the
examiner
’s
sight
.
The
chance
of
monitoring
any
change
of
the
impairment
in
PD
subjects
over
time
,
possibly
daily
and
in
a
domestic
environment
,
could
have
a
strong
impact
on
the
clinical
management
of
the
patients
and
,
consequently
,
on
the
long-term
costs
for
the
healthcare
system
.
</p>
<p>
In
an
attempt
to
address
these
challenges
and
quantify
motor
symptoms
,
motion
analysis
studies
have
played
a
growing
role
in
managing
subjects
with
PD
,
exploring
kinematic
variables
on
gait
;
tremor
;
bradykinesia
and
rigidity
.
Motion
capture
systems
are
the
reference
standard
for
motion
analysis
,
but
they
are
expensive
and
non-portable
,
so
their
use
is
limited
to
laboratory
environments
and
scientific
research
rather
than
to
a
routine
clinical
use
.
</p>
<p>
Therefore
,
in
order
to
overcome
these
hurdles
,
it
is
urgent
to
find
automatic
and
cost-effective
solutions
,
capable
of
providing
accurate
and
objective
kinematic
measures
of
motor
performance
and
automatic
scores
that
are
well
correlated
to
the
standard
clinical
ones
.
</p>
<p>
Recently
,
various
technological
approaches
have
been
proposed
for
the
analysis
of
movement
in
PD
,
including
wearable
sensor
networks
based
on
the
use
of
inertial
measurement
units
(
IMUs
)
,
smartphones
and
active
vision
systems
based
on
new
low-cost
RGB-Depth
optical
devices
such
as
Microsoft
Kinect®
(
Microsoft
Corporation
,
Redmond
,
WA
,
USA
)
and
Intel
RealSense®
SR300
(
Intel
Corporation
,
Santa
Clara
,
CA
,
USA)[26
]
.
</p>
<p>
On
the
basis
of
these
considerations
,
we
propose
the
integration
of
two
different
sensor-based
subsystems
as
a
single
solution
for
the
objective
,
accurate
and
automated
assessment
of
some
standard
tasks
for
the
upper
and
lower
limbs
,
as
defined
in
the
motor
examination
section
(
Section
3
)
of
UPDRS
.
The
first
component
is
an
active
vision
system
dedicated
to
the
analysis
of
the
motor
tasks
related
to
upper
limbs
;
the
second
applies
a
body
sensor
network
(
BSN
)
approach
with
wireless
wearable
sensors
for
the
analysis
of
the
lower
limb
tasks
.
The
technical
details
of
both
and
the
validation
of
their
accuracy
as
UPDRS
automatic
scoring
systems
have
been
already
presented
in
previous
works
and
will
be
briefly
summarized
in
the
Materials
and
Methods
section
.
</p>
<p>
A
gesture-based
human
machine
interface
has
been
developed
as
part
of
the
solution
,
to
simplify
the
interaction
and
the
self-management
of
the
system
by
people
with
impairment
,
in
view
of
a
possible
use
at
home
.
</p>
<p>
The
system
is
able
to
analyze
and
automatically
score
the
patient
movements
during
the
performance
of
UPDRS
tasks
.
In
addition
,
it
archives
in
the
Cloud
the
kinematic
data
,
the
score
and
the
video
of
each
motor
performance
,
guaranteeing
the
remote
supervision
by
clinicians
and
overcoming
the
mandatory
presence
of
the
specialist
during
the
execution
of
the
motor
activities
.
Finally
,
in
view
of
a
decentralized
approach
to
the
clinical
management
of
the
patient
,
the
issue
of
acceptability
and
usability
of
the
integrated
system
has
been
evaluated
through
a
standard
questionnaire
.
</p>
<p>
The
integrated
system
here
presented
is
aimed
at
a
more
comprehensive
evaluation
of
the
neuro-motor
status
of
PD
subjects
by
a
decentralized
approach
,
and
could
represent
a
new
example
of
an
accurate
,
feasible
and
cost-effective
strategy
for
the
clinical
management
of
PD
.
