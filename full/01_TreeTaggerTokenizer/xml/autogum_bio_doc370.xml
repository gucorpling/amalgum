He

incident
known
as

Background
</head>
<p>
After
the
disappearance
of
king
Sebastian
at
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Alcácer_Quibir">
Alcácer
Quibir
</ref>
(
1578
)
,
many
efforts
were
made
to
ransom
imprisoned
Portuguese
soldiers
.
Several
soldiers
returned
to
Portugal
,
which
led
many
Portuguese
to
believe
Sebastian
had
survived
the
battle
and
would
return
to
claim
his
throne
.
This
led
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastianism">
Sebastianism
</ref>
:
the
belief
that
Sebastian
could
return
at
any
moment
.
Sebastian
did
not
have
descendants
and
thus
eventually
the
throne
went
to
his
uncle

Very
little
is
known
of
Espinosa
's
early
years
.
Some
scholars
believe
that
he
was
probably
born
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toledo,_Spain">
Toledo
</ref>
as
this
town
had
he
oldest
document
known
about
him
,
his
title
of
baker
,
but
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrigal_de_las_Altas_Torres">
Madrigal
</ref>
is
believed
thar
he
was
born
there
.
What
is
known
is
that
in
1594
he
arrived
at
Madrigal
alongside
his
two-year-old
daughter
,
Clara
,
and
his
wife
,
Isabel
Cid
.
People
noticed
that
the
new
baker
spoke
several
languages
(
at
least
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language">
French
</ref>
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language">

</ref>
)
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-1">

knew
how
to
ride
a
horse
and
,
in
general
,
appeared
to
be
more
than
a
humble
officer
.
Although
it
is
not
impossible
that
he
had
learned
these
skills
working
for
the
militia
of
Captain
Pedro
Bermúdez
,
where
he
served
.
</p>
<p>
In
the
same
town
lived
<hi rend="bold">
Friar
Miguel
de
los
Santos
</hi>
,
the
possible
thinker
of
the
scam
,
who
had
been
a
confessor
in
the
court
of
King
Sebastian
,
and
had
supported
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/António,_Prior_of_Crato">
Prior
of
Crato
</ref>
in
his
intention
to
succeed
said
king
.
For
that
reason
he
had
been
exiled
from
Portugal
and
sent
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Castile">
Castile
</ref>
by
Philip
II
.
</p>
<p>
The
third
person
involved
is
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/María_Ana_de_Austria_(1568-1629)">
María
Ana
de
Austria
</ref>
,
daughter
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_of_Austria">
John
of
Austria
</ref>
.
She
entered
the
convent
of
Agustinas
de
Madrigal
at
the
age
of
six
,
sent
by
his
uncle
Philip
II
.
It
seems
that
she
had
no
religious
vocation
whatsoever
,
and
that
she
preferred
adventure
stories
,
especially
if
they
referred
to
her
father
or
her
cousin
Sebastian
,
whom
,
like
many
others
at
the
time
,
she
believed
alive
.

The
plot
</head>
<p>
Probably
Friar
Miguel
de
los
Santos
noticed
the
physical
resemblance
between
Espinosa
and
Sebastian
(
among
other
things
,
they
were
both
redheads
,
something
unusual
in
Portugal
)
and
convinced
Espinosa
to
impersonate
the
late
king
.
De
los
Santos
also
introduced
him
to
Ana
de
Austria
.
Either
because
she
believed
him
to
actually
be
her
cousin
or
just
because
she
wanted
to
escape
the
convent
she
agreed
to
promise
in
marriage
with
him
until
she
could
obtain
permission
from
the
Pope
.
</p>
<p>
Sebastian
was
arrested
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valladolid">
Valladolid
</ref>
for
talking
disrespectfully
of
the
king
and
the
jailers
found
on
him
4
letters
(
two
by
Miguel
de
los
Santos
and
two
by
Ana
de
Austria
)
talking
about
the
plot
.
The
matter
was
then
referred
to
the
royal
court
and
both
Miguel
and
Ana
were
also
arrested

both
Espinosa

Miguel

were
repeatedly
interrogated

sometimes
under

Espinosa
made
contradictory
declarations

process

he
was
sentenced
to
death

He
remained
calm

proud
during

execution

After
the
hanging
,
Gabriel
was
decapitated

dismembered

his
remains
were
exposed

hanged

Philip
