Chaung
Tha
</hi>
(
Burmese
ချောင်းသာ
)

a
coastal
town
and
beach

<head>
Understand
</head>
<p>
This
town
is
expanding
fast
and
you
can
now
find
many
beach
side
resorts
.
Step
from
your
bungalow
straight
onto
the
beach
.
Although
there
are
not
so
many
foreign
visitors
,
the
number
is
growing
and
hotels
are
upgrading
their
facilities
to
accommodate
them
.
</p>
<p>
The
beach
itself
is
a
long
expanse
of
golden
sand
.
Each
hotel
tries
to
clean
its
own
beach
side
daily
.
Many
vendors
work
the
beach
,
but
are
not
pushy
.
Some
carry
fresh
live
seafood
and
will
barbecue
it
for
you
upon
request
.
Inflatable
rings
and
dinghies
are
available
for
hire
.
</p>
<head>
Get
in
</head>
<p>
Getting
in
via
road
,
mostly
by
bus
,
is
the
only
option
.

Buses
leave
around
dawn
and
take
5-6
hours
to
reach
Chaung
Tha
.
The
last
2
hours
or
so
of
the
trip
are
on
very
bad
roads
,
making
the
trip
longer
.
The
buses
make
2-3
scheduled
stops
along
the
way
at
roadside
cafes
.
The
journey
costs
around
8,000
kyat
.
Travellers
departing
from
Yangon
should
set
aside
an
extra
hour
for
travel
between
the
city
centre
and
the
outskirts
bus
station
,
Dagon
Ayar
Highway
Bus
Station
.
Expect
to
pay
between
300
and
5,000
kyat
from
the
centre
to
the
bus
station
,
depending
on
the
kind
of
transportation
,
i.e.
local
bus
or
taxi
.

Another
option
is
to
take
a
transport
to
Pathein
from
Yangon
(
bus
,
3-4
hours
,
3,700-8,000
kyat
)
,
or
any
other
city
in
Myanmar
,
e.g.
<ref target="Pyay">
Pyay
</ref>
or
<ref target="Ngapali">
Ngapali
</ref>
.
From
Pathein
you
can
take
a
local
bus
or
shared
pickup/van
for
another
2
hours
.
Try
the
city
bus
station
near
Shwemokehtaw
Pagoda
or
hail
for
passing
by
vehicles
at
the
northern
end
of
Min
Gyi
Road
,
which
leads
to
Chaung
Tha
(
and
Ngwe
Saung
)
.
The
last
regular
transport
leaves
at
16:00
,
after
which
it
is
still
possible
to
negotiate
a
transfer
from
Pathein
to
the
beach
via
(
pickup
)
taxi
for
around
30,000-50,000
kyat
.
If
you
do
not
have
a
lot
of
luggage
,
it
is
also
possible
to
do
this
trip
via
a
motorbike
for
around
10,000
kyat
per
person
(
2
hours
)
.
Be
mindful
of
the
bad
roads
for
this
portion
of
the
trip
,
i.
e.
,
this
option
is
not
for
those
looking
for
comfort
.

Ngwe

via
coast
and
motorbike
taxi
for
about
8-13,000
kyat
one-way
.
This
includes
at
least
two
river
crossings
.
Reported
durations
vary
widely
between
45
min
and
4
hr
,
so
clarify
beforehand
.
</item>
</list>
<p>
You
can
even
negotiate
with
any
<hi rend="bold">
Yangon
taxi
</hi>
driver
to
take
you
by
taxi
to
Chaung
Tha
(
some
have
air
conditioning
)
,
so
if
you
are
travelling
in
a
group
of
3
or
4
and
you
split
the
cost
it
can
be
worthwhile
.
However
,
remember
that
the
taxi
will
be
returning
empty
,
so
you
have
to
consider
this
when
agreeing
the
price
.
If
your
trip
is
for
just
a
few
days
,
it
may
be
better
to
negotiate
with
the
driver
to
stay
in
town
(
he
'll
probably
sleep
in
his
taxi
)
and
then
he
will
be
able
to
bring
you
back
also
.
Current
rate
is
around
$
120
-
150
one
way
.

Get
around
</head>
<p>
The
main
strip
is
located
directly
by
the
beach
,
meaning
all
eating
and
relaxing
needs
can
be
satisfied
on
foot
.
</p>
<p>
The
motorbike
taxis
wait
outside
most
of
the
hotels
and
are
plentiful
.
Expect
to
pay
500
kyat
per
trip
,
although
nothing
is
very
far
.
Sidecar
(
a
bicycle
with
a
sidecar
of
two
back-to-back
seats
)
are
also
available
at
a
more
leisurely
pace
for
the
same
fare
.

<p>
Northern
beaches
are
considered
cleaner
.
On
the
other
hand
,
depending
on
circumstances
,
beaches
in
the
centre
may
be
cleaner
;
after
a
storm
,
northern
beaches
may
have
black
stuff
washed
up
on
them

Pokala
Island
</hi>
(
Just
southwest
of
the
Chaung
Tha
coast
)
.
Pokala
Island
is
particularly
beautiful
,
and
just
a
short
motorcycle-boat
trip
away
from
the
main
beach
street
.
This
also
requires
a
short
boat
ride
(
1,000
kyat
return
)
.
Inhabitants
of
the
island
are
local
fishermen
,
living
together
with
their
families
in
the
houses
on
the
island
.
A
walk
around
the
island
reveals
remote
beaches
as
well
as
sharp
&amp;
rocky
coastline

(
about
2
km
further
north
from
Chaung

,
go
by
the
Golden
Bay
Resort
along
the
beach
)
.
Some
say
they
are
cleaner
.
Walking
there
,
go
past
the
small
pagoda
standing
on
a
small
hill
in
the
water
,
there
is
another
pagoda
further
up
,
with
three
large
rocks
in
the
water
.
You
can
get
there
by
motorcycle
,
but
the
road
is
muddy
with
many
ruts
.
Likewise
,
the
beach
route
is
hard
to
drive
on
,
if
you
are
not
that
experienced
with
motorbikes
,
and
driving
on
sand
,
you
may
need
a
local
driver
if
you
do
not
want
to
go
by
your
own
bike
.
You
will
find
a
great
place
to
relax
within
coconut
trees
and
even
a
&quot;
bar
&quot;
with
cold
drinks
.

Ngwe
Saung
</hi>
.
A
motorbike
ride
to
Ngwe
Saung
Beach
is
highly
recommended
(
about
1.5-2
hr
)
.
It
follows
the
beach
and
includes
3
river
crossings
by
a
small
boat
.
This
is
a
very
scenic
trip
.
Can
be
arranged
with
a
travel
agency
or
your
hotel
for
13,000-15,000
kyat
,
or
privately
for
around
8-13,000
kyat
.
Even
though
you
might
want
to
consider
Ngwe
Saung
to
be
the
next
stop
instead
of
a
day
trip

up

</head>
<p>
Numerous
shops
and
street

exist
along
the
beach
road
.
Here
you
can
buy
souvenirs
,
local
snack
foods
and
beach

Eat
</head>
<p>
Numerous
restaurants
line
the
main
beach
road
,
serving
seafood
in
addition
to
the
typical
Myanmar
cuisine
.
Most
serve
mango
or
delicious
traditional
desserts
as
a
complimentary
after-dinner
treat
.
</p>
<p>
Try
to
avoid
eating
at
the
larger
hotel
restaurants
,
as
locals
complain
that
they
stifle
competition
by
buying
up
all
the
freshly
caught
seafood
and
locally
grown
potatoes
from
the
town
's
markets
