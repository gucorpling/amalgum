Among

is
the

The
first
manuscript
was
done
for
a
priest
named
Khatchatur
and
received
many
sponsors
from
various
wealthy
Armenians
.

This
was
soon
followed
by
the
Gospel
of
1609
,

Mourning
fell
upon
Armenia
,
for
he
[
Shah
Abbas

destroyed
and
made
desolate
all
houses
and
habitations
,
so
that
men
fled
and
hid
themselves
in
fortresses
and
clefts
of
rocks
.
Some
he
found
and
slew
,
others
he
led
captive
and
sent
to
that
city
of
Shosh
or
Aspahan
[
Isfahan

...
And
he
settled
us
on
the
south
side
of
the
river
Zandar

where
we
built
houses
and
habitations
and
churches
for
our
prayers

Art
historian
Alice
Taylor
describes
Mesrop
's
work
as
&quot;
less
lively
&quot;
than
other
contemporaneous
Khizan
painters
,
but
his
&quot;
settings
are
charged
with
life
and
energy
&quot;
