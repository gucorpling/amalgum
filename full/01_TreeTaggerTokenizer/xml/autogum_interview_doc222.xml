Let
's
get
into
social
issues
now
.
You
criticized
President
Obama
for
his
stance
that
same-sex
marriage
be
left
to
the
states
.
With
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">
Tenth
Amendment
</ref>
in
mind
,
why
should
same-sex
marriage
be
a
federal
issue
and
why
should
the
federal
government
mandate
that
states
allow
same
sex
marriage
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Gary
Johnson
</hi>
:
Well
I
think
that
first
and
foremost
that
as
president
of
the
United
States
you
take
an
oath
to
govern
under
strict
adherence
to
the
U.S.
Constitution
.
I
would
espouse
...
I
would
suggest
that
marriage
equality
is
a
constitutionally
guaranteed
right
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal%20Protection%20Clause">
Equal
Protection
Clause
</ref>
that
is
on
par
with
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American%20Civil%20Rights%20Movement%20(1955 â€“ 1968)">
Civil
Rights
of
the
sixties
</ref>
.
It
's
not
a
states
issue
,
that
it
's
a
federal
issue
and
that
the
federal
government
should
be
involved
.
If
you
say
it
's
a
state
issue
where
42
states
have
said
that
marriage
is
between
a
man
and
a
woman
.
Effectively
what
you
're
saying
is
that
'
I
'm
not
going
to
do
anything
when
it
comes
to
marriage
equality
'
,
and
I
take
the
position
that
marriage
equality
is
a
constitutionally
guaranteed
right
so
goes
the
federal
involvement
.

Okay
I
'm
getting
to
my
final
questions
here
.
I
want
to
talk
about
the
Libertarian
Party
.
The
first
nominee
of
the
Party
was
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John%20Hospers">
John
Hospers
</ref>
,
who
died
last
year
,
and
he
was
a
supporter
of
Republican
President
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/George_W._Bush">
George
W.
Bush
</ref>
.
The
next
nominee
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger%20MacBride">
Roger
MacBride
</ref>
also
left
the
party
and
went
to
the
Republican
Party
.
The
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United%20States%20presidential%20election,%201988">
1988
</ref>
nominee
Ron
Paul
,
as
we
all
know
,
serves
in
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives">
House
of
Representatives
</ref>
as
a
member
of
the
Republican
Party
,
and
his
son
[
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rand%20Paul">
Rand
Paul
</ref>
]
serves
in
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_States_Senate">
Senate
</ref>
as
a
member
of
the
Republican
Party
.
Both
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2008">
2008
</ref>
presidential
and
vice-presidential
nominees
of
the
Libertarian
Party
:
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Bob_Barr">
Bob
Barr
</ref>
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne%20Allyn%20Root">
Wayne
Allyn
Root
</ref>
have
recently
rejoined
the
Republican
Party
and
have
both
endorsed
Mitt
Romney
for
president
.
In
fact
,
until
the
end
of
last
year
,
you
too
were
a
member
of
the
Republican
Party
.
So
why
does
it
seem
Libertarians
flock
to
the
Republican
Party
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Gary
Johnson
</hi>
:
I
'm
not
so
certain
...
I
think
that
the
tie-in
is
[
libertarian
]
Republicans
are
fiscally
conservative
and
socially
accepting
.
That
's
the
,
I
think
,
the
heading
under
which
most
Americans
are
.
I
will
just
tell
you
that
last
night
,
although
it
did
not
happen
,
apparently
the
Democrats
were
going
to
come
and
protest
my
speaking
at
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University%20of%20Colorado%20at%20Boulder">
University
of
Colorado
at
Boulder
</ref>
.
I
guess
it
was
all
those
anti-gay
,
anti-immigration
,
pro-Drug
War
,
pro-military
interventionists
that
were
going
to
show
up
and
protest
me
.

But
you
admit
that
there
are
some
Liberty
Republicans
and
that
Republicans
make
up
a
large
portion
of
libertarians
.
Is
that
correct
?
