SIR
Model

Propagation
</head>
<p>
In
this
work
,
we
focus
on
an
undirected
graph
,
where
<hi rend="italic">
V
</hi>
is
the
set
of
nodes
and
<hi rend="italic">
E
</hi>
is
the
set
of
edges
.
Each
node
has
its
possible
state
—
Susceptible
(
<hi rend="italic">
S
</hi>
)
,
Infected
(
<hi rend="italic">
I
</hi>
)
,
Recovered
(
<hi rend="italic">
R
</hi>
)
.
The
susceptible
nodes
represent
the
people
who
are
infected
easily
but
have
not
been
infected
yet
,
meanwhile
the
infected
nodes
denote
the
citizens
who
have
already
been
infected
and
are
capable
of
infecting
other
nodes
.
The
recovered
nodes
are
the
individuals
who
remain
immune
or
die
.
Suppose
that
there
is
a
time-slotted
system
.
At
first
,
only
several
nodes
are
infected
,
which
are
the
contagion
sources
in
the
network
.
Meanwhile
,
the
other
nodes
are
susceptible
.
At
each
time
step
,
each
infected
node
infects
its
susceptible
neighbors
with
probability
<hi rend="italic">
p
</hi>
independently
,
that
is
,
a
susceptible
node
is
infected
with
probability
when
it
has
<hi rend="italic">
n
</hi>
infected
neighbors
.
Meanwhile
,
the
infected
nodes
turn
to
be
recovered
with
probability
<hi rend="italic">
q
</hi>
.
Additionally
,
the
recovered
nodes
will
not
be
infected
,
which
may
die
or
be
removed
.

Problem
Formulation
</head>
<p>
As
a
contagion
propagates
through
a
complex
network
under
the
SIR
model
,
all
the
nodes
will
change
infection
state
as
time
goes
by
.
The
susceptible
nodes
may
be
infected
by
infected
neighbour
nodes
and
the
infected
nodes
recover
to
a
recovered
node
with
a
certain
probability
.
Due
to
the
emergency
response
to
contagion
,
we
mainly
consider
an
initial
infection
situation
of
the
whole
network
and
only
collect
two
states
,
infected
and
uninfected
(
susceptible
,
recovered
)
,
of
all
nodes
.
Accordingly
,
the
problem
of
the
multiple
sources
localization
problem
can
be
described
as
—
given
the
simple
snapshot
of
the
network
at
an
early
certain
moment
,
how
can
we
accurately
locate
multiple
sources
?
</p>
<p>
It
is
common
that
we
know
the
state
of
almost
all
nodes
,
but
we
have
no
ability
to
distinguish
the
susceptible
nodes
from
the
recovered
nodes
.
Therefore
,
all
nodes
can
be
divided
into
two
states
—
infected
and
uninfected
,
which
decreases
the
accuracy
of
multiple
sources
localization
certainty
.

Potential
Concentration
Label
Definition
</head>
<p>
In
the
early
period
of
severe
contagion
propagation
,
disease
outbreaks
through
a
crowd
quickly
.
It
comes
to
the
situation
that
the
nodes
around
sources
are
more
likely
to
be
the
infected
nodes
,
that
is
,
the
sources
are
surrounded
by
many
infected
nodes
.
Only
by
depending
on
the
infection
states
can
we
locate
the
sources
in
a
complex
network
accurately
.
</p>
<p>
Inspired
by
<figure>
Figure
1
</figure>
a
,
which
shows
the
concentration
of
a
pollutant
,
it
is
clear
that
the
sources
are
more
likely
to
be
the
node
set
,
whose
concentration
is
the
highest
(
10
)
.
In
fact
,
to
get
the
state
of
each
node
is
not
easy
,
for
example
,
some
sensors
do
not
have
the
capacity
to
measure
concentrations
,
and
can
only
judge
whether
the
concentration
surpasses
a
threshold
value
or
not
,
and
even
then
we
may
lose
the
concentration
information
.
Therefore
,
the
information
we
can
obtain
is
incomplete
,
just
like
in
<figure>
Figure
1
</figure>
b.
We
can
see
two
concentration
states
easily
,
0
or
1
(
1
denotes
concentration
over
8
,
0
denotes
concentration
under
8
)
in
a
network
,
where
an
error
occurred
with
node
<hi rend="italic">
c
</hi>
.
It
seems
we
have
no
ability
to
identify
the
sources
according
to
these
concentrations
,
which
is
similar
to
the
infection
situation
of
contagion
.
</p>
<p>
Therefore
,
a
new
index
needs
to
be
proposed
so
as
to
distinguish
between
the
sources
and
other
nodes
for
incomplete
pollutant
diffusion
and
contagion
propagation
.
We
think
the
node
with
more
infected
neighbors
,
including
the
first
order
neighbor
,
the
second
order
neighbor
and
so
forth
,
is
closer
to
the
sources
.
Based
on
the
above
analysis
,
we
propose
a
new
concept
,
namely
a
potential
concentration
label
,
denoted
by
.
The
potential
concentration
label
is
determined
by
its
initial
label
and
the
labels
of
neighbor
nodes
.
The
experiments
demonstrate
that
it
is
a
good
index
for
locating
multiple
sources
of
contagion
in
complex
networks
under
the
SIR
model
.

The
Method
</head>
<p>
In
this
section
,
we
present
the
method
at
length
in
this
section
.
The
purpose
of
is
to
locate
multiple
contagion
sources
,
which
is
realized
by
following
four
steps
in
Algorithm

.

Step

:
Label
Assignment
in
the
Snapshot
of
Network
</head>
<p>
Due
to
the
incomplete
information
,
only
two
states
can
be
seen
in
the
network
—
infected
and
uninfected
(
susceptible
and
recovered
)
.
The
infection
state
of
nodes
is
shown
as
follows
—
infected
nodes
carry
the
virus
,
denoted
by
1
;
uninfected
nodes
carry
no
virus
,
denoted
by
0
.
That
is
,
if
node
<hi rend="italic">
i
</hi>
is
infected
,
then
;
if
node
<hi rend="italic">
i
</hi>
is
uninfected
,
then
,
where
is
the
initial
potential
concentration
label
of
node
<hi rend="italic">
i
</hi>
.
