Deal
with
Exposed
Tree
Roots
</head>
<p>
As
a
tree
ages
,
shallow
roots
can
sometimes
expand
to
the
point
that
they
become
exposed
above
the
surface
of
the
soil
.
Roots
can
also
become
exposed
due
to
soil
erosion
or
cramped
conditions
forcing
the
roots
to
the
surface
.
If
your
tree
has
exposed
roots
that
are
causing
problems
,
try
covering
the
roots
with
mulch
or
an
attractive
ground
cover
.
As
a
last
resort
,
consider
removing
or
partially
removing
a
problem
root
.
Prevent
problems
by
planting
your
trees
strategically
and
choosing
species
that
are
less
prone
to
surface
roots
.

Covering
Exposed
Roots
with
Mulch
</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Select
an
organic
mulch
material
.
A
layer
of
mulch
around
the
tree
’s
roots
can
cushion
and
insulate
the
roots
and
minimize
soil
erosion
.
Pick
a
material
that
wo
n’t
absorb
too
much
moisture
from
the
soil
around
the
base
of
the
tree
.
A
few
options
include
:
<figure rend="Deal with Exposed Tree Roots Step 1.jpg">
</figure>
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Pine
straw
.
This
material
is
not
absorbent
,
and
will
allow
moisture
to
reach
your
tree
’s
roots
easily
.
</item>
<item>
Pine
bark
nuggets
.
If
you
choose
this
material
,
make
sure
to
remove
old
nuggets
before
laying
down
new
ones
,
or
the
old
mulch
may
absorb
too
much
moisture
from
around
the
tree
’s
roots
.
</item>
<item>
Shredded
wood
mulch
.
Because
this
material
absorbs
moisture
easily
,
avoid
putting
too
much
at
the
base
of
your
tree
.
Use
a
layer
only
about
1
inch
(
2.5
cm
)
thick
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Put
down
a
layer
of
mulch
no
more
than
3-4
inches
(
7.6-10.2
cm
)
thick
.
You
will
need
to
put
down
enough
mulch
to
cover
the
exposed
roots
,
but
take
care
not
to
put
down
so
much
that
you
smother
the
roots
.
<figure rend="Deal with Exposed Tree Roots Step 2.jpg">
</figure>
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Use
thinner
layers
when
applying
more
absorbent
mulches
(
such
as
shredded
wood
)
,
and
take
care
that
the
pile
does
n’t
become
too
thick
when
you
refresh
the
mulch
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Make
the
area
of
mulch
wide
enough
to
cover
the
exposed
roots
.
Your
mulched
area
may
need
to
be
up
to
2/3rds
the
diameter
of
the
tree
’s
canopy
.
Do
n’t
worry
if
the
mulch
covers
up
part
of
the
lawn
around
the
tree
.
Allowing
your
roots
to
compete
with
your
grass
will
only
lead
to
further
soil
erosion
.

<item>
Avoid
piling
mulch
against
the
trunk
of
the
tree
.
If
you
pile
up
too
much
mulch
around
the
base
of
the
tree
,
it
may
cause
the
bark
at
the
bottom
of
the
tree
to
become
diseased
.
Leave
a
little
space
between
your
mulched
area
and
the
base
of
the
tree
.

Break
up
the
top
1
inch
(
2.5
cm
)
layer
of
soil
around
the
roots
.
Use
a
spading
fork
to
very
carefully
break
up
the
compacted
topsoil
between
the
surface
roots
.
Take
care
not
to
damage
the
roots
themselves
,
and
go
no
deeper
than
1
inch
(
2.5
cm
)
.
<figure rend="Deal with Exposed Tree Roots Step 5.jpg">

Spread
no
more
than
2
inches
(
5
cm
)
of
garden
soil
over
the
topsoil
.
Add
garden
soil
to
your
newly
broken-up
topsoil
layer
,
being
very
careful
not
to
layer
on
more
than
2
inches
(
5
cm
)
of
new
soil
.
If
you
add
too
much
new
soil
,
your
tree
’s
roots
will
suffocate
,
and
the
tree
will
eventually
die
.

While
you
may
need
to
replenish
the
new
soil
each
year
,
do
not
add
more
than
2
inches
(
5
cm
)
of
soil
to
the
base
of
your
tree
per
year
.
</item>

<item>
Add
a
light
application
of
general-purpose
granular
fertilizer
.
Adding
some
fertilizer
will
help
keep
your
tree
healthy
and
prevent
the
ground
cover
plants
from
using
up
too
many
valuable
nutrients
.
Following
the
package
directions
,
sprinkle
a
little
15-5-10
or
13-13-13
NPK
fertilizer
over
the
exposed
root
area
.

tree
.
Pick
a

or
moisture
.
In
general
,
the
best
times
to
plant

are
early
spring
and
late
fall
.

Avoid
planting
shade
trees
too
close
to
buildings

Surface
roots
mainly
become
a
problem
when
they
interfere
with
footpaths

Try
to
plant
