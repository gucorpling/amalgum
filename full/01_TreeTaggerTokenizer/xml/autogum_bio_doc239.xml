Exploits
with

Bau
</head>
<p>
Given
his
fluency
of
the
Tongan
and
Fijian
languages
and
proclivity
for
violence
,
Savage
easily
insinuated
himself
in
the
company
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bau_Island">
Bau
Island
</ref>
chieftain
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turaga_na_Rasau#The_reign_of_Naulivou">
Naulivou
</ref>
.
From
the
wreckage
of
the
<hi rend="italic">

,
Savage
was
able
to
salvage
a
number
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musket">
muskets
</ref>
which
he
then
demonstrated
to
the
Bauan
leaders
.
This
combination
of
circumstance
,
personality
,
and
technology
allowed
Savage
to
participate
in
the
Fijian
wars
,
allegedly
the
first
time
firearms
were
ever
used
in
Fiji
.

Savage
led
a
small
group
of
beachcombers
as
mercenaries
in
the
service
of
Naulivou
and
quickly
showed
their
worth
in
fights
with
his
enemies

Lacking
certain
cultural
inhibitions
of
Fijians
(
such
as
targeting
opposing
chieftains
at
the
outset
of
battle
)
and
leveraging
their
individual
skill
with
muskets
proved
Savage
and
company
as
a
violent
and
capable
force
in
Fijian
internecine
warfare
.
</p>
<p>
Savage
is
credited
with
using
an
arrow-proof
structure
built
outside
his
enemies
'
fortifications
so
that
he
could
fire
at
them
with
impunity
.
Other
accounts
of
his
lethality
depict
that
his
“
victims
were
so
numerous
that
the
townspeople
piled
up
the
bodies
and
sheltered
behind
them
;
and
the
stream
beside
the
village
ran
red
.

For
his
services
,
Savage
was
accorded
a
certain
amount
of
prestige
and
rewards
from
Naulivou
,
although
the
scope
and
magnitude
of
the
more
sensational
details

to
include
numerous
wives

on
local

,
and
becoming
a

in

to
be

The
events
of
Dillon
's
Rock
</head>
<p>
In
1813
the
<hi rend="italic">
Hunter
</hi>
reached
Fiji
to
ply
in
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandalwood">
sandalwood
</ref>
trade
and
subsequently
employed
a
number
of
local
European
beachcombers
including
Savage
.
As
recounted
by
third
mate
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Dillon">
Peter
Dillon
</ref>
,
Savage
met
his
fate
in
a
skirmish
with
Wailea
Fijians
on
September
6
,
1813
.
Ashore
as
a
member
of
a
party
to
destroy
Wailean
canoes
,
Savage
and
the
other
scattered
members
of
the
party
found
themselves
the
victims
of
an
ambush
.
They
attempted
to
flee
back
to
the
anchored
<hi rend="italic">
Hunter
</hi>
,
but
found
“
it
impossible
to
get
to
the
boat
through
the
crowds
of
natives
that
intercepted
the
pathway
.
”
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-refname6-5">

</ref>
At
this
point
Dillon
directed
the
men
to
climb
a
flat-topped
hill
of
a
rock
(
which
later
became
Dillon
's
Rock
)
and
organized
a
defense
.
Because
of
its
steep
and
narrow
ascent
,
the
rock
could
only
be
climbed
by
a
few
persons
at
a
time
,
allowing
the
defenders
to
maximize
their
volleys
.
</p>
<p>
After
some
intense
and
sporadic
exchanges
,
the
Wailea
fell
back
to
a
siege
of
sorts
comprised
(
by
Dillon
’s
accounting
)
of
several
thousand
natives
.
At
this
point
,
Savage
suggested
that
they
break
and
run
,
but
this
was
outrightly
dismissed
by
Dillon
,
who
,
to
further
accentuate
his
resolve
,
threatened
to
shoot
the
first
man
who
attempted
to
run
.
Using
the
lull
in
fighting
to
attempt
to
parlay
,
Dillon
reminded
the
Wailea
that
eight
of
their
own
,
including
a
priest
’s
brother
,
were
held
hostage
on
board
the
<hi rend="italic">
Hunter
</hi>
.
Dillon
proposed
sending
a
man
down
to
go
to
the
ship
to
secure
their
release
in
exchange
for
the
defenders
.
The
Wailea
agreed
and
so
an
injured
defender
was
sent
down
to
facilitate
the
transaction
.
During
this
ceasefire
,
several
chiefs
climbed
the
hill
to
implore
the
remaining
defenders
to
accept
offers
of
friendship
and
peace
.
Savage
,
confident
in
his
knowledge
of
the
language
and
customs
was
convinced
that
he
could
go
down
safely
and
secure
some
sort
of
resolution
.
Dillon
disagreed
and
refused
to
leave
the
rock
before
the
prisoner
exchange
,
and
allowed
Savage
to
go
only
if
he
left
his
musket
and
ammunition
behind
.
</p>
<p>
Savage
then
descended
the
rock
and
spoke
with
the
Wailea
for
some
time
who
continued
to
try
to
convince
Dillon
to
join
them
but
to
no
avail
.
Finally
,
exasperated
by
Dillon
’s
refusal
to
come
down
and
triggered
by
another
defender
attempting
to
escape
,
the
Wailea
attacked
the
unarmed
Savage
and
quickly
overpowered
him
,
eventually
drowning
him
in
a
well
.
Dillon
goes
on
to
describe
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannibal">
cannibalistic
</ref>
practices
and
rituals
involved
with
Savage
’s
and
the
others
’
bodies
,
but
those
details
have
been
disputed
by
others
.

Results
of
Savage
's
exploits
</head>
<p>
The
life
of
an
archetypal
beachcomber
with
few
documented
exploits
has
served
as
the
legend-making
clay
of
numerous
writers
and
historians
in
the
time
since
.
Savage
's
influence
(
and
by
association
muskets
)
on
Fiji
's
history
has
been
debated
.
Scholarly
books
and
articles
have
examined
Savage
's
legacy
in
terms
of
his
aid
in
the
rise
of
the
Bau
(
and
thus
their
subsequent
dominance
of
Fiji
)
,
his
introduction
of
firearms
,
and
his
role
as
an
agent
of
social
change
with
varying
degrees
of
support
and
reproof
.
