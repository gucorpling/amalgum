Introduction
</head>
<p>
Microfluidic
devices
have
obtained
global
relevance
since
their
initial
application
in
miniaturized
separation
and
chromatographic
instrumentation
.
More
recently
,
micro-total-analysis
systems
(
µTAS
)
,
have
been
applied
to
chemical
analysis
and
environmental
monitoring
.
The
small
,
low-cost
,
power
efficient
nature
of
microfluidic
analysis
platforms
have
even
been
used
for
in
situ
ocean
nutrient
sensors
in
recent
years
.
Their
potential
to
do
automated
and
low-volume
measurements
at
high
pressures
makes
them
amenable
for
sensor
deployment
in
deep
ocean
environments
.
However
,
reliable
fluid
handling
remains
a
core
development
area
in
establishing
higher
levels
of
integration
on
microfluidic
devices
.
This
is
typically
accomplished
with
specialized
micro-valves
and
micro-pumps
.
</p>
<p>
Microfabricated
valves
fall
into
one
of
two
categories
:
Active
or
passive
.
Active
valves
require
external
actuation
and
often
rely
on
off-chip
support
systems
.
A
typical
active
membrane
valve
uses
induced
fluid
pressure
to
actuate
a
movable
diaphragm
to
seal
a
channel
.
Generating
and
controlling
pressure
for
these
on-chip
active
valves
require
a
substantial
amount
of
energy
and
external
equipment
that
limit
the
ability
to
miniaturize
.
Complex
in
situ
lab-on-chip
systems
employ
multiple
pneumatic
or
hydraulic
actuators
driven
by
off-chip
solenoids
.
In
the
works
by
Ogilvie
et
al.
and
Beaton
et
al.
,
completely
automated
lab-on-chip
nutrient
sensors
contained
10
–
15
actuators
.
The
solenoids
contributed
to
a
significant
power
draw
during
operation
for
fluid
routing
and
handling
,
over
10
Watts
,
equating
to
100
s
if
not
1000
s
of
Joules
of
energy
per
sample
measurement
.
Using
this
much
energy
per
sample
limits
the
number
of
measurements
possible
per
deployment
with
current
battery
capacities
on
small
autonomous
underwater
vehicles
and
drifting
floats
.
Incorporating
rugged
passive
valves
can
reduce
the
energy
demand
for
fluid
handling
on
microfluidic
devices
.
</p>
<p>
Passive
valves
require
no
external
power
or
interface
and
most
often
use
simple
mechanical
biases
,
like
an
elastomeric
membrane
,
or
some
other
physical
property
to
restrict
fluid
flow
in
one
direction
.
The
Tesla
valve
,
for
example
,
uses
an
in-channel
geometric
pattern
to
increase
fluidic
resistance
in
one
direction
and
not
the
other
.
Passive
valves
can
also
be
made
by
exploiting
capillary
pressure
differences
in
microchannels
,
or
by
using
an
air
bladder
to
create
a
capillary
stop-valve
.
Other
types
of
valves
include
using
comb-like
structures
or
centrifugal
elastic
valves
.
Flap
valves
are
perhaps
the
most
common
and
use
a
thin
membrane
that
seals
against
a
rigid
body
in
one
direction
,
and
have
freedom
to
deflect
in
the
other
.
Although
flap
valves
generally
seal
well
against
reverse
flow
,
they
are
still
subject
to
leakage
at
low
flow
rates
and
do
not
have
a
strong
seal
in
an
unbiased
state
.
Furthermore
,
such
membrane
valves
are
usually
made
up
of
at
least
two
distinct
materials
,
requiring
unique
bonding
procedures
between
layers
.
This
introduces
extra
manufacturing
equipment
and
methods
,
such
as
UV
exposure/oxygen
plasma/chemical
surface
modifications
and
are
prone
to
sealing
failures
if
stringent
quality
controls
are
not
implemented
.
Alternatively
,
a
few
researchers
have
implemented
ball
and
cage
valves
based
on
the
Starr
–
Edwards
valve
used
in
heart
surgery
.
When
forward
flow
is
applied
,
the
ball
is
dislodged
from
a
seat
and
retained
by
the
cage
.
In
reverse
flow
,
the
ball
is
pushed
into
the
seat
,
creating
a
seal
.
However
,
like
flap
valves
,
ball
valves
show
appreciable
leakage
,
on
the
order
of
100
µL
min−1
when
a
reverse
pressure
of
25
kPa
is
applied
.
Backflow
is
unacceptable
and
must
me
be
minimized
on
any
in
situ
marine
sensor
,
as
reagent
cross-contamination
reduces
the
integrity
and
accuracy
of
the
measurements
.

<p>
Many
microfluidic
applications
use
magnetic
fields
to
implement
on-chip
actuation
without
direct
physical
coupling
.
Micro-magnetofluids
,
for
example
,
can
be
manipulated
with
an
external
magnetic
field
to
perform
on-chip
mixing
,
pumping
,
or
even
droplet
formation
.
Yamahata
et
al.
and
Shen
et
al.
have
explored
the
use
of
permanent
magnets
encased
in
a
deformable
membrane
to
act
as
a
piston
for
a
solenoid-based
micropump
.
The
reported
systems
use
oscillating
magnetic
fields
to
drive
an
on-chip
piston
with
two
ball-style
check
valves
to
pump
fluid
.
Other
groups
in
the
biomedical
field
have
researched
magnetic
hydrogels
to
create
magnetically
actuated
microvalves
.
These
systems
,
however
,
are
intended
for
use
in
benchtop
applications
and
are
not
likely
to
withstand
extreme
pressure
environments
.
Furthermore
,
the
valves
require
more
than
3
s
to
fully
seal
,
which
exceeds
the
activation
time
requirement
for
many
applications
.
Single
use
drug
delivery
systems
have
used
permanent
magnets
as
external
valve
actuators
but
are
targeted
for
limited
and
disposable
applications
.
Magnetorheological
fluids
can
be
actuated
using
a
permanent
magnet
to
seal
a
microchannel
.
These
innovative
valves
,
however
,
are
made
with
an
intermediary
PDMS
layer
,
and
partially
seal
80
–
90
%
of
the
channel
at
extremely
low
flow
rates
(
&lt;0.1
µL
min−1
)
.
Other
common
valve
designs
use
magnetized
polymers
to
create
magnetically
actuated
membrane
valves
.
Valves
of
this
sort
,
however
,
require
the
fabrication
and
bonding
of
specialized
polymers
.
Many
of
the
reported
magnetic
valves
in
the
literature
,
as
listed
above
,
are
activated
with
external
linear
translation
stages
or
with
energy
intensive
electronic
systems
.
Passively
biased
magnetic
valves
are
much
less
common
but
have
potential
for
use
in
power
restricted
applications
.
