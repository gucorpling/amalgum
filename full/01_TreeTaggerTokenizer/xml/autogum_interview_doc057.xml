No
particular
reason
on
my
behalf
,
it
was
the
organisers
of
the
Sexpo
who
got
me
to
paint
it
mainly
for
publicity
.
But
also
to
have
a
portrait
on
my
stand
,
who
people
in
Cape
Town
would
relate
to
as
I
now
know
she
is
very
popular
and
has
a
great
sense
of
humour
.

Mayor

Helen

commented
of
your
portrait
painting
of
her
:
&quot;
This
is
a
free
country
.
A
free
society
throws
up
these
kinds
of
people
,
who
exercise
their
freedom
in
unusual
ways
.
And
if
this
is
how
he
wants
to
do
it
,
I
must
accept
his
constitutional
right
to
do
so
.
&quot;
—
what
are
your
thoughts
on
her
reaction
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">

:
Sounds
a
bit
formal
but
that
is
how
politicians
usually
talk
,
guarded
and
a
totally
correct
response
,
the
trouble
is
that
if
they
spoke
from
the
heart
it
might
come
back
to
bite
them
one
day
,
but
I
did
talk
to
one
of
her
aides
privately
and
she
said
they
were
all
really
impressed
and
loved
the
concept
,
I
really
should
have
offered
to
paint
her
too
but
I
was
probably
flat
out
all
day
—
I
always
am
at
the
South
African
shows
.

further
commented
about
the
quality
of
your
painting
of
her
:
&quot;
[
Pricasso
]
has
achieved
a
good
likeness
and
I
ca
n't
imagine
how
he
painted
it
without
brushes
or
conventional
equipment
.
&quot;
—
what
do
you
think
of
this
assessment
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Pricasso
</hi>
:
Most
people
are
impressed
when
they
see
it
done
,
skeptical
at
first
but
after
the
initial
shock
they
all
usually
stop
to
watch
until
I
finish
that
particular
painting
,
usually
they
take
about
15
minutes
.

If
you
could
speak
to
Mayor
Zille
,
what
would
you
say
to
her
about
her
reaction
to
your
painting

her
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Pricasso
</hi>
:
I
would
say
I
was
impressed
with
her
response
,
mostly
girls
are
much
more
impressed
than
guys
only
a
minority
of
guys
I
might
add
,
lots
of
them
love
it
and
me
too
!
!
But
in
general
she
gave
a
responsible
and
educated
reply
and
was
not
at
all
offended
by
the
experience
.

quit

how

I
guess
I
could
say
;
This
is
a
free
country
.
A
free
society
throws
up
these
kinds
of
people
,
who
exercise
their
dissaproval
in
various
ways
.
And
if
this
is
how
she
wants
to
protest
,
I
must
accept
her
constitutional
right
to
do
so
.
There
was
that
politically
correct
enough
?
Or
maybe
the
silly
old
B***ch
—
but
her
reaction
did
get
heaps
of
publicity
for
the
show
and
they
had
record
numbers
coming
through
the
doors
so
there
was
a
silver
lining
.
But
obviously
it
is
a
bit
confronting
and
not
everyone
's
cup
of
tea
but
if
they
could
just
see
it
before
they
get
on
their
high
horse
they
might
have
a
different
point
of
view
.
