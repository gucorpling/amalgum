Does
BDSM
turn
you
on
?

<hi rend="italic">
<hi rend="bold">
Alex
:
</hi>
</hi>
The
majority
of
the
time
I
do
n’t
get
any
sexual
pleasure
out
of
it
.
There
are
going
to
be
times
in
session
because
of
the
way
I
’m
dressed
…
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
Outside
of
work
is
it
something
that
is
an
interest
of
yours
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Alex
:
</hi>
A
little
bit
,
but
definitely
not
the
majority
of
time
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
Did
it
start
out
that
it
was
a
turn-on
and
then
you
just
moved
on
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">
<hi rend="bold">
Alex
:
</hi>
</hi>
Yeah
,
because
I
’m
very
experimental
by
nature
.
I
love
learning
about
things
,
and
I
imagine
you
are
the
same
way
because
you
do
all
this
research
on
different
topics
!

<hi rend="bold">
DS

True
;
tomorrow
I
’m
talking
to
a
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Sam_Brownback_on_running_for_President,_gay_rights,_the_Middle_East_and_religion">
Presidential
candidate

and
the
President

ACLU

I
would
love
for
you
to
<hi rend="italic">
combine
</hi>
these
two
things
and
bring
<hi rend="italic">
in
</hi>
that
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam%20Brownback">
Republican
candidate

here
,
and
then
perhaps
we
could…somehow
it
would
be
very
satisfying
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
So
BDSM
is
something
that
you
had
a
curiosity
about
,
experienced
it
,
you
realized
you
had
a
talent
,
and
made
it
into
a
profession
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">
<hi rend="bold">
Alex
:
</hi>
</hi>
I
realized
I
was
good
at
it
and
I
enjoyed
it
;
I
enjoyed
the
variety
and
the
different
people
I
was
hanging
out
with
,
people
like
Jada
.
It
’s
much
better
than
just
playing
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
How
did
you
start
,
Jada
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Jada
:
</hi>
I
always
had
an
interest
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&amp;M">
S&amp;M
</ref>
.
As
a
teenager
it
was
one
of
those
things
that
I
did
n’t
know
exactly
what
it
was
,
but
I
was
always
into
the
fetish
,
the
kink
,
the
tying
up
,
the
doing
all
sorts
of
different
things
.
Then
I
was
in
a
relationship
where
there
was
no
communication
.
It
was
going
down
the
toilet
[
<hi rend="italic">
giggles
</hi>
]
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
Was
it
an
S&amp;M
relationship
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Jada
:
</hi>
Just
a
regular
relationship
.
There
was
no
communication
going
on
,
nothing
happening
,
no
intimacy
,
and
after
awhile
we
were
literally
at
the
point
where
we
were
going
to
break
up
.
I
was
going
to
break
up
with
him
,
and
then
he
told
me
had
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bondage%20(BDSM)">
bondage
fetish
</ref>
.
So
I
was
like
,
“
Fine
,
okay
!
That
’s
perfect
,
if
that
’s
the
only
problem
that
you
have
,
you
know
,
let
’s
do
this
!
”
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
Is
that
<hi rend="italic">
why
</hi>
things
were
going
down
the
toilet
,
because
he
had
that
desire
and
he
would
n’t
express
it
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Jada
:
</hi>
Yes
,
he
had
expressed
it
in
previous
relationships
,
and
because
he
expressed
it
he
was
seen
as
a
freak
.
“
How
dare
you
!
That
’s
the
equivalent
of
rape
!
”
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
So
he
learned
not
to
express
it
and
that
caused
him
to
not
communicate
…
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Jada
:
</hi>
Exactly
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
And
he
just
assumed
you
were
somebody
who
