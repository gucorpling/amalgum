athletes
used
to
run
a

and

remarked
that
football
chants
are
like
huge
tribal
poems
.
Generally
,
though
,
sport
and
poetry
have
never
seemed
natural
companions
in
human
enterprise
.
Until
the

team
suffered
in
2007

&quot;
Nothing
was
really
representing

point

view

in
an
interview
.
&quot;
There
's
a
lot
of
hurting
people
out
there
who
ca
n't
express
what
happened
.
&quot;
<p>
And
to
those
who
read
the
<hi rend="italic">
Times
</hi>
last
Saturday
,
Messina
wants
you
to
know
his
father
never
apologized
for
raising
him
as
a
Mets
fans
.
&quot;
I
never
asked
for
his
apology
,
and
he
never
apologized
,
nor
did
he
owe
us
one
.
I
was
misquoted
in
the
New
York
Times
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Messina
's
parents
taught
him
about
opposite
ends
of
the
spectrum
of
life
.
&quot;
My
mother
was
supportive
even
when
I
made
mistakes
.
She
taught
me
to
never
give
up
no
matter
what
vocation
you
choose
in
your
life
.
&quot;
Whereas
Messina
's
mother
taught
him
to
never
give
up
,
his
father
taught
him
how
to
die
with
grace
.
He
passed
away
from
cancer
in
2005
.
&quot;
I
got
to
see
a
man
who
accepted
his
fate
.
He
was
like
the
Captain
of
the
Titanic
.
My
mother
was
also
calm
.
I
was
the
one
freaking
out
inside
.
I
saw
someone
who
had
acknowledged
his
own
demise
,
accepted
it
,
and
died
at
home
.
He
was
a
tough
old
guy
.
It
takes
a
lot
to
accept
that
;
it
takes
a
very
strong
person
.
Some
of
the
special
moments
toward
the
end
was
sitting
with
him
and
watching
baseball
games
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
It
is
baseball
that
has
garnered
Messina
attention
now
.
He
has
performed
in
32
countries
and
40
states
,
and
in
1993
he
founded
the
band
Spoken
Motion
,
a
spoken
word
band
.
What
is
striking
about
Messina
is
that
his
work
has
branched
two
worlds
that
often
do
n't
interact
:
downtown
coffeehouse
denizens
of
poetry
and
the
denizens
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shea%20Stadium">
Shea
Stadium
</ref>
.
It
is
Frank
Messina
who
has
personalities
as
diverse
as
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe%20Benigno">
Joe
Benigno
</ref>
,
the
archetype
of
the
New
York
sportscaster
at
WFAN
,
reflecting
on
love
and
poetry
.
&quot;
No
one
would
question
a
poet
writing
about
love
for
a
woman
,
&quot;
said
Benigno
,
&quot;
but
when
you
â€™re
a
fan
of
a
team
,
the
emotional
attachment
is
even
stronger
...
.
&quot;
Benigno
sounded
similar
to
avant-garde
writer
and
musician
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David%20Amram">

,
who
said
Messina
's
poems
paint
&quot;
the
stark
beauty
of
the
streets
,
the
pain
of
9/11
,
the
joy
of
everyday
life
,
the
mysteries
of
love
all
fill
the
pages
of
this
book
.
It
's
a
feast
of
images
and
sounds
that
stay
with
you
.
