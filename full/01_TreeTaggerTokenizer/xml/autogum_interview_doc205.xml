Does
that
make
you
feel
uncomfortable
?
Are
there
some
times
where
you
are
like
,
“
I
do
n’t
want
to
punish
the
Jew
.
”
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Jada
:
</hi>
It
all
depends
on
the
person
and
how
they
are
taking
it
.
During
session
you
can
tell
whether
it
is
going
too
far
,
or
whether
it
is
something
that
is
very
emotional
for
a
person
.
You
both
have
to
go
into
it
understanding
that
it
<hi rend="italic">
is
</hi>
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roleplaying">
role
play
</ref>
.
And
a
lot
of
times
they
’ll
tell
me
,
“
Look
,
it
’s
okay
,
you
can
call
me
this
,
this
and
that
.
It
’s
fine
.

DS
:
With
experiences
like
that
,
do
you
experience
personal
growth
and
contend
with
your
own
hang-ups
or
why
certain
things
bother
you
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Jada
:
</hi>
It
really
<hi rend="italic">
does
</hi>
.
It
’s
surprising
how
much
you
learn
about
yourself
and
another
person
.
A
lot
of
things
you
learn
from
here
—
which
for
some
people
is
surprising
—
you
apply
to
your
own
life
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
Can
you
given
an
example
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Jada
:
</hi>
Well
,
you
learn
to
be
more
open-minded
to
people
.
More
understanding
to
a
man
’s
needs
rather
than
,
“
This
is
the
way
you
’re
<hi rend="italic">
supposed
</hi>
to
be
.
This
is
the
way
<hi rend="italic">
society
</hi>
has
made
you
.
You
ca
n’t
<hi rend="italic">
be
</hi>
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sissy">
sissy
</ref>
maid
,
you
have
to
be
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machismo">
macho
man
</ref>
all
the
time
.
”
You
know
?
It
makes
you
understand
that
there
are
multiple
sides
to
everybody
rather
than
what
you
see
is
what
you
get
.
I
have
worked
here
for
a
few
months
and
I
am
still
surprised
by
the
people
who
come
in
.

Is
it
important
for
you
to
know
the
motivations
of
the
clients
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Jada
:
</hi>
It
is
something
you
need
to
be
aware
of
and
something
you
need
to
be
able
to
tell
during
your
session
.
You
feel
it
,
you
sense
it
,
by
speaking
with
someone
and
dealing
with
someone
in
that
way
,
you
are
able
to
tell
whether
it
is
an
actual
problem
that
they
have
.
They
are
very
open
with
us
and
they
tell
us
a
lot
of
things
.
You
are
in
constant
discussion
.
It
’s
not
just
the
physical
aspect
of
S&amp;M
,
where
there
’s
the
whipping
and
spanking
,
it
’s
also
very
verbal
.
You
are
constantly
talking
to
each
other
and
there
’s
a
lot
of
times
where
you
can
tell
whether
it
’s
just
a
regular
fetish
or
whether
it
is
an
actual
psychological
problem
these
people
have
.
And
there
have
been
a
few
people
like
that
.
