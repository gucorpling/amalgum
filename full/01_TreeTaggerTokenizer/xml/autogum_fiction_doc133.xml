CHAPTER

<p>
“
O
lady
!
we
receive
but
what
we
give
,
And
in
our
life
alone
does
nature
live
:
Ours
is
her
wedding
garments
ours
her
shrorwd
!
.
.
.
.
.
Ah
!
from
the
soul
itself
must
issue
forth
,
A
light
,
a
glory
,
a
fair
luminous
cloud
,
</p>
<p>
Enveloping
the
Earth
--
And
from
the
soul
itself
must
there
be
sent
A
sweet
and
potent
voice
of
its
own
birth
,
Of
all
sweet
sounds
the
life
and
element
!
”
COLERIDGE
.
</p>
<p>
From
this
time
,
until
I
arrived
at
the
palace
of
Fairy
Land
,
I
can
attempt
no
consecutive
account
of
my
wanderings
and
adventures
.
Everything
,
henceforward
,
existed
for
me
in
its
relation
to
my
attendant
.
What
influence
he
exercised
upon
everything
into
contact
with
which
I
was
brought
,
may
be
understood
from
a
few
detached
instances
.
To
begin
with
this
very
day
on
which
he
first
joined
me
:
after
I
had
walked
heartlessly
along
for
two
or
three
hours
,
I
was
very
weary
,
and
lay
down
to
rest
in
a
most
delightful
part
of
the
forest
,
carpeted
with
wild
flowers
.
I
lay
for
half
an
hour
in
a
dull
repose
,
and
then
got
up
to
pursue
my
way
.
The
flowers
on
the
spot
where
I
had
lain
were
crushed
to
the
earth
:
but
I
saw
that
they
would
soon
lift
their
heads
and
rejoice
again
in
the
sun
and
air
.
Not
so
those
on
which
my
shadow
had
lain
.
The
very
outline
of
it
could
be
traced
in
the
withered
lifeless
grass
,
and
the
scorched
and
shrivelled
flowers
which
stood
there
,
dead
,
and
hopeless
of
any
resurrection
.
I
shuddered
,
and
hastened
away
with
sad
forebodings
.
</p>
<p>
In
a
few
days
,
I
had
reason
to
dread
an
extension
of
its
baleful
influences
from
the
fact
,
that
it
was
no
longer
confined
to
one
position
in
regard
to
myself
.
Hitherto
,
when
seized
with
an
irresistible
desire
to
look
on
my
evil
demon
(
which
longing
would
unaccountably
seize
me
at
any
moment
,
returning
at
longer
or
shorter
intervals
,
sometimes
every
minute
)
,
I
had
to
turn
my
head
backwards
,
and
look
over
my
shoulder
;
in
which
position
,
as
long
as
I
could
retain
it
,
I
was
fascinated
.
But
one
day
,
having
come
out
on
a
clear
grassy
hill
,
which
commanded
a
glorious
prospect
,
though
of
what
I
cannot
now
tell
,
my
shadow
moved
round
,
and
came
in
front
of
me
.
And
,
presently
,
a
new
manifestation
increased
my
distress
.
For
it
began
to
coruscate
,
and
shoot
out
on
all
sides
a
radiation
of
dim
shadow
.
These
rays
of
gloom
issued
from
the
central
shadow
as
from
a
black
sun
,
lengthening
and
shortening
with
continual
change
.
But
wherever
a
ray
struck
,
that
part
of
earth
,
or
sea
,
or
sky
,
became
void
,
and
desert
,
and
sad
to
my
heart
.
On
this
,
the
first
development
of
its
new
power
,
one
ray
shot
out
beyond
the
rest
,
seeming
to
lengthen
infinitely
,
until
it
smote
the
great
sun
on
the
face
,
which
withered
and
darkened
beneath
the
blow
.
I
turned
away
and
went
on
.
The
shadow
retreated
to
its
former
position
;
and
when
I
looked
again
,
it
had
drawn
in
all
its
spears
of
darkness
,
and
followed
like
a
dog
at
my
heels
.
</p>
<p>
Once
,
as
I
passed
by
a
cottage
,
there
came
out
a
lovely
fairy
child
,
with
two
wondrous
toys
,
one
in
each
hand
.
The
one
was
the
tube
through
which
the
fairy-gifted
poet
looks
when
he
beholds
the
same
thing
everywhere
;
the
other
that
through
which
he
looks
when
he
combines
into
new
forms
of
loveliness
those
images
of
beauty
which
his
own
choice
has
gathered
from
all
regions
wherein
he
has
travelled
.
Round
the
child
’s
head
was
an
aureole
of
emanating
rays
.
As
I
looked
at
him
in
wonder
and
delight
,
round
crept
from
behind
me
the
something
dark
,
and
the
child
stood
in
my
shadow
.
Straightway
he
was
a
commonplace
boy
,
with
a
rough
broad-brimmed
straw
hat
,
through
which
brim
the
sun
shone
from
behind
.
The
toys
he
carried
were
a
multiplying-glass
and
a
kaleidoscope
.
I
sighed
and
departed
.
</p>
<p>
One
evening
,
as
a
great
silent
flood
of
western
gold
flowed
through
an
avenue
in
the
woods
,
down
the
stream
,
just
as
when
I
saw
him
first
,
came
the
sad
knight
,
riding
on
his
chestnut
steed
.
</p>
<p>
But
his
armour
did
not
shine
half
so
red
as
when
I
saw
him
first
.
</p>
<p>
Many
a
blow
of
mighty
sword
and
axe
,
turned
aside
by
the
strength
of
his
mail
,
and
glancing
adown
the
surface
,
had
swept
from
its
path
the
fretted
rust
,
and
the
glorious
steel
had
answered
the
kindly
blow
with
the
thanks
of
returning
light
.
These
streaks
and
spots
made
his
armour
look
like
the
floor
of
a
forest
in
the
sunlight
.
His
forehead
was
higher
than
before
,
for
the
contracting
wrinkles
were
nearly
gone
;
and
the
sadness
that
remained
on
his
face
was
the
sadness
of
a
dewy
summer
twilight
,
not
that
of
a
frosty
autumn
morn
.
He
,
too
,
had
met
the
Alder-maiden
as
I
,
but
he
had
plunged
into
the
torrent
of
mighty
deeds
,
and
the
stain
was
nearly
washed
away
.
No
shadow
followed
him
.
He
had
not
entered
the
dark
house
;
he
had
not
had
time
to
open
the
closet
door
.
“
Will
he
ever
look
in
?
”
I
said
to
myself
.
“
MUST
his
shadow
find
him
some
day
?
”
But
I
could
not
answer
my
own
questions
.
