How
did
you
select
the
acts
that
would
be
performing
and
the
other
entertainment
on
offer
?
What
are
your
personal
opinions
on
the
artists
present
?

Originally
we
were
looking
at
a
KISS
concert
in
November
.
To
assist
an
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Australia">
Australian
</ref>
promoter
we
moved
this
act
to
the
Easter
slot
and
then
to
make
it
a
festival
format
added
Ozzy
on
a
second
day
.
It
then
grew
from
there
based
largely
on
availability
and
the
genre
.
Originally
we
planned
a
format
with
2
‘
younger
’
bands
and
4
more
mature
performers
so
we
were
close
to
where
we
needed
to
be
.
Have
absolutely
no
issues
with
the
artists
and
all
performed
up
to
expectation
or
beyond
.

Is
it
true
that
Ozzy
demanded
the
set
be
repainted
from
KISS
colours
to
his
own
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Phil
:
</hi>
Ozzy
made
no
demands
on
repainting
the
Guitar
set
we
had
.
We
in
consultation
with
their
production
chief
did
so
as
it
was
better
‘
form
’
not
to
embarrass
the
artist
on
the
second
night
and
retain
the
very
happy
production
of
the
weekend
.

What
kind
of
reaction
has
there
been
from
fans
and
the
media
to
the
festival
?

Phil

</hi>
HUGE
!
We
have
been
bombarded
with
emails
from
around
the
world
and
from
NZ
fans
.
Media
too
have
been
very
active
and
other
than
a
few
who
‘
picked
’
at
individual
performances
most
enjoyed
the
experience
for
what
it
was
.

Three-quarters
of
a
million
dollars
is
a
huge
loss
.
Why
is
the
quantity
so
large
if
ticket
sales
were
still
relatively
high
,
even
if
they
were
below
anticipated
levels
?
How
much
did
it
cost
to
hire
each
of
the
acts
present
,
anyway
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Phil
:
</hi>
The
loss
figure
is
only
an
estimate
at
this
point
but
yes
we
sustained
a
loss
.
The
ratio
of
ticket
sales
who
bought
the
discounted
two-day
package
was
30
%
higher
than
expected
,
accommodation
in
Wellington
was
at
maximum
partly
due
to
a
conference
and
another
entertainment
event
booked
after
our
concert
that
also
swallowed
up
capacity
.
The
fact
that
no
major
concert
has
ever
been
held
in
Wellington
over
Easter
was
always
going
to
be
experimental
and
risky
.
We
contained
other
costs
very
well
with
the
only
blowout
coming
from
additional
costs
of
international
freight
which
was
doubled
on
us
by
airlines
who
had
been
supportive
then
decided
to
charge
premium
when
demand
increased
.
(
That
war
is
still
to
be
fought
.

Who
is
going
to
pay
the
price
now
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Phil
:
</hi>
Everyone
of
our
contractors
,
Artist
and
suppliers
are
paid
.
We
are
concert
promoters
and
will
go
onto
the
next
concerts
.
It
is
what
we
do

You
believe
Easter
trading
restrictions
are
responsible
for
low
sales
.
Might
we
then
see
a
future
Rock2Wgtn
at
a
different
time
of
the
year
?
If
so
,
what
can
we
expect
from
it
?
