Ireland

has
two
cultures
:
the
historical
Gaelic

literatures
in
Western

)
and
the
more
recent
English-speaking

it

It

something

a

History
</head>
<p>
The
earliest
evidence
of
human
presence
in
Ireland
goes
back
to
10,500
BCE
,
when
the
country
was
inhabited
by
a
handful
of
hunter
gatherers
.
Some
time
before
4000
BCE
they
were
followed
by
Neolithic
settlers
,
who
had
migrated
northwards
along
the
European
coastline
from
Spain
.
They
brought
farming
with
them
and
a
liking
for
large
stone
monuments
.
They
established
some
of
the
earliest
field
systems
known
in
Europe
,
preserved
until
the
20
century
under
layers
of
peat
.
</p>
<p>
The
Bronze
Age
–
marked
by
skilful
metalworking
–
began
in
Ireland
around
2500
BCE
.
During
the
Iron
Age
(
beginning
c.
800
BCE
)
a
Celtic
language
and
culture
emerged
in
Ireland
,
possibly
as
a
result
of
cultural
diffusion
from
Britain
,
since
there
is
no
archaeological
evidence
of
a
Celtic
&quot;
invasion
&quot;
.
</p>
<p>
Ireland
was
Christianised
from
the
5th
century
onward
,
and
this
brought
with
it
literacy
and
a
knowledge
of
Latin
culture
.
Monastic
towns
were
established
,
becoming
centres
of
learning
and
literature
.
The
monks
were
the
first
to
commit
Ireland
’s
legends
to
writing
,
and
composed
exquisite
nature
poetry
.
The
monasteries
were
a
prime
target
for
the
<ref target="Vikings%20and%20the%20Old%20Norse">
Norsemen
</ref>
who
invaded
in
the
late
8th
century
and
eventually
established
important
settlements
in
Dublin
,
Wexford
,
Waterford
,
Cork
and
Limerick
.
Local
military
alliances
shifted
and
melded
frequently
but
monastic
Christian
culture
endured
and
sent
successful
missionaries
to
Scotland
,
England
and
as
far
afield
as
Switzerland
.
</p>
<p>
The
Normans
invaded
in
the
early
12th
century
and
set
in
place
Ireland
's
uneasy
position
within
England
's
sphere
of
influence
.
The
Gaelic
Ireland
they
entered
had
a
distinctive
society
which
tended
to
assimilate
newcomers
linguistically
and
culturally
.
An
intensively
cultivated
classical
tradition
had
developed
in
the
Irish
language
,
producing
a
unique
literature
which
was
matched
by
a
rich
folk
culture
.
The
Normans
had
brought
English-speaking
followers
with
them
,
but
English
for
a
long
time
remained
marginal
.
</p>
<p>
Irish
lords
retained
a
great
deal
of
practical
independence
until
the
end
of
the
Elizabethan
period
.
The
English
Crown
,
in
the
person
of
Elizabeth
I
,
made
a
determined
attempt
to
impose
its
own
power
towards
the
end
of
the
16th
century
,
with
resistance
being
led
by
powerful
northern
lords
,
especially
Red
Hugh
O'Neill
.
Their
defeat
meant
the
gradually
replacement
of
the
native
elite
by
English
landlords
.
</p>
<p>
Irish
society
and
culture
were
most
severely
disrupted
during
the
Cromwellian
period
in
the
17
century
,
when
native
leaders
tried
to
re-establish
Irish
independence
but
were
weakened
by
internal
dissension
.
Despite
this
,
Irish
language
and
culture
remained
strong
,
with
the
18th
century
seeing
a
literary
flowering
.
General
adoption
of
the
English
language
did
not
occur
until
the
second
half
of
the
19
century
,
largely
as
a
consequence
of
bilingualism
.
</p>
<p>
The
Act
of
Union
that
came
into
force
on
1
January
1801
—
in
which
Catholics
,
90
%
of
the
Irish
population
,
were
excluded
from
Parliament
—
saw
Ireland
joining
the
United
Kingdom
.
While
Great
Britain
was
the
<ref target="Industrial%20Britain">
cradle
of
the
Industrial
Revolution
</ref>
in
the
18th
and
19th
centuries
,
Ireland
remained
a
farming
country
;
millions
of
Irish
emigrated
to
Britain
,
North
America
and
Australia
,
where
the
men
often
worked
as
labourers
and
the
women
as
domestic
servants
.
Initially
,
they
often
spoke
little
English
.
</p>
<p>
Irish
nationalism
remained
strong
in
the
19th
century
,
often
expressed
through
English
.
Much
attention
was
drawn
to
the
evils
of
landlordism
,
exacerbated
by
the
Great
Famine
of
the
1840s
,
which
left
many
dead
and
caused
a
wave
of
emigration
.
At
the
end
of
the
century
there
occurred
the
Gaelic
Revival
,
with
influential
urban
intellectuals
insisting
on
the
need
to
modernise
and
extend
Gaelic
culture
as
a
basic
principle
of
Irish
nationality
.
Some
of
them
were
later
at
the
fore
of
armed
resistance
to
British
rule
.
The
Catholic
Church
,
which
had
suffered
various
degrees
of
persecution
from
the
16th
century
on
,
had
now
been
reorganised
and
strengthened
.
It
became
a
potent
element
in
Irish
nationalism
and
a
symbol
for
many
of
Irish
identity
,
though
its
influence
was
to
wane
in
the
later
20th
century
.
</p>
<p>
By
1900
institutions
of
British
origin
were
firmly
established
in
Ireland
.
English
was
the
language
of
the
vast
majority
but
had
a
strongly
native
flavour
;
this
made
itself
felt
in
a
literature
which
was
to
become
world
famous
.
Irish
was
still
cultivated
by
a
small
minority
and
produced
a
distinguished
modern
literature
of
its
own
.
</p>
<p>
Some
bars
to
non-Anglican
civic
participation
had
been
removed
in
the
1820s
,
but
in
the
latter
half
of
the
19th
century
and
early
20th
century
the
subject
of
Irish
home
rule
was
a
major
debate
within
the
British
parliament
.
After
several
failed
attempts
,
a
Home
Rule
bill
finally
passed
through
parliament
in
1914
although
the
start
of
the
first
world
war
saw
its
indefinite
postponement
.
A
failed
rebellion
on
Easter
Monday
in
1916
showed
a
hint
of
things
to
come
with
years
of
war
to
follow
,
beginning
with
the
Irish
War
of
Independence
(
1919-1921
)
and
continuing
with
the
Irish
Civil
War
(
1922-1923
)
.
</p>
<p>
Eventually
a
somewhat
stable
situation
emerged
with
the
independence
of
26
of
Ireland
's
counties
known
as
the
Irish
Free
State
;
the
remaining
six
,
in
the
north-east
of
the
country
and
comprising
two-thirds
of
the
ancient
province
of
Ulster
,
remained
part
of
the
United
Kingdom
—
a
status
that
has
continued
to
the
present
day
.
In
1949
the
Irish
Free
State
became
&quot;
Ireland
&quot;
(
also
known
as
the
Republic
of
Ireland
)
and
withdrew
from
the
British
Commonwealth
.
</p>
<p>
Ireland
's
history
post-partition
has
been
marked
to
some
extent
by
violence
.
A
a
period
known
as
&quot;
The
Troubles
&quot;
,
generally
regarded
as
beginning
in
the
late
1960s
,
saw
large
scale
confrontation
between
opposing
paramilitary
groups
seeking
to
either
keep
Northern
Ireland
as
part
of
the
United
Kingdom
or
bring
it
into
the
Republic
.
The
Troubles
saw
many
ups
and
downs
in
intensity
of
fighting
and
on
occasion
were
even
responsible
for
terrorist
attacks
in
Britain
and
continental
Europe
.
The
governments
of
both
the
UK
and
the
Republic
were
opposed
to
all
terrorist
groups
.
A
peace
settlement
known
as
the
Good
Friday
Agreement
was
finally
approved
in
1998
and
is
being
implemented
.
All
signs
point
to
this
agreement
holding
steady
.
</p>
<p>
Though
a
relatively
poor
country
for
much
of
the
20th
century
,
Ireland
joined
the
European
Community
in
1973
(
at
the
same
time
as
the
United
Kingdom
)
.
Between
the
mid
1990s
and
2008
,
Ireland
had
a
massive
economic
boom
(
and
was
called
&quot;
The
Celtic
Tiger
&quot;
)
,
becoming
one
of
the
richest
countries
in
Europe
.
However
,
the
global
banking
crisis
and
subsequent
recession
hit
Ireland
hard
,
with
high
levels
of
unemployment
and
emigration
.
The
economy
is
now
recovering
and
many
emigrants
are
returning
.
