to
your
car
,
and
just
as
regular
visits
to
a
doctor
can
help
prevent
illnesses
and
afflictions
from
developing
,
routine
maintenance
of
your
home
can
help
you
ward
off
major
,
costly
repairs
.
Paying
for
home
repairs
out
of
pocket
is
one
of
the
unpredictable
and
less
glamorous
aspects
of
home
ownership
.
Major
repairs
,
up
to
and
including
structural
damage
,
can
be
inaccessibly
expensive
.
To
help
prevent
major
home
repairs
,
it
helps
to
practice
routine
maintenance
of
your
home
.
The
guide
below
highlights
some
of
the
important
aspects
of
this
maintenance

Clean
your
gutters
regularly
.
This
is
one
of
the
most
important
tasks
in
warding
off
major
home
repairs
.
Gutters
are
designed
to
direct
water
safely
away
from
your
home
.
When
they
are
clogged
with
leaves
and
debris
,
water
overflows
out
of
the
gutters
directly
onto
the
ground
surrounding
your
house
.
This
can
quickly
saturate
the
soil
against
your
home
's
foundation
,
which
can
lead
to
leaky
basement
walls
and
even
cracked
concrete
foundations
.

Change
your
home
's
air
filters
regularly
.
Dirty
air
filters
not
only
impede
the
flow
of
air
through
your
home
;
they
can
cause
major
damage
to
your
air
conditioning
unit
.
Inadequate
air
flow
across
the
unit
's
evaporator
coil
can
cause
the
temperature
to
drop
enough
for
ice
to
form
on
the
coils
.
This
ice
can
eventually
crack
or
collapse
the
tubing
in
the
evaporator
coil
,
which
would
require
a
costly
visit
from
an
HVAC
technician
.

Keep
a
vigilant
eye
out
for
mold
growth
.
Mold
and
mildew
growth
is
fairly
common
in
homes
,
as
mold
only
needs
some
organic
material
and
a
bit
of
moisture
to
proliferate
.
In
areas
where
moisture
levels
are
high
(
typically
bathrooms
and
kitchens
)
,
regularly
scrub
walls
,
ceilings
,
and
fixtures
with
bleach
,
vinegar
,
or
another
disinfectant
.
Letting
mold
growth
proceed
unchecked
can
quickly
cause
damage
to
the
studs
in
your
walls
,
which
will
require
major
and
costly
structural
repairs
.

Replace
aging
or
malfunctioning
appliances
or
fixtures
.
Aging
and
faulty
electrical
wiring
can
pose
a
risk
of
fire
.
Old
appliances
should
be
inspected
by
an
electrician
and
replaced
or
reconditioned
when
no
longer
in
safe
condition
.
Any
wiring
in
your
home
with
stripped
or
frayed
insulation
should
be
replaced
immediately
.
Small
fixtures
like
lamps
can
usually
be
completely
rewired
with
little
trouble
.
An
electrical
fire
can
very
easily
get
out
of
control
and
cause
major
structural
damage
.

Take
precautions
against
insect
infestations
.
Insects
can
cause
major
damage
to
your
home
,
but
even
when
they
do
not
cause
structural
damage
,
they
can
be
very
expensive
to
eliminate
.
Insects
such
as
termites
,
roaches
,
and
bed
bugs
can
be
kept
ay
bay
by
making
sure
that
your
house
is
cleaned
regularly
.
Avoid
eating
food
throughout
your
home
,
instead
eating
only
in
your
kitchen
or
dining
area
.
Being
vigilant
about
water
damage
will
also
help
prevent
termites
and
other
insects
that
feed
on
water-softened
wood
.

Purchasing
comprehensive
homeowner
's
insurance
is
another
effective
strategy
for
mitigating
the
out-of-pocket
cost
of
major
home
repairs
.
Remember
that
fire
and
flood
damage
may
need
to
be
covered
through
a
separate
policy
.
