Get
Your
Husband
to
Use
Proper
Table
Manners
</head>
<p>
Perhaps
a
loud
,
guttural
after
dinner
belch
is
an
appropriate
way
to
tell
the
cook
you
loved
the
meal
in
some
cultures
,
but
in
most
nations
it
s
considered
to
be
rude
and
pretty
disgusting
.
If
you
feel
as
if
you
’ve
been
dining
with
a
caveman
since
you
said
,
“
I
do
”
and
ca
n’t
take
it
anymore
,
there
are
ways
to
revise
his
uncivilized
table
manners
and
transform
your
beast
into
a
prince
.

Do
n’t
point
out
the
obvious
.
Barking
orders
at
your
spouse
is
only
going
to
cultivate
passive
aggressive
behavior
.
While
he
may
be
acting
like
an
animal
,
telling
him
could
be
humiliating
.
Instead
of
whacking
his
elbows
off
the
table
or
snapping
his
jaw
closed
when
he
chews
,
take
a
more
subtle
approach
.

Ask
him
what
kind
of
table
manners
were
practiced
at
his
house
growing
up
.
Perhaps
he
’s
forgotten
manners
that
his
mother
insisted
upon
and
recalling
them
may
bring
them
back
today
.

Point
out
bad
manners
on
TV
.
See
a
TV
or
movie
character
exhibiting
the
same
bad
manners
as
your
man
?
Point
out
how
garish
the
character
’s
manners
are
--
maybe
it
’ll
ring
a
bell
.
</item>
<item>
Talk
about
people
behind
their
back
.
Well
,
perhaps
talk
about
their
manners
.
Discuss
both
good
and
bad
mannered
friends
.
For
example
,
talk
about
how
your
friend
Dan
always
looks
put
together
,
has
sparkling
dinner
conversation
and
always
knows
which
fork
to
use
for
each
course
.
Quite
the
contrast
,
your
friend
Stephanie
thinks
that
everything
is
a
finger
food
and
slurps
her
soda
.

Take
an
etiquette
class
--
together
(
or
as
a
family
)
.
For
fun
,
ask
him
to
join
you
(
and
the
kids
)
for
a
manners
and
etiquette
class
.
Look
for
courses
offered
at
your
local
community
center
or
college
.
A
good
etiquette
class
will
not
only
cover
table
manners
but
may
also
hit
on
themes
such
as
how
to
write
a
proper
thank
you
card
and
how
to
dress
for
certain
occasions
(
topics
that
you
may
also
want
to
cover
)
.
Not
only
can
a
class
be
beneficial
to
getting
him
to
stop
his
bad
habits
,
bringing
the
kids
along
will
help
them
cultivate
good
manners
that
will
lead
them
into
the
future
.

Practice
proper
table
manners
at
home
.
Lead
by
example
and
always
practice
proper
table
manners
at
home
.
Also
,
if
you
have
children
,
insist
they
practice
table
manners
.
Use
their
errors
as
a
way
to
point
out
“
do
’s
”
and
“
don’ts
.
”
For
example
,
if
Mary
is
chewing
with
her
mouth
open
while
telling
a
story
,
stop
her
and
say
,
“
Mary
,
a
lady
or
gentleman
never
shows
his
or
her
guests
the
food
being
chewed
.
Please
chew
with
your
mouth
closed
and
then
continue
with
your
story
.
”
Do
n’t
forget
to
deliver
praise
,
especially
if
its
your
husband
practicing
good
manners
.
For
example
,
“
Look
at
how
well
daddy
remembered
to
place
his
napkin
in
his
lap
!
”
Your
husband
will
think
you
are
just
using
him
as
a
good
example
,
while
all
along
you
are
reinforcing
good
behavior
.

Pick
your
battles
.
Your
husband
may
never
know
which
fork
to
use
for
the
salad
course
or
whether
he
can
get
away
with
serving
white
wine
with
beef
;
but
as
long
as
he
can
master
the
basics
you
should
be
able
to
dine
in
public
with
him
and
not
want
to
hide
.

Before
a
business
dinner
meeting
,
ask
him
if
he
wants
to
brush
up
on
dining
etiquette
skills
.
In
effort
to
impress
the
boss
,
he
may
be
more
willing
to
take
gentle
advice
on
what
he
should
be
doing
differently
at
the
table
.
</item>
<item>
Focus
on
one
aspect
at
a
time
.
He
may
be
a
total
disaster
at
the
table
,
but
instead
of
barking
at
him
to
take
his
elbows
off
the
table
,
put
his
napkin
in
his
lap
and
chew
with
his
mouth
closed
,
tackle
it
one
bad
manner
at
a
time
.

<item>
Do
n’t
allow
table
manners
to
ruin
your
marriage
.
Sometimes
the
most
stubborn
of
men
may
not
adhere
to
change
.
If
he
either
does
n’t
understand
what
you
want
him
to
do
or
simply
ca
n’t
remember
do
n’t
turn
it
into
a
federal
case
.
