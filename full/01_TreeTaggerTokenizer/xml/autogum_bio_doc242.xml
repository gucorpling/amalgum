Moore
’s
early
observations
in
the
colony
were
published
under
the
title
<hi rend="italic">
A

some

most
detailed
information
available
on
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oglethorpe_Plan">

and
its

.
Moore
’s
account
of
Georgia
is
silent
on
Oglethorpe
’s
emerging
anti-slavery
position
;
however
it
seems
likely
that
the
two
men
discussed
Africa
and
the
slave
trade
at
length
,
and
this
may
have
informed
the
latter
’s
views
