<p>
Oscar
Diös
is
a
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Sweden">
Swedish
</ref>
businessman
looking
to
invest
in
a
new
project
within
the
aviation
community
.
He
's
already
bought
the
venture
's
first
airliner
,
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing%20747">
Boeing
747-200
</ref>
.
</p>
<p>
However
,
his
intention
is
not
to
start
an
airline
,
and
the
jet
is
not
intended
for
flight
.
Instead
,
he
plans
to
convert
the
airliner
into
a
unique
business
which
he
calls
the
'
Jumbo
Hostel
'
.
The
450-seat
widebodied
jetliner
will
have
25
rooms
sleeping
a
total
of
85
people
,
including
some
in
a
luxury
suite
in
the
cockpit
,
and
will
sit
at
the
entrance
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm-Arlanda%20Airport">
Stockholm-Arlanda
Airport

.

HAVE
YOUR
SAY
Would
you
be
interested
in
staying
in

hotel
?

Built
in
1976
,
the
aircraft
was
an
&quot;
old
wreck
&quot;
when
acquired
,
according
to
Oscar
.
The
aircraft
was
being
offered
for
sale
at
Stolkholm-Arlanda
after
previous
owner
Transjet
became
bankrupt
.
The
airframe
has
then
been
completely
gutted
and
is
being
fitted
with
a
new
,
modernised
interior
.
Each
room
contains
three
bunk
beds
.
A
cafe
and
a
walkway
across
the
left
wing
are
also
featured
.
</p>
<p>
The
airliner
will
sit
on
a
concrete
platform
at
the
airport
's
entrance
,
with
its
landing
gear
secured
in
steel
cradles
.
It
is
intended
to
offer
a
good
view
of
the
day-to-day
operation
of
the
airport
.
</p>
<p>
The
hostel
,
which
is
to
open
in
December
,
is
aimed
at
families
with
children
,
aviation
enthusiasts
,
low-budget
travelers
and
people
catching
early
morning
flights
who
wish
to
leave
it
as
late
as
possible
before
rising
to
get
to
check-in
-
unlike
its
competitors
,
the
Jumbo
Hostel
is
ten
minutes
walk
from
the
check-in
desks
.
</p>
<p>

Diös

I

the

That

We

Aviation
is
currently
experiencing
a
slowdown
,
with
both
high
fuel
costs

the
credit
crunch
hitting
the
industry
badly

Are
you
concerned
that
reduced
travelling
may
mean
the
hostel
comes
at
a
bad
time
,
or
do
you
think
that
cheaper

Difficult
to
say
.
We
are
planning
the
Jumbo
Hostels
onto
airports
that
lack
the
hostel
service
in
general
.
Arlanda
in
Stockholm
did
not
have
a
hostel
before
.
This
means
we
will
fill
up
a
gap
that
is
demanded
.
The
hostels
are
quite
small
and
should
not
be
to
difficult
to
fill
up
with
guests

Well

Not
really
.
The
Boeing
747
aircraft
is
probably
the
most
common
transcontinental
aircraft
.
Many
parts
of
the
world
recognize
the
&quot;
Queen
of
the
Skies

and
therefore
everyone
that
learnt
about
our
hostel
can
start

imagine
and
relate

what
it
could
be
like
staying
over
night
at
Jumbo
