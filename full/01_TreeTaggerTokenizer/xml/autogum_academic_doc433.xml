Introduction
</head>
<p>
Wastewater
,
following
treatment
processes
,
is
generally
discharged
into
surface
water
bodies
,
whereupon
it
is
transported
and
diluted
.
In
areas
with
high
population
densities
,
this
leads
to
a
large
percentage
of
water
courses
being
impacted
by
treated
wastewater
(
TWW
)
.
Indeed
,
a
recent
study
by
the
EU
Commission
indicates
that
TWW
is
of
a
near
ubiquitous
presence
in
the
surface
water
bodies
of
EU
nations
.
In
many
regions
,
TWW
discharge
helps
to
maintain
environmental
flow
capacities
in
surface
water
bodies
and
to
recharge
shallow
aquifers
.
It
is
,
however
,
likely
that
in
areas
where
surface
water
bodies
are
highly
impacted
with
wastewater
,
water
quality
concerns
are
an
issue
.
Contaminants
found
in
TWW
include
pathogenic
microorganisms
(
concentrations
in
the
range
of
10−1-105
[
cfu
l−1
)
,
nutrients
(
nitrates
and
phosphates
,
100-102
[
mg
l−1
]
)
,
heavy
metals
(
10−1-102
[
µg
l−1
]
)
and
endocrine
disruptors
(
10−2-102
[
µg
l−1
]
)
.
The
presence
of
these
in
surface
water
bodies
may
lead
to
problems
meeting
WFD
chemical
water
quality
targets
,
negative
impacts
on
ecology
and
reduced
societal
functions
.
Furthermore
,
if
surface
water
bodies
are
infiltrating
,
the
transfer
of
contaminants
to
groundwater
may
occur
.
This
is
highly
dependent
on
subsurface
characteristics
and
hydrological
conditions
,
but
is
indicated
by
studies
which
find
a
range
of
TWW-related
pharmaceuticals
and
personal
care
products
in
groundwater
samples
.
</p>
<p>
De
facto
(
or
indirect
)
wastewater
reuse
is
the
practice
of
extracting
from
a
surface
water
body
which
is
heavily
influenced
by
discharge
from
a
wastewater
stream
(
see
Appendix
A
)
for
anthropogenic
use
.
In
this
form
,
TWW
can
constitute
a
freshwater
resource
for
agriculture
(
irrigation
)
,
industry
(
cooling
purposes
)
and
public
services
(
drinking
water
)
.
The
extent
of
its
usefulness
is
,
however
,
limited
by
its
quality
and
the
regulations
associated
with
reuse
.
The
EU
recognise
water
as
a
resource
which
should
be
managed
as
a
key
element
of
the
circular
economy
.
Indeed
,
literature
points
to
the
direct
reuse
of
TWW
becoming
a
more
common
trend
in
the
future
,
both
internationally
and
in
the
EU
,
if
appropriate
regulations
can
be
devised
and
the
societal
“
yuck
”
factor
can
be
overcome
.
These
reports
,
however
,
generally
neglect
to
include
the
occurrence
of
de
facto
reuse
as
a
component
of
water
reuse
initiatives
.
This
is
reflected
in
the
lack
of
regulations
relating
to
the
practice
when
compared
to
direct
reuse
.
Given
more
knowledge
on
the
topic
,
strategies
could
be
better
developed
which
would
better
integrate
de
facto
reuse
into
freshwater
management
plans
,
complimenting
existing
water
reuse
schemes
.
</p>
<p>
In
the
Netherlands
,
it
is
likely
that
wastewater
is
an
important
flow
component
in
surface
water
bodies
owing
to
high
population
densities
and
an
extensive
network
of
wastewater
treatment
plants
(
WWTPs
)
.
Moreover
,
the
range
of
land
and
water
usages
located
in
proximity
to
WWTPs
suggests
that
de
facto
reuse
is
prevalent
nationally
.
Existing
studies
have
shown
that
TWW
exerts
a
significant
impact
on
many
surface
water
bodies
in
terms
of
water
quality
,
but
have
failed
to
address
the
contribution
of
wastewater
to
the
discharge
of
surface
water
bodies
.
Without
this
knowledge
,
it
is
impossible
to
draw
links
between
wastewater
discharges
and
societal
water
uses
,
hence
neglecting
the
assessment
of
the
occurrence
of
de
facto
water
reuse
.
Characterising
this
problem
has
been
(
to
date
)
confounded
by
difficulties
in
measuring
and
tracing
the
presence
of
TWW
in
a
dynamic
hydrological
system
.
A
range
of
approaches
seek
to
address
this
;
from
comparing
discharge
datasets
for
rivers
and
WWTPs
to
interrogating
population
and
hydrological
datasets
using
GIS
methods
.
This
study
opts
for
a
new
approach
to
this
problem
:
repurposing
a
national
scale
water
quality
model
and
labelling
TWW
as
a
tracer
in
and
of
itself
.
This
methodology
gives
a
more
continuous
representation
of
the
impaction
of
surface
water
bodies
than
previous
efforts
.
As
such
,
the
distribution
of
TWW
within
the
surface
water
network
of
the
Netherlands
can
be
characterised
(
without
the
need
for
direct
measurements
)
and
subsequently
related
to
agricultural
extractions
,
hence
bridging
the
knowledge
gap
between
TWW
emissions
and
societal
water
uses
.
</p>
<p>
Via
“
following
the
water
”
,
this
study
aims
to
determine
whether
TWW
makes
up
a
significant
flow
component
for
surface
water
bodies
in
the
Netherlands
and
provide
a
first
estimate
of
the
extent
to
which
de
facto
wastewater
reuse
is
occurring
in
agricultural
irrigation
.
This
contributes
to
initiating
discussions
regarding
appropriate
regulations
for
de
facto
reuse
and
how
the
practice
can
be
integrated
within
the
circular
economy
to
increase
the
responsible
reuse
of
water
sources
.
