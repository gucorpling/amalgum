Does
anyone
else
's
depression
manifest
in
extreme
fatigue
and
complete
lack
of
motivation
?
</head>
<sp who="#OFGhost">
<p>
I
've
struggled
with
depression
and
anxiety
for
years
.
I
've
gone
to
two
different
therapists
now
(
currently
on
my
second
therapist
)
,
and
a
psychiatrist
who
has
diagnosed
me
with
major
depression
and
generalized
anxiety
.
Sometimes
I
feel
like
I
would
be
better
off
dead
.
I
'm
sad
a
lot
of
the
time
,
weepy
sometimes
,
and
struggle
with
anxiety
and
panic
episodes
off
and
on
.
I
also
deal
with
obsessive
thoughts
and
emotions
.
I
feel
like
my
depression
is
a
bit
different
from
others
on
this
sub
,
though
,
and
was
wondering
if
anyone
else
can
relate
and
offer
me
advice
.
I
am
exhausted
<hi rend="bold">
constantly
.
</hi>
Even
when
I
sleep
8-10
hours
,
I
'm
still
falling
asleep
at
work
the
next
day
and
feel
like
I
need
a
long
nap
.
When
I
sleep
for
more
than
10
hours
or
less
than
8
,
I
'm
even
more
exhausted
.
I
feel
like
I
just
want
to
sleep
every
day
away
.
I
'm
also
completely
lacking
in
motivation
.
I
will
sit
around
all
day
at
home
when
I
'm
not
working
just
mindlessly
browsing
the
internet
,
feeling
no
motivation
or
desire
to
get
out
of
the
house
,
hang
out
with
friends
,
play
games
,
clean
the
house
,
or
anything
.
I
have
to
force
myself
to
do
anything
,
and
I
'm
so
mind-numbingly
bored
all
the
time
,
yet
I
do
nothing
about
it
.
I
feel
like
my
life
is
going
nowhere
,
and
I
'm
destined
to
be
miserable
forever
.
I
'm
also
extremely
irritable
and
hate
all
people
.
I
feel
like
an
asshole
for
admitting
this
,
but
it
's
how
I
honestly
feel
.
When
I
want
to
be
left
alone
and
people
talk
to
me
,
I
will
become
very
irritable
,
snap
,
or
feel
incredibly
anxious
.
Some
of
my
obsessive
thoughts
revolve
around
my
disdain
for
people
.
I
find
myself
repeating
negative
thoughts
about
other
people
or
myself
over
and
over
in
my
head
,
especially
when
I
'm
stuck
in
a
conversation
that
I
do
n't
want
to
be
in
.
I
&quot;
talk
to
myself
&quot;
in
my
head
pretty
much
,
and
I
ca
n't
control
it
.
I
feel
like
I
'm
going
a
bit
crazy
,
haha
.
A
few
years
ago
I
was
put
on
lexapro
for
depression/anxiety
,
and
it
made
me
even
more
tired
.
I
was
recently
put
on
Prozac
,
and
that
also
made
me
exhausted
,
so
now
I
've
been
switched
to
Pristiq
.
I
do
n't
seem
<hi rend="bold">
as
</hi>
exhausted
on
Pristiq
,
but
I
also
have
n't
noticed
any
mood
lift
or
a
change
in
thought
patterns
or
anything
.
I
'm
unsure
where
to
go
from
here
.
Nothing
seems
to
work
,
and
I
hate
therapy
.
I
feel
so
uncomfortable
going
.
I
have
had
feelings
of
superiority
and
grandeur
in
the
past
and
have
had
problems
with
impulse
control
,
substance
abuse
,
and
feeling
&quot;
high
on
life
,
&quot;
which
makes
me
wonder
if
I
could
be
bipolar
,
but
I
do
n't
think
I
've
ever
experienced
what
they
call
mania
or
hypomania
.
Can
anyone
relate
to
this
or
offer
up
some
advice
?

<sp who="#Idiotecka">
<p>
raising
my
hand
here
.
exercise
,
therapy
,
meds
,
even
weed.
.
it
all
helps
but
i
ca
n't
seem
to
fucking
get
to
a
level
where
things
are
steady
.
and
i
have
been
working
on
myself
a
lot
in
the
last
few
years.
.
i
've
done
great
progress
.
i
guess
it
's
a
matter
of
keeping
my
head
down
and
soldiering
on
,
but
man.
.
it
's
fucking
exhausting
.
</p>
<p>
also
i
'm
pretty
sure
my
sleep
is
pretty
bad
.
i
've
been
wanting
to
go
to
a
sleep
clinic
for
quite
a
while
but
never
really
mustered
the
courage
to
actually
go
.
