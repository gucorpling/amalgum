A
kid
who
reads
a
book
and
says
,
'
This
is
n't
for
me
.
It
does
n't
have
anything
to
do
with
my
time
period
;
I
do
n't
know
why
I
'm
reading
it
.
Literature
is
completely
removed
from
my
experience
.
'
They
're
right
!
There
's
no
reason
to
have
that
kid
reading
books
that
are
removed
from
their
experience

&quot;
The
clear
references
to
9/11
in
the
apocalyptic
ending
can
only
bring
Orwell
's
name
into
disrepute
in
the
U.S.
,
&quot;
wrote
William
Hamilton
,
the
British
literary
executor
of
the
Orwell
estate
.
That
process
had
already
begun
:
it
was
revealed
Orwell
gave
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British%20Foreign%20Office">
British
Foreign
Office
</ref>
a
list
of
people
he
suspected
of
being

&quot;
labeling
some
of
them
as

</ref>
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuals">

.
&quot;
I
really
wanted
to
explode
that
book

told

and
found
that
,
as
often
is
the
case
,
the
answer
lies
somewhere
in
the
middle
.
</p>
<p>
Reed
is
electrified
by
the
changes
that
surround
him
that
channel
through
a
lens
of
inspiration
wrought
by
his
children
.
&quot;
The
kids
have
made
me
a
better
writer
,
&quot;
Reed
said
.
In
his
new
untitled
work
,
which
he
calls
a
&quot;
new
play
by
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William%20Shakespeare">
William
Shakespeare
</ref>
,
&quot;
he
takes
lines
from
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bard">
The
Bard
</ref>
'
s
classics
to
form
an
original
tragedy
.
He
began
it
in
2003
,
but
only
with
the
birth
of
his
children
could
he
finish
it
.
&quot;
I
did
n't
understand
the
characters
who
had
children
.
I
did
n't
really
understand
them
.
And
once
I
had
had
kids
,
I
could
approach
them
differently
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Taking
the
old
to
make
it
new
is
a
theme
in
his
work
and
in
his
world
view
.
Reed
foresees
new
narrative
forms
being
born
,
Biblical
epics
that
will
be
played
out
across
print
and
electronic
mediums
.
He
is
pulled
forward
by
revolutions
of
the
past
,
a
search
for
a
spiritual
sensibility
,
and
a
desire
to
locate
himself
in
the
process
.
