The
first
line
means
that
the
Italian
sovereigns
are
coming
back
--
they
have
been
to
England
.
The
second
line
seems
to
mean
that
they
enlarged
the
King
at
the
Italian
hospital
.
With
a
banquet
,
I
suppose
.
An
English
banquet
has
that
effect
.

The

,
“

I
do
not
know
about
Italian
time
,
but
I
judge
it
begins
at
midnight
and
runs
through
the
twenty-four
hours
without
breaking
bulk
.
In
the
following

,
the
theaters
open
at
half-past
twenty

If
these
are
not
matinees
,
20.30
must
mean
8.30
P.M.
,
by
my
reckoning

There
are

also
a

of
accidents

This

one

</p>
<head>
Grave
disgrazia
sul
Ponte
Vecchio
</head>
<p>
Stammattina
,
circe
le
7,30
,
mentre
Giuseppe
Sciatti
,
di
anni
55
,
di
Casellina
e
Torri
,
passava
dal
Ponte
Vecchio
,
stando
seduto
sopra
un
barroccio
carico
di
verdura
,
perse
l
'
equilibrio
e
cadde
al
suolo
,
rimanendo
con
la
gamba
destra
sotto
una
ruota
del
veicolo
.
</p>
<p>
Lo
Sciatti
fu
subito
raccolto
da
alcuni
cittadini
,
che
,
per
mezzo
della
pubblica
vettura
n.
365
,
lo
transporto
a
San
Giovanni
di
Dio
.

<p>
Ivi
il

riscontro
la
frattura
della
gamba
destra
e
alcune
lievi
escoriazioni
giudicandolo
guaribile
in
50
giorni
salvo
complicazioni
.
</p>
<p>
What
it
seems
to
say
is
this
:
“
Serious
Disgrace
on
the
Old
Old
Bridge
.
This
morning
about
7.30
,
Mr.
Joseph
Sciatti
,
aged
55
,
of
Casellina
and
Torri
,
while
standing
up
in
a
sitting
posture
on
top
of
a
carico
barrow
of
vedure
(
foliage
?
hay
?
vegetables
?
)
,
lost
his
equilibrium
and
fell
on
himself
,
arriving
with
his
left
leg
under
one
of
the
wheels
of
the
vehicle
.
</p>
<p>
“
Said
Sciatti
was
suddenly
harvested
(
gathered
in
?
)
by
several
citizens
,
who
by
means
of
public
cab
No.
365
transported
him
to
St.
John
of
God
.
”
</p>
<p>
Paragraph
No.
3
is
a
little
obscure
,
but
I
think
it
says
that
the
medico
set
the
broken
left
leg
--
right
enough
,
since
there
was
nothing
the
matter
with
the
other
one
--
and
that
several
are
encouraged
to
hope
that
fifty
days
well
fetch
him
around
in
quite
giudicandolo-guaribile
way
,
if
no
complications
intervene
.
</p>
<p>
I
am
sure
I
hope
so
myself
.
</p>
<p>
There
is
a
great
and
peculiar
charm
about
reading
news-scraps
in
a
language
which
you
are
not
acquainted
with
--
the
charm
that
always
goes
with
the
mysterious
and
the
uncertain
.
You
can
never
be
absolutely
sure
of
the
meaning
of
anything
you
read
in
such
circumstances
;
you
are
chasing
an
alert
and
gamy
riddle
all
the
time
,
and
the
baffling
turns
and
dodges
of
the
prey
make
the
life
of
the
hunt
.
A
dictionary
would
spoil
it
.
Sometimes
a
single
word
of
doubtful
purport
will
cast
a
veil
of
dreamy
and
golden
uncertainty
over
a
whole
paragraph
of
cold
and
practical
certainties
,
and
leave
steeped
in
a
haunting
and
adorable
mystery
an
incident
which
had
been
vulgar
and
commonplace
but
for
that
benefaction
.
Would
you
be
wise
to
draw
a
dictionary
on
that
gracious
word
?
would
you
be
properly
grateful
?

<p>
After
a
couple
of
days
'
rest
I
now
come
back
to
my
subject
and
seek
a
case
in
point
.
I
find
it
without
trouble
,
in
the
morning
paper
;
a
cablegram
from
Chicago
and
Indiana
by
way
of
Paris
.
All
the
words
save
one
are
guessable

a

ignorant

Italian
