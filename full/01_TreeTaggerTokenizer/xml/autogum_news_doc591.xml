to
discuss
the
investigation
of
claims
that
the
police
attempted
to
collect
evidence
from
the
Lawrence
family
in
order
to
smear
them
.
Theresa
May
had
previously
announced
Monday
the
allegations
would
be
investigated
as
part
of
two
ongoing
inquiries
,
but
representatives
of
the
Lawrence
family
demanded
an
independent
public
inquiry
into
the
events
.
</p>
<p>
Doreen
Lawrence
said
in
the
meeting
May
had
said
&quot;
all
options
are
open
&quot;
.
Lawrence
said
the
inquiry
&quot;
should
be
open
and
not
behind
closed
doors
so
that
we
can
hear
once
and
for
all
exactly
what
was
going
on
after
Stephen
was
murdered
[
...
]
I
think
unless
we
have
a
public
inquiry
that
goes
through
the
whole
thing
,
we
will
never
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
&quot;
.
</p>
<p>
Stephen
Lawrence
was
stabbed
in
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/London">
London
</ref>
in
1993
by
a
gang
of
white
teenagers
while
he
waited
for
a
bus
.
Lawrence
's
killers
were
not
convicted
for
eighteen
years
;
failures
in
the
police
investigation
led
to
an
inquiry
led
by
Sir
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William%20Macpherson">
William
Macpherson
</ref>
that
found
the
police
to
be
&quot;
institutionally
racist
&quot;
.
</p>
<p>
The
allegations
regarding
the
Lawrence
investigation
were
revealed
on
Monday
by

programme
,
who
interviewed
Peter
Francis
,
a
former
undercover
officer
with
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special%20Demonstration%20Squad">
Special
Demonstration
Squad
</ref>
.
</p>
<p>
While
a
member
of
the
undercover
squad
,
Peter
Francis
posed
from
1993
to
1997
as
an
anti-racist
campaigner
and
infiltrated
a
number
of
left-wing
protest
groups
.
Francis
claims
anti-racist
campaigning
after
the
death
of
Stephen
Lawrence
was
considered
by
some
in
the
Metropolitan
Police
to
be
a
potential
source
for
rioting
and
public
disorder
similar
to
the
riots
in
Los
Angeles
riots
in
reaction
to
the
treatment
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney%20King">
Rodney
King
</ref>
by
police
.
</p>
<p>
Francis
said
&quot;
there
was
almost
constant
pressure
on
me
personally
to
find
out
anything
I
could
that
would
discredit
[
the
Lawrence
family
]
campaigns
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Stephen
Lawrence
's
father
,
Neville
,
expressed
anger
at
the
police
over
the
allegations
that
they
set
out
to
collect
evidence
to
smear
his
family
:
&quot;
It
is
unthinkable
that
in
the
extremely
dark
days
and
months
after
my
son
's
murder
that
my
family
were
subject
to
such
scrutiny
&quot;
.
</p>
<p>
Neville
Lawrence
also
called
for
an
independent
inquiry
:
&quot;
I
understand
that
the
home
secretary
has
announced
that
she
will
extend
the
inquiries
of
Mark
Ellison
QC
and
Operation
Herne
,
I
would
like
to
make
it
clear
that
I
find
this
completely
unsatisfactory
.
&quot;
He
added
:
&quot;
I
am
convinced
that
nothing
short
of
a
judge-led
public
inquiry
will
suffice
and
I
have
no
confidence
that
the
measures
announced
today
[
Monday
]
will
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
matter
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Stephen
Lawrence
's
mother
Doreen
said
she
was
&quot;
surprised
and
shocked
&quot;
by
the
idea
that
the
police
were
collecting
intelligence
on
the
Lawrence
family
:
&quot;
They
put
all
the
resources
into
monitoring
what
the
family
and
what
the
campaign
was
doing
rather
than
investigating
Stephen
's
murder
&quot;
.
</p>
<p>
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/David_Cameron">
David
Cameron
</ref>
has
expressed
support
for
the
Lawrence
family
:
&quot;
Let
's
be
clear
,
these
are
absolutely
dreadful
allegations
and
we
can
only
think
of
the
Lawrence
family
,
who
have
suffered
so
much
already
from
the
loss
of
their
son
.
To
hear
that
,
potentially
,
the
police
that
were
meant
to
be
helping
them
were
actually
undermining
them
â€”
that
's
horrific
&quot;
.
Cameron
said
he
hopes
investigations
in
to
the
allegations
will
happen
&quot;
rapidly
&quot;
.
</p>
<p>
London
mayor
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Boris_Johnson">
Boris
Johnson
</ref>
also
expressed
disapproval
with
the
alleged
actions
of
the
police
:
&quot;
I
cannot
think
of
anything
more
despicable
than
the
police
attempting
to
smear
Stephen
Lawrence
's
family
.
If
there
was
a
campaign
to
discredit
those
seeking
justice
,
we
need
to
know
what
the
orders
were
and
who
gave
them
.
We
need
to
know
whether
there
was
any
criminal
activity
,
and
we
should
n't
rule
out
the
possibility
of
criminal
proceedings
.
