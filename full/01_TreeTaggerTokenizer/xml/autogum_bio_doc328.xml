Paisius
was

The
first
time
that
Paisius
was
elected
as
Patriarch
of
Constantinople
was
20
November
1726
,
the
day
when
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarch_Callinicus_III_of_Constantinople">
Callinicus
III
</ref>
was
found
dead
by
heart
attack
before
his
enthronement
:
Paisius
was
immediately
chosen
by
the
faction
that
previously
elected
Callinicus
to
preclude
a
return
to
the
throne
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecumenical_Patriarch_Jeremias_III_of_Constantinople">

</ref>

The
first
years
of
his
reign
were
marked
by
clashes
with
the
faction
gathered
around
the
community
of
Caesarea
,
whose
main
representatives
were
Jeremias
III
and
later
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecumenical_Patriarch_Neophytus_VI_of_Constantinople">
Neophytus
VI
</ref>
,
despite
the
fact
that
Paisius
himself
was
born
in
this
town
.
In
1731
this
faction
tried
to
depose
him
and
to
restore
Jeremias
,
but
failed
.
A
second
attempt
in
September
1732
was
successful
,
when
Jeremias
III
overthrew
him
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-EHW-3">

</ref>
When
later
Jeremias
had
to
retire
due
to
health
problems
,
a
Patriarch
from
Nicomedia
(
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecumenical_Patriarch_Serapheim_I_of_Constantinople">
Serapheim
I
</ref>
)
followed
and
later
again
one
from
Caesarea
(
Neophytus
VI
)
who
reigned
six
years
.
</p>
<p>
The
reign
of
Neophytus
VI
was
ended
by
a
decision
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Vizier">
Grand
Vizier
</ref>
,
who
allowed
Paisius
to
be
reinstalled
for
his
second
term
in
August
1740
.
However
three
years
later
,
in
May
1743
,
Paisius
was
deposed
by
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Porte">
Ottoman
authorities
</ref>
for
financial
issues
and
Neophytus
VI
was
restored
.

The
third
reign
of
Paisius
began
in
March
1744
,
when
he
overthrew
Neophytus
.
Shortly
after
however
a
new
opponent
arose
:
the
Metropolitan
of
Nicomedia
and
future
Patriarch
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecumenical_Patriarch_Cyril_V_of_Constantinople">
Cyril
V
Karakallos
</ref>
,
who
voiced
the
complaints
against
him
and
was
able
to
depose
him
on
28
September
1748
.
The
complaints
were
due
mainly
to
Paisius
'
financial
management
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millet_(Ottoman_Empire)">
millet
</ref>
,
i.e.
the
Christian
civil
community
ruled
by
the
Patriarch
:
to
reduce
the
high
levels
of
debts
,
Paisius
increased
the
taxation
particularly
of
the
laity
,
and
this
caused
discontent
with
him
.

Paisius
II
's
fourth
term
was
an
interlude
in
the
reign
of
Cyril
V
,
and
began
in
last
days
of
May
1751
when
Cyril
was
actually
deposed
by
the
Metropolitans
both
because
of
his
regulations
on
taxes
and
because
of
his
strong
position
in
favor
of
the
necessity
of
re-
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptism">
baptism
</ref>
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_Apostolic_Church">
Armenian
</ref>
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church">
Latin
</ref>
converts
.
Cyril
however
was
supported
by
a
large
portion
of
the
populace
and
by
the
demagogic
monk
Auxentios
,
who
instigated
riots
which
culminated
in
a
violent
assault
on
the
Patriarchate
and
the
seizure
of
Paisius
himself
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Frazee-4">

Paisius
was
subsequently
deposed
and
Cyril
V
was
reinstated
on
7
September
1752
after
a
gift
to
the
Ottoman
authorities
of
45,000

After
his
fourth
and
final
deposition
,
Paisius
retired
in
the
monastery
of
Kamariotissa
on
island
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heybeliada">

,
where
he
died
