This
is
probably
the
most
important
step
of
all
.
It

simple
too
.
INTRODUCE
YOURSELF
!
You

n't
get
close

know
more
about
them
if
they
have
no
idea
who
you
are
.

Try
and
get
that
person
talking
.
Find
something
they
're
interested
in
and
talk
about
that
.
Helping
this
person
feel
comfortable
around
you
will
help
them
open
up
and
communicate
a
little
more

Tips
</head>
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Try
and
be
friendly
.
You
ca
n't
be
mean
to
this
person
and
expect
them
to
like
you
.
Treat
this
new
friend
of
yours
like
any
other
friend
.
</item>
<item>
Do
n't
try
and
get
to
know
them
to
spill
their
secrets
and
humiliate
them
.
It
's
not
very
fun
to
be
humiliated
in
front
of
everyone
that
you
know
.
</item>
<item>
Do
n't
expect
immediate
results
</item>
<item>
Do
n't
give
up
and
be
persistent
.
If
that
person
says
&quot;
I
do
n't
want
you
around
me
&quot;
then
just
leave
them
alone
.
But
until
they
do
,
try
and
get
to
know
them
better
.
Break
them
out
of
the
shell
they
have
.
</item>
<item>
If
the
person
does
n't
warm
up
to
you
right
away
,
do
n't
sweat
it
.
This
is
a
private
person
so
they
may
be
trying
to
figure
out
if
you
're
friend
or
foe
.

Warnings
</head>
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Make
sure
you
are
not
exceeding
the
person
's
comfort
level
.
Be
mindful
of
their
posture
and
expressions
,
to
see
if
they
are
becoming
nervous
.
In
the
event
that
the
person
has
social
limitations
or
trust
issues
,
it
is
important
that
they
feel
like
you
are
a
&quot;
safe
&quot;
person
to
talk
to
,
who
would
respect
their
boundaries
and
not
try
to
pressure
them
into
more
conversation
than
they
are
comfortable
with
.
</item>
<item>
Some
people
have
psychological
disorders
which
make
social
interactions
difficult
for
them
.
It
's
rare
that
they
will
simply
announce
this
to
you
.
Be
aware
of
this
possibility
,
ahead
of
time
.
While
the
person
may
simply
be
shy
,
they
could
also
just
as
well
be
suffering
from
PTSD
or
Social
Anxiety
.
These
conditions
do
not
necessarily
mean
that
they
will
never
allow
you
to
become
close
to
them
.
However
,
it
may
be
at
a
different
pace
than
the
one
you
would
normally
expect
.
Be
respectful
and
do
not
impose
your
pace
upon
them
.
A
gentle
and
slow
approach
will
give
a
them
a
greater
sense
of
ease
,
and
they
will
be
more
likely
to
open
up
to
you
.
