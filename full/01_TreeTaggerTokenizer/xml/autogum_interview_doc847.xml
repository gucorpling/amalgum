Why
are
you
running
for
political
office
,
why
at
the
federal
level
,
why
this
party
,
and
why
in
this
riding
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
I
am
running
for
office
because
I
care
about
Canada
and
my
fellow
Canadians
.
I
am
worried
about
the
future
we
are
leaving
behind
to
our
children
.
I
am
running
for
Member
of
Parliament
because
it
is
Canada
?
s
top
level
of
government
that
carries
the
responsibility
of
overseeing
which
path
we
take
in
dealing
with
the
following
issues
:
the
direction
we
chose
for
our
Economy
and
ensure
it
stays
on
course
;
the
way
we
chose
to
deal
with
the
Environment
;
protection
of
our
Universal
Health
Care
System
and
many
other
issues
.
The
Federal
Government
sets
the
tone
for
the
rest
of
the
Country
to
follow
.
I
want
to
be
a
part
of
how
we
shape
the
future
.
The
Liberal
Party
of
Canada
has
come
to
match
my
values
best
.
I
support
our
plans
addressing
the
following
issues
Economy
,
Environment
,
Healthcare
,
Poverty
Reduction
,
continued
support
for
our
Arts
and
Culture
Community
,
our
policy
on
immigration
and
our
role
Internationally
.
I
have
just
touched
on
just
a
few
of
the
reasons
I
have
come
to
embrace
the
ideas
of
the
Liberal
Party
of
Canada
.
I
am
running
in
this
riding
because
I
have
been
a
resident
here
for
almost
20
years
.
As
a
result
I
have
first
hand
experience
with
some
of
the
issues
here
locally
.
I
am
passionate
about
my
community
.
