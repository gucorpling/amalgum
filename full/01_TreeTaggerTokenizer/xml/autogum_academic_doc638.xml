First
,
our
data
showed
that
different
dimensions
of
parenting
practices
,
in
particular
,
those
of
affect
and
communication
,
promotion
of
autonomy
,
self-disclosure
,
humor
,
psychological
control
,
and
self-esteem
are
related
to
each
other
.
According
to
our
results
,
adolescents
who
scored
high
in
self-esteem
were
those
who
perceived
the
most
affect
and
communication
from
their
parents
,
as
well
as
the
most
promotion
of
their
autonomy
and
humor
in
the
parent-child
relationship
.
On
the
contrary
,
adolescents
with
lower
scores
in
self-esteem
perceived
more
parental
psychological
control
in
their
relations
.
Other
studies
have
agreed
that
the
above
dimensions
,
except
for
psychological
control
,
contribute
to
improving
the
quality
of
the
parent-adolescent
child
relationship
,
as
they
respect
and
accept
their
individuality
,
which
facilitates
adolescents
evaluating
themselves
positively
.
Researchers
are
also
in
agreement
that
when
psychological
and
behavioral
control
are
distinguished
,
family
relations
based
on
manipulation
or
inducing
guilt
(
predominant
psychological
control
)
are
not
beneficial
to
fostering
adolescent
self-esteem
,
and
are
in
favor
of
distinguishing
these
two
dimensions
instead
of
considering
them
together
as
one
general
dimension
related
to
control
,
as
has
classically
been
done
in
the
study
of
parenting
practices
and
adolescent
adjustment
.
</p>
<p>
Correlations
were
found
between
the
various
dimensions
of
parenting
practices
and
life
satisfaction
.
Specifically
,
the
higher
the
score
on
the
affect
and
communication
,
promotion
of
autonomy
,
humor
,
and
self-disclosure
variables
,
the
higher
life
satisfaction
was
.
In
all
the
correlations
,
the
effect
size
was
moderate
.
On
the
contrary
,
the
higher
the
score
in
the
psychological
control
dimension
,
the
lower
the
life
satisfaction
of
the
adolescents
was
.
Our
objective
of
developing
a
predictive
model
for
life
satisfaction
based
on
the
dimensions
of
parenting
practices
was
also
accomplished
.
The
affect
and
communication
,
self-disclosure
,
psychological
control
,
and
humor
dimensions
explained
23.1
%
of
the
variability
found
in
life
satisfaction
.
The
results
of
the
regression
analysis
revealed
that
life
satisfaction
in
adolescence
increased
when
parenting
was
characterized
by
strong
practices
of
affect
and
communication
,
high
self-disclosure
in
their
relations
,
low
psychological
control
,
and
strong
sense
of
humor
,
where
affect
and
communication
,
which
predominates
in
authoritative
and
indulgent
parenting
styles
,
was
the
parenting
practices
variable
with
the
most
predictive
power
for
life
satisfaction
.
In
fact
,
these
results
have
also
been
found
by
other
similar
studies
,
which
underline
the
importance
of
promoting
warm
,
affectionate
parent-child
relationships
based
on
affect
and
communication
.
Thus
,
some
authors
emphasize
the
importance
of
parental
support
based
on
acceptance
,
open
communication
,
and
affect
as
one
of
the
most
important
predictors
of
life
satisfaction
.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless
,
these
findings
must
be
interpreted
within
a
methodological
limitation
of
this
study
,
which
is
that
the
information
on
parenting
practices
comes
exclusively
from
the
adolescents
themselves
,
and
there
could
,
therefore
,
be
some
bias
in
the
results
contributing
to
a
higher
correlation
between
variables
.
It
is
,
therefore
,
advisable
to
complete
this
information
with
other
information
reported
by
other
family
members
.
Even
so
,
some
authors
believe
that
the
adolescent
is
one
of
the
most
reliable
sources
for
evaluating
parenting
practices
because
they
are
less
conditioned
by
social
desirability
.
Moreover
,
although
the
use
of
standardized
tests
,
such
as
questionnaires
,
have
frequently
been
used
in
similar
studies
,
e.
g.
,
,
it
is
suggested
that
future
research
also
uses
observational
records
of
parent-child
interaction
or
interviews
,
which
enable
parenting
practices
to
be
explored
.
</p>
<p>
The
results
also
showed
that
there
is
a
close
relationship
between
adolescent
self-esteem
and
life
satisfaction
with
a
moderate
effect
size
.
This
study
enabled
us
to
compare
the
level
of
life
satisfaction
in
adolescent
profiles
characterized
by
high/low
self-esteem
.
In
this
sense
,
the
results
of
this
study
have
shown
that
adolescents
with
high
self-esteem
scored
higher
in
life
satisfaction
.
These
findings
coincide
with
our
research
hypothesis
that
,
a
priori
,
it
was
expected
to
find
significant
differences
in
the
level
of
life
satisfaction
between
adolescents
with
high
and
low
self-esteem
,
in
favor
of
those
with
high
self-esteem
compared
to
those
with
low
self-esteem
.
Previous
research
on
this
subject
has
contributed
results
in
the
same
direction
.
These
results
are
coherent
since
both
variables
also
correlated
with
other
personal
(
self-efficacy
)
and
social
(
perception
of
support
and
school
victimization
)
variables
.
</p>
<p>
Finally
,
the
results
suggest
that
self-esteem
exerts
a
moderating
effect
on
the
relationship
between
self-disclosure
and
life
satisfaction
.
It
should
,
therefore
,
be
mentioned
that
interpersonal
relations
are
two-way
,
so
both
parents
and
children
have
an
active
role
in
the
relationship
,
in
which
the
psychological
characteristics
of
both
intervene
.
In
this
case
,
our
data
show
that
it
is
relevant
and
advisable
to
develop
positive
self-esteem
in
the
adolescent
,
among
other
reasons
,
because
it
improves
fluid
,
spontaneous
parent-child
communication
,
generating
more
life
satisfaction
in
adolescents
.
In
this
respect
,
future
studies
could
explore
the
role
of
positive
communication
in
adolescent
wellbeing
in
greater
depth
,
considering
the
combined
effect
of
dimensions
,
such
as
humor
,
affect/communication
,
and
self-disclosure
in
their
development
,
taking
sex
differences
into
account
.
