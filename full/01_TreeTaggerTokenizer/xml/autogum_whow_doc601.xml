Learn
to
love
how
you
are
.
If
someone
does
n't
like
you
,
then
who
cares
?
You
are
YOU
and
you
should
love
yourself
more
and
more
each
day
.
You
do
n't
have
to
be
similar
to
everyone
.
Being
different
is
the
most
important
thing
of
all
.
</item>
<item>
To
be
very
healthy
,
DO
NOT
smoke
.
Smoking
is
so
bad
for
your
health
,
and
can
lead
to
lung
cancer
and
loss/shortage
of
life
.
It
's
very
hard
to
stop
when
you
've
already
started
.
</item>
<item>
When
you
eat
too
much
junk
food
,
your
body
may
not
like
it
.
Soon
you
may
become
fatter
and
no
one
likes
that
!
To
be
slim
eat
fruit
,
vegetables
,
and
meat
.
Anything
like
chocolate
,
cake
,
and
chips
are
bad
for
your
health
,
and
can
damage
your
body
.
Refined
sugars
and
saturated
fats
are
health
disasters
waiting
to
happen
!
</item>
<item>
Try
to
avoid
getting
sick
.
If
you
see
someone
who
has
caught
a
cold
,
do
n't
get
too
close
to
them
.
Try
to
avoid
getting
cancer
or
breaking
a
leg
,
and
be
careful
where
you
head
!
Falling
down
the
stairs
,
on
the
road
,
dropping
from
a
building
.
Be
SO
careful
!
</item>
<item>
Lastly
,
if
someone
you
hate
or
a
bully
tries
to
hurt
you
in
some
way
,
STAY
AWAY
.
If
you
are
so
close
to
them
,
then
act
nice
to
them
.
Bullies
hate
when
you
do
that
.
If
nothing
works
,
try
a
compliment
.
If
it
still
wo
n't
work
,
then
you
must
defend
yourself
with
your
INNER
strength
and
FAITH
.

If
you
SO
BADLY

wait
,
and
feel
stronger
,
go
on
health

Some
medicine
can
help
your
muscles
.
Also
,
milk
can
help
your
muscles
grow
.
But
,
inner
strength
is
when
your
emotions
help
you
become
strong
.
It
happens
!

Everyone
knows
drugs
are
bad
for
you
,
but
medical
drugs
are
ok
.
They
help
your
body
and
can
clear
yourself
from
cancer
.
</item>
<item>
Maybe
you
could
stop
the
health
challenges
and
diets
and
stuff
.
Instead
,
be
yourself
.
Strength
is
n't
everything
,
and
soon
one
day
you
may
not
be
strong
,
but
you
wo
n't
turn
into
a
bully
.
Sometimes
things
like
this
happen

watch
out

When
a
very
well
loved
person
dies
,
it
is
hard
not
to
cry
.
But
,
to
help
you
power
on
and
stop
worrying
,
you
could
maybe
talk
to
a
friend
or
family
member
.
</item>
<item>
Another
thing
to
do
is
to
write
about
it
and
express
your
feelings
in
journals
and
diaries
.
Soon
,
it
wo
n't
sound
so
bad
,
and
you
wo
n't
be
teared
up
in
agony
anymore
.
</item>
<item>
If
you
are
still
crying
and
do
n't
know
what
to
do
,
try
remembering
all
your
cherished
moments
with
that
particular
person
in
your
life
.
You
will
always
remember
the
person
who
helped
you
get
through
life
,
be
happy
after
tears
,
and
make
you
feel
good
about
yourself
.

Sharing
your
story
with
others
can
help
you
feel
better
.
Talking
about
it
to
a
teacher
,
friends
,
and
your
parents
can
help
you
soften
those
tears
.
</item>
<item>
If
all
else
fails
,
and
you
are
still
teared
up
in
sadness
,
pretend
that
he/she
is
still
living
.
Daydream/dream/act
out
plays
and
stories
of
how
he/she
is
still
living
and
as
good
as
ever
.
Then
,
he/she
would
n't
be
in
his/her
grave
,
after
all
!
He/she
will
be
with
you
only
.

There
are
many
ways
to
show
people
that
you
are
in
pain
.
I
will
tell
you
how
to
feel
better
about
the
way

Wheelchairs
are
used
for
people
who
ca
n't
walk
anymore
.
If
you
ca
n't
walk
and
you
are
in
a
wheelchair
,
people
may
stare
at
you
.
If
you
ca
n't
ride
a
wheelchair
well
,
get
a
best
friend
or
family
member
to
help
you
wheel
along
.
</item>
<item>
People
use
crutches
when
they
can
walk
,
but
it
hurts
.
If
crutches
is
the
way
to
go
,
do
n't
feel
too
bad
.
If
you
find
it
hard
to
hop
for
so
long
,
get
someone
to
help
you
while
you
are
hopping
.
Maybe
,
they
can
help
you
hop
on
your
foot
.
Hold
you
while
you
hop
,
so
you
do
n't
fall
over
.
</item>
<item>
Blood
is
painful
,
and
can
be
red
,
but
also
maroon
.
To
fix
blood
pouring
down
your
legs
or
arms
or
stuff
,
get
a
bandage
or
a
band-aid
(
bandage
would
be
better
)
and
wrap
it
around
where
your
blood
is
.
Remember
to
change
your
bandage
once
a
day
or
it
may
stick
there
forever
!
Soon
,
when
it
does
n't
hurt
anymore
,
get
rid
of
the
bandages
,
and
you
're
fine
!

Crying
can
tell
that
something
is
wrong
.
Everyone
cries
sometime
,
and
crying
can
bring
lots
of
attention
.
Feeling
lost
?
Broke
your
leg
?
Your
life
is
horrible
?
Many
people
will
usually
come
to
your
rescue
.
And
when
you
tell
them
about
your
pain
,
they
will
almost
always
help
.
Crying
is
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
,
and
can
save
your
life
sometimes
!
