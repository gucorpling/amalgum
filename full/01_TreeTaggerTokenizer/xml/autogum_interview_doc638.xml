I
support
capital

however
something
more
needs
to
be
done

insure
that

Yes

lower

We
need

less

and
less
taxes
to
support

is

too
powerful

End
the
wars
,
Save
Social

;
I
am
on
a
Constitution
Party
national
committee
dealing
with
Social
Security
and
our
committee
has
a
very
good
plan
to
not
only
save
Social
Security
,
but
keep
it
well
for
100
years
;
get
it
out
of
the
hands
of
Congress
which
has
robbed
it
.
I
will
also
end
the
taxation
of
ALL
Social
Security
benefits
for
those
that
are
retired
and
eliminate
the
earnings
requirement
.
I
will
also
end
free
trade
and
bring
good
quality
,
high
paying
jobs
back
top
the
USA
with
good
health
benefits
.

I

As
to
wining
the

I
'm
very

I
will
do

better
then
we

done

I

will
be
