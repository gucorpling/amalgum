Introduction
</head>
<p>
Autophagy
,
a
self-eating
process
,
is
involved
in
the
development
and
the
differentiation
of
various
cell
types
including
the
adipocyte
.
Autophagy
contributes
to
the
adipocyte
differentiation
by
reorganizing
the
intracellular
components
,
forming
the
fat
droplets
and/or
providing
the
energy
source
for
the
development
of
the
phenotype
.
Therefore
,
the
knockdown
of
essential
autophagy
genes
prevents
the
adipocyte
differentiation
and
intervenes
in
the
lipid
accumulation
within
adipogenic
cells
.
The
adipocyte
differentiation
is
a
well-understood
process
.
A
well
defined
transcriptional
program
is
initiated
and
maintained
by
specific
transcription
factors
.
The
3T3-L1
mouse
fibroblast
is
a
key
model
for
studying
this
process
.
When
the
pre-adipocyte
is
induced
with
a
chemical
cocktail
containing
MDI
(
1-Methyl-3-isobutylxanthine
,
Dexamethasone
,
and
Insulin
)
,
the
cell
witnesses
morphological
and
metabolic
changes
and
is
finally
transformed
into
mature
adipocyte
.
</p>
<p>
Several
studies
reported
functional
links
between
the
adipogenic
factors
and
key
autophagy
genes
.
For
example
,
the
transcription
factor
CCAAT
enhancer-binding
protein
beta
(
CEBPB
)
controls
the
expression
of
the
autophagy-related
4b
cysteine
peptidase
(
<hi rend="italic">
Atg4b
</hi>
)
.
A
recent
study
suggested
that
peroxisome
proliferator-activated
receptor
gamma
(
PPARG
)
regulates
autophagy
through
NEDD4
E3
ubiquitin
protein
ligase
(
NEDD4
)
gene
expression
in
thiazolidinediones-treated
HepG2
cells
.
Forkhead
box
o1
(
FOXO1
)
regulates
autophagy
induction
and
it
also
negatively
regulates
Pparg
,
the
master
adipogenic
factor
.
Indeed
,
the
inhibition
of
FOXO1
is
thus
necessary
for
the
differentiation
to
proceed
.
In
a
previous
study
from
our
laboratory
,
we
reported
the
progressive
activation
of
the
<hi rend="italic">
Foxo1
</hi>
gene
during
the
course
of
differentiation
,
to
reach
the
highest
expression
in
the
mature
adipocytes
.
In
addition
,
we
identified
a
large
number
of
differentially
expressed
autophagy
genes
between
differentiated
and
undifferentiated
adipocytes
.
The
changes
in
gene
expression
were
clustered
into
several
groups
that
corresponded
to
the
known
stages
of
adipocyte
differentiation
.
Therefore
,
the
regulation
of
autophagy
during
the
course
of
the
differentiation
seems
to
be
more
dynamic
and
stage-dependant
.
Only
a
few
examples
of
direct
and
indirect
regulation
of
autophagy
genes
have
been
studied
.
</p>
<p>
We
hypothesize
that
the
autophagy
process
may
be
regulated
by
the
same
adipogenic
factors
either
directly
or
indirectly
through
specific
autophagy
transcription
factors
.
To
investigate
this
hypothesis
,
we
modeled
the
gene
expression
and
transcription
factors
and
co-factors
binding
at
different
stages
of
adipocyte
maturation
(

)
.
Then
,
we
studied
the
direct
regulatory
links
between
the
adipogenic
transcription
factors
and
key
autophagy
genes
as
well
as
specific
autophagy
transcription
factors
.
We
were
able
to
quantify
the
changes
in
the
global
expression
of
autophagy
genes
as
the
pre-adipocytes
progressed
toward
the
maturation
stage
.
We
considered
changes
at
both
the
individual
gene
and
the
gene
set
levels
.
Then
,
we
investigated
the
links
between
the
master
adipogenic
transcription
factors
and
the
observed
changes
in
gene
expression
.
We
tested
whether
the
established
links
hold
in
the
knockdown
condition
of
the
adipogenic
factors
.
In
addition
,
the
role
of
transcription
co-factors
and
histone
modifications
in
modulating
the
function
of
the
transcription
factor
was
discussed
.
