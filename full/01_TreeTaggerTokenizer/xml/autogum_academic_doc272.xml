<p>
The
method
proposed
in
this
paper
will
seek
to
exploit
the
correlations
between
distinct
currency
crosses
in
order
to
predict
the
medium-term
trend
of
ones
of
them
.
To
this
end
,
the
authors
will
describe
below
a
pipeline
that
is
based
on
the
use
of
set
of
cross-currency
exchanges
characterizing
an
arbitrage
opportunity
in
the
Forex
market
.
As
introduced
in
the
first
section
,
an
arbitrage
takes
advantage
of
differences
in
the
price
of
single
currency
related
to
short-time
misalignments
between
the
traded
currency
with
the
related
ones
.
A
typical
example
of
arbitrage
is
the
so-called
triangular
arbitrage
referred
to
three
currencies
of
which
one
is
obtainable
from
the
combination
of
the
prices
of
the
other
two
crosses
.
In
this
article
,
we
will
refer
to
the
EUR/USD
,
GBP/USD
,
and
EUR/GBP
crosses
.
A
similar
approach
can
be
extended
to
any
other
trio
of
related
currencies
.
The
currency
on
which
to
execute
trading
operations
is
EUR/USD
.
The
price
of
the
EUR/USD
cross
for
arbitrage
purposes
in
the
currency
market
must
always
be
obtainable
from
the
other
two
pairs
EUR/GBP
and
GBP/USD
by
the
relationship
(

)
</p>
<p>
In
Equation
(
1
)
,
we
have
denoted
with
<b>
<hi rend="italic">
px(tk
)
</hi>
</b>
the
price
of
the
currency
.
Therefore
,
in
a
financially
balanced
market
,
so
that
an
investor
cannot
take
advantage
of
arbitrage
conditions
and
consequently
obtain
a
systematic
gain
,
Equation
(
1
)
must
always
be
verified
,
i.
e.
,
there
must
be
a
very
precise
temporal
correlation
between
specific
currency
crosses
.
In
reality
,
small
short-term
misalignments
are
always
found
in
the
Forex
markets
and
these
are
often
excellent
trading
opportunities
for
financial
robot
advisors
who
automatically
execute
many
operations
,
taking
advantage
of
these
short-time
market
misalignments
.
The
author
is
investigating
the
design
and
use
of
specific
hand-crafted
features
(
which
the
author
has
already
used
in
the
medical
field
)
extracted
from
the
chart
of
currency
time-series
and
which
would
seem
to
early
indicate
the
possible
misalignments
between
the
cross
currency
prices
from
which
are
extracted
.
</p>
<p>
For
the
reasons
mentioned
above
,
the
author
has
designed
a
pipeline
which
,
to
determine
the
medium-term
trend
of
a
given
currency
,
analyzes
the
correlations
between
the
related
currencies
in
the
context
of
a
triangular
arbitrage
.
In
the
specific
case
,
without
losing
generalization
,
the
author
will
refer
to
the
EUR/USD
currency
as
that
on
which
to
execute
financial
trading
operations
and
to
the
EUR/GBP
and
GBP/USD
currencies
to
determine
the
data
set
for
a
possible
triangular
arbitrage
.
Similar
considerations
can
be
extended
to
any
other
set
of
currencies
with
the
same
financial
characteristics
.
</p>
<p>
Having
established
this
necessary
premise
,
the
author
will
describe
the
proposed
pipeline
below
.

the
algorithmic
pipeline
that
is
intended
to
be

The
following
paragraphs
will
illustrate
each
of
the
blocks
present
in
the
complete
diagram
of
the
proposed
pipeline

Data
Pre-Processing
Block
</head>
<p>
The
objective
of
this
block
is
to
pre-process
the
data
of
the
incoming
financial
time-series
.
Specifically
,
in
this
block
the
data
of
the
incoming
time-series
will
be
normalized
in
the
range
[
0
,
1
]
.
<figure>
Figure
3
</figure>
shows
an
example
of
normalized
financial
time-series
relating
to
the
three
cross
currency
analyzed
in
this
paper
.
In
this
way
,
whatever
the
pricing
of
the
cross
currency
entering
our
system
,
the
pipeline
will
always
process
data
in
the
range
[
0
,
1
]
,
greatly
improving
the
stability
of
the
proposed
algorithm
.
</p>
<p>
In
order
to
train
and
validate
the
proposed
pipeline
,
the
author
has
organized
a
proper
dataset
of
financial
pricing
data
.
Specifically
,
historical
financial
data
(
with
99.9
%
accuracy
)
of
EUR/USD
,
GBP/USD
,
EUR/GBP
for
the
years
2004
â€“
2018
have
been
collected
.
Again
,
with
reference
to
the
aforementioned
time
period
,
for
each
cross
currency
the
historical
data
referring
to
the
opening
and
closing
prices
,
higher
and
lower
in
addition
to
the
time
of
each
quotation
(
CET
time
)
have
been
collected
.
This
dataset
has
been
properly
divided
in
order
to
organize
a
set
of
data
that
can
be
used
for
the
training
phase
of
the
proposed
system
and
the
remaining
for
the
testing
and
validation
session
.
Specifically
,
such
training
simulations
and
annual
validation
have
been
performed
,
dividing
the
dataset
as
follows
:
70
%
of
the
mentioned
dataset
was
used
to
train
the
pipeline
,
while
the
remaining
30
%
was
used
to
validate
and
test
the
proposed
method
.
Both
the
training
set
and
the
validation
ones
has
been
analyzed
as
to
understand
if
the
possible
trends
(
LONG
,
SHORT
,
NULL
)
were
equally
represented
in
both
datasets
in
order
to
avoid
overfitting
issues
for
the
deep
learning
system
.
</p>
<p>
The
financial
data
thus
organized
are
therefore
presented
as
input
to
the
pre-processing
system
described
in
this
section
whose
output
will
be
further
processed
by
the
next
deep
learning
block
.
