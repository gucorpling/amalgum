Chuuk
Lagoon
is
part
of
the
larger
Caroline
Islands
group
.
</p>
<p>
The
area
consists
of
eleven
major
islands
(
corresponding
to
the
eleven
municipalities
of
Truk
lagoon
,
which
are
Tol
,
Udot
,
Fala-Beguets
,
Romanum
,
and
Eot
of
Faichuk
group
,
and
Moen
,
Fefan
,
Dublon
,
Uman
,
Param
,
and
Tsis
of
Namoneas
group
)
and
forty-six
smaller
ones
within
the
lagoon
,
plus
forty-one
on
the
fringing
coral
reef
,
and
is
known
today
as
the
Chuuk
islands
,
part
of
the
Federated
States
of
Micronesia
in
the
Pacific
Ocean
</p>
<p>
The
islands
were
originally
settled
more
than
2000
years
ago
,
probably
from
Pohnpei
and
Kosrae
to
the
east
,
based
on
many
legend
and
language
similarities
.
</p>
<p>
During
World
War
II
,
Truk
Lagoon
,
as
it
was
then
known
,
was
the
Empire
of
Japan
's
main
base
in
the
South
Pacific
theatre
.
A
significant
portion
of
the
Japanese
fleet
was
based
there
.
Truk
was
the
base
for
Japanese
operations
against
Allied
forces
in
New
Guinea
and
the
Solomon
Islands
.
Due
to
its
heavy
fortifications
,
both
natural
and
manmade
,
the
base
at
Truk
was
known
to
Allied
forces
as
&quot;
the
Gibraltar
of
the
Pacific
&quot;
.
</p>
<p>
Operation
Hailstone
was
launched
from
the
Marshall
Islands
,
and
the
attack
on
Truk
lagoon
started
in
the
early
morning
of
February
17
,
1944
,
and
culminated
in
one
of
the
most
important
naval
airstrikes
of
the
war
.
Twelve
Japanese
warships
,
thirty-two
merchant
ships
and
249
aircraft
were
destroyed
making
the
lagoon
the
biggest
graveyard
of
ships
in
the
world
,
although
the
larger
warships
had
moved
to
Palau
a
week
earlier
.

Following
Jacques
Cousteau
's
1971
television
documentary
about
the
lagoon
and
its
ghostly
remains
,
the
place
became
a
wreck
diving
destination
,
drawing
wreck
diving
enthusiasts
from
around
the
world
to
see
its
numerous
,
virtually
intact
sunken
ships
.
The
shipwrecks
and
remains
are
sometimes
referred
to
as
the
&quot;
Ghost
Fleet
of
Truk
Lagoon
&quot;
.
Scattered
mainly
around
the
Dublon
,
Eten
,
Fefan
and
Uman
islands
within
the
Truk
group
,
a
number
of
the
shipwrecks
lie
in
crystal
clear
waters
less
than
fifteen
meters
below
the
surface
.
In
waters
devoid
of
normal
ocean
currents
,
divers
can
easily
swim
across
decks
littered
with
gas
masks
and
depth
charges
and
below
deck
can
be
found
numerous
human
remains
.
In
the
massive
ships
'
holds
are
row
upon
row
of
fighter
aircraft
,
tanks
,
bulldozers
,
railroad
cars
,
motorcycles
,
torpedoes
,
mines
,
bombs
,
boxes
of
munitions
,
radios
,
plus
thousands
of
other
weapons
,
spare
parts
,
and
other
artifacts
.

<p>
Of
special
interest
is
the
wreck
of
the
submarine
I-169
Shinohara
which
was
lost
when
diving
to
avoid
the
bombing
.
The
sub
had
been
part
of
the
attack
on
Pearl
Harbor
.

The
coral
encrusted
wrecks
attract
a
diverse
array
of
marine
life
,
including
manta-rays
,
turtles
,
sharks
and
corals
.
In
2007
,
266
species
of
reef
fish
were
recorded
by
an
Earthwatch
team
and
in
2006
the
rare
coral
Acropora
pichoni
was
identified
.
