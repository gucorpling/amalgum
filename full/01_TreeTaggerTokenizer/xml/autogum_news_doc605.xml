and
I
are
talking
to
NBC
at
the
moment
.
The
basic
problem
is
that
no
one
knows
who
owns
the
rights
&quot;
.
Their
legal
department
had
apparently
been
looking
into
the
matter
for
two
months
,
as
of
the
convention
weekend
.

the

had
a

at

convention
displaying

Amidst
the
bustle
of
activity
,
Campbell
was
working
on
a

helmet
sculpt
.
After
the
convention
,
he
told
Wikinews
that
&quot;
it
can
be
tough
to
maintain
focus
with
so
many
people
streaming
past
and
along
questions
,
but
sculpting
in
front
of
a
crowd
at
conventions
is
great
because
it
allows
people
to
see
the
process
that
goes
into
what
I
do
[
...
]
it
also
can
serve
as
inspiration
to
other
to
pursue
their
own
artistic
endeavors

Lisa
Mancini
has
been
cosplaying
for
two
years
,
her
&quot;
passion
&quot;
for
the
hobby
&quot;
stemmed
through
my
love
for
Halloween
.
&quot;
She
typically
chooses
&quot;
to
portray
beloved
characters
from
childhood
or
strong
females
.
I
also
enjoy
a
good
gender
bent
cosplay
to
ensure
a
touch
of
uniqueness
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Mancini
told
Wikinews
after
the
event
that
the
best
part
of
cosplay
is
&quot;
bringing
a
character
to
life
.
&quot;
One
of
the
characters
she
took
on
this
year
was
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squirrel%20Girl">
Squirrel
Girl
</ref>
,
a
Marvel
Comics
character
.
Mancini
has
been
described
by
the
<hi rend="italic">
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily%20Hive">
Daily
Hive
</ref>
</hi>
as
a
&quot;
squirrel
whisperer
&quot;
,
for
the
close
affinity
some
of
the
animals
have
for
her
.

Stephanie
Chapman
has
knit
a
variety
of
knit
outfits
,
an
uncommon
technique
for
cosplay
.
Prompted
by
Ron
Perlman
's
visit
,
she
wore
a
costume
based
on
<hi rend="italic">
Hellboy
</hi>
character
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abe%20Sapien">
Abe
Sapien
</ref>
,
which
lacks
the
eyeholes
of
her
normal
masks
.
With
&quot;
Abe
,
I
wanted
to
go
for
accuracy
over
comfort
,
&quot;
Chapman
told
Wikinews
,
a
choice
leaving
her
largely
helpless
without
a
handler
.
The
costume
&quot;
is
very
warm
[
...
]
so
I
have
to
stay
hydrated
and
try
to
keep
as
calm
as
possible
.
It
's
just
really
hard
to
stay
calm
when
I
meet
someone
like
Ron
Perlman
&quot;
.
With
the
combination
of
excitement
and
&quot;
the
stress
I
'm
putting
on
my
body
&quot;
,
she
shared
that
she
was
prone
to
meltdown
in
suit
.
