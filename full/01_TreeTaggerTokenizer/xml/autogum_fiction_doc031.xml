KNIGHT-ERRANTRY
AS
A
TRADE
</head>
<p>
Sandy
and
I
were
on
the
road
again
,
next
morning
,
bright
and
early
.
It
was
so
good
to
open
up
one
's
lungs
and
take
in
whole
luscious
barrels-ful
of
the
blessed
God
's
untainted
,
dew-fashioned
,
woodland-scented
air
once
more
,
after
suffocating
body
and
mind
for
two
days
and
nights
in
the
moral
and
physical
stenches
of
that
intolerable
old
buzzard-roost
!
I
mean
,
for
me
:
of
course
the
place
was
all
right
and
agreeable
enough
for
Sandy
,
for
she
had
been
used
to
high
life
all
her
days
.
</p>
<p>
Poor
girl
,
her
jaws
had
had
a
wearisome
rest
now
for
a
while
,
and
I
was
expecting
to
get
the
consequences
.
I
was
right
;
but
she
had
stood
by
me
most
helpfully
in
the
castle
,
and
had
mightily
supported
and
reinforced
me
with
gigantic
foolishnesses
which
were
worth
more
for
the
occasion
than
wisdoms
double
their
size
;
so
I
thought
she
had
earned
a
right
to
work
her
mill
for
a
while
,
if
she
wanted
to
,
and
I
felt
not
a
pang
when
she
started
it
up
:
</p>
<p>
“
Now
turn
we
unto
Sir
Marhaus
that
rode
with
the
damsel
of
thirty
winter
of
age
southward
--
”
</p>
<p>
“
Are
you
going
to
see
if
you
can
work
up
another
half-stretch
on
the
trail
of
the
cowboys
,
Sandy
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Even
so
,
fair
my
lord
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Go
ahead
,
then
.
I
wo
n't
interrupt
this
time
,
if
I
can
help
it
.
Begin
over
again
;
start
fair
,
and
shake
out
all
your
reefs
,
and
I
will
load
my
pipe
and
give
good
attention
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Now
turn
we
unto
Sir
Marhaus
that
rode
with
the
damsel
of
thirty
winter
of
age
southward
.
And
so
they
came
into
a
deep
forest
,
and
by
fortune
they
were
nighted
,
and
rode
along
in
a
deep
way
,
and
at
the
last
they
came
into
a
courtelage
where
abode
the
duke
of
South
Marches
,
and
there
they
asked
harbour
.
And
on
the
morn
the
duke
sent
unto
Sir
Marhaus
,
and
bad
him
make
him
ready
.
And
so
Sir
Marhaus
arose
and
armed
him
,
and
there
was
a
mass
sung
afore
him
,
and
he
brake
his
fast
,
and
so
mounted
on
horseback
in
the
court
of
the
castle
,
there
they
should
do
the
battle
.
So
there
was
the
duke
already
on
horseback
,
clean
armed
,
and
his
six
sons
by
him
,
and
every
each
had
a
spear
in
his
hand
,
and
so
they
encountered
,
whereas
the
duke
and
his
two
sons
brake
their
spears
upon
him
,
but
Sir
Marhaus
held
up
his
spear
and
touched
none
of
them
.
Then
came
the
four
sons
by
couples
,
and
two
of
them
brake
their
spears
,
and
so
did
the
other
two
.
And
all
this
while
Sir
Marhaus
touched
them
not
.
Then
Sir
Marhaus
ran
to
the
duke
,
and
smote
him
with
his
spear
that
horse
and
man
fell
to
the
earth
.
And
so
he
served
his
sons
.
And
then
Sir
Marhaus
alight
down
,
and
bad
the
duke
yield
him
or
else
he
would
slay
him
.
And
then
some
of
his
sons
recovered
,
and
would
have
set
upon
Sir
Marhaus
.
Then
Sir
Marhaus
said
to
the
duke
,
Cease
thy
sons
,
or
else
I
will
do
the
uttermost
to
you
all
.
When
the
duke
saw
he
might
not
escape
the
death
,
he
cried
to
his
sons
,
and
charged
them
to
yield
them
to
Sir
Marhaus
.
And
they
kneeled
all
down
and
put
the
pommels
of
their
swords
to
the
knight
,
and
so
he
received
them
.
And
then
they
holp
up
their
father
,
and
so
by
their
common
assent
promised
unto
Sir
Marhaus
never
to
be
foes
unto
King
Arthur
,
and
thereupon
at
Whitsuntide
after
,
to
come
he
and
his
sons
,
and
put
them
in
the
king
's
grace
.

“
Even
so
standeth
the
history
,
fair
Sir
Boss
.
Now
ye
shall
wit
that
that
very
duke
and
his
six
sons
are
they
whom
but
few
days
past
you
also
did
overcome
and
send
to
Arthur
's
court
!
”
</p>
<p>
“
Why
,
Sandy
,
you
ca
n't
mean
it
!
”
</p>
<p>
“
An
I
speak
not
sooth
,
let
it
be
the
worse
for
me
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Well
,
well
,
well
,
--
now
who
would
ever
have
thought
it
?
One
whole
duke
and
six
dukelets
;
why
,
Sandy
,
it
was
an
elegant
haul
.
Knight-errantry
is
a
most
chuckle-headed
trade
,
and
it
is
tedious
hard
work
,
too
,
but
I
begin
to
see
that
there
<hi rend="italic">
is
</hi>
money
in
it
,
after
all
,
if
you
have
luck
.
Not
that
I
would
ever
engage
in
it
as
a
business
,
for
I
would
n't
.
No
sound
and
legitimate
business
can
be
established
on
a
basis
of
speculation
.
A
successful
whirl
in
the
knight-errantry
line
--
now
what
is
it
when
you
blow
away
the
nonsense
and
come
down
to
the
cold
facts
?
It
's
just
a
corner
in
pork
,
that
's
all
,
and
you
ca
n't
make
anything
else
out
of
it
.
You
're
rich
--
yes
,
--
suddenly
rich
--
for
about
a
day
,
maybe
a
week
;
then
somebody
corners
the
market
on
<hi rend="italic">
you
</hi>
,
and
down
goes
your
bucket-shop
;
ai
n't
that
so
,
Sandy
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Whethersoever
it
be
that
my
mind
miscarrieth
,
bewraying
simple
language
in
such
sort
that
the
words
do
seem
to
come
endlong
and
overthwart
--
”
</p>
<p>
“
There
's
no
use
in
beating
about
the
bush
and
trying
to
get
around
it
that
way
,
Sandy
,
it
's
<hi rend="italic">
so
</hi>
,
just
as
I
say
.
I
<hi rend="italic">
know
</hi>
it
's
so
.
And
,
moreover
,
when
you
come
right
down
to
the
bedrock
,
knight-errantry
is
<hi rend="italic">
worse
</hi>
than
pork
;
for
whatever
happens
,
the
pork
's
left
,
and
so
somebody
's
benefited
anyway
;
but
when
the
market
breaks
,
in
a
knight-errantry
whirl
,
and
every
knight
in
the
pool
passes
in
his
checks
,
what
have
you
got
for
assets
?
Just
a
rubbish-pile
of
battered
corpses
and
a
barrel
or
two
of
busted
hardware
.
Can
you
call
<hi rend="italic">
those
</hi>
assets
?
Give
me
pork
,
every
time
.
Am
I
right
?
