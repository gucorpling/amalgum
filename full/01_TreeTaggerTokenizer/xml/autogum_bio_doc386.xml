He

a
troop

in
the
Spanish
service
;
but
was
not
,
as
he
thought

sufficiently
rewarded

Since

Three
years
later
his
body
was
exhumed
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbeting">
gibbeted

by
order
of
the
states
.
His
heir
was
Edmund
Yorke
,
who
was
executed
at
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyburn">

in
1595
for
attempting
to
assassinate
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth_I">

Edmund
had
been
persuaded
by
his
uncle
's
associate
Sir
William
Stanley
,
and
Stanley
's
rather
mysterious
lieutenant
Jacques
de
Francesci
(
Captain
Jacques
)
,
that
the
assassination
would
be
a
meritorious
act
.
On
returning
to
England
he
quickly
fell
under
suspicion
,
due
perhaps
to
his
association
with
the
Irish
fencing
master
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_O'Collun">

.
They
were
both
arrested

along

Richard

and
all
three
were
convicted
of
treason
and
executed
