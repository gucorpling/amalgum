Introduction
</head>
<p>
The
use
of
plant
secondary
metabolites
as
natural
alternatives
to
antibiotic
growth
promoters
has
continued
to
elicit
great
interest
globally
.
Furthermore
,
supplementation
with
plant
secondary
metabolites
is
capable
of
improving
livestock
productivity
while
also
reducing
the
impact
of
livestock
production
on
the
environment
.
One
type
of
plant
secondary
metabolite
known
for
their
wide
application
in
animal
production
are
condensed
tannins
,
which
are
water-soluble
polyphenolic
compounds
of
high
molecular
weight
with
the
ability
to
modulate
rumen
fermentation
.
Past
research
has
revealed
that
condensed
tannins
can
bind
with
protein
in
feed
,
saliva
,
tissue
,
enzymes
,
and
microbes
.
This
results
in
reduced
rumen
protein
degradability
,
and
reduced
urinary
nitrogen
loss
.
Other
applications
of
CTs
include
the
control
of
bloat
and
intestinal
parasites
in
ruminants
,
as
well
as
a
reduction
in
enteric
methane
emissions
.
Condensed
tannins
exhibit
their
anti-methanogenic
activity
directly
by
inhibiting
the
growth
of
methanogens
through
the
tanning
action
of
their
functional
proteins
,
resulting
in
bacteriostatic
and
bactericidal
effects
.
</p>
<p>
However
,
moderate
to
high
concentrations
of
dietary
CT
,
which
proved
consistently
effective
in
methane
reduction
,
may
also
significantly
depress
dry
matter
intake
and
nutrient
digestibility
depending
on
the
concentration
and
biological
activity
of
the
tannin
.
The
astringency
of
tannins
is
particularly
noted
for
the
negative
responses
in
feed
intake
observed
in
ruminants
consuming
high
tannin
concentrations
.
Equally
,
a
compromise
on
intake
and
nutrient
digestibility
,
if
not
carefully
balanced
,
may
impose
a
serious
challenge
on
production
performance
.
Beyond
the
rumen
,
free
CT
may
also
re-bind
to
dietary
protein
,
digestive
enzymes
,
or
membrane
proteins
of
mucosal
cells
,
thereby
reducing
nutrient
absorption
.
Recent
studies
have
shown
that
encapsulation
may
be
used
to
mask
or
reduce
the
negative
effects
associated
with
tannins
and
other
bioactive
compounds
in
the
food
or
feed
industry
,
with
additional
tendency
to
control
the
release
of
the
active
ingredient
at
the
required
site
for
optimum
effectiveness
.
</p>
<p>
Thus
,
encapsulation
of
tannin
extract
has
the
potential
to
mask
the
astringency
by
restricting
the
biological
activity
of
tannins
in
the
mouth
and
provide
a
sustained
release
in
the
rumen
,
guaranteeing
the
modulation
of
microbial
fermentation
,
and
,
therefore
,
the
tannin
effect
is
limited
to
the
rumen
and
post-rumen
environment
.
According
to
Mamvura
et
al.
,
the
productivity
of
bioactive
compounds
may
be
enhanced
when
they
are
fully
available
at
the
precise
location
where
they
are
required
such
as
in
the
rumen
.
It
is
hypothesised
that
encapsulated
<hi rend="italic">
Acacia
</hi>
tannin
extract
(
ATE
)
will
confine
the
effect
of
tannin
to
the
rumen
,
resulting
in
improved
anti-methanogenic
effect
without
an
associated
depression
in
feed
intake
.
A
gradual
release
of
tannin
in
the
rumen
may
equally
ensure
the
minimal
effect
of
tannin
on
nutrient
absorption
in
the
intestine
.
</p>
<p>
The
aim
of
this
study
,
therefore
,
was
to
determine
if
encapsulating
<hi rend="italic">
Acacia
mearnsii
</hi>
tannin
extract
in
a
lipid
matrix
will
favourably
mask
the
bitter
taste
of
tannin
and
possibly
slow
down
its
release
in
the
rumen
without
reducing
its
antimethanogenic
potency
.
By
this
,
the
anticipated
utilisation
of
encapsulated
CT
extract
in
methane
reduction
can
be
achieved
without
the
associated
negative
effects
on
dry
matter
intake
,
nutrient
digestibility
and
N-balance
,
using
South
Africa
Mutton
Merino
wethers
as
a
model
animal
.
