<p>
I
will
change
this
country
’s
self-image
from
that
of
THE
SUPER
POWER/
WORLD
LEADER
to
that
of
a
member
of
the
global
community
.
I
will
cut
our
military
budget
by
at
least
half
.
</p>
<p>
We
need
to
stop
supporting
dictators
.
On
the
nuclear
issue
,
we
need
to
get
rid
of
double
standards
.
We
need
to
treat
all
nations
with
the
same
expectations
,
be
it
Pakistan
,
Israel
,
France
,
the
U.S.
,
Iran
,
etc.
In
other
words
,
my
policies
would
be
even-handed
.
I
will
join
the
rest
of
the
world
in
pressuring
Israel
to
live
up
to
treaties
,
and
to
dismantle
its
nuclear
arms
.
I
will
use
the
“
special
relationship
”
between
Israel
and
the
U.S.
to
motivate
Israel
to
do
this
.
</p>
<p>
I
will
work
for
the
global
shutting
down
of
all
nuclear
reactors
and
dismantling
of
all
nuclear
[
and
biological
and
chemical
]
weapons
.
I
will
start
this
in
the
U.S.
All
countries
should
be
expected
to
live
under
the
same
rules
…
.
not
one
set
for
the
“
super
powers
”
and
another
for
the
“
developing
”
nations
like
Iran
.
I
will
push
for
a
global
development
of
clean
,
safe
energy
sources
as
alternatives
to
nuclear
power
.
</p>
<p>
We
have
been
robbed
during
the
recent
years
of
many
of
our
rights
and
freedoms
.
I
will
have
repealing
parties
in
the
White
House
,
scrapping
all
the
rules
and
policies
in
every
department
and
agency
that
infringe
on
our
rights
,
freedoms
,
privacy
,
health
and
welfare
.
We
will
have
similar
parties
in
both
houses
of
Congress
to
repeal
bad
laws
such
as
the
so-called
Patriot
Act
.
We
will
return
to
the
common
English
language
in
which
“
torture
”
means
torture
.
I
will
declassify
documents
that
were
classified
to
hide
questionable
actions
rather
than
to
protect
the
real
national
interests
.
I
will
push
the
Justice
Department
to
investigate
the
war
on
The
Left
by
the
F.B.I.
since
the
60
’s
.
Terrorism
is
a
criminal
matter
.
It
should
be
dealt
with
as
such
,
not
as
a
war
.
We
should
n’t
abandon
our
principles
,
freedoms
,
rights
,
The
Constitution
and
The
Bills
of
Rights
to
live
in
fear
.
Whenever
there
is
an
attempt
to
fudge
the
limits
of
power
for
convenience
of
“
safety
,
”
we
the
people
get
screwed
.
</p>
<p>
I
’ll
do
away
with
welfare
,
medicare
and
social
security
.
Instead
,
every
American
will
receive
a
minimum
income
of
$
1,000
a
month
.
This
amount
will
be
tied
to
the
cost
of
living
and
will
not
be
taxable
.
</p>
<p>
We
will
have
universal
prenatal-to-the-grave
health
care
and
universal
free
education
with
equal
access
.
</p>
<p>
The
universal
health
care
would
include
all
medicine
,
medical
equipment
and
supplies
,
long-term
care
,
personal
attendants
,
etc.
There
will
be
no
pre-authorization
ritual
.
So
your
doctor
will
be
free
to
prescribe
whatever
you
need
.
There
may
be
a
review
of
treatment
afterward
if
there
are
any
questions
.
Everybody
will
have
the
same
care
as
the
President
now
has
.
Preventative
medicine
will
be
stressed
and
the
so-called
alternative
medicine
will
be
included
.
You
will
notice
that
health
insurance
companies
are
not
in
this
picture
!
