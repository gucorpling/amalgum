Hi
,
I
'm
not
sure
if
this
is
the
right
place
to
ask
this
,
but
in
about
two
weeks
time
I
'm
involved
in
a
costume
party
.
My
group
is
doing
the
<ref target="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/lazy-town4817/images/2/26/Nick_Jr._LazyTown_Characters_Cast_Main.png/revision/latest?cb=20161230042303">
characters
</ref>
from
<ref target="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/LazyTown">
Lazy
Town
</ref>
,
and
I
've
been
allocated

Robbie
Rotten
</ref>
.
I
'm
based
in
the
UK
,
and
I
've
tried
looking
around
online
for
Robbie
Rotten
costumes
.
The
only
ones
I
've
been
able
to
find
are
either
<ref target="https://www.etsy.com/ie/listing/552807631/robbie-rotten-inspired-cosplay-lazy-town">
way
too
expensive
(
£500
)
</ref>
,
or
are

shipped
from
China
,
and
will
take
a
month
or
two
to
get
here
</ref>
.
I
do
n't
think
I
'll
be
able
to
find
one
to
order
,
so
I
've
decided
to
make
one
myself
from
various
items
of
clothing
,
though
I
'm
not
really
sure
how
to
go
about
doing
it
-
I
'm
not
really
sure
what
to
look
for
and
where
to
look
for
it
.
I
was
wondering
if
I
could
tap
into
this
subreddit
's
collective
expertise
for
ideas
,
options
and
the
items
of
clothing
to
buy
-
I
've
never
done
anything
similar
to
this
before
.
So
far
the
things
I
've
been
able
to
gather
together
are
:
<hi rend="bold">
Long-sleeved
navy
lycra
,
which
is
his
'
underclothing
'
.
</hi>
White
cuffs
(
done
with
card
)
.
<hi rend="bold">
White
Socks
.
</hi>
Black
Shoes
.
<hi rend="bold">
A
black
belt
.
</hi>
A
large
quantity
of
gel
for
the
hair
.
*
A
pocket
chain
.
Which
pretty
much
leaves
his
distinctive
striped
vest
and
striped
trousers
,
which
I
've
so
far
been
unable
to
find
.
If
it
matters
,
I
'm
6
'
6
&quot;
and
pretty
skinny
(
which
might
have
limitations
on
the
stuff
available
?
)
.
(
Oh
,
another
limiting
factor
is
that
I
'm
not
allowed
to
spend
a
total
of
more
than
£35
on
the
costume
)
.
Thank
you
very
much
for
any
help
you
can
give
me
!

First
advice
I
would
say
is
check
out
your
local
donation
stores
.
There
is
a
slight
chance
you
might
be
able
to
find
exactly
what
you
are
looking
for
there
.
</p>
<p>
If
you
have
no
luck
there
,
I
would
suggest
looking
up
sewing
techniques
on
youtube
and
making
it
all
from
scratch
.
I
know
the
vest
and
trousers
are
probably
going
to
be
the
most
important
things
but
given
your
time
and
monetary
constraints
,
this
might
be
your
best
option
.
</p>
<p>
Oh
and
word
of
advice
:
good
enough
is
good
enough
.
You
do
n't
have
to
aim
for
100
%
accuracy
.
