Introduction

<p>
Manifested
as
irregular
electron
density
or
total
electron
content
(
TEC
)
variations
,
the
equatorial
plasma
bubbles
(
EPBs
)
are
a
phenomenon
related
to
the
collisional
Rayleigh-Taylor
instability
(
RTI
)
mechanisms
.
Although
the
onset
condition
remains
unclear
,
the
RTI
is
believed
to
occur
after
sunset
at
low
latitudes
near
magnetic
equator
and
generates
plasma
depletions
which
grow
up
from
the
bottom
side
to
the
upper
F
layer
.
While
moving
upward
,
EPBs
extend
along
the
magnetic
flux
tube
to
higher
latitudes
and
often
reach
the
equatorial
ionization
anomaly
crest
.
These
plasma
irregularities
disturb
radio
communication
and
navigation
by
causing
phase
and
amplitude
scintillations
or
even
signal
loss
,
which
is
an
important
issue
for
space
weather
.
Furthermore
,
the
study
of
the
RTI
and
EPBs
is
relevant
to
progress
in
understanding
and
modeling
of
ionospheric
plasma
physics
.
</p>
<p>
The
study
of
EPBs
has
gone
a
long
way
since
it
was
first
recorded
as
equatorial
spread
F
(
ESF
)
with
ionosonde
.
The
term
EPBs
was
proposed
when
ground-based
incoherent
scatter
radar
detected
low-density
irregularities
rising
from
the
bottom
side
of
F
layer
to
an
altitude
far
beyond
the
ionospheric
peak
.
These
irregularities
were
directly
confirmed
by
AE-C
satellite
in-situ
measurements
to
be
regions
with
an
abrupt
decrease
of
electron
density
by
two
orders
of
magnitude
with
tens
of
kilometers
scale
.
The
optical
imaging
techniques
probed
a
two-dimensional
structure
of
the
plasma
bubble
.
Effects
of
scintillations
on
radio
waves
from
the
stars
or
satellites
have
been
also
used
to
investigate
the
behavior
of
EPBs
.
TEC
fluctuation
measured
with
ground-based
Global
Navigation
Satellite
System
(
GNSS
)
networks
can
capture
occurrence
and
evolution
of
EPBs
and
reveal
their
longitudinal
occurrence
characteristics
as
well
.
Spaceborne
GNSS
radio
occultation
of
Constellation
Observing
System
for
Meteorology
,
Ionosphere
,
and
Climate
(
COSMIC
)
complements
the
ground-based
observations
of
EPBs
with
its
global
coverage
.
Moreover
,
it
is
crucial
to
obtain
the
vertical
structure
of
the
ionosphere
.
For
this
reason
,
basing
on
GNSS
and
radio
occultation
measurements
,
a
three-dimensional
morphology
of
EPBs
was
deduced
and
a
tomography
method
was
attempted
to
reconstruct
EPBs
in
a
Brazilian
sector
.
</p>
<p>
Recent
researches
on
RTI
and
EPBs
have
been
driven
mostly
by
space
weather
concerns
to
identify
the
key
environmental
parameters
leading
to
the
presence
of
EPBs
.
Comprehensive
observation
can
reveal
the
structure
and
evolution
of
EPBs
that
are
connected
with
their
initial
conditions
.
This
paper
aims
to
investigate
the
characteristics
of
EPBs
in
space-
and
ground-based
GNSS
data
.
The
scintillation
index
S4
and
electron
density
of
the
ionosphere
,
profiled
by
spaceborne
GNSS
radio
occultation
of
COSMIC
,
can
provide
new
information
on
their
vertical
structure
,
occurrence
,
and
evolution
process
of
EPBs
.
Together
with
ground-based
observation
,
three-dimensional
aspects
of
EPBs
can
be
inspected
.
We
focus
on
low
latitude
regions
at
longitude
~110
Â°E
in
south
China
in
March
2014
when
EPBs
occurred
every
day
of
the
month
,
and
therefore
a
common
underlying
cause
to
seed
the
RTI
can
be
examined
.
We
use
GNSS
radio
occultation
of
COSMIC
to
derive
the
vertical
structure
of
EPBs
and
relate
their
characteristics
with
ground-based
GNSS
measurements
in
China
.
Global
distribution
of
irregularities
occurrence
is
also
presented
.
Section
2
introduces
data
and
analysis
methods
.
Our
results
are
described
in
Section
3
,
where
TEC
fluctuation
and
occurrence
from
ground-based
GNSS
observation
are
displayed
in
Section
3.1
,
as
well
as
temporal
variations
of
electron
density
and
EPBs
occurrence
profiles
,
global
occurrence
of
scintillations
caused
by
EPBs
,
and
sporadic
E
(
Es
)
from
COSMIC
are
shown
in
Section
3.2
.
Section
4
presents
a
discussion
of
a
comprehensive
view
of
EPBs
by
combining
both
ground-based
and
space-based
observations
and
referencing
previous
research
findings
.
The
conclusions
are
drawn
in
Section
5
.
