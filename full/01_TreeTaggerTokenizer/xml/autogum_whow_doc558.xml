Measure
a
Dog
for
a
Crate
</head>
<p>
Crates
can
be
a
great
tool
for
house
training
puppies
,
giving
your
dog
a
safe
space
,
or
even
help
with
separation
anxiety
.
Your
dog
's
crate
should
be
a
home
within
a
home
,
not
a
prison
,
and
finding
the
right
size
is
an
important
factor
in
making
it
a
comfortable
space
.
To
find
the
perfect
crate
for
your
pup
,
you
just
need
their
height
,
length
,
and
weight
.
If
you
have
a
quickly
growing
puppy
,
look
for
an
adjustable
crate
so
that
you
do
n't
need
to
buy
a
new
one
every
few
months
.

Steps

<head>
Taking
Your
Dog
's
Measurements
</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Mark
your
dog
's
measurements
on
a
wall
.
You
can
more
clearly
see
exactly
how
long
and
tall
your
dog
is
by
having
them
stand
against
a
wall
.
Mark
the
wall
with
something
temporary
like
chalk
or
pencil
.
Then
,
measure
the
marks
with
a
measuring
tape
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Bribe
your
dog
to
stand
still
using
a
treat
,
if
you
can
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Use
a
measuring
tape
to
find
your
dog
's
length
from
nose
to
tail
.
To
get
the
most
accurate
measurement
,
have
your
dog
stand
on
all
4
paws
.
Measure
from
the
tip
of
the
nose
to
the
base
of
the
tail
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
If
you
include
the
entire
length
of
your
dog
's
tail
,
the
crate
will
be
too
big
.
</item>
<item>
If
your
dog
has
a
very
thick
,
long
tail
,
include
some
extra
length
if
you
want
.
When
your
dog
wags
,
the
tail
will
hit
the
crate
,
so
a
little
extra
length
will
help
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Find
out
how
tall
your
dog
is
sitting
down
.
Measure
from
the
floor
to
the
highest
point
of
your
dog
's
head
.
If
your
dog
has
stiff
ears
that
stand
up
,
include
them
in
your
measurement
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Use
a
soft
measuring
tape
to
more
easily
find
your
dog
's
height
while
sitting
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Weigh
your
dog
.
If
you
will
ever
need
to
carry
your
dog
in
the
crate
,
make
sure
that
your
dog
is
under
the
maximum
weight
listed
for
the
crate
.
Otherwise
,
you
might
damage
or
even
break
the
crate
if
you
carry
your
dog
inside
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Alternatively
,
you
can
opt
to
have
separate
crates
for
home
and
travel
.

Finding
the
Right
Crate
</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Add
to
your
dog
's
length
and
height
.
The
perfect
crate
will
give
your
dog
enough
room
to
stand
up
,
turn
around
,
sit
down
,
and
lie
on
their
side
.
To
make
sure
the
crate
is
big
enough
,
add
a
few
inches
to
both
the
height
and
the
length
:
<list type="unordered">
<item>
For
small
dog
breeds
,
add
to
the
height
and
length
measurements
.
</item>
<item>
For
large
dog
breeds
,
add
to
the
height
and
length
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Go
for
a
plastic
crate
if
your
dog
is
easily
distracted
.
Plastic
crates
have
less
visibility
than
wire
or
metal
crates
.
This
can
give
some
dogs
a
sense
of
security
,
especially
when
traveling
.
Plastic
crates
are
also
easy
to
clean
and
provide
some
insulation
in
cold
climates
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
It
's
best
to
avoid
plastic
crates
if
your
dog
gets
stressed
when
they
ca
n't
see
their
surroundings
,
or
if
you
live
in
a
very
hot
climate
.
</item>
<item>
Plastic
crates
are
also
better
for
small
dogs
than
metal
crates
.
</item>
<item>
If
you
have
a
larger
dog
,
you
can
make
it
feel
more
secure
by
draping
a
heavy
blanket
over
3
sides
of
the
crate
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Opt
for
a
metal
crate
for
puppies
and
dogs
that
like
to
see
their
surroundings
.
Metal
crates
often
come
with
a
panel
that
lets
you
adjust
the
size
of
the
inside
.
They
are
also
easy
to
clean
and
affordable
.
You
may
need
to
find
a
waterproof
liner
to
help
the
crate
contain
any
accidents
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Strong
,
excited
puppies
can
bend
cheap
wire
crates
with
their
teeth
.
Look
for
a
reinforced
steel
crate
if
you
are
worried
about
your
puppy
escaping
.
</item>
<item>
Line
the
crate
with
a
cozy
blanket
or
bed
to
make
it
more
comfortable
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Use
a
soft-sided
crate
for
travel
.
Soft-sided
crates
are
lightweight
and
easy
to
transport
.
They
are
also
easy
to
fold
down
and
store
.
A
soft-sided
crate
is
best
for
a
small
,
well-trained
dog
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Soft-sided
crates
are
not
very
durable
and
can
be
difficult
to
keep
clean
.
They
're
best
to
use
for
travel
only
.
</item>
<item>
This
type
of
crate
is
also
only
suitable
for
a
dog
that
wo
nâ€™t
chew
on
the
fabric
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Buy
a
resizable
crate
to
save
money
while
your
puppy
is
growing
.
A
resizable
crate
can
&quot;
grow
&quot;
with
your
puppy
as
they
get
older
.
These
crates
come
with
a
divider
panel
that
you
can
use
to
make
the
main
area
of
the
crate
smaller
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Make
sure
that
the
largest
size
of
the
crate
will
be
big
enough
when
your
dog
is
fully
grown
.
</item>
<item>
This
is
most
useful
for
large
breeds
that
grow
quickly
.
Some
breeds
need
an
bigger
size
every
3
months
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Use
a
crate
on
the
smaller
side
to
house
train
your
puppy
.
Your
puppy
needs
to
be
able
to
sit
,
lie
,
and
turn
comfortably
in
the
crate
.
However
,
do
n't
get
a
crate
so
large
that
your
puppy
can
soil
one
side
of
it
and
lie
on
the
other
side
.
If
you
are
between
two
sizes
,
go
for
the
smaller
one
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
A
too-large
puppy
crate
can
derail
house
training
and
make
it
more
difficult
for
you
to
teach
your
dog
where
to
potty
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Adjust
if
your
dog
does
n't
have
enough
space
.
If
you
notice
that
your
dog
ca
n't
comfortably
lie
down
on
their
side
with
their
legs
outstretched
,
it
's
time
for
a
bigger
crate
.
If
you
have
an
adjustable
crate
,
simply
size
up
.
If
not
,
measure
your
dog
's
length
and
height
and
buy
a
larger
crate
according
to
the
new
measurements
.
