Find
Your
Life
's
Ambition
</head>
<p>
There
's
a
saying
that
no
man
is
perfect
.
Eventually
,
no
person
can
do
his
very
best
in
spite
of
his
full
efforts
.
But
this
ca
n't
be
the
basis
for
life
.
As
a
matter
of
fact
,
if
a
person
tries
to
spend
his
life
owing
to
a
realistic
and
sensible
mindset
then
he
may
suddenly
be
able
to
excel
in
the
chosen
spheres
.
But
in
order
to
make
this
thing
possible
,
he
must
firstly
understand
the
essential
meaning
of
life
and
as
such
must
be
thoroughly
acquainted
with
the
basics
.
Here
are
a
few
ways
to
spend
life
in
its
perfect
way
and
to
make
the
same
really
count
and
really
matter
.

<list type="ordered">
<item>
First
of
all
,
discover
yourself
.
You
ca
n't
be
perfect
unless
you
truly
know
who
you
really
are
.
Even
belief
in
God
implies
that
we
certainly
have
a
role
for
which
we
are
sent
here
on
the
earth
.
Obviously
,
if
you
can
let
yourself
realize
the
same
,
your
chances
to
excel
would
be
always
maximum
.
But
for
this
,
you
must
give
yourself
enough
time
so
as
to
know
the
person
budding
inside
you
.
Be
careful
as
many
people
do
n't
give
importance
to
this
first
important
step
of
self-discovery
.

<item>
As
soon
as
you
have
found
your
role
in
life
,
it
is
no
difficult
to
find
your
place
in
this
world
.
This
marks
the
beginning
of
your
success
.
You
may
either
opt
to
excel
in
multiple
arts
or
you
may
even
consider
any
one
of
them
to
be
useful
,
as
the
case
may
be
.
Soon
you
will
come
to
know
about
your
strong
holds
and
also
your
grey
areas
.
Consequently
,
you
will
be
soon
setting
a
desired
destination
for
yourself
.

<item>
Once
you
have
confirmed
your
ambition
in
life
,
the
only
thing
which
will
remain
is
how
far
you
can
pursue
it
and
this
will
matter
the
most
.
Then
as
time
progresses
,
there
wo
n't
be
much
to
bother
you
and
you
may
surely
keep
on
becoming
more
and
more
mature
in
your
own
field
.
For
your
sake
,
always
remember
that
not
our
actions
but
our
abilities
need
to
be
great
and
always
value
your
work
in
terms
of
efforts
invested
and
not
merely
in
terms
of
fame
earned
.

Tips

<list type="unordered">
<item>
Believe
yourself
.
Avoid
trying
with
half-hearted
measures
.
</item>
<item>
Be
virtuous
.
In
actual
practice
,
our
virtues
make
us
the
desired
human
being
and
not
just
our
conduct
.
</item>
<item>
Do
n't
get
disappointed
from
ups
and
downs
.
Just
consider
them
to
be
a
part
of
life
.

Warnings

<list type="unordered">
<item>
Never
ever
try
to
overload
yourself
.
You
might
be
happy
with
your
current
position
but
by
attempting
to
compare
yourself
with
somebody
else
,
you
may
unfortunately
lose
your
path
in
life
.
It
is
useful
to
remember
that
there
is
nothing
so
good
as
being
happy
and
perhaps
,
this
accounts
for
one
of
the
most
acceptable
terms
of
perfect
living
.
