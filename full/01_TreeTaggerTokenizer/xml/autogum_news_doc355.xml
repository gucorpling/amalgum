Tuesday
was
a
tumultuous
day
in
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khadr%20family">
Khadr
household
</ref>
as
they
desperately
awaited
to
hear
whether
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdullah%20Khadr">
Abdullah
</ref>
,
the
Canadian
family
's
oldest
son
,
would
be
released
on
bail
after
nearly
four
years
of
detention
awaiting
trial
in
the
United
States
for
helping
Afghan
militants
procure
weapons
.
<p>
&quot;
We
could
n't
help
but
be
a
little
hopeful
,
&quot;
his
older
sister
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaynab%20Khadr">
Zaynab
</ref>
remarked
,
though
Khadr
himself
remained
more
optimistic
and
encouraged
his
family
to
use
their
second
weekly
visit
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto%20West%20Detention%20Centre">
Toronto
West
Detention
Centre
</ref>
later
that
day
,
as
a
sign
of
faith
that
the
courts
would
soon
reunite
the
fractured
family
.
But
when
the
family
returned
home
from
their
second
visit
,
there
was
a
crushing
message
from
his
lawyers
,
&quot;
Abdullah
did
n't
make
bail
&quot;
.
</p>
<p>
The
family
feels
frustrated
and
says
that
the
court
's
ruling
that
Khadr
still
represents
a
serious
flight
risk
is
unfair
.
&quot;
None
of
us
have
every
tried
to
leave
the
country
&quot;
,
Zaynab
sighs
,
pointing
to
Abdullah
's
co-operation
with
Canadian
authorities
since
the
very
beginning
.
</p>
<p>
Although
his
lawyers
proposed
a
&quot;
stringent
supervision
plan
&quot;
that
would
have
seen
the
Ottawa-born
Khadr
living
with
his
grandparents
and
fitted
with
an
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankle%20monitor">
electronic
ankle-bracelet
</ref>
to
track
his
whereabouts
,
the
ruling
released
late
Tuesday
confirmed
that
Mr.
Justice
Gary
Trotter
was
not
convinced
that
Khadr
would
remain
in
Canada
if
released
back
into
the
community
.
</p>
<figure rend="Zaynab filming3.png">

The
ruling
echoes
a
similar
finding
made
in
2005
,
when
Khadr
first
applied
to
be
released
pending
the
outcome
of
his
extradition
hearing
to
the
United
States
,
where
he
faces
federal
conspiracy
charges
.
<p>
Khadr
's
lawyers
appeared
successful
in
allaying
earlier
concerns
about
the
insufficient
ankle
bracelet
that
would
have
tracked
Khadr
's
movements
in
2005
,
bringing
the
owner
of
Trace
Canada
,
Len
Beagley
,
to
testify
that
&quot;
tremendous
developments
&quot;
had
been
made
since
the
courts
last
heard
Khadr
's
plea
for
bail
in
2005
.
However
,
Trotter
seemed
unconvinced
that
ankle-bracelets
were
an
&quot;
accepted
way
of
monitoring
individuals
&quot;
,
and
agreed
with
Crown
arguments
that
such
devices
required
&quot;
co-operation
from
the
subject
&quot;
.
</p>
<p>
Fatmah
and
Mohammad
Elsamnah
again
offered
their
$
300,000
Toronto
home
as
surety
for
Khadr
's
behaviour
if
released
on
bail
.
However
,
they
were
judged
unacceptable
guardians
for
their
grandson
,
in
part
due
to
Mohammad
's
stuttered
and
confused
responses
to
questions
from
the
Crown
,
and
his
advanced
memory
loss
.
</p>
<p>
Khadr
's
lawyers
chose
to
focus
on
the
recent
community
support
shown
at
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salaheddin%20Islamic%20Centre">
Salaheddin
Islamic
Centre
</ref>
,
where
his
family
prays
.
In
addition
to
adding
$
50,000
in
collected
donations
as
assurance
that
the
community
would
keep
a
close
eye
on
Khadr
,
the
Board
of
Directors
agreed
to
pay
the
costs
associated
with
the
most
advanced
system
of
monitoring
ankle-bracelet
for
Khadr
.
The
manager
of
the
Islamic
Centre
also
offered
to
employ
the
27-year
old
Khadr
,
driving
him
to
and
from
work
each
day
.
Crown
lawyers
Matthew
Sullivan
and
Howard
Piafsky
challenged
the
mosque
's
credibility
however
,
asking
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal%20Canadian%20Mounted%20Police">
RCMP
</ref>
officer
Tarek
Mokdad
to
describe
the
number
of
worshippers
who
were
later
accused
of
militant
action
.
</p>
<p>
Trotter
dismissed
claims
that
the
mosque
was
tied
to
terrorism
,
but
said
the
donations
from
worshippers
were
unacceptable
since
they
gave
the
money
without
expecting
to
see
it
returned
to
them
,
regardless
of
Khadr
's
behaviour
.
</p>
<p>
The
last
to
find
out
about
his
fate
,
Abdullah
was
n't
told
the
outcome
of
the
hearing
until
he
phoned
his
family
Wednesday
evening
.
