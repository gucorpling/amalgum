I
was
reading
the
January
2009
article
<ref target="http://starbeacon.com/obitcorrection/x343696723/In-the-2008-presidential-campaign-it-was-Joe-the-Plumber-In-2012-it-s-going-to-be-Joe-the-Painter">
In
the
2008
presidential
campaign
,
it
was
Joe
the
Plumber
.
In
2012
,
it
’s
going
to
be
Joe
the
Painter
</ref>
from
the
<hi rend="italic">
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star%20Beacon">

Beacon

</hi>
,
and
it
says
that
you
're
&quot;
a
former
print
journalist
and
addictions
counselor
who
switched
to
house
painting
when
he
felt
guided
to
run
for
president
.
&quot;
Why
did
you
feel
guided
to
run
for
president
?

Ok
,
‘
Joe
the
painter
’
…
While
the
Star
Beacon
article
was
done
quite
well
as
a
whole
,
the
wording
in
this
part
about
‘
the
presidency
and
house
painting
’
is
a
bit
too
abbreviated
,
and
a
bit
too
disjointed
.
The
more
accurate
version
is
…
I
have
a
degree
in
journalism
from
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling%20Green%20State%20University">
Bowling
Green
State
University
</ref>
and
have
worked
for
several
intermediate
sized
newspapers
in
Ohio
.
A
ways
into
this
,
I
changed
professions
and
became
a
licensed
chemical
dependency
counselor
who
started
one
of
the
first
outpatient
treatment
programs
in
the
Midwest
for
people
who
were
raised
in
addictive/dysfunctional
families
.
(
As
an
aside
,
during
Campaign
2000
,
I
told
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS%20News">
CBS
News
</ref>
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monterey,%20California">
Monterey
</ref>
,
that
:
“
To
heal
the
country
,
we
have
to
heal
the
family
.
”
After
working
in
the
chemical
dependency
field
for
about
eight
years
,
I
felt
a
spiritual
prompting
–
as
other
people
at
times
feel
spiritual
promptings
to
do
any
number
of
things
–
to
leave
this
profession
and
go
out
on
the
road
to
look
for
people
trying
to
make
a
difference
when
it
came
to
things
like
healing
the
family
,
saving
the
environment
,
helping
the
poor
,
creating
peace
...
I
felt
compelled
to
gather
these
stories
,
using
my
journalism
background
,
then
share
them
with
others
–
with
the
hopes
of
planting
“
seeds
of
change
.
”
After
a
long
,
considered
discernment
process
,
I
decided
to
go
on
the
road
and
left
Cleveland
,
in
1990
.
This
was
the
start
of
an
eight-year
research
period
where
I
logged
close
to
100,000
miles
.
What
I
learned
was
a
lot
of
tremendously
creative
,
common
sense
solutions
to
practically
all
the
issues
of
our
day
.
Armed
with
this
,
I
started
to
running
for
president
in
1999
,
and
have
been
doing
it
ever
since
(
four
successive
election
cycles
)
.
In
each
newspaper
interview
,
each
radio
show
,
each
speech
...
I
share
parts
of
what
I
researched
with
the
hopes
people
will
try
some
of
it
in
their
own
town
,
and
who
knows
how
far
out
it
will
ripple
from
there
.
(
I
found
that
running
for
president
is
a
great
way
to
get
a
message
out
.
And
yes
,
I
am
indeed
trying
to
win
as
well
.
Then
I
could
get
the
information
out
a
lot
quicker
,
and
further
.
)
Now
as
far
as
the
house
painting
,
because
I
'm
on
the
road
some
six
to
eight
months
a
year
campaigning
,
it
's
logistically
quite
hard
to
hold
down
a
counseling
or
journalism
job
.
So
,
instead
,
I
do
some
part-time
house
painting
to
make
ends
meet
.
And
thus
,
“
Joe
the
painter
.
”
Note
:
As
an
example
,
in
the
heart
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo,%20New%20York">
Buffalo
</ref>
,
I
interviewed
Dr.
Myron
Glick
who
felt
his
own
'
spiritual
prompting
'
to
move
his
family
to
inner
city
Buffalo
and
start
the
Jericho
Road
Health
Clinic
.
He
uses
a
minimal
sliding
fee
scale
and
has
seen
people
from
at
least
50
different
countries
(
Buffalo
is
a
port
city
)
.
Why
?
Because
he
's
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity">
Christian
</ref>
,
he
told
me
,
and
it
is
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus">
Jesus
Christ
</ref>
'
edict
that
we
help
the
poor
.
I
have
shared
Dr.
Glick
's
story
all
over
the
country
,
with
the
hopes
of
inspiring
other
doctors
to
consider
doing
some
version
of
the
same
.
And
each
time
that
happens
,
I
get
a
component
of
our
healthcare
bill
passed
–
and
another
little
kid
living
below
the
poverty
line
gets
the
medical
help
they
might
have
otherwise
not
gotten
.
