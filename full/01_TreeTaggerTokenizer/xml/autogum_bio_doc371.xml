he

Cogua
was
considered
the

town

all

In

,
De
Aguado
moved
to
Bogotá
,
and
became
a

minister
provincial

of
the
local
Franciscan
Province

In

,
De

was
sent
by
the
Province
on

mission
to
Spain
to
answer
charges
that
the

monks
were
greedy
and
abusive

De
Aguado
tried
unsuccessfully
to
secure
publication
over
a
number
of
years
.
A
series
of
bureaucratic
hurdles
around
censorship
were
complicated
by
a
change
in
the
rules
,
invalidating
the
royal
licence
to
print
which
de
Aguado
obtained
in
1581
,
while
a
second
licence
in
1582
was
complicated
by
a
new
requirement
to
have
the
printed
copy
checked
against
the
original
manuscript
signed
off
by
the
king
's
secretary
.
Financial
difficulties
also
played
a
role
,
but
a
definitive
reason
for
publication
failing
to
materialise
is
not
known
.
A
planned
Part
III
appears
to
have
been
abandoned
,
possibly
in
frustration
at
the
difficulties
with
publication
,
with
the
witness
statements
that
would
have
been
the
source
material
left
in
Spain
on
his
return
to
Bogotá
in
1583
.

After

death
,
his
work
was
used
directly
and
indirectly
by
other
authors
,
notably
by
Fray
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Simón">

who
appears
to
have
had
access

The

in

late
eighteenth

by
the
historian
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Bautista_Muñoz">

the

and
it

consulted
by
