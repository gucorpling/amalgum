Abraham
ben
Elijah
of
Vilna
</hi>
was
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jew">
Jewish
</ref>
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talmud">
Talmudist
</ref>
who
lived
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuania">
Lithuania
</ref>
.
There
is
some
debate
as
to
when
he
was
born
.
Some
place
his
birth
as
early
as
1749
,
but
more
recent
scholarship
suggests
he
was
actually
born
in
1766
.
He
was
born
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilna">
Vilna
</ref>
and
died
there
on
December
14
,
1808
.
He
was
the
son
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilna_Gaon">
Elijah
,
the
Vilna
Gaon
</ref>
,
the
most
famous
Talmudist
of
modern
times
.
He
was
educated
under
the
supervision
of
his
father
,
who
was
famous
both
for
his
opposition
to
both
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasidic_Judaism">
Hasidic
</ref>
movement
,
and
the
dry
scholasticism
which
dominated
the
rabbinic
leadership
of
Poland
at
that
time
.
According
to
the
custom
of
the
time
,
he
married
at
the
age
of
twelve
,
but
continued
his
studies
in
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beth_midrash">
Talmudic
colleges
</ref>
in
other
cities
,
and
after
a
few
years
returned
home
,
where
he
completed
his
studies
under
his
father
.
Like
his
father
,
he
never
officiated
as
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbi">
rabbi
</ref>
,
but
was
a
highly
respected
member
of
the
Jewish
community
of
Vilna
,
in
which
he
held
various
offices
.

It
was
due
to
his
father
's
influence
that
he
developed
a
literary
activity
of
a
far
more
scientific
character
than
was
usually
found
at
that
age
or
in
that
country
.
Especially
interested
in
the
history
of
the
old
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homiletical">
homiletical
</ref>
literature
,
he
edited
the
<hi rend="italic">
Midrash
Agadat
Bereshit
</hi>
with
a
number
of
other
mostly
pseudepigraphic
works
of
similar
character
(
Vilna
,
1802
)
,
adding
valuable
notes
.
In
the
preface
of
this
edition
he
makes
the
first
known
attempt
to
give
a
complete
history
of
the
midrashic
literature
.

,
reprinted
this
edition
with
the
preface
(
Zolkiev

)
,
but
was
careful
to
omit
the
name
of
Elijah
Gaon
wherever
the
son
had
mentioned
him
.
He
omitted
,
also
,
on
the
title-page
the
mention
of
Abraham

,
referring
only
to

This
introduction
was
only
part
of
his
greater
work
,
<hi rend="italic">

.
This
book
is
an
alphabetical
index
of
all
<hi rend="italic">
midrashim
</hi>
known
to
the
author
.
It
seems
that
Abraham
of
Vilna
believed
literally
in
the
statement
that
the
eighty
concubines
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Solomon">
King
Solomon
</ref>
(
<hi rend="italic">
Shir
ha-Shirim
Rabbah
</hi>

)
meant
eighty
<hi rend="italic">
midrashim
.
</hi>
This
is
at
least
testified
to
by
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Luria">

in
a
letter
to
Simon
Chones
(
<hi rend="italic">

)
.
The
book
,
however
,
contains
over
one
hundred
and
twenty
midrashic
works
.
While
Abraham
of
Vilna
shows
greater
interest
in
literature
and
literary
questions
than
is
found
among
his
contemporaries
,
he
accepts
traditional
attributions
of
authorship
.
He
ascribes
the

authenticity
produced
by
various
writers
since
the
time
of

.
He
accepts
that
the

was
not
written
down
until
generations
after
Bar
Yochai
's
death
.
He
also
believed
in
the
traditional

of

Secular

<p>
Abraham
's
interest
in
secular
knowledge
,
quite
rare
in
his
environment
,
is
also
manifest
in
the
writing
of
