Build
a
Backyard
Vertical
Farm
</head>
<p>
Vertical
farms
are
a
new
and
extremely
innovative
way
to
grow
crops
.
You
may
not
know
that
you
can
have
one
right
outside
your
home
,
and
can
build
it
yourself
with
minimum
effort
!
This
wikiHow
will
show
you
how
to
build
2
different
kinds
of
vertical
farms
within
your
own
backyard
,
one
being
easy
and
small-scale
(
with
PVC
pipe
)
,
and
the
other
being
a
little
more
intensive
and
bigger
(
with
a
full
pallet
)
.

You
will
need
safety
equipment
including
,
but
not
limited
to
,
safety
glasses
,
protective
clothing
,
and
even
earplugs
.
(
This
is

you
plan
to
drill
holes
in
PVC
pipes
yourself

PVC
pipes
-
as
many
as
needed
-
with
holes
spaced
evenly
throughout
(
can
buy
these
at
a
DIY/hardware
store
or
can
drill
holes
yourself
)
</item>
<item>
An
end
cap
for
PVC
pipe
mentioned
above
,
for
stabilization
and
balance
(
Can
also
buy
these
at
a
DIY/hardware
store
)
</item>
<item>
Rocks
(
to
weigh
down
PVC
pipe
to
stay
in
place
)
</item>
<item>
Soil
(
to
plant
the
crops
in
)
</item>
<item>
And
finally
,
the
crops
you
would
like
to
grow
.
Use
ones
that
have
grown
for
a
week
or
two
,
but
are
not
in
‘
full
bloom
’
.
These
cannot
be
seeds
,
because
they
will
need
to
grow
out
of
the
holes
we
have
drilled
in
the
PVC
pipe
,
and
seeds
can
grow
in
any
direction
and
run
into
the
inside
of
the
pipe
,
rendering
them
useless
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Glue
the
end
cap
to
your
PVC
pipe
,
and
let
it
sit
for
about
10
minutes
to
strengthen
the
bond
.
</item>
<item>
Put
the
smaller
sized
rocks
into
the
PVC
pipe
,
about
⅓
of
the
way
full
.
</item>
<item>
Fill
up
PVC
pipe
with
soil
,
leaving
about
½

of
the
top
empty
.

Using
a
Pallet
</head>
<list type="ordered">

Stay
safe
.
As
with
the
previous
method
,
you
will
need
safety
equipment
including
,
but
not
limited
to
,
safety
glasses
,
protective
clothing
,
and
even
earplugs
.
(
This
is
only
if
you
plan
on
putting
together
the
pallet
yourself
as
opposed
to
buying
it
!
)
.
You
will
also
need
a
pallet
,
a
small
roll
of
landscape
fabric
,
a
staple
gun
,
sandpaper
,
and
finally
2
large
bags
of
potting
soil
.
</item>
<item>
Free
the
pallet
of
debris
.
Before
you
can
plant
these
crops
,
you
need
to
make
sure
our
pallet
is
free
of
any
chipped
wood
or
loose
nails
.
Use
the
sandpaper
to
smooth
over
any
potentially
sharp
and
dangerous
nails
or
pieces
of
wood
.
</item>
<item>
Find
the
perfect
location
for
your
vertical
farm
.
It
can
stand
it
up
against
a
wall
or
tree
;
you
could
find
a
wall
to
place
it
on
,
and
drill
screws
into
wall
to
hold
up
the
pallet
.
These
will
need
to
be
strong
,
because
the
pallet
will
be
much
heavier
than
you
think
with
it
is
filled
with
soil
!
</item>
<item>
Install
the
landscape
fabric
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Choose
which
side
of
your
pallet
will
be
shown
,
because
you
will
be
covering
the
back
,
sides
,
and
bottom
of
it
.
(
You
do
n’t
want
any
soil
falling
out
!
)
</item>
<item>
Lay
pallet
face
down
and
completely
cover
it
with
landscape
fabric
.
You
may
need
to
cover
twice
.
</item>
<item>
You
will
need
to
make
sure
the
fabric
is
going
to
stay
there
,
so
pull
out
your
staple
gun
and
staple
it
towards
the
top
edge
and
corners
of
the
board
!
Make
sure
to
pull
the
fabric
and
make
it
completely
flat
,
leaving
few
to
no
ridges
or
bumps
.
</item>
<item>
Staple
roughly
every
1
½
”
-
2
”
.
</item>
<item>
Repeat
this
process
on
every
side
of
the
pallet
until
back
and
sides
are
completely
covered
in
the
fabric
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Staple
some
more
.
Make
sure
to
staple
anywhere
that
the
soil
may
be
able
to
come
out
!
(
Put
as
many
as
you
think
you
need
;
There
is
no
wrong
answer
!
)
</item>
<item>
Pour
soil
over
the
pallet
.
Use
your
hands
to
stuff
it
inside
,
completely
filling
it
and
making
it
as
tight
as
you
can
.
</item>
<item>
Plant
the
crops
in
the
soil
,
just
like
you
would
if
they
were
in
the
ground
.
</item>
<item>
Water
regularly
.
Water
your
farm
based
on
the
needs
of
the
specific
crop
.
Watch
your
vertical
farm
thrive

If
you
are
not
going
to
build
the
pallet
yourself
,
make
sure
upon
obtaining
it
that
you
are
able
to
.
Do
not
simply
find
one
outside
of
a
building
and
take
it
without
permission
