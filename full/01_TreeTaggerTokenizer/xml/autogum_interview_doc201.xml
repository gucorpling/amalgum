Jada

</hi>
—
would
be
that
same
way
.
Someone
who
would
n’t
be
into
it
and
be
like
,
“
How
could
you
even
think
something
like
that
?
That
’s
gross
,
that
’s
disgusting
!
”

DS

So
here
you
were
thinking
he
hated
you
,
but
really
he
just
had
—
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Jada
:
</hi>
—
this
one
little
thing
,
this
one
little
fetish
that
really
is
n’t
a
big
deal
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
Are
you
still
with
him
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Jada
:
</hi>
Yes
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
Had
you
ever
done
explored
BDSM
before
,
or
was
it
a
new
thing
for
you
when
he
expressed
it
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Jada
:
</hi>
We
played
a
little
bit
,
because
I
’m
just
kind
of
kinky
like
that
,
but
he
never
said
anything
.
He
said
nothing
.
So
I
did
n’t
know
what
was
going
on
or
what
the
problem
was
,
until
he
finally
told
me
he
has
a
fetish
.
From
there
we
went
to
a
film
shop
on
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42nd%20Street%20(Manhattan)">
42nd
Street
</ref>
where
all
the
porn
can
be
found
,
and
we
found
some
fetish
videos
on
bondage
.
It
just
developed
from
there
,
and
I
started
enjoying
it
more
and
more
,
and
I
wanted
to
know
more
about
it
on
a
psychological
level
than
anything
else
.
So
I
started
to
become
a
dom
.
I
saw
an
ad
on
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig's%20List">
Craig
's
List
</ref>
.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
How
long
ago
was
that
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Jada
:
</hi>
About
two
years
ago
.
I
decided
if
I
am
going
to
learn
more
about
it
I
should
learn
from
the
pros
!
[
<hi rend="italic">
Giggles

</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
And
how
long
have
you
been
doing
this
,
Alex
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">
<hi rend="bold">
Alex
:
</hi>
</hi>
About
two
years
,
also
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
How
long
do
you
see
yourself
doing
this
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">
<hi rend="bold">
Alex
:
</hi>
</hi>
I
think
I
will
always
do
it
somewhat
.
Professionally
?
There
’s
going
to
be
an
end
.
For
myself
,
I
usually
like
to
do
things
in
blocks
of
a
few
years
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
I
’m
very
much
the
same
way
.
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">
<hi rend="bold">
Alex
:
</hi>
</hi>
Yeah
!
So
I
could
see…I
ca
n’t
imagine
it
anytime
soon
because
I
’m
actually
really
happy
with
the
way
things
are
going
right
now
,
and
I
ca
n’t
imagine
spending
less
time
here
.
But
I
imagine
I
will
probably
go
down
to
just
one
day
a
week
or
I
will
be
distracted
by
something
else
because
I
will
be
traveling
or
something
.
So
that
’s
for
me
.
I
do
n’t
know
how
much
research
you
’ve
done
on
the
sex
industry…you
ca
n’t
really
compare
it
with
the
sex
industry
,
in
places
where
women…it
’s
not
like
that
;
there
’s
really
not
an
expiration
,
which
is
nice
.
I
think
that
might
be
a
misconception
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Jada
:
</hi>
In
that
sense
,
older
Doms
are
actually
more
respected
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">
<hi rend="bold">
Alex
:
</hi>
</hi>
Yeah
!
Some
are
more
sought
out
,
they
have
experience
.
It
’s
across
the
board
;
people
have
different
types
and
they
want
different
things
.
That
’s
really
nice
.
It
’s
not
really
an
issue
as
it
is
…
