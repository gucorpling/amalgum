Prune
Philodendron
</head>
<p>
Philodendrons
are
beautiful
plants
that
need
regular
maintenance
in
order
to
stay
healthy
.
Using
sharp
scissors
or
garden
shears
,
you
can
prune
the
dead
leaves
and
stems
from
your
plant
,
and
also
remove
discolored
and
potentially
diseased
parts
of
the
philodendron
.
With
regular
pruning
,
your
philodendron
can
bring
you
joy
for
many
years
to
come
.

the
Pruning

Decide
if
pruning
is
necessary
.
If
your
philodendron
looks
healthy
,
with
no
dead
or
discolored
leaves
and
stems
,
you
may
not
need
to
prune
it
at
the
moment
.
There
is
no
reason
to
remove
portions
of
the
plant
if
it
is
in
good
shape
overall
;
you
can
leave
it
alone
and
keep
an
eye
on
it
for
any
changes
.

Prune
if
there
is
dead
or
discolored
material
.
If
there
are
leaves
and
stems
on
your
plant
that
are
dead
or
discolored
,
you
'll
want
to
prune
your
philodendron
to
remove
them
.
They
could
stifle
the
healthy
parts
of
the
plant
and
keep
it
from
growing
.

Discoloration
could
mean
that
the
plant
is
diseased
in
some
way
.
You
'll
want
to
remove
those
areas
to
keep
the
disease
from
spreading
.

<item>
Prune
if
your
philodendron
is
taking
up
too
much
space
.
The
stems
of
philodendrons
will
continue
to
grow
,
and
soon
you
may
find
that
your
plant
is
too
big
for
the
area
where
you
are
keeping
it
.
In
this
case
,
you
can
trim
the
plant
to
keep
it
from
growing
any
larger
without
any
harm
to
the
plant
.

Avoid
pruning
more
than
⅓-½
of
your
philodendron
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Trim
the
stems
that
are
too
long
.
As
your
philodendron
grows
,
you
'll
notice
that
some
stems
grow
much
longer
than
others
.
These
are
typically
called
&quot;
leggy
&quot;
stems
and
your
plant
could
look
sloppy
with
a
bunch
of
long
,
uneven
stems
sticking
out
.

<list type="unordered">
<item>
In
many
cases
,
a
plant
is
forced
to
divert
more
energy
to
these
leggy
stems
.
By
keeping
everything
the
same
length
it
will
help
keep
the
plant
healthier
.
</item>
<item>
This
will
also
help
to
encourage
new
growth
,
once
the
leggy
stems
are
removed
.

Sterilize
your
tools
.
You
can
use
a
sharp
pair
of
scissors
or
gardening
shears
to
prune
your
philodendron
.
Before
you
use
one
of
these
,
you
'll
want
to
soak
it
in
a
diluted
bleach
and
water
solution
,
and
rinse
them
very
well
when
you
're
done
.
This
will
keep
bacteria
from
being
spread
from
the
tools
to
the
plant
.

Cut
your
plant
to
preserve
as
much
healthy
material
as
possible
.
If
you
're
removing
dead
or
diseased
portions
of
the
plant
,
make
sure
to
cut
just
below
the
area
in
question
.
That
way
you
're
not
cutting
healthy
portions
of
the
plant
that
you
want
to
preserve
.

Trim
the
longest
or
oldest
stems
.
Holding
your
tool
at
a
45-degree
angle
,
cut
the
longest
stems
to
make
them
even
with
the
rest
of
the
plant
.
Your
philodendron
will
look
neater
,
and
it
will
also
encourage
growth
in
the
rest
of
the
plant
.

Prune
your
philodendron
during
active
growing
periods
while
the
plant
is
producing
new
shoots
to
promote
regrowth
.
</item>
<item>
Wait
a
few
weeks
or
months
after
pruning
before
cutting
portions
of
the
plant
again
.

<item>
Prune
the
philodendron
where
the
stem
meets
the
main
plant
.
In
some
cases
,
it
will
be
necessary
to
remove
an
entire
stem
of
the
plant
.
Typically
,
this
is
because
the
death
or
disease
has
spread
,
or
because
you
want
to
thin
the
plant
to
make
it
look
better
.

Make
sure
to
leave
the
main
stem
alone
,
the
one
that
connects
all
of
the
leaves
and
stems

Remove
only
the
offshoot
branches
and

Tips

<list type="unordered">
<item>
The
healthy
stems
you
removed
can
be
replanted
,
so
that
they
can
grow
on
their
own
.
You
can
place
them
in
the
dirt
of
the
existing
plant
,
or
start
a
new
pot
with
soil
.
Just
bury
the
bottom
of
the
stem
in
about
of
soil
.
It
will
eventually
take
root
and
grow
on
its
own
.
