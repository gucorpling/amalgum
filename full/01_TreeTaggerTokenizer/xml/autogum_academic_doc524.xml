Structure
of
Hymod
Model
</head>
<p>
A
parsimonious
conceptual
rainfall-runoff
model
structure
of
the
Hymod
model
was
adopted
in
this
case
study
.
The
Hymod
model
has
been
widely
applied
in
hydrological
modeling
and
provided
satisfactory
performance
.
This
five-parameter
model
is
based
on
the
probability-distribution
model
(
PDM
)
proposed
by
Moore
and
was
originally
introduced
by
Boyle
et
al.
.
As
shown
in
<figure>
Figure
3
</figure>
a
,
the
model
structure
consists
of
two
main
components
,
which
are
the
rainfall
excess
component
and
the
routing
component
.
Table
2
presents
a
brief
description
of
the
free
parameters
of
the
Hymod
model
.
</p>
<p>
The
core
of
the
Hymod
model
is
a
two-parameter
nonlinear
tank
with
a
rainfall
excess
component
.
In
order
to
split
the
rainfall
into
direct
runoff
and
subsurface
runoff
,
this
tank
statistically
describes
the
heterogeneous
spatial
distribution
of
soil
moisture
storage
capability
.
It
is
hypothesized
that
the
soil
moisture
storage
capacity
varies
across
the
catchment
and
has
a
maximum
soil
moisture
storage
capacity
,
.
Thus
,
this
tank
allows
deriving
the
saturated
proportion
of
a
catchment
and
its
relative
saturation
.
In
practice
,
a
Pareto
distribution
function
describes
the
fraction
of
the
catchment
having
a
storage
capacity
.
(

)
where
denotes
the
soil
moisture
storage
capacity
,
is
the
maximum
soil
moisture
storage
capacity
in
the
catchment
,
and
parameter
defines
the
degree
of
spatial
variability
of
storage
capacities
over
the
catchment
(

)
.

The
corresponding
probability
density
function
of
the
soil
moisture
storage
capacity
is
shown
below

<p>
A
similar
function
is
also
employed
in
the
Xinanjiang
model
and
the
Variable
Infiltration
Capacity
(
VIC
)
model
.
<figure>
Figure

</figure>
a
illustrates
that
the
area
producing
fast
runoff
is
calculated
from
the
proportion
of
the
catchment
with
saturated
reservoirs
.
The
effective
rainfall
is
equal
to
the
soil
moisture
excess
calculated
at
each
time
step
.
</p>
<p>
The
routing
component
consists
of
two
series
of
linear
reservoirs
,
a
single
reservoir
for
the
slow
flow
,
and
three
identical
quick
flow
reservoirs
(
<figure>
Figure
3
</figure>
a
)
.
The
slow
flow
reservoir
,
modelled
using
one
linear
reservoir
,
represents
the
groundwater
.
The
quick
flow
is
routed
by
surface
runoff
using
a
cascade
of
three
linear
quick
flow
reservoirs
.

of
the
Hymod
model

Semi-Distributed
Model
Setup
</head>
<p>
In
this
study
,
the
Hymod
model
was
set
up
using
a
semi-distributed
modelling
system
.
The
semi-distributed
scheme
was
applied
in
two
catchments
,
which
had
been
respectively
delineated
into
three
sub-catchments
.
Modelling
at
each
sub-catchment
was
performed
using
the
lumped
version
of
the
Hymod
model
.
The
river
routing
between
sub-catchments
was
conducted
by
a
linear
Muskingum
river
model
.
The
forcing
data
(
i.
e.
,
precipitation
and
potential
evapotranspiration
)
was
interpolated
,
according
to
sub-catchment
boundaries
with
the
purpose
of
running
a
semi-distributed
model
.
Only
the
streamflow
data
at
the
outlet
station
were
used
for
calibration
.
The
lumped
Hymod
model
was
run
at
each
sub-catchment
,
and
the
same
set
of
parameters
was
estimated
for
all
sub-catchments
.
Since
the
amount
of
sub-catchment
is
small
and
the
area
of
each
sub-catchment
is
similar
,
two
parameters
in
the
Muskingum
routing
model
were
both
treated
as
homogeneous
.
As
a
result
,
in
addition
to
the
parameters
of
the
Hymod
model
,
the
Muskingum
river
model
has
two
free
parameters
that
need
to
be
calibrated
.

Prior
Estimation
of
the
Degree
of
Parameter
Î²
</head>
<p>
The
prior
estimation
of
the
was
conducted
by
using
SMAP
root-zone
soil
moisture
data
based
on
the
method
of
moments
.
As
mentioned
in
Section
3.1
,
is
the
shape
parameter
of
Pareto
distribution
,
which
was
utilized
to
describe
the
spatial
variability
of
soil
moisture
storage
capability
.
This
spatial
distribution
can
be
related
to
different
soil
moisture
storage
capacity
among
the
study
catchment
.
</p>
<p>
The
form
of
the
curve
of
the
spatial
distribution
of
soil
moisture
storage
capacity
is
shown
in
Equation
(
2
)
,
and
the
first
theoretical
moment
of
Equation
(
2
)
is
shown
below
.
(

)
</p>
<p>
Solving
for
in
Equation
(
3
)
gives
the
following
.
(

)
</p>
<p>
In
this
study
,
SMAP
root-zone
soil
moisture
data
were
used
to
yield
the
samples
(
)
for
the
soil
moisture
storage
capacity
.
For
each
cell
of
SMAP
data
,
the
soil
moisture
storage
capacity
sample
of
the
<hi rend="italic">
i
</hi>
-th
cell
could
be
estimated
as
follows
:
(

)
(

)
(

)
where
means
the
SMAP
root-zone
soil
moisture
for
the
<hi rend="italic">
i
</hi>
-th
cell
at
the
time
step
,
is
the
total
number
of
time
steps
,
and
is
the
depth
of
the
root
zone
.
Note
that
Equation
(
7
)
is
based
on
the
assumption
that
the
soil
moisture
will
reach
the
maximum
and
minimum
soil
wetness
at
least
once
during
the
study
period
.
