Introduction
</head>
<p>
The
ethnic
differences
in
bone
mineral
density
(
BMD
)
and
fracture
risk
have
been
described
in
both
high-income
,
and
low-
and
middle-income
countries
.
In
South
Africa
,
black
populations
have
been
reported
to
have
a
higher
overall
BMD
and
a
lower
fracture
risk
compared
to
white
populations
.
However
,
evidence
point
towards
a
lower
than
expected
BMD
in
black
South
African
women
and
an
increased
risk
for
poor
bone
health
and
fractures
.
Reduced
BMD
among
black
South
African
women
may
be
associated
with
the
predominance
of
environmental
exposures
over
genetic
factors
.
</p>
<p>
Earlier
studies
identified
that
the
migration
of
black
South
Africans
into
urban
areas
significantly
affects
their
health
status
with
an
increase
in
the
incidence
of
obesity
and
non-communicable
diseases
related
to
urbanisation
,
the
nutrition
transition
,
and
decreased
physical
activity
.
A
high
body
mass
index
(
BMI
)
has
been
suggested
to
protect
against
low
BMD
by
some
,
while
others
have
found
excessive
fat
mass
to
be
associated
with
low
BMD
and
not
protecting
against
osteoporosis
.
Similarly
,
lean
mass
and
not
fat
mass
strongly
correlated
with
bone
health
in
black
South
African
women
.
Therefore
,
the
high
prevalence
of
obesity
among
black
South
African
women
may
be
a
contributing
factor
to
a
lower
BMD
in
this
group
.
In
addition
to
high
fat
mass
levels
,
increased
circulating
inflammatory
cytokines
in
obese
individuals
have
also
been
linked
to
a
low
BMD
.
</p>
<p>
Diet
is
a
known
modifiable
risk
factor
for
optimal
bone
health
,
with
the
value
of
specific
nutrients
such
as
dietary
calcium
and
vitamin
D
well
established
.
More
recently
,
a
holistic
approach
acknowledging
the
interaction
between
foods
,
nutrients
,
and
food
components
on
health
outcomes
,
including
bone
health
,
was
proposed
to
investigate
the
association
of
dietary
patterns
with
the
markers
of
bone
health
.
The
dietary
patterns
associated
with
reduced
bone
health
are
characterised
by
the
high
intakes
of
refined
cereals
,
processed
meats
,
fried
foods
and
sweet
foods
,
while
patterns
high
in
fruit
,
vegetables
,
and
a
prudent
diet
pattern
are
positively
associated
with
bone
health
.
In
the
Northwest
Province
of
South
Africa
,
an
accelerated
nutrition
transition
among
black
Africans
resulted
in
a
shift
from
a
plant-based
diet
to
an
animal
food-based
diet
which
is
energy-dense
but
nutrient
poor
and
therefore
,
may
negatively
impact
bone
health
.
</p>
<p>
Therefore
,
the
purpose
of
this
prospective
study
was
to
investigate
the
association
between
nutrient
intake
and
dietary
patterns
(
exposures
)
with
changes
in
bone
turnover
and
BMD
(
bone
health
outcomes
)
in
postmenopausal
urban
black
South
African
women
over
two
years
.
