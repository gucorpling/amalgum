Have
a
Fair
Opinion
</head>
<p>
Everyone
has
an
opinion
on
something
...
and
everyone
is
passionate
about
at
least
one
cause
or
belief
.
This
article
discusses
how
to
develop
your
own
opinion
,
and
discuss
it
with
others
as
well
,
without
offending
anyone
holding
a
different
belief
.

Steps
</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Try
to
think
about
the
other
person
's
feelings
.
Empathize
for
a
minute
about
why
they
have
their
opinion
and
why
you
have
yours
.
If
they
are
thinking
differently
,
agree
to
disagree
,
but
do
it
in
a
kind
way
so
that
no
one
's
feelings
are
hurt
and
you
can
remain
on
good
terms
together
.

Try
to
point
out
the
good
points
in
both
your
and
their
beliefs
.
Even
if
you
do
n't
completely
agree
,
being
a
little
open
minded
and
understanding
can
always
help
to
&quot;
put
yourself
in
their
shoes
&quot;
for
a
while
.
It
is
n't
something
you
have
to
do
for
the
rest
of
your
life
;
just
for
the
time
spent
with
this
person
.

Do
n't
get
frustrated
if
they
act
rudely
toward
you
,
even
after
following
these
steps
.
People
will
stick
to
their
opinions
,
right
or
wrong
.
The
only
possible
way
to
try
to
get
your
point
across
is
to
actively
listen
to
everything
they
have
to
say
and
understand
why
they
have
such
beliefs
,
also
the
development
of
your
own
ideas
and
opinions
on
matters
may
be
changed
by
the
person
you
are
arguing
with
.

Celebrate
your
differences
.
Being
happy
about
how
diverse
and
different
you
are
can
lead
to
a
much
happier
outlook
on
your
different
opinions
.
So
,
do
n't
be
ashamed
to
think
differently
just
because
you
're
afraid
of
being
ignored
!

a
consequence

Do
n't
be

aggressive

you
feel
even
after
you
