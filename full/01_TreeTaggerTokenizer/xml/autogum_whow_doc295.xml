Cook

Teflon

<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Teflon
</hi>
is
a
registered
trademark
and
brand
name
of
the
DuPont
company
for
products
made
from
fluorine-containing
polymers
(
fluoropolymers
)
.
Other
companies
also
use
similar
coatings
for
their
<hi rend="bold">
non-stick
cookware
</hi>
.
</p>
<p>
These
products
are
created
using
chemicals
that
are
known
to
be
toxic
.
Although
the
manufacturers
will
tell
you
that
they
do
not
release
chemicals
&quot;
under
normal
conditions
&quot;
,
even
they
admit
that
overheating
can
cause
these
dangerous
chemicals
to
gas
off
.
</p>
<p>
At
this
time
there
are
no
studies
that
prove
that
fluoropolymers
are
dangerous
,
that
is
not
a
guarantee
of
their
safety
.
By
following
the
advice
in
this
article
you
can
at
least
reduce
your
families
risk
of
exposure
to
these
chemicals
.

Steps
</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Research
the
possible
effects
of
fluoropolymers
,
and
make
an
educated
decision
.
Although
studies
to
date
do
not
indicate
a
measurable
risk
,
there
are
broader
studies
that
show
that
the
combination
of
many
small
doses
of
a
variety
of
chemicals
can
combine
to
have
serious
health
effects
.
It
is
up
to
you
to
decide
whether
you
need
to
take
the
risk
with
your
family
's
health
.

Use
oven-proof
glassware
.
Glassware
is
a
safe
natural
alternative
for
use
in
the
oven
.
Heat
resistant
glass
can
be
used
for
baking
and
roasting
.
Whether
you
are
cooking
up
a
loaf
of
bread
or
roasting
a
chicken
,
there
is
excellent
glass
cookware
to
meet
your
needs
.
Glass
is
in
practical
terms
as
non
stick
as
Teflon
under
normal
use
.

Use
a
<hi rend="bold">
cast
iron
pan
</hi>
for
frying
.
Cast
iron
,
when
used
properly
builds
up
a
natural
&quot;
patina
&quot;
which
is
not
only
non-stick
,
but
also
fairly
resistant
to
the
use
of
metal
implements
.

Use
a
steel
wok
for
Asian
foods
(
stir-fries
,
curries
,
etc
)
.
Like
cast
iron
,
a
steel
wok
when
used
properly
builds
up
a
natural
&quot;
patina
&quot;
.

<item>
Use
silicone
for
baking
cakes
,
muffins
and
pies
.
Silicon
cookware
is
something
fairly
new
.
It
is
a
non-chemical
product
and
virtually
non-stick
.

<item>
If
in
doubt
,
use
stainless
steel
pots
and
pans
.
Stainless
steel
can
be
close
to
non-stick
unless
overheated
.
If
you
do
scorch
the
pan
you
're
going
to
have
some
scrubbing
to
do
,
but
a
bit
of
scrubbing
is
better
than
gassing
your
family
with
nasty
fluorine
compounds
!

Tips
</head>
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Clean
your
<hi rend="bold">
cast
iron
pans
</hi>
using
a
nylon
dish-brush
and
<hi rend="bold">
no
soap
</hi>
.
Scrub
away
any
food
scraps
,
and
then
stick
them
back
on
the
flame
(
or
element
)
for
a
minute
to
evaporate
any
water
.
</item>
<item>
Glassware
usually
cleans
up
easily
,
but
if
you
get
something
really
baked
on
it
will
much
easier
to
clean
after
soaking
overnight
.
</item>
<item>
Although
<hi rend="bold">
silicone
</hi>
is
reasonably
non-stick
,
it
is
a
good
idea
to
grease
the
pan
or
tray
with
a
little
butter
-
just
to
be
sure
.
</item>
<item>
<hi rend="bold">
Silicone
</hi>
pans
and
trays
are
floppy
!
Use
two
hands
when
moving
to
and
from
the
oven
.
</item>
<item>
If
you
do
a
lot
of
Asian
cooking
,
you
might
want
two
woks
.
One
for
wet
(
e.
g.
Thai
curry
)
and
one
for
dry
(
e.
g.
Stir
fry
)
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
In
both
cases
,
treat
them
similarly
to
cast
iron
(
clean
<hi rend="bold">
without
soap
</hi>
and
dry
on
element
)
.
They
will
also
build
up
a
patina
-
this
is
good
!
</item>
<item>
The
dry
one
will
usually
end
up
blacker
(
even
better
)
,
but
if
you
then
use
it
for
a
wet
curry
or
soup
you
might
get
black
bits
in
your
meal
.
Still
at
least
it
's
just
carbon
and
not
some
nasty
fluorine
compound
!
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Soak
scorched
<hi rend="bold">
stainless
steel
</hi>
pots
and
pans
,
and
then
clean
using
baking
soda
(
and
a
lot
of
elbow
grease
)
.

Warnings
</head>
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Cast
iron
pans
that
have
not
yet
built
up
a
patina
can
leach
small
amounts
of
iron
into
acidic
foods
like
tomato
sauces
.
Iron
is
a
vital
nutrient
,
but
for
some
people
excess
iron
can
be
a
problem
.
If
you
suffer
from
haemochromatosis
or
similar
conditions
you
may
want
to
avoid
cooking
in
cast
iron
.
If
in
doubt
,
check
with
your
physician
.
</item>
<item>
If
you
have
a
pet
bird
,
and
continue
to
use
Teflon
,
be
extra
careful
not
to
overheat
the
pan
.
Even
small
doses
of
the
chemicals
that
gas
off
will
kill
a
bird
.
(
Consider
this
,
and
the
reason
why
miners
used
to
take
a
canary
with
them
)
.
