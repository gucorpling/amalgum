an

,
Hedayat-Allah
returned

Karim

him
by
demanding

later
altered
his
stratagem
and
in

restored
Hedayat-Allah
as
the
ruler
of
Gilan
under
Zand
suzerainty

Furthermore
,
he
also
arranged

In
1782
Agha
Mohammad
Khan
invaded
Gilan
,
Hedayat-Allah
had
changed
his
allegiance
to
the
Zand
dynasty
.
Hedayat-Allah
then
sent
two
diplomats
,
Mirza
Sadeq
and
Agha
Sadeq
Lahiji
,
to
Agha
Mohammad
to
make
peace
.
As
a
precaution
he
went
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirvan">

.
The
diplomats
were
unable
to
come
to
favorable
terms
with
Agha
Mohammad
Khan
,
who
raided
Gilan
's
capital
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasht">

and
seized
its
riches
.
</p>
<p>
Agha
Mohammad
Khan
now
had
to
focus
on
Gilan
because
Hedayat-Allah
had
returned
to
the
province
(
allegedly
with
Russian
help
)
since
the
Qajar
invasion
of
the
province
in
1782
.

In
Agha
Mohammad
Khan
's
eyes
,
the
whole
Caspian
coast
was
under
threat
by
Hedayat-Allah
and
the
Russians
.
Agha
Mohammad
Khan
and
his
men
easily
managed
to
enter
Gilan
.
While
he
was
marching
towards
Rasht
,
he
was
joined
by
a
local
ruler
named
Mehdi
Beg
Khalatbari
and
other
people

<p>
Furthermore
,
the
Russian
consul
in

betrayed
Hedayat-Allah
by
providing
weapons
to
Agha
Mohammad

Hedayat-Allah
once
again
tried
to
flee
to
Shirvan
,
but
was
captured
by
men
sent
by
a
local
ruler
named
Agha
Ali
Shafti
(
or
another
local
ruler
according
to
some
sources
)
,
who
killed
him
to
avenge
the
slaughter
of
his
family
a
few
years
earlier
.
Gilan
was
now
completely
under
Qajar
rule
.
Besides
the
conquest
of
Gilan
,
the
second
most
valuable
thing
for
Agha
Mohammad
Khan
was
Hedayat-Allah
's
treasure
.

Characteristics

<p>
Gilan
flourished
under
the
rule
of
Hedayat-Allah
,
who
encouraged
foreign
trade
by
tempting
a
substantial
amount

He
preserved
an

court
in

,
funded
by
the
silk
industry
and
the
sea
commerce

.
Nonetheless
,
according
to
the
Cambridge
History
of
Iran
,
&quot;
he
was
treacherous
and
bloodthirsty
,
even
by
the
standards
of
the
age
,
and
his
eventual
overthrow
by
Mohammad
Hasan
Khan
's
son
and
political
heir
,
Agha
Mohammad
Khan
,
passed
unmourned
.
