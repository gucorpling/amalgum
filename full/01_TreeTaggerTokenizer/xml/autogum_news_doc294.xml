<p>
65-year-old

took
a
ride
on
the
&quot;

&quot;
,
an
airplane
producing
weightlessness
by
following
a
parabolic
flight
path
.
He
did
this
to
show
awareness
for
space
exploration
.
The
flight
took
off

Hawking
,
who
is
confined
to
a
wheelchair
due
to
a
degenerative
disease
,
was
unstrapped
from
it
while
the
plane
made
eight
free-fall
maneuvers
that
simulate
zero-gravity
to
those
on-board
.
Hawking
told
reporters
he
enjoyed
the
zero-gravity
part
of
his
flight
and
other
people
with
him
said
he
&quot;
did
n't
want
to
come
back
&quot;
.
</p>
<p>
Hawking
made
the
flight
to
draw
attention
to
the
importance
of
space
exploration
.
&quot;
I
believe
the
human
race
has
no
future
if
it
does
n't
go
into
space

failed
the

round
of
voting
in
parliament
on
Friday
.
He
received
357
votes
;
367
votes
are
required
to
win
.
Opposition
parties
asked
the
Constitutional
Court
to
stop
the
voting
.
If

Constitutional

rules
in

,
a
general
election
could
be

<p>
A
second
round
will
be
on
May

.
If
Gül
does

pick
up
the
additional
ten
votes
then
,
the
process
will
move
on
to
a
third
and
if
necessary
a
fourth
round
.
During
those
rounds
,
only
a
simple
majority
is
needed
so

seems
assured
of
getting

People

</p>
<p>

all
