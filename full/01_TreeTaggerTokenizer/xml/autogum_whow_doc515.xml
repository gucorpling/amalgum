When
thinking
of
a
brand
name
,
it
's
usually
best
to
get
a
notepad
ready
for
a
list
that
will
help
you
remember
all
the
name
and
make
the
process
of
elimination
easier
.
Try
to
think
of
something
that
emphasises
your
persona
or
brand
message

Consider
how
you
want
to
represent
yourself
and
your
brand
.
If
you
're
a
happy
person
,
opt
for
light
colours
and
fun
designs
.
If
you
're
a
serious
,
practical
person
,
design
the
whole
brand
to
how
it
suits
you
!
This
is
one

Before
you
actually
start
making
anything
or
finalising
your
brand
,
go
to
craft
fairs
and
look
at
some
of
the
homemade
jewelry
they
have
created
.
Take
a
note
down
of
the
properties
and
design
features
of
the
ones
that
you
like
so
you
can
mix
them
up
and
add
to
yours
when
you
do
start
making
!

Make
the
jewelry
!
If
you
could
n't
find
much
inspiration
,
go
on
YouTube
and
see
how
they
make
the
jewelry
in
different
ways
to
give
effect

After
making
all
your
fabulous
pieces
,
it
's
time
to
spread
the
word
and
put
on
a
jewelry
party
!
Get
a
few
friends
to
come
round
,
have
a
few
drinks
,
mingle
but
most
importantly
,
ask
for
feedback
and
try
to
sell
the
bracelets
!
Obviously
,
you
should
n't
have
high
prices
as
they
are
not
part
of
a
big
brand
yet
,
but
hopefully
soon
will
be
!

Put
flyers
up
around
town
and
posting
business
cards
on
bulletin
boards
really
help
improve
business
.
Also
,
setting
up
your
own
website
is
another
really
helpful
way
to
get
people
to
buy
your
jewelry
and
try
to
get
'
founded
'
by
shops
and
big
accessory
brands

iI
the
jewelry
is
selling
,
it
's
time
to
talk
to
some
high
street
store
managers
that
could
maybe
give
you
a
brand
funded
by
that
shop
.
Making
an
appointment
with
a
lower
end
fashion
store
is
a
good
way
to
start
.
Keep
on
trying
until
you
finally
get
accepted

As
you
went
to
craft
fairs
earlier
on
,
do
the
same
and
sell
some
of
your
accessories
there
,
maybe
to
help
someone
in
the
same
position
as
you
were
!
Make
multiple
of
the
same
design
just
in
case
some
are
more
popular
than
others
.

<item>
if
you
think
you
have
enough
money
,
and
the
accessories
will
do
well
enough
,
maybe
it
's
time
to
open
up
your
own
shop
!
Look
around
town
and
the
high
street
to
see
if
there
are
any
places
to
let
,
or
set
up
your
own
stall
in
the
middle
of
a
shopping
centre
.
You
could
maybe
think
about
getting
a
ground
floor
apartment
close
to
where
you
live
and
use
that
as
the
shop
,
with
the
landlord
's
permission
.

Get
some
staff
and
your
own
shop
!
As
the
job
market
is
rapidly
getting
lower
,
you
could
help
a
non-working
friend
out
by
giving
them
a
job
.
Even
though
you
have
your
own
business
,
it
never
hurts
to
carry
the
store
on
and
try
to
set
up
a
brand
in
another
shop

<list type="unordered">
<item>
Ask
a
lot
of
stores
if
they
would
n't
mind
using
your
designs
for
their
store
.
Do
n't
just
use
only
one
and
keep
persisting
.
</item>
<item>
Only
open
a
store
if
your
positive
the
accessories
are
doing
well
.
Otherwise
stick
to
the
Internet
or
open
a
stall
.
</item>
<item>
If
you
have
a
3+
story
house
,
why
not
consider
using
the
ground
floor
as
your
store
?
It
's
cheaper
and
it
wo
n't
be
that
far
to
travel
to
.

At
the
jewelry
parties
,
ask
your
friends
to
bring
a
few
of
their
friends
for
more
recommendations
