Practice
on
your
pet
.
Observe
your
pet
daily
,
and
keep
an
eye
out
for
any
signs
of
bad
health
or
deterioration
in
well-being
.
For
example
,
if
you
have
a
dog
and
it
's
eating
grass
,
it
may
be
sick
.
On
the
other
hand
,
this
could
be
a
sign
of
something
a
healthy
dog
does
,
so
always
do
your
research
in
reliable
books
about
animal
care
.
