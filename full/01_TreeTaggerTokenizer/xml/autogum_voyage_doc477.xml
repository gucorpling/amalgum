Fiordland
National

,
covering
over
1.2
million
hectares
,
is
<ref target="New%20Zealand">
New

</ref>
'
s
largest
national
park
and
one
of
the
largest
in
the
world
.
The
park
,
together
with
the
adjoining
<ref target="Mount%20Aspiring%20National%20Park">
Mount

National

</ref>
,
occupies
the

and
is
listed
as
a
<ref target="UNESCO_World_Heritage_List%23New_Zealand">

</ref>
.

<p>
Fiordland
,
as
the
name
suggests
,
is
home
to
several
fiords
â€”
steep-sided
inlets
carved
by
glaciers
during
the
last
ice
age
,
then
later
drowned
by
the
rising
sea
.
Its
rugged
landscape
remains
one
of
the
least
explored
areas
of
New
Zealand
.
Although
the
park
has
about
500
km
of
formed
walking
tracks
,
these
are
mostly
confined
to
eastern
and
northern
parts
of
the
park
.
</p>
<p>
Like
all
of
New
Zealand
's
national
parks
,
it
is
managed
by
the
<hi rend="bold">
Department
of
Conservation
</hi>
(
DOC
)
.
The
department
aims
to
allow
the
public
to
enjoy
the
park
,
while
also
preserving
the
environment
.
There
are
relatively
few
restrictions
on
access
by
individual
visitors
,
though
commercial
activity
is
carefully
(
some
might
say
strictly
)
controlled
.
</p>
<p>
The
main
visitor
information
centre
is
in
the
township
of
<ref target="Te%20Anau">
Te
Anau
</ref>
.
There
are
park
ranger
outposts
at
major
visitor
locations
.
Visitors
intending
to
stay
in
the
park
overnight
are
advised
to
inform
the
park
rangers
of
their
intentions
.
In
the
event
of
an
emergency
,
these
intentions
will
be
used
as
part
of
any
search
and
rescue
operation
.
</p>
<head>
Flora
and
fauna
</head>
<p>
The
area
is
so
remote
and
unexplored
that
some
speculate
that
species
thought
extinct
in
New
Zealand
may
still
live
in
the
park
.
The
<hi rend="bold">
takahe
</hi>
,
a
flightless
bird
previously
thought
extinct
,
was
discovered
in
a
remote
part
of
the
park
in
1948
.
</p>
<p>
The
<hi rend="bold">
kakapo
</hi>
,
the
world
's
only
flightless
parrot
,
survived
in
Fiordland
longer
than
any
other
place
on
New
Zealand
's
two
main
islands
,
although
even
here
it
died
out
by
the
1980s
.
A
recovery
project
has
been
started
on
offshore
islands
free
of
the
predators
that
threatened
its
survival
on
the
mainland
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Sandflies
</hi>
are
an
obvious
(
and
annoying
)
demonstration
of
the
insect
life
that
inhabits
the
area
.
</p>
<head>
Climate
</head>
<p>
The
weather
in
the
park
can
change
dramatically
over
the
space
of
a
few
hours
and
over
a
few
kilometres
.
Visitors
should
always
be
prepared
for
rain
,
which
can
be
heavy
and
prolonged
.
The
park
has
over
200
rain
days
per
year
,
though
different
parts
of
the
park
receive
widely
different
rainfalls
.
Te
Anau
,
with
1200
mm
(
40
inches
)
annual
rainfall
is
almost
as
dry
as
much
of
the
eastern
South
Island
,
while
Milford
Sound
,
with
8000
mm
(
320
inches
)
annual
rainfall
,
is
truly
rainforest
and
waterfall
territory
.

<head>
Aircraft
</head>
<p>
Aircraft
are
part
of
the
Fiordland
National
Park
scene
.
DOC
uses
them
to
carry
out
its
duties
in
the
park
,
including
pest
control
.
Aircraft
service
the
walking
track
and
remove
every
bit
of
waste
,
including
toilet
waste
.
As
there
are
no
roads
,
all
lodge
,
track
maintenance
and
building
is
enabled
by
aircraft
and
all
supplies
to
the
lodges
are
flown
in
.
If
you
injure
yourself
so
you
ca
n't
continue
or
you
go
missing
,
aircraft
are
the
only
practical
method
to
carry
out
search
and
rescue
.
For
many
people
the
only
way
they
can
access
the
park
is
by
aircraft
either
because
of
lack
of
time
,
age
or
infirmity
.
The
other
important
consideration
is
that
aircraft
make
the
least
real
environmental
impact
of
any
of
the
users
of
the
park
.
