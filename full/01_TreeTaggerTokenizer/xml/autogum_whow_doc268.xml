Develop
an
IT
Risk‐Management
Policy
</head>
<p>
Information
Technology
(
IT
)
risk
management
is
the
ongoing
process
that
protects
data
against
unauthorized
access
or
changes
.
Developing
an
IT
risk-management
policy
will
provide
a
business
or
organization
with
the
security
to
handle
customers
'
sensitive
data
and
Internal
files
and
to
complete
transactions
safely
.
The
policy-development
process
weighs
risks
and
controls
with
regard
to
effectiveness
and
cost
,
and
it
analyzes
changes
in
existing
policies
,
government
regulations
,
and
laws
.
Consider
the
following
as
you
learn
how
to
develop
an
IT
risk-management
policy

No

system

be
considered

Risk
management
should

Your
organization
's
assessment

what

considered
acceptable
risk
should
be
conducted
in
consultation
with
your
board

directors

leadership
staff
,
and
insurance
provider

Consider
any
access
former
employees

potential
vulnerabilities

Monitoring
the
exit
process
of
staff
members
and
safeguarding
confidentiality
are
integral
parts
of
your
IT
risk-management
policy
