Introduction
</head>
<p>
The
World
Health
Organization
(
WHO
)
classifies
gliomas
into
four
categories
based
on
malignancy
and
overall
survival
(
OS
)
.
Glioblastoma
is
the
most
malignant
form
of
astrocytoma
that
is
fast-growing
(
grade
4
glioma
)
.
The
median
OS
of
glioblastoma
is
9
–
15
months
and
the
five-year
survival
rate
remains
less
than
5
%
.
Radiotherapy
with
six
cycles
of
concomitant
temozolomide
,
an
oral
alkylating
agent
with
minimal
additional
toxicity
,
is
the
standard
treatment
after
surgery
in
glioblastoma
patients
.
Thus
,
there
is
an
immediate
requirement
for
the
early
diagnosis
and
precise
prediction
of
the
prognosis
for
treatments
of
glioblastoma
.
</p>
<p>
The
invasiveness
of
glioblastoma
depends
on
its
high
infiltration
potential
to
invade
the
basement
membranes
of
surrounding
tissues
.
Glioma
cells
are
reprogrammed
to
have
increased
motility
via
weakened
cell
adhesions
and
a
dysregulated
cytoskeleton
;
this
is
known
as
epithelial
–
mesenchymal
transition
(
EMT
)
.
EMT
is
a
biological
process
that
polarized
epithelial
cell
sheets
undergo
,
wherein
multiple
biochemical
changes
culminate
in
mesenchymal
phenotypes
.
Cells
display
altered
morphology
,
resistance
to
chemotherapy
,
and
<hi rend="italic">
anoikis
</hi>
(
a
form
of
programmed
cell
death
of
cells
detached
from
the
basement
membranes
)
.
EMT
is
also
involved
in
other
biological
processes
,
including
implantation
and
embryo
development
,
wound
healing
,
tissue
regeneration
,
and
neoplasia
associated
with
cancer
progression
.
During
invasion
in
cancer
,
phenotypes
also
change
as
EMT
is
mainly
induced
by
hypoxia
and
the
transforming
growth
factor
(
TGF)-β
released
from
glioma
stem
cells
(
GSCs
)
,
mesenchymal
stem
cells
(
MSCs
)
,
and
myeloid
cells
recruited
by
hypoxia
.
The
reverse
is
also
essential
for
the
formation
of
distant
or
disseminated
tumor
nodules
.
</p>
<p>
Stem
cells
,
including
cancer
stem
cells
(
CSCs
)
,
are
pluripotent
and
capable
of
self-renewal
,
like
induced
pluripotent
stem
(
iPS
)
cells
induced
by
the
transcription
factors
Oct3/4
,
Sox2
,
c-Myc
,
and
Klf4
or
OCT4
,
SOX2
,
NANOG
,
and
LIN28
.
The
expression
of
OCT4
,
MYC
,
and
KLF4
increases
with
increasing
malignancy
in
astrocytomas
,
whereas
MYC
expression
slightly
decreases
in
recurrent
glioblastomas
.
Exposure
to
temozolomide
(
TMZ
)
increases
the
expression
of
KLF4
and
reduces
the
expression
of
Nanog
and
OCT4
in
glioma
cells
,
indicating
that
stem
cell
factors
,
especially
KLF4
,
play
pivotal
roles
in
GSCs
.
The
most
common
GSC
marker
CD133
,
also
known
as
prominin-1
(
<hi rend="italic">
PROM1
</hi>
)
,
is
used
to
isolate
GSCs
by
fluorescence-activated
cell
sorting
(
FACS
)
in
primary
glioma
tissues
and
the
cell
lines
U87
and
T98G
.
There
are
changes
in
metabolism
in
glioma
and
oxidative
phosphorylation
,
glycolysis
,
and
glutaminolysis
replace
redox
balance
,
bioenergetics
,
and
biosynthesis
,
respectively
.
Tumor
progression
is
enhanced
by
inflammation
,
which
is
an
emerging
hallmark
of
cancers
that
depends
on
the
balance
of
glioma
cell
proliferation
,
migration
,
and
escape
from
the
immune
system
.
However
,
the
correlation
between
EMT
and
GSCs
in
glioblastoma
has
not
been
reported
to
date
.
</p>
<p>
In
this
study
,
we
focused
on
EMT
and
GSCs
and
performed
multivariable
analyses
using
the
expression
data
and
OS
in
patients
with
glioblastoma
.
To
determine
the
distribution
of
survival
of
glioblastoma
patients
,
we
composed
prognosis
prediction
formulae
for
the
following
components
:
epithelium
(
EPI
)
,
mesenchyme
(
MES
)
,
glioma
(
GLI
)
,
GSC
,
molecular
target
therapy
(
MTT
)
genes
,
and
potential
glioma
biomarkers
(
PGBs
)
.
Consequently
,
several
candidate
genes
were
identified
as
promising
glioblastoma
predictors
.
