We

a
time
where

feel
lonely
and
your
life
is
n't
that
fun
.

Do
n't
be
stubborn
when
people
are
telling
good
compliments
about
you
.
This
makes
people
think
you
're
overreacting
.
Especially
for
girls
.
What
's
the
hard
thing
of
saying
&quot;
Thank
You
&quot;
on
every
compliment
that
people
are
giving
?

If
there
's
just
one
kind
of
folks
,
why
ca
n't
they
get
along
with
each
other
?
If
they
're
all
alike
,
why
do
they
go
out
of
their
way
to
despise
each
other
?
&quot;
.
.
Just
look
at
that
quote
for
a
minute
.
What
comes
to
your
mind
is
about
your
worst
enemy
or
your
hypocrite
friend
or
whatever
kind
of
person
that
is
treating
you
really
bad
if
I
am
not
wrong
.
The
thing
here
is
,
do
n't
start
a
fight
with
anyone
if
you
do
n't
know
how
to
end
it
.
Do
n't
say
sorry
if
you
do
n't
mean
it
.
It
's
just
going
to
make
people
think
you
're
a
person
,
who
treats
people
as
you
want
to
.

Be
fun
!
Do
n't
be
mad
at
every
little
jokes
your
friend
made
on
you
.
It
's
just
a
joke
and
nothing
is
more
.
If
you
're
being
mad
,
than.
.
it
means
the
joke
is

do
something

Or
,
if
you
found
those
kinds
of
people

leave
them
alone
and
they
're
gonna
be
shy
themselves
because
