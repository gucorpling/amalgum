The
Rebellion
of
the
High
Ki
</head>
<p>
The
bold
speech
of
Nerle
's
made
the
two
damsels
laugh
at
the
same
time
,
and
their
sweet
laughter
sounded
like
rippling
strains
of
harmonious
music
.
But
the
two
Ki-Ki
frowned
angrily
,
and
the
two
Ki
looked
at
the
boy
in
surprise
,
as
if
wondering
at
his
temerity
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Who
are
these
strangers
?
&quot;
asked
the
pretty
High
Ki
,
speaking
together
as
all
the
twins
of
Twi
did
;
&quot;
and
why
are
they
not
mates
,
but
only
half
of
each
other
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
These
questions
,
your
Supreme
Highnesses
,
&quot;
said
the
blond-haired
pair
of
Ki-Ki
,
&quot;
we
are
unable
to
answer
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Perhaps
,
then
,
the
strangers
can
answer
themselves
,
&quot;
said
the
little
maids
,
smiling
first
upon
the
Ki-Ki
and
then
upon
the
prisoners
.
</p>
<p>
Prince
Marvel
bowed
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
am
from
the
great
outside
world
,
&quot;
said
he
,
&quot;
and
my
name
is
Prince
Marvel
.
Until
now
I
have
never
seen
people
that
live
in
pairs
,
and
speak
in
unison
,
and
act
in
the
same
way
and
think
the
same
thoughts
.
My
world
is
much
bigger
than
your
world
,
and
in
it
every
person
is
proud
to
think
and
act
for
himself
.
You
say
I
am
only
a
'
half
,
'
but
that
is
not
so
.
I
am
perfect
,
without
a
counterpart
;
my
friend
Nerle
is
perfect
without
a
counterpart
,
and
it
is
yourselves
who
are
halved
.
For
in
the
Land
of
Twi
no
person
is
complete
or
perfect
without
its
other
half
,
and
it
seems
to
take
two
of
you
to
make
one
man
--
or
one
maid
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
sweet
faces
of
the
twin
High
Ki
grew
thoughtful
at
this
speech
,
and
they
said
:
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Indeed
,
it
may
be
you
are
right
.
But
it
is
our
custom
in
Twi
to
do
everything
double
and
to
live
double
.
&quot;
Then
,
turning
to
the
Ki
,
they
asked
:
&quot;
Why
have
you
brought
these
strangers
here
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
To
ask
your
Supreme
Highnesses
to
permit
them
to
return
again
to
the
world
from
whence
they
came
,
&quot;
answered
the
Ki
,
both
of
them
regarding
their
supreme
rulers
earnestly
.
</p>
<p>
But
here
the
Ki-Ki
spoke
up
quickly
in
their
mild
voices
,
saying
:
</p>
<p>
&quot;
That
is
not
our
idea
,
your
Highnesses
.
We
,
the
Ki-Ki
of
Twi
,
think
it
best
the
strangers
should
be
put
to
death
.
And
we
pray
your
Supreme
Highnesses
to
favor
our
wish
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
two
little
maids
looked
from
the
Ki
to
the
Ki-Ki
,
and
frowned
and
pouted
their
rosy
lips
in
evident
perplexity
.
</p>
<p>
But
Nerle
whispered
to
Prince
Marvel
:
</p>
<p>
&quot;
It
's
all
up
with
us
!
I
know
very
well
why
her
royal
doublets
always
favors
the
Ki-Ki
.
It
's
because
they
are
young
and
handsome
,
while
the
Ki
are
old
and
ugly
.
Both
of
her
will
condemn
us
to
death
--
you
see
if
she
do
n't
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
This
seemed
somewhat
mixed
,
but
Nerle
was
in
earnest
,
and
Prince
Marvel
,
who
had
not
forgotten
his
fairy
lore
,
began
to
weave
a
silent
spell
over
the
head
of
the
nearest
twin
High
Ki
.
But
just
as
it
was
completed
,
and
before
he
had
time
to
work
the
spell
on
the
other
twin
,
the
Ki-Ki
grew
impatient
,
and
exclaimed
:
</p>
<p>
&quot;
We
beg
your
Highnesses
not
to
keep
us
waiting
.
Let
us
have
your
decision
at
once
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
And
the
twin
maidens
raised
their
fair
heads
and
replied
.
But
the
reply
was
of
such
a
nature
that
both
the
old
Ki
and
both
the
young
Ki-Ki
staggered
backward
in
amazement
.
For
one
of
the
twin
High
Ki
said
:
</p>
<p>
&quot;
They
shall
die
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
And
the
other
twin
High
Ki
said
at
the
same
instant
:
</p>
<p>
&quot;
They
shall
NOT
die
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Had
twin
thunderbolts
fallen
through
the
twin
roofs
of
the
twin
palaces
and
struck
the
twin
Ki
and
the
twin
Ki-Ki
upon
their
twin
heads
it
would
have
created
no
more
stupendous
a
sensation
than
did
this
remark
.
Never
before
had
any
two
halves
of
a
twin
of
the
Land
of
Twi
thought
differently
or
spoken
differently
.
Indeed
,
it
startled
the
two
maidens
themselves
as
much
as
it
did
their
hearers
,
for
each
one
turned
her
head
toward
the
other
and
,
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
,
looked
into
the
other
's
face
!
</p>
<p>
This
act
was
fully
as
strange
as
their
speech
,
and
a
sudden
horrible
thought
came
into
the
startled
heads
of
the
twin
Ki
and
the
twin
Ki-Ki
:
THE
HIGH
KI
OF
TWI
WAS
NO
LONGER
ONE
,
BUT
TWO
.
AND
THESE
TWO
WERE
THINKING
AND
ACTING
EACH
INDEPENDENT
OF
THE
OTHER
!
</p>
<p>
It
is
no
wonder
the
shock
rendered
them
speechless
for
a
time
,
and
they
stood
swaying
their
four
bodies
,
with
their
eight
eyes
bulging
out
like
those
of
fishes
and
their
four
mouths
wide
open
,
as
if
the
two
pairs
had
become
one
quartet
.
</p>
<p>
The
faces
of
the
two
maids
flushed
as
they
gazed
upon
each
other
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
How
DARE
you
contradict
me
?
&quot;
asked
one
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
How
dare
you
contradict
ME
?
&quot;
demanded
the
other
,
and
not
only
were
these
questions
asked
separately
,
but
the
accent
on
the
words
was
different
.
And
their
twin
minds
seemed
to
get
farther
apart
every
moment
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
'm
the
High
Ki
of
Twi
!
&quot;
said
one
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
You
're
not
!
I'M
the
High
Ki
!
&quot;
retorted
the
other
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
The
strangers
shall
die
!
&quot;
snapped
one
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
They
shall
live
!
&quot;
cried
the
other
.
&quot;
My
will
is
supreme
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
It
's
not
!
MY
will
is
supreme
,
&quot;
returned
the
other
twin
.
</p>
<p>
The
bald
heads
of
the
ancient
Ki
were
bobbing
in
amazement
,
first
to
one
maid
and
then
toward
the
other
.
The
blond
hairs
of
the
two
Ki-Ki
were
standing
almost
on
end
,
and
their
eyes
stared
straight
before
them
as
if
stupefied
with
astonishment
.
Nerle
was
bellowing
with
rude
laughter
and
holding
his
sides
to
keep
from
getting
a
stitch
in
them
,
while
Prince
Marvel
stood
quietly
attentive
and
smiling
with
genuine
amusement
.
For
he
alone
understood
what
had
happened
to
separate
the
twin
High
Ki
.
