The

vice-president

said

on

that
TVN
was
&quot;
evidently
trying
to
distort
information

&quot;
while
Marcelo

,
president
of
the
association
told
<hi rend="italic">

that
&quot;
[
TVN

is
trying
to
reduce
the
students
protests
only
to
what
is
doing
a
group
of
'
hooded

'
.
TVN
is
the
channel
of
all
the
Chileans
,
it
just
cannot
give
this
kind
of
messages
.

linked
the

with

It
