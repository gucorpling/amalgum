Sawega
wrote
that
Tan
's
name
remained
inexorably
linked
with
the
popular
literature
of
early
20th
century
Indonesia
.
However
,
owing
to
a
lack
of
documentation
of
his
publications
,
in
2002
the
Kediri
city
government
organized
a
team
to
research
Tan
's
oeuvre
and
his
life
.
A
spokesman
for
the
team
stated
that
they
intended
to
make
Tan
's
former
residence
into
a
tourist
attraction
