to

Queen

</ref>
.
These
claims
were
made
after
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Daily_Mail">
<hi rend="italic">
Daily
Mail

</ref>
described
him
as
a
&quot;
sex-obsessed
bigot
and
vile
buffoon
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Zuma
accused
Britons
of
considering
themselves
to
be
culturally
superior
owing
to
their
past
colonial
activities
.
&quot;
When
the
British
came
to
our
country
they
said
everything
we
did
was
barbaric
,
was
wrong
,
inferior
in
whatever
way
.
Bear
in
mind
that
I
'm
a
freedom
fighter
and
I
fought
to
free
myself
,
also
for
my
culture
to
be
respected
.
And
I
do
n't
know
why
they
are
continuing
thinking
that
their
culture
is
more
superior
than
others
,
those
who
might
have
said
so
,
&quot;
stated
Zuma
in
an
African
newspaper
.
</p>
<p>
According
to
him
,
he
had
never
&quot;
looked
down
upon
any
culture
of
anyone
&quot;
and
that
no
one
has
the
authority
of
judging
other
cultures
.
Zuma
added
,
&quot;
The
British
have
done
that
before
,
as
they
colonised
us
,
and
they
continue
to
do
this
,
and
it
's
an
unfortunate
thing
.
If
people
want
an
engagement
,
I
'm
sure
we
will
engage
on
that
issue
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
President
's
comments
were
published
in
a
local
private
newspaper
.
Zuma
,
who
has
three
current
wives
,
made
these
comments
after
arriving
in
Britain
with
Thobeka
Madiba
,
38
,
his
third
wife
.
</p>
<p>
The
Queen
will
welcome
them
at
the
Horse
Guards
Parade
and
take
them
to
Buckingham
Palace
thereafter
.
A
state
banquet
will
also
be
held
in
his
honor
at
the
palace
,
where
he
is
set
to
spend
two
nights
.
</p>
<p>
Zuma
,
a
member
of
the
Zulu
tribe
,
was
compelled
to
make
a
public
apology
following
a
love
child
with
the
daughter
of
a
friend
.
This
incident
triggered
the
articles
in
Daily
Mail
and
Daily
Mirror
which
attacked
Zuma
.

Jacob

,
President
of
South

</p>
<p>
Zuma
,
whose
state
trip
includes
meetings
with
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Gordon_Brown">
Gordon
Brown
</ref>
,
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/David_Cameron">

and
Nick

,
as
well
as
a
speech
to
members
of
parliament
,
plans
to
continue
with
the
visit
.
This
was
confirmed
by
officials
today
.
</p>
<p>
Vincent
Magwenya
,
Zuma
's
spokesman
said
the
incident
would
have
no
impact
in
Zuma
's
trip
.
</p>
<p>
Magwenya
stated
:
&quot;
Mr
Zuma
is
in
the
UK
for
wide-ranging
programme
of
substantial
and
serious
issues
.
The
comments
he
made
were
not
aimed
at
the
British
public
in
general
but
at
certain
sections
of
the
media
which
have
lambasted
him
for
what
he
considers
to
be
his
culture
.
Mr
Zuma
had
a
meeting
with
British
journalists
yesterday
and
was
asked
not
one
question
about
his
private
life
&quot;
.
</p>
<p>
He
also
added
that
Zuma
did
not
&quot;
appreciate
reading
things
which
he
considers
are
patronising
to
his
culture
&quot;
and
claimed
that
it
was
obvious
that
&quot;
his
comments
will
have
no
bearing
on
the
state
visit
.
&quot;
The
President
,
according
to
Magwneya
,
looks
forward
to
the
visit
and
will
continue
with
the
full
schedule
.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile
,
the
Democratic
Alliance
,
South
Africa
's
principal
opposition
party
,
stated
that
the
reports
in
the
British
newspapers
did
not
warrant
Zuma
's
lashing
out
at
Britain
.
</p>
<p>
Kenneth
Mubu
,
of
the
opposing
political
party
said
,
said
:
&quot;
Instead
of
rising
above
predictable
criticism
from
a
particular
quarter
of
the
British
press
,
he
has
allowed
himself
to
be
dragged
down
to
the
level
of
the
tabloids
.
By
accusing
the
British
people
of
believing
that
Africans
are
barbaric
and
inferior
,
he
has
insulted
his
hosts
,
and
no
doubt
undermined
the
entire
purpose
of
the
state
visit
–
which
is
to
strengthen
relations
between
South
Africa
and
the
United
Kingdom
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
youth
sector
of
the
African
National
Congress
supported
the
President
.
It
expressed
its
disgust
at
the
British
reports
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
British
media
seem
to
have
developed
a
habit
of
rubbishing
our
president
and
constantly
portray
him
as
barbaric
and
of
inferior
belonging
,
&quot;
the
youth
league
said
.
&quot;
It
is
quite
apparent
that
the
British
media
is
the
one
that
is
characterised
and
defined
by
the
worst
form
of
barbarism
,
backwardness
and
racism
.
These
British
racists
continue
to
live
in
a
dreamland
and
sadly
believe
that
Africans
are
still
their
colonial
subjects
,
with
no
values
and
principles
.
They
believe
that
the
only
acceptable
values
and
principles
in
the
world
are
British
values
of
whiteness
and
subjugation
of
Africans
,
&quot;
stated
the
party
.
