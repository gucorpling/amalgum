<sp who="#SecretGaygent128">
<p>
When
my
husband
was
little
and
his
mom
was
pregnant
with
his
sister
,
they
told
him
there
was
going
to
be
a
baby
.
They
then
asked
him
if
he
wanted
a
little
brother
or
a
little
sister
.
</p>
<p>
I
want
a
robot
.

Finally
,
something
I
can
answer
!
First
off
,
kids
say
a
LOT
more
than
parents
would
probably
like
to
know
.
I
had
a
girl
who
was
going
to
court
against
her
biodad
who
had
raped
her
(
got
the
full
story
from
a
coworker
)
,
and
she
would
not
stop
telling
people
Do
n't
let
(
biodads
first
name
)
come
near
you
because
he
's
mean
and
bad
and
will
touch
your
privates
!
it
really
shocked
me
because
this
girl
is
the
sweetest
and
funniest
little
girl
ever
,
shes
only
4
.
</p>
<p>
I
ve
had
kids
who
were
playing
barbies
and
one
of
the
mom
barbies
started
yelling
at
the
child
barbies
shit
like
I
wish
you
were
never
born
!
I
hate
you
!
I
wish
i
had
never
carried
you
etc.
Kids
who
talk
about
their
parents
fights
,
what
they
said
,
where
they
went
and
how
many
doors
they
slammed
.
Nothing
is
off
limits
at
(
a
good
)
daycare
,
because
children
ca
n't
go
through
these
things
alone
,
and
often
the
parents
do
n't
want
to
talk
about
it
or
they
're
the
ones
causing
the
problem
.
It
's
heartbreaking
really
.

Not
a
daycare
worker
but
mom
works
for
the
YMCA
and
she
once
had
a
girl
that
said
to
her
My
daddy
hits
me
sometimes
and
when
the
dad
showed
up
,
he
completely
denied
it
.

I
had
a
student
in
my
class
,
age
3
,
who
was
constantly
dropped
off
by
his
barefoot
mom
without
any
underwear
.
Granted
,
he
was
completely
potty-trained
so
it
was
n't
a
huge
deal
and
I
just
figured
out
they
were
hippies
.
So
one
day
,
we
're
coloring
and
talking
about
superheroes
and
punching
comes
up
.
My
mommy
punches
me
,
to
which
I
responded
,
you
mean
like
this
?
and
I
gave
him
a
light
friendly
nudge
like
hey
you
!
and
he
shook
his
head
.
No
like
this
.
and
he
SLAMMED
his
fist
down
on
the
table
.
So
I
told
him
that
it
was
a
good
thing
he
told
me
,
asked
for
a
subsitute
to
take
a
potty
time
(
which
was
our
code
for
I
need
help
from
a
senior
employee
-
if
you
actually
needed
to
pee
,
you
used
the
term
potty
break
.
)
My
manager
met
me
in
the
front
office
and
we
filed
a
complain
with
the
CPS
.
Unfortunately
,
I
gave
birth
about
a
week
later
and
never
returned
,
so
I
do
n't
know
what
became
of
him
:(
