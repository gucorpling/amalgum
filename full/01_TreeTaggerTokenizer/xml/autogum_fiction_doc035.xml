CHAPTER
II
.
JAKE
DUNLAP
</head>
<p>
WE
had
powerful
good
luck
;
because
we
got
a
chance
in
a
stern-wheeler
from
away
North
which
was
bound
for
one
of
them
bayous
or
one-horse
rivers
away
down
Louisiana
way
,
and
so
we
could
go
all
the
way
down
the
Upper
Mississippi
and
all
the
way
down
the
Lower
Mississippi
to
that
farm
in
Arkansaw
without
having
to
change
steamboats
at
St.
Louis
;
not
so
very
much
short
of
a
thousand
miles
at
one
pull
.
</p>
<p>
A
pretty
lonesome
boat
;
there
war
n't
but
few
passengers
,
and
all
old
folks
,
that
set
around
,
wide
apart
,
dozing
,
and
was
very
quiet
.
We
was
four
days
getting
out
of
the
“
upper
river
,
”
because
we
got
aground
so
much
.
But
it
war
n't
dull
--
could
n't
be
for
boys
that
was
traveling
,
of
course
.
</p>
<p>
From
the
very
start
me
and
Tom
allowed
that
there
was
somebody
sick
in
the
stateroom
next
to
ourn
,
because
the
meals
was
always
toted
in
there
by
the
waiters
.
By
and
by
we
asked
about
it
--
Tom
did
and
the
waiter
said
it
was
a
man
,
but
he
did
n't
look
sick
.
</p>
<p>
“
Well
,
but
AIN'T
he
sick
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
do
n't
know
;
maybe
he
is
,
but
'
pears
to
me
he
's
just
letting
on
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
What
makes
you
think
that
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Because
if
he
was
sick
he
would
pull
his
clothes
off
SOME
time
or
other
--
do
n't
you
reckon
he
would
?
Well
,
this
one
do
n't
.
At
least
he
do
n't
ever
pull
off
his
boots
,
anyway
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
The
mischief
he
do
n't
!
Not
even
when
he
goes
to
bed
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
No.
”
</p>
<p>
It
was
always
nuts
for
Tom
Sawyer
--
a
mystery
was
.
If
you
'd
lay
out
a
mystery
and
a
pie
before
me
and
him
,
you
would
n't
have
to
say
take
your
choice
;
it
was
a
thing
that
would
regulate
itself
.
Because
in
my
nature
I
have
always
run
to
pie
,
whilst
in
his
nature
he
has
always
run
to
mystery
.
People
are
made
different
.
And
it
is
the
best
way
.
Tom
says
to
the
waiter
:
</p>
<p>
“
What
's
the
man
's
name
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Phillips
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Where
'd
he
come
aboard
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
think
he
got
aboard
at
Elexandria
,
up
on
the
Iowa
line
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
What
do
you
reckon
he
's
a-playing
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
hai
n't
any
notion
--
I
never
thought
of
it
.
”
</p>
<p>
I
says
to
myself
,
here
's
another
one
that
runs
to
pie
.
</p>
<p>
“
Anything
peculiar
about
him
?
--
the
way
he
acts
or
talks
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
No
--
nothing
,
except
he
seems
so
scary
,
and
keeps
his
doors
locked
night
and
day
both
,
and
when
you
knock
he
wo
n't
let
you
in
till
he
opens
the
door
a
crack
and
sees
who
it
is
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
By
jimminy
,
it
's
int'resting
!
I
'd
like
to
get
a
look
at
him
.
Say
--
the
next
time
you
're
going
in
there
,
do
n't
you
reckon
you
could
spread
the
door
and
--
”
</p>
<p>
“
No
,
indeedy
!
He
's
always
behind
it
.
He
would
block
that
game
.
”
</p>
<p>
Tom
studied
over
it
,
and
then
he
says
:
</p>
<p>
“
Looky
here
.
You
lend
me
your
apern
and
let
me
take
him
his
breakfast
in
the
morning
.
I
'll
give
you
a
quarter
.
”
</p>
<p>
The
boy
was
plenty
willing
enough
,
if
the
head
steward
would
n't
mind
.
Tom
says
that
's
all
right
,
he
reckoned
he
could
fix
it
with
the
head
steward
;
and
he
done
it
.
He
fixed
it
so
as
we
could
both
go
in
with
aperns
on
and
toting
vittles
.
</p>
<p>
He
did
n't
sleep
much
,
he
was
in
such
a
sweat
to
get
in
there
and
find
out
the
mystery
about
Phillips
;
and
moreover
he
done
a
lot
of
guessing
about
it
all
night
,
which
war
n't
no
use
,
for
if
you
are
going
to
find
out
the
facts
of
a
thing
,
what
's
the
sense
in
guessing
out
what
ai
n't
the
facts
and
wasting
ammunition
?
I
did
n't
lose
no
sleep
.
I
would
n't
give
a
dern
to
know
what
's
the
matter
of
Phillips
,
I
says
to
myself
.
</p>
<p>
Well
,
in
the
morning
we
put
on
the
aperns
and
got
a
couple
of
trays
of
truck
,
and
Tom
he
knocked
on
the
door
.
The
man
opened
it
a
crack
,
and
then
he
let
us
in
and
shut
it
quick
.
By
Jackson
,
when
we
got
a
sight
of
him
,
we
'
most
dropped
the
trays
!
and
Tom
says
:
</p>
<p>
“
Why
,
Jubiter
Dunlap
,
where
'd
YOU
come
from
?
”
</p>
<p>
Well
,
the
man
was
astonished
,
of
course
;
and
first
off
he
looked
like
he
did
n't
know
whether
to
be
scared
,
or
glad
,
or
both
,
or
which
,
but
finally
he
settled
down
to
being
glad
;
and
then
his
color
come
back
,
though
at
first
his
face
had
turned
pretty
white
.
So
we
got
to
talking
together
while
he
et
his
breakfast
.
And
he
says
:
</p>
<p>
“
But
I
aint
Jubiter
Dunlap
.
I
'd
just
as
soon
tell
you
who
I
am
,
though
,
if
you
'll
swear
to
keep
mum
,
for
I
ai
n't
no
Phillips
,
either
.
”
</p>
<p>
Tom
says
:
</p>
<p>
“
We
'll
keep
mum
,
but
there
ai
n't
any
need
to
tell
who
you
are
if
you
ai
n't
Jubiter
Dunlap
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Why
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Because
if
you
ai
n't
him
you
're
t'other
twin
,
Jake
.
You
're
the
spit'n
image
of
Jubiter
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Well
,
I
'm
Jake
.
But
looky
here
,
how
do
you
come
to
know
us
Dunlaps
?
”
</p>
<p>
Tom
told
about
the
adventures
we
'd
had
down
there
at
his
uncle
Silas
's
last
summer
,
and
when
he
see
that
there
war
n't
anything
about
his
folks
--
or
him
either
,
for
that
matter
--
that
we
did
n't
know
,
he
opened
out
and
talked
perfectly
free
and
candid
.
He
never
made
any
bones
about
his
own
case
;
said
he
'd
been
a
hard
lot
,
was
a
hard
lot
yet
,
and
reckoned
he
'd
be
a
hard
lot
plumb
to
the
end
.
He
said
of
course
it
was
a
dangerous
life
,
and
--
He
give
a
kind
of
gasp
,
and
set
his
head
like
a
person
that
's
listening
.
We
did
n't
say
anything
,
and
so
it
was
very
still
for
a
second
or
so
,
and
there
war
n't
no
sounds
but
the
screaking
of
the
woodwork
and
the
chug-chugging
of
the
machinery
down
below
.
