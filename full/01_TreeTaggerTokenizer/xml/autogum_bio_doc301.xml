Early
life
</head>
<p>
St.
Santhalingar
lived
in
Perur
three
hundred
years
ago
.
Perur
is
known
as
Chidambaram
west
.
(
The
chidambaram
East
is
in
South
Arcot
Dt
.
)
It
is
believed
that
he
should
have
been
born
either
in
the
&quot;
Nadu
Nadu
&quot;
or
&quot;
Thondai
Nadu
&quot;
where
the
'
Vira
Saiva
'
religion
,
was
popular
.
From
his
very
childhood
he
developed
love
to
serve
Lord
Siva
ascetics
,
to
respect
and
revere
the
symbols
of
Siva
,
namely
Vibuthi
and
Rudraksha
.
His
company
with
holy
people
inducted
him
to
perceive
the
vanity
of
the
worldly
things
.
He
abhorred
the
idea
of
birth
and
rebirth
.
He
under
took
a
pilgrimage
to
all
the
holy
cities
where
Lord
Siva
reigns
supreme
in
search
of
a
Guru
who
could
initiate
him
in
this
birth
ridding
process
.

<p>
Perur
is
sacred
not
only
because
it
is
one
of
the
'
sivasthalams
'
of
Kongunadu
,
but
also
because
the
Divine
grace
of
Lord
Siva
is
so
immanent
and
perceptible
that
when
Sundaramoorthy
Nayanar
,
one
of
the
four
preceptors
of
Saivism
,
went
to
chidambaram
to
worship
Lord
Nataraja
,
he
found
there
but
the
deity
of
Perur
.
He
stays
in
this
Thillaikkoil
hymn
.
Hence
it
is
no
wonder
that
our
St.
Santhalinga
Swamigal
was
also
attracted
by
this
holy
city
.

,

His
family
life
was
in
conformity
with
the
maxim
&quot;
If
a
man
fulfilled
aright
the
duties
of
the
house-holder
,
where
is
the
need
for
him
to
take
up
other
duties
?
&quot;
His
family
life
never
stood
in
the
way
of
his
endeavours
in
realisation
of
Truth
.
By
undaunted
perseverance
he
rose
to
perfection
.
Pupils
flocked
around
him
to
par
take
his
teachings
.
One
day
when
he
spoke
on
total
renunciation
,
condemning
the
love
for
transient
worldly
things
,
some
of
his
reactionary
students
began
to
indulge
in
scandalising
the
verity
of
his
speech
.
&quot;
Could
it
be
possible
for
a
man
living
with
his
wife
to
preach
total
renunciation
,
unless
he
be
a
hypocrite
?
&quot;
they
doubted
.
Sensing
their
feelings
,
St.
Santhalingar
,
seated
his
wife
Mrs.
Gnambikai
on
his
lap
and
continued
his
teaching
.
To
their
utter
bewilderment
they
saw
Lord
Neelkanta
with
his
consort
Gowri
in
the
place
of
St.
Santhalingar
and
his
wife
Gnanambikai
.
The
pupils
fell
down
instantaneously
before
Swamigal
and
apologised
fervently
for
their
mistake
.
Swamigal
took
pity
on
them
and
loved
them
more
than
before
.
After
this
incident
he
resolved
to
renounce
the
world
thoroughly
in
its
entirety
and
declared
that
he
would
set
out
for
alms
next
day
and
that
if
he
was
served
rice
with
milk
at
the
very
first
house
he
approached
,
he
would
become
a
complete
ascetic
thenceforth
.
He
was
served
rice
with
milk
at
the
very
first
house
he
resorted
to
.
From
that
moment
he
broke
all
his
worldly
attachment
and
renounced
the
world
utterly
.

were

The
later
years
</head>
<p>
At
a
proper
time
St.
Santhalinga
Swamigal
gave
vent
to
his
long
cherished
desire
to
be
initiated
in
the
noble
venture
of
the
realisation
of
God
.
Observing
the
'
upadesa
'
,
he
was
enjoying
the
divine
bliss
in
the
presence
of
his
Guru
.
Sometime
later
,
his
Guru
ordered
him
to
settle
in
a
place
he
liked
and
work
for
the
salvation
of
the
humanity
.
Obeying
the
order
,
St.
Santhalinga
Swamigal
settled
at
Perur
,
the
holy
city
where
his
favourite
deity
Lord
Nataraja
reigns
supreme
and
continued
his
religious
pursuits
.
His
fame
began
to
spread
far
and
wide
around
Perur
.
His
retinue
began
to
swell
in
the
form
of
followers
and
well-wishers
.
Except
the
time
he
spent
for
bathing
,
dieting
and
teaching
,
almost
the
whole
of
the
day
was
devoted
in
meditation
.
One
day
when
he
opened
his
eyes
after
meditation
,
Lord
Nataraja
with
his
consort
Maragathabikai
.
,
-seated
on
Nandhi
,
appeared
before
him
.
St.
Santhalinga
Swamigal
enjoyed
the
vision
of
God
with
devouring
look
.
He
,
with
down
pouring
eyes
,
hands
folded
on
his
head
with
reverence
,
with
melting
heart
,
prostrated
before
the
God
numberless
times
.
His
hymns
bear
many
references
vouching
for
this
incident
(
Vairakkiya
Catakam
Devotional
part
)
when
the
vision
disappeared
his
languish
was
indescribable
.
He
craved
to
have
the
'
darshan
'
once
again
as
can
be
seen
in
his
works
.
The
power
of
his
'
Tapas
'
was
so
strong
that
when-ever
he
set
out
for
alms
,
the
womenfolk
hurriedly
rushed
to
cover
their
sons
and
men
folk
,
fearing
that
his
very
sight
would
infuse
in
them
'
Vairakkiya
'
and
render
them
renounce
the
world
immediately
