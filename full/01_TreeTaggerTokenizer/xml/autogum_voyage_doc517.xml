History
</head>
<p>
The
Gloucester
district
was
first
visited
by
Robert
Dawson
,
Chief
Agent
for
the
Australian
Agricultural
Company
-
or
the
A.A.
Company
as
it
was
generally
known
-
in
1826
.
Settlement
occurred
in
the
1830s
.
The
township
of
Gloucester
was
first
established
in
1855
,
primarily
for
sheep
farming
,
however
it
became
apparent
that
the
land
was
not
entirely
suitable
.
The
four
main
industries
of
the
Gloucester
area
are
:
tourism
,
timber
,
cattle
farming
and
,
now
,
coal
.
The
timber
industry
has
been
prevalent
in
Gloucester
since
the
late
19th
century
,
and
it
and
cattle
farming
are
still
major
industries
in
and
around
Gloucester
;
both
dairy
and
beef
cattle
.
</p>
<p>
For
most
of
the
twentieth
century
it
boasted
two
cinemas
in
the
main
thoroughfare
-
Church
Street
:
The
Star
(
opposite
Permewans
,
closed
c1968
)
,
and
the
Majestic
Theatre
(
built
early
1920s
)
.
The
Majestic
did
not
permanently
close
its
doors
until
c1980
,
and
although
the
building
still
stands
it
is
now
a
shopping
arcade
.
The
district
has
a
weekly
newspaper
,
<hi rend="italic">
The
Gloucester
Advocate
.
</hi>
</p>
<p>
In
March
1972
His
Excellency
the
Governor
of
New
South
Wales
,
Sir
Roden
Cutler
,
VC
,
etc.
,
and
Lady
Cutler
toured
the
district
and
attended
a
formal
Civic
Reception
at
the
Gloucester
Bucketts
Motel
.
</p>
<p>
In
1876
,
gold
was
discovered
in
Copeland
,
a
small
town
north-west
of
Gloucester
.
Copeland
became
a
large
town
of
over
3,000
inhabitants
due
to
the
gold
discovery
and
the
large
number
of
red
cedar
(
Toona
australis
)
trees
.
However
,
the
population
has
since
dwindled
to
a
population
of
a
few
hundred
.
</p>
<p>
The
Australian
Agricultural
Company
had
been
awarded
mineral
rights
to
half
a
million
acres
(
2,000
km
Â²
)
between
the
Karuah
River
and
the
Manning
River
,
which
covered
the
Gloucester
district
.
The
company
employed
surveyors
in
1856-7
to
undertake
a
trial
survey
for
a
railway
between
Port
Stephens
and
Stroud
,
New
South
Wales
and
north
passing
what
became
Gloucester
to
the
Manning
River
.
At
the
time
it
was
felt
that
with
the
&quot;
formidable
obstructions
&quot;
from
ranges
and
rivers
a
line
would
be
impracticable
and
construction
was
not
proceeded
with
,
and
coal
mining
was
abandoned
before
it
had
commenced
.
</p>
<p>
However
,
in
1995
,
Gloucester
Coal
,
originally
Stratford
Coal
,
began
mining
in
Stratford
,
a
small
town
12
km
south
of
Gloucester
,
this
is
the
only
active
coal
mine
in
the
region
.
</p>
<p>
Over
the
past
few
years
Gloucester
Resources
has
bought
land
closer
to
the
township
for
the
purpose
of
mining
.
Although
the
majority
of
the
local
community
oppose
the
operation
,
it
is
possible
that
in
the
next
few
years
mining
in
the
area
will
commence
and
taint
this
beautiful
valley
permanently
.
