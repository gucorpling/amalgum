THE
RUBE
</head>
<p>
It
was
the
most
critical
time
I
had
yet
experienced
in
my
career
as
a
baseball
manager
.
And
there
was
more
than
the
usual
reason
why
I
must
pull
the
team
out
.
A
chance
for
a
business
deal
depended
upon
the
good-will
of
the
stockholders
of
the
Worcester
club
.
On
the
outskirts
of
the
town
was
a
little
cottage
that
I
wanted
to
buy
,
and
this
depended
upon
the
business
deal
.
My
whole
future
happiness
depended
upon
the
little
girl
I
hoped
to
install
in
that
cottage
.
</p>
<p>
Coming
to
the
Worcester
Eastern
League
team
,
I
had
found
a
strong
aggregation
and
an
enthusiastic
following
.
I
really
had
a
team
with
pennant
possibilities
.
Providence
was
a
strong
rival
,
but
I
beat
them
three
straight
in
the
opening
series
,
set
a
fast
pace
,
and
likewise
set
Worcester
baseball
mad
.
The
Eastern
League
clubs
were
pretty
evenly
matched
;
still
I
continued
to
hold
the
lead
until
misfortune
overtook
me
.
</p>
<p>
Gregg
smashed
an
umpire
and
had
to
be
laid
off
.
Mullaney
got
spiked
while
sliding
and
was
out
of
the
game
.
Ashwell
sprained
his
ankle
and
Hirsch
broke
a
finger
.
Radbourne
,
my
great
pitcher
,
hurt
his
arm
on
a
cold
day
and
he
could
not
get
up
his
old
speed
.
Stringer
,
who
had
batted
three
hundred
and
seventy-one
and
led
the
league
the
year
before
,
struck
a
bad
spell
and
could
not
hit
a
barn
door
handed
up
to
him
.
</p>
<p>
Then
came
the
slump
.
The
team
suddenly
let
down
;
went
to
pieces
;
played
ball
that
would
have
disgraced
an
amateur
nine
.
It
was
a
trying
time
.
Here
was
a
great
team
,
strong
everywhere
.
A
little
hard
luck
had
dug
up
a
slump
--
and
now
!
Day
by
day
the
team
dropped
in
the
race
.
When
we
reached
the
second
division
the
newspapers
flayed
us
.
Worcester
would
never
stand
for
a
second
division
team
.
Baseball
admirers
,
reporters
,
fans
--
especially
the
fans
--
are
fickle
.
The
admirers
quit
,
the
reporters
grilled
us
,
and
the
fans
,
though
they
stuck
to
the
games
with
that
barnacle-like
tenacity
peculiar
to
them
,
made
life
miserable
for
all
of
us
.
I
saw
the
pennant
slowly
fading
,
and
the
successful
season
,
and
the
business
deal
,
and
the
cottage
,
and
Milly
--
--
</p>
<p>
But
when
I
thought
of
her
I
just
could
not
see
failure
.
Something
must
be
done
,
but
what
?
I
was
at
the
end
of
my
wits
.
When
Jersey
City
beat
us
that
Saturday
,
eleven
to
two
,
shoving
us
down
to
fifth
place
with
only
a
few
percentage
points
above
the
Fall
River
team
,
I
grew
desperate
,
and
locking
my
players
in
the
dressing
room
I
went
after
them
.
They
had
lain
down
on
me
and
needed
a
jar
.
I
told
them
so
straight
and
flat
,
and
being
bitter
,
I
did
not
pick
and
choose
my
words
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
And
fellows
,
&quot;
I
concluded
,
&quot;
you
've
got
to
brace
.
A
little
more
of
this
and
we
ca
n't
pull
out
.
I
tell
you
you
're
a
championship
team
.
We
had
that
pennant
cinched
.
A
few
cuts
and
sprains
and
hard
luck
--
and
you
all
quit
!
You
lay
down
!
I
've
been
patient
.
I
've
plugged
for
you
.
Never
a
man
have
I
fined
or
thrown
down
.
But
now
I
'm
at
the
end
of
my
string
.
I
'm
out
to
fine
you
now
,
and
I
'll
release
the
first
man
who
shows
the
least
yellow
.
I
play
no
more
substitutes
.
Crippled
or
not
,
you
guys
have
got
to
get
in
the
game
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
I
waited
to
catch
my
breath
and
expected
some
such
outburst
as
managers
usually
get
from
criticized
players
.
But
not
a
word
!
Then
I
addressed
some
of
them
personally
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Gregg
,
your
lay-off
ends
today
.
You
play
Monday
.
Mullaney
,
you
've
drawn
your
salary
for
two
weeks
with
that
spiked
foot
.
If
you
ca
n't
run
on
it
--
well
,
all
right
,
but
I
put
it
up
to
your
good
faith
.
I
've
played
the
game
and
I
know
it
's
hard
to
run
on
a
sore
foot
.
But
you
can
do
it
.
Ashwell
,
your
ankle
is
lame
,
I
know
--
now
,
can
you
run
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Sure
I
can
.
I
'm
not
a
quitter
.
I
'm
ready
to
go
in
,
&quot;
replied
Ashwell
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Raddy
,
how
about
you
?
&quot;
I
said
,
turning
to
my
star
twirler
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Connelly
,
I
've
seen
as
fast
a
team
in
as
bad
a
rut
and
yet
pull
out
,
&quot;
returned
Radbourne
.
&quot;
We
're
about
due
for
the
brace
.
When
it
comes
--
look
out
!
As
for
me
,
well
,
my
arm
is
n't
right
,
but
it
's
acting
these
warm
days
in
a
way
that
tells
me
it
will
be
soon
.
It
's
been
worked
too
hard
.
Ca
n't
you
get
another
pitcher
?
I
'm
not
knocking
Herne
or
Cairns
.
They
're
good
for
their
turn
,
but
we
need
a
new
man
to
help
out
.
And
he
must
be
a
crackerjack
if
we
're
to
get
back
to
the
lead
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Where
on
earth
can
I
find
such
a
pitcher
?
&quot;
I
shouted
,
almost
distracted
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Well
,
that
's
up
to
you
,
&quot;
replied
Radbourne
.
</p>
<p>
Up
to
me
it
certainly
was
,
and
I
cudgeled
my
brains
for
inspiration
.
After
I
had
given
up
in
hopelessness
it
came
in
the
shape
of
a
notice
I
read
in
one
of
the
papers
.
It
was
a
brief
mention
of
an
amateur
Worcester
ball
team
being
shut
out
in
a
game
with
a
Rickettsville
nine
.
Rickettsville
played
Sunday
ball
,
which
gave
me
an
opportunity
to
look
them
over
.
</p>
<p>
It
took
some
train
riding
and
then
a
journey
by
coach
to
get
to
Rickettsville
.
I
mingled
with
the
crowd
of
talking
rustics
.
There
was
only
one
little
&quot;
bleachers
&quot;
and
this
was
loaded
to
the
danger
point
with
the
feminine
adherents
of
the
teams
.
Most
of
the
crowd
centered
alongside
and
back
of
the
catcher
's
box
.
I
edged
in
and
got
a
position
just
behind
the
stone
that
served
as
home
plate
.
