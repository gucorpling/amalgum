What
is
a
new
goal

</hi>
Balance
.
Trying
to
grow
my
career
enough
to
make
sure
it
does
n’t
consume
me
.
It
’s
hard
to
balance
a
touring
career
because
there
is
no
structure
to
your
life
.
I
’m
trying
to
take
this
dream
and
make
it
work
as
a
job
.

<hi rend="bold">

How
challenging
is
it
to
obtain
that

?

</hi>
There
’s
not
a
lot
of
money
in
the
folk
world
.
In
generally
right
now
I
think
people
’s
numbers
are
down
and
only
a
few
people
can
make
a
living
at
it
.
It
’s
pretty
competitive
.
I
’m
doing
okay
,
but
there
’s
no
huge
riches
in
it
so
I
’m
trying
to
think
of
my
future
and
maintain
a
balance
in
it
.

DS
:
Do
you
think
of
doing
something
less
folk-oriented
to
give
your
career
a
push
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
Not
really
,
I
’ve
done
that
a
little
bit
by
trying
to
approach
the
major
labels
,
but
that
was
when
the
major
labels
were
dying
so
I
came
in
at
a
bad
time
for
that
.
I
found
that
when
it
comes
to
do
it
yourself
,
the
folk
world
is
the
best
place
to
make
money
because
as
soon
as
you
go
major
you
are
paying
a
band
.

More

What
things

doing

</hi>
Giving
up
control
is
hard
when
you
have
a
producer
.
His
vision
,
sometimes
,
is
something
you
ca
n’t
understand
and
have
to
trust
sometimes
.
See
how
it
comes
out
.
That
was
hard
for
me
,
because
up
until
now
I
have
been
such
a
do
it
yourself
,
writing
my
own
songs
,
recording
them
myself
.

I
’d
like
to
say
my
guitar

but
I
’m
still
looking
for
a
good
one

I
have
this

When
I
was
in
college
I
had
a
romantic
friend
named
David
,
he
was
kind
of
my
first
love
.
We
were
young
and
found
this
latex
glove
in
a
parking
lot
.
We
though
,
“
Oh
,
this
is
a
nice
glove
,
we
’ll
name
him
Duncan
.
”
</p>

DS

You
found
a
latex
glove
in
a
parking
lot
and
you
decided
to
take
it
?
</hi>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">
AD
:
</hi>
Yeah
[

.
He
became
the
symbol
of
our
friendship
.
He
’s
disgusting
at
this
point
,
he
’s
falling
apart
.
But
David
and
I
are
still
friends
and
we
’ll
pass
him
back
and
forth
to
each
other
every
three
years
or
so
when
we
’ve
forgotten
his
existence
.
David
surprised
me
at
a
show
in
Philly
.
He
gave
Duncan
to
the
sound
man
who
brought
it
back
stage
,
and
now
I
have
Duncan
.
So
he
’s
kind
of
special
to
me
.
