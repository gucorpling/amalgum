<head>
Biography
according
to
legend
</head>
<p>
Black
Caesar
,
according
to
traditional
accounts
,
was
a
prominent
African
tribal
war
chieftain
.
Widely
known
for
his
<hi rend="italic">
&quot;
huge
size
,
immense
strength
and
keen
intelligence
,
&quot;
</hi>
he
evaded
capture
from
many
different
slave
traders
.
Caesar
was
finally
captured
when
he
and
twenty
of
his
warriors
were
lured
onto
a
ship
by
a
slave
trader
.
Showing
him
a
watch
,
the
trader
promised
to
show
him
and
his
warriors
more
objects
,
which
were
<hi rend="italic">
&quot;
too
heavy
and
too
numerous
to
bring
on
shore
&quot;
</hi>
if
they
came
aboard
his
ship
.
He
enticed
them
to
stay
with
food
,
musical
instruments
,
silk
scarves
and
jewels
,
however
he
had
his
men
raise
anchor
and
slowly
sail
away
.
When
Caesar
discovered
what
was
happening
,
he
and
his
men
attempted
to
charge
their
captors
but
were
driven
back
by
the
well-armed
sailors
using
swords
and
pistols
.
Although
it
took
a
considerable
length
of
time
for
him
and
his
warriors
to
accept
their
captivity
,
he
was
eventually
befriended
by
a
sailor
who
was
the
only
man
Black
Caesar
would
accept
food
and
water
from
.
</p>
<p>
As
they
neared
the
coast
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida">
Florida
</ref>
,
the
sudden
appearance
of
a
hurricane
threatened
to
destroy
the
ship
on
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Reef">
Florida
Reefs
</ref>
.
Recognizing
the
ship
's
imminent
destruction
,
the
sailor
snuck
below
decks
and
freed
Caesar
.
The
two
then
forced
the
captain
and
crew
into
a
corner
,
most
likely
at
gunpoint
,
and
boarded
one
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longboat">
longboats
</ref>
with
ammunition
and
other
supplies
.
The
wind
and
waves
pushed
them
to
shore
where
they
waited
out
the
storm
,
apparently
the
only
survivors
of
the
doomed
ship
.
</p>
<p>
They
soon
began
using
the
lifeboat
to
lure
passing
ships
which
stopped
to
give
assistance
.
While
posing
as
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shipwreck">
shipwrecked
</ref>
sailors
,
they
would
sail
out
to
the
vessel
offering
to
take
them
aboard
.
Once
they
were
close
to
the
vessel
,
they
brought
out
their
guns
and
demanded
supplies
and
ammunition
,
threatening
to
sink
the
ship
if
they
were
refused
.
He
and
the
sailor
continued
this
ploy
for
a
number
of
years
and
amassed
a
sizable
amount
of
treasure
which
was
buried
on
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_Key">

.

However
,
he
and
the
sailor
had
a
falling
out
over
a
young
woman
the
mate
had
brought
back
from
one
of
the
ships
they
had
looted
.
Fighting
over
her
,
Caesar
killed
his
longtime
friend
in
a
duel
and
took
the
woman
for
his
own
.
</p>
<p>
He
began
taking
on
more
pirates
over
time
and
soon
was
able
to
attack
ships
on
the
open
sea
.
He
and
his
crew
were
often
able
to
avoid
capture
by
running
into
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_Creek_(Florida)">
Caesar
Creek
</ref>
and
other
inlets
between
Elliot
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Rhodes_Key">
Old
Rhodes
Key
</ref>
and
onto
the
mangrove
islands
.
Using
a
metal
ring
embedded
in
a
rock
,
they
ran
a
strong
rope
through
the
ring
,
heel
the
boat
over
,
and
hide
their
boat
in
the
water
until
the
patrol
ship
or
some
other
danger
went
away
.
They
might
also
lower
the
mast
and
sink
the
ship
in
shallow
water
,
later
cutting
the
rope
or
pumping
out
the
water
to
raise
the
boat
and
continue
raiding
.
It
is
thought
that
he
and
his
men
buried
26
bars
of
silver
on
the
island
,
although
no
treasure
has
ever
been
recovered
from
the
island
.
</p>
<p>
He
apparently
had
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harem">
harem
</ref>
on
his
island
,
having
at
least
100
women
seized
from
passing
ships
,
as
well
as
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internment">
prison
camp
</ref>
which
he
kept
prisoners
in
stone
huts
hoping
to
ransom
them
.
When
leaving
the
island
to
go
on
raids
,
he
left
no
provisions
for
these
prisoners
and
many
eventually
starved
to
death
.
A
few
children
reportedly
escaped
captivity
,
subsisting
on
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berries">
berries
</ref>
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellfish">
shellfish
</ref>
,
and
formed
their
own
language
and
customs
.
This
society
of
lost
children
gave
rise
to
native
superstition
that
the
island
is
haunted
.
</p>
<p>
During
the
early
18th
century
,
Caesar
left

However

Caesar
was
stopped
by
one
of

captives
who
tackled
him
as
he
prepared
to
light
a

of
gunpowder

He
struggled
with
the
man
below
decks
until
several
of

able

restrain

Taken
