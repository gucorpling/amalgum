Why
have
you
chosen
to
involve
yourself
in
the
political
process
?
Why
did
you
choose
to
run
in
this
constituency
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
I
became
involved
because
through
my
work
as
a
legal
clinic
lawyer
,
I
came
into
contact
with
many
people
with
problems
either
deliberately
created
or
inadvertently
worsened
by
bad
public
policy
.
I
chose
to
run
here
because
I
live
here
and
love
the
strong
characters
and
families
I
meet
here
.

<hi rend="bold">
What
prior

experience

you
have

What
skills
and
insight
can
you
bring
to
office
,
from
other
non-political
positions
you
may
have
held
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
I
ran
for
the
first
time
in
the
2003
provincial
election
and
have
been
involved
in
NDP
politics
for
about
15
years
.
I
have
worked
with
and
,
in
several
cases
,
helped
found
a
range
of
non-profit
community
organizations
,
as
well
as
others
working
at
the
provincial
and
national
levels
.
As
a
lawyer
and
full-time
volunteer
I
have
a
good
sense
of
how
to
work
with
people
,
how
things
get
done
and
how
to
make
things
happen

Which
of
your
competitors
do
you
expect
to
pose
the
biggest
challenge
to
your
candidacy
?
Why
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
John
Yakabuski
,
as
incumbent
and
as
the
capital-C
conservative
in
a
riding
that
is
in
many
ways
conservative-minded
,
has
a
large
advantage
,
especially
due
to
the
loyalty
his
late
father
,
the
former
MPP
Paul
Yakabuski
,
commanded
.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">
What
makes
you
the
most
desirable
of
all
candidates
running
in
the
riding
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke
is
economically
disadvantaged
.
People
here
need
an
advocate
who
takes
up
the
case
of
ordinary
people
and
families
.
The
Conservatives
and
Liberals
are
the
voices
of
big
business
and
the
well-off
.
Their
policies
do
not
represent
the
best
interests
of
the
kind
of
lower-
and
middle-income
families
who
live
here
.
The
NDP
's
policies
and
commitments
do
.

What
do
you
feel
are
the
three
most
important
issues
to
voters
in
your
riding
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
It
is
hard
to
settle
on
just
three
,
but
broadly
,
we
might
say
<list type="ordered">
<item>
poverty
and
cuts
to
public
services
</item>
<item>
rural
decline
and
the
lack
of
positive
response
to
change
in
the
rural
economy
</item>
<item>
the
needs
of
an
aging
society
</item>
</list>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Are
these
the
same
top
three
issues
that
are
most
important
to
you
?
What
would
you
do
to
address
these
issues
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
These
are
some
of
the
issues
on
which
my
campaign
is
focusing
.
The
points
in
my
campaign
literature
summarize
our
key
pledges
to
voters
:
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Increasing
the
minimum
wage
to
$
10
per
hour
.
NOW
.
</item>
<item>
Fixing
the
Harris/McGuinty
school
funding
formula
and
putting
money
back
into
our
kids
'
education
.
</item>
<item>
Protecting
our
children
's
health
and
environment
with
a
right-to-know
law
,
and
fighting
climate
change
</item>
<item>
a
Heath
Tax
Rebate
for
working
families
and
shorter
health
care
wait
times
</item>
<item>
Guaranteed
minimum
standards
of
care
for
seniors
</item>
<item>
Removing
barriers
to
university
,
college
and
apprenticeship
training
,
and
rolling
back
tuition
fees
,
eliminating
them
for
apprenticeship
.

What
should
be
the
first
order
of
business
in
the
39th
Legislative
Assembly
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
Increasing
the
minimum
wage
to
CA$
10
per
hour
would
be
a
good
and
easy
place
to
start
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Are
the
property
taxes
in
your
riding
at
a
fair
level
for
the
amount
of
services
received
in
the
municipality
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
No.
The
assessment
formula
brought
in
by
the
Conservatives
and
never
fixed
by
the
Liberals
has
combined
with
provincial
downloading
to
place
an
unfair
burden
on
local
ratepayers
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
How
can
the
province
lead
the
way
in
stimulating
job
creation
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
An
NDP
government
would
invest
in
green
industries
,
from
the
construction
of
public
transportation
to
the
installation
of
insulation
and
the
production
of
energy-saving
appliances
.
This
could
produce
new
jobs
and
place
Ontario
at
the
forefront
of
a
worldwide
movement
to
fight
global
warming
.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">
What
are
your
views
on
the
mixed
member
proportional
representation
(
MMP
)
referendum
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
I
support
it
.
The
current
system
is
antiquated
.
It
does
not
fairly
reflect
the
views
of
the
public
and
frequently
results
in
skewed
electoral
results
.
I
believe
the
referendum
proposal
is
a
good
step
toward
correcting
these
problems
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
What
role
,
if
any
,
does
“
new
media
”
play
in
your
campaign
,
and
the
campaign
of
your
party
?
(
websites
,
blogs
,
Facebook
,
YouTube
videos
,
etc
)
Do
you
view
it
as
beneficial
,
or
a
challenge
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
We
use
our
website
and
email
extensively
in
our
campaign
.
They
have
completely
changed
how
we
run
campaigns
.
Because
there
are
so
few
opportunities
for
young
people
in
this
area
,
many
leave
.
We
wish
we
had
more
young
people
involved
to
further
promote
the
use
of
new
technologies
.
Technology
,
however
,
will
never
replace
human
contact
,
and
it
should
not
be
allowed
to
do
so
.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Of
the
decisions
made
by
Ontario
's
38th
Legislative
Assembly
,
which
was
the
most
beneficial
to
your
this
electoral
district
?
To
the
province
as
a
whole
?
Which
was
least
beneficial
,
or
even
harmful
,
to
your
this
riding
?
To
the
province
as
a
whole
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
I
am
glad
the
Liberal
government
stopped
vilifying
public
servants
in
the
way
their
predecessor
did
.
What
bothers
me
is
that
,
beside
the
famous
broken
promises
,
so
much
of
what
the
Liberals
did
in
government
has
perpetuated
the
damage
and
problems
created
by
the
Conservatives
.
The
funding
formula
continues
to
inadequately
fund
schools
.
Public
service
cuts
from
natural
resources
to
agriculture
to
court
houses
make
life
harder
and
harder
for
rural
communities
.
Unfair
tax
assessment
continues
.
Public
housing
programs
and
social
assistance
policies
remain
inadequate
and
punitive
.
There
is
a
lengthy
list
of
problems
for
our
rural
communities
created
or
worsened
by
the
Conservatives
and
left
to
fester
by
the
McGuinty
Liberals
.
