Get
a
Food
Handlers
Card
</head>
<p>
A
food
handler
’s
card
is
required
for
many
culinary
jobs
,
including
cook
,
barista
,
and
caterer
.
Though
each
state
has
slightly
different
requirements
,
the
basics
are
the
same
.
To
obtain
your
card
(
also
known
as
a
certificate
,
license
,
certification
,
or
credentials
)
,
you
’ll
need
to
pass
a
government-approved
test
and
pay
a
fee
.
Then
you
can
print
your
license
or
choose
to
receive
a
hard
copy
in
the
mail
.
Once
you
’ve
completed
the
necessary
steps
and
can
present
your
official
food
handler
’s
card
,
you
can
start
working
with
food
!

Find
the
course
for
your
state
online
.
You
can
generally
find
the
course
(
which
ends
with
the
test
)
with
a
simple
Google
search
.
Taking
the
course

at
your
own
pace
and
gives
you
more
flexibility
.
The
course
and
test
should
generally
take
around
1.5-2
hours

Get
your

if

are
the
owner

Even

have
a
card

still
take
the

Ask
your

position
requires
a
food
handler
’s
card
.
Some
restaurants
do
n’t
require
all
employees
to
have
a
card
.
Instead
,
they
follow
a
rule
that
there
must
be
1
certified
employee
working
at
all
open
hours
who
can
teach
everyone
else
