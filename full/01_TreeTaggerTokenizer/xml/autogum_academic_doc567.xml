Unsupervised
Intrusion
Detection
Techniques
</head>
<p>
Intrusion
detection
mainly
includes
signature-based
intrusion
detection
and
anomaly-based
intrusion
detection
.
In
detail
,
signature-based
intrusion
detection
is
also
known
as
rule-based
intrusion
detection
.
Signature-based
intrusion
detection
has
a
high
detection
rate
for
known
attacks
,
but
has
no
ability
to
detect
attack
behaviors
that
are
not
in
the
rule
base
.
Anomaly-based
intrusion
detection
is
also
known
as
behavior-based
intrusion
detection
.
This
algorithm
has
the
ability
to
detect
unknown
attack
behavior
.
Feature
extraction
based
on
accurately
preprocessed
network
packets
in
anomaly-based
intrusion
detection
is
the
basis
for
good
performance
.
At
present
,
it
is
easy
to
collect
a
large
amount
of
unlabeled
data
in
intrusion
detection
,
and
it
is
difficult
to
obtain
a
large
amount
of
labeled
data
.
Therefore
,
an
unsupervised
algorithm
for
intrusion
detection
has
been
introduced
.
</p>
<p>
In
recent
years
,
there
have
been
some
studies
based
on
unsupervised
intrusion
detection
techniques
.
In
2007
,
Liu
et
al.
used
a
hierarchical
PCA
model
to
detect
intrusion
behavior
on
the
KDD99
dataset
.
In
2017
,
Gouveia
et
al.
used
RBM
to
detect
intrusion
behavior
on
the
ISCX2012
dataset
.
In
2018
,
Farahnakian
et
al.
used
Deep
Auto-encoder
to
detect
intrusion
behavior
on
the
KDD99
dataset
.
The
common
point
of
the
above
studies
is
that
the
preprocessing
ignores
the
similarity
between
network
packets
.
Network
packets
with
strong
similarity
relationship
are
closer
in
the
similarity
relation
graph
and
have
similar
local
proximity
embedding
.
The
preprocessing
algorithm
in
the
above
studies
ignores
the
similarity
relationship
between
network
packets
,
resulting
in
low
accuracy
of
intrusion
detection
.
Therefore
,
we
introduce
a
graph
representation
leaning
algorithm
to
solve
the
above
problem
.
The
network
packet
is
preprocessed
by
using
a
graph
representation
leaning
algorithm
.
In
the
proposed
algorithm
,
the
original
features
of
the
network
packet
are
combined
with
the
local
proximity
features
describing
the
similarity
relationship
between
the
network
packets
as
the
input
of
the
neural
network
.
The
proposed
algorithm
adds
effective
features
by
considering
the
similarities
between
network
packets
.

Graph
Representation
Learning
</head>
<p>
Graph
representation
leaning
refers
to
the
automatic
extraction
of
proximity
features
of
nodes
in
a
graph
.
This
algorithm
has
achieved
effects
in
the
application
of
approximate
semantic
classification
of
words
,
handwritten
character
classification
and
so
on
.
The
existing
graph
representation
leaning
algorithms
are
mainly
the
following
,
such
as
:
Node2vec
,
Deepwalk
,
LINE
.
However
,
Deepwalk
uses
a
simple
unbiased
random
walk
,
which
does
not
control
the
direction
of
random
walks
.
Therefore
,
Deepwalk
is
easy
to
sample
into
the
higher-order
proximity
range
,
which
makes
it
impossible
to
accurately
describe
the
local
proximity
features
of
the
current
node
;
LINE
does
not
have
the
ability
to
simultaneously
sample
first-order
proximity
and
second-order
proximity
,
so
the
algorithm
has
limitations
;
Node2vec
uses
a
random
walk
based
on
breadth
first
search
(
BFS
)
or
depth
first
search
(
DFS
)
to
explore
the
neighbor
of
the
node
.
However
,
random
walks
based
on
BFS
or
DFS
are
blind
searches
.
In
other
words
,
BFS
lacks
constraints
on
the
range
of
random
walks
.
Therefore
,
the
random
walk
has
the
probability
of
sampling
to
the
source
node
â€™s
higher-order
proximity
,
which
makes
it
impossible
to
accurately
extract
the
local
proximity
features
of
the
source
node
that
describe
the
similarity
relationship
between
network
packets
.
Therefore
,
we
propose
a
node2vec
with
penalty
for
unsupervised
automatic
preprocessing
.
The
proposed
algorithm
limits
the
range
of
random
walks
so
that
the
sampling
of
random
walks
only
occurs
within
the
low-proximity
of
the
source
node
.
Therefore
,
the
algorithm
has
the
ability
to
obtain
local
proximity
features
that
accurately
characterize
the
similarity
of
network
packets
.
</p>
<p>
The
literature
that
we
surveyed
has
not
used
the
unsupervised
automatic
preprocessing
of
graph
representation
learning
algorithm
with
penalty
in
the
field
of
intrusion
detection
.
In
the
proposed
algorithm
,
the
original
features
of
the
network
packet
are
combined
with
the
local
proximity
features
describing
the
similarity
relationship
between
the
network
packets
as
the
input
of
the
neural
network
.
The
proposed
algorithm
adds
effective
features
to
get
better
intrusion
detection
performance
.
