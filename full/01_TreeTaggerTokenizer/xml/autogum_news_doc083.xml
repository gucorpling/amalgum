Today
,
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Zimbabwe">
Zimbabwean
</ref>
officials
informed
the
media
that
an
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air%20Zimbabwe">
Air
Zimbabwe
</ref>
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing%20767">
Boeing

</ref>
aircraft
carrying
250
people
had
crashed
at
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harare%20International%20Airport">
Harare
International
Airport
</ref>
,
before
they
announced
the
reports
were
false
and
the
incident
had
in
fact
been
a
drill
to
simulate
the
occurrence
of
such
an
event
.
Initial
reports
suggested
that
a
flight
from
London
had
crashed
upon
landing
at
the
airport
.
However
,
Medical
Rescue
International
later
stated
in
a
post
on
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Facebook">
Facebook
</ref>
that
no
airplane
had
crashed
and
it
had
&quot;
joined
up
with
other
services
to
attend
to
a
mock
accident
at
Harare
International
Airport
...
Good
to
keep
the
practising
up
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Those
behind
the
staged
accident
had
reportedly
not
told
any
other
governmental
departments
,
resulting
in
relatives
inquiring
with
Air
Zimbabwe
as
to
what
had
happened
.
A
senior
figure
for
Air
Zimbabwe
stated
that
he
was
&quot;
concerned
that
this
incident
led
to
many
,
many
calls
to
us
.
People
were
frightened
.
No
actual
plane
was
involved
,
but
there
was
a
scenario
involving
a
Boeing
767
plane
that
had
been
hijacked
and
forced
down
at
Harare
airport
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
It
was
reported
that
Peter
Chikumba
,
chief
of
Air
Zimbabwe
,
had
also
not
been
informed
that
the
exercise
was
to
take
place
,
and
that
the
airline
had
set
up
an
emergency
helpdesk
to
liaise
with
the
families
of
victims
.
Alan
McGuinness
,
a
correspondent
for
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Sky_News">
Sky
News
</ref>
,
stated
,
&quot;
journalists
who
arrived
at
the
airport
saw
smoke
rising
from
a
runway
and
were
then
taken
to
a
room
where
they
were
told
to
wait
.
David
Chawota
,
the
head
of
the
Zimbabwe
Civil
Aviation
Authority
,
said
the
media
was
duped
to
make
the
drill
more
realistic
.
&quot;
Chawota
stated
,
&quot;
telling
the
media
was
part
of
the
exercise
.
We
wanted
to
see
how
the
media
would
react
,
&quot;
he
said
.
</p>
<p>
Chawota
himself
told
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNO%20News">
BNO
News
</ref>
that
an
airliner
had
crashed
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael%20van%20Poppel">
Michael
van
Poppel
</ref>
,
head
of
BNO
News
said
that
&quot;
while
I
first
thought
Chawota
was
just
misinformed
by
others
,
although
that
would
be
odd
since
he
is
the
CEO
of
the
aviation
authority
,
I
was
stunned
to
hear
that
he
actually
knew
it
was
a
drill
and
wanted
to
see
the
media
's
response
...
This
basically
means
he
was
lying
to
me
when
I
spoke
to
him
,
but
also
to
other
reporters
he
spoke
to
...
I
think
it
was
absolutely
irresponsible
of
this
CEO
and
I
ca
n't
imagine
what
the
families
of
passengers
travelling
to
Harare
around
that
time
must
have
gone
through
when
they
heard
news
reports
that
there
had
been
an
'
accident
'
at
the
airport
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
McGuinness
reported
,
&quot;
Stuart
Sprake
,
general
manager
of
FX
Logistics
,
works
at
Harare
airport
and
believed
the
secrecy
surrounding
the
drill
will
help
emergency
crews
learn
valuable
lessons
.
&quot;
Sprake
told
reporters
&quot;
they
(
the
crews
)
had
to
find
their
way
through
crowds
and
traffic
...
training
exercises
should
be
ad
hoc
â€”
the
less
people
know
about
it
the
better
.
