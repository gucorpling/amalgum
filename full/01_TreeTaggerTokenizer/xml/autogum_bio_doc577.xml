In
his

career
he
used
the
initials
&quot;
Z.A.
&quot;
to
sign
some
twenty
engravings
,
and
until

was
regarded

the

stood
for
Giovanni

,
&quot;

a

.
Around
1507
he
began
to
use

such
as

and
signed
some

Zoan

a
very
obscure
painter
,
documented
as
working
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantua">

,
he
then
may
have
travelled
around

,

certainly
spent
his

in

Life
</head>
<p>
Though
he
was
apparently
from
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brescia">
Brescia
</ref>
in
northern
Italy
,
there
are
no
documentary
records
of
his
life
other
than
the
prints
;
the
locations
and
rough
timing
of
his
career
have
been
worked
out
from
these
.
He
began
his
traceable
printmaking
career
in
the
circle
of
Mantegna
,
arriving
in
Mantua
in
the
1490s
,
and
leaving
around
1506
,
perhaps
after
Mantegna
's
death
that
year
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-8">
[

</ref>
He
may
have
been
relatively
old
and
experienced
as
an
artist
in
another
medium
when
he
joined
the
aged
Mantegna
.
It
is
assumed
he
moved
to
Rome
,
as
his
later
engravings
depict
works
available
to
him
only
in
that
city
,
but
the
date
this
happened
varies
between
different
accounts
.
After
he
left
Mantua
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedetto_Montagna">
Benedetto
Montagna
</ref>
and
his
father
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartolomeo_Montagna">

both

<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicenza">

</ref>
,
become
influences
,
and
a
period
there
has
been
posited
.
He
also
appears
to
have
spent
time
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence">
Florence

,

The
date
of
his
arrival
in

is
estimated
to
be
around

According
to
Jacquelyn
Sheehan
(
in

,
he
must
have
been
active
there
until
at
least
1525

date
of

<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-14">

his

about

Prints
</head>
<p>
His
prints
are
mainly
concerned
with
the
figures
,
which
often
occupy
most
of
the
picture
space
.
Unlike
many
of
his
contemporaries
,
who
adopted
the
extensive
landscape
backgrounds
pioneered
by
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrecht_Dürer">
Albrecht
Dürer
</ref>
,
he
is
,
like
Mantegna
,
relatively
little
interested
in
the
backgrounds
,
which
are
often
blank
or
very
simple
.
According
to
Sheehan
&quot;
he
never
achieves
a
true
unity
between
figures
and
setting
,
as
do
the
more
advanced
masters
of
the
16th
century
&quot;
.

In
Mantua
his
relationship
with
Mantegna
was
apparently
close
,
but
the
precise
nature
of
it
remains
uncertain
.
Mantegna
had
been
interested
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printmaking">
printmaking
</ref>
for
decades
,
probably
since
the
1460s
,
and
he
is
&quot;
the
artist
who
can
best
be
claimed
to
have
&quot;
invented
&quot;
printmaking
in
Italy
&quot;
.
