How

Satan
is
a
model
or
a
mode
of
behavior
.
Satan
in
Hebrew
means
&quot;
adversary
&quot;
or
&quot;
opposer
&quot;
;
one
who
questions
.
Since
we
generally
are
skeptical
atheists
,
we
question
all
spirituality
.
We
believe
that
carnality
is
all
that
exists
and
the
spiritual
dimensions
are
fictional
.
So
we
stand
against
eastern
and
western
religions
that
promote
fictions
,
according
to
our
perspectives
.
So
we
are
adversaries
.
Satan
to
us
is
an
exemplar
.
When
we
look
at
how
he
is
portrayed
by
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark%20Twain">

</hi>
,
he
ends
up
being
an
inspirational
symbol
to
us
.
We
say
we
would
like
to
be
more
like
that
.
We
will
not
bow
our
heads
;
we
will
be
independent
.
We
will
constantly
question
.
</p>
<hi rend="bold">
You
ca
n't
be
praying
to
a
God
or
blaming
a
devil
,
or
anyone
else
,
for
that
matter
,
for
what
happens
to
you
.
It
’s
on
your
own
head
.
That
’s
a
challenge
for
most
people
.

What
is
the
Church
of
Satan
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
PG
:
</hi>
Satanism
begins
with
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Atheism">
atheism
</ref>
.
We
begin
with
the
universe
and
say
,
“
It
’s
indifferent
.
There
’s
no
God
,
there
’s
no
Devil
.
No
one
cares
!
”
So
you
then
have
to
make
a
decision
that
places
yourself
at
the
center
of
your
own
subjective
universe
,
because
of
course
we
ca
n’t
have
any
kind
of
objective
contact
with
everything
that
exists
.
That
’s
rather
arrogant
and
delusional
,
people
who
try
to
put
things
that
way
.
So
by
making
yourself
the
primary
value
in
your
life
,
you
’re
your
own
God
.
By
being
your
own
God
,
you
are
comfortable
about
making
your
own
decisions
about
what
to
value
.
What
’s
positive
to
you
,
is
good
.
What
harms
you
,
is
evil
.
You
extend
it
to
things
that
you
cherish
and
the
people
that
you
cherish
.
So
it
’s
actually
very
easy
to
see
that
it
’s
a
self-centered
philosophy
.
</p>
<p>
But
it
also
requires
responsibility
,
since
you
are
taking
on
for
yourself
the
complete
onus
for
your
personal
success
or
failure
.
You
ca
n't
be
praying
to
a
God
or
blaming
a
devil
,
or
anyone
else
,
for
that
matter
,
for
what
happens
to
you
.
It
’s
on
your
own
head
.
That
’s
a
challenge
for
most
people
.
Most
people
tend
to
really
feel
that
they
want
some
kind
of
external
support
,
that
they
are
outward
looking
and
might
want
some
sort
of
supernatural
parental
figure
,
or
even
some
sort
of
existing
governmental
authority
,
existing
in
their
life
.

:
Why
do
you
think
people
are
like
that
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
PG
:
</hi>
I
think
there
are
actually
two
kinds
of
people
.
There
are
the
kind
of
people
who
need
that
,
and
the
kind
that
do
n't
.
The
kind
that
do
n't
are
the
smaller
percentage
of
our
species
.
It
’s
as
simple
as
that
.
