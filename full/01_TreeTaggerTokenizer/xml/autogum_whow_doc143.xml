Lead
by
Communicating
</head>
<p>
Lead
by
communicating
effectively
with
people
.
Everyone
should
,
but
leaders
of
organizations/teams
and
managers/coaches
of
areas
,
departments
and
such
definitely
need
to
get
out
of
the
den/office
and
into
the
work
or
sport
places
,
etc.
You
never
know
what
ideas
might
emerge
when
two
people
in
different
parts
of
the
organization
are
talking
about
improving
things
that
they
’re
doing
.
Great
things
can
be
birthed

Do
n’t
waste
time
roaming
the
sidelines
:
Avoid
sliding
into
the
background
.
Get
into
your
field
of
endeavor
at
school
,
plant
or
the
office
—
not
spying
,
looking/watching
from
a
distance
—
losing
opportunities
because
you
are
off
the
front
lines
of
work
,
play
or
school
.
While
your
team
,
technicians
,
producers
,
sales
force
are
in
action
,
be
out
there
communicating
.
Be
an
&quot;
enthusiast/cheerleader
&quot;
if
that
might
work
.
Continually
engage
the
entire
collection
of
teams
—
at
each
level
,
bottom
to
top
.

Talk
with
production
and
sales
people
;
not
just
their
managers
.
Pump
customer
service
for
their
input
on
business
through
the
customers
'
eyes
.
Prime
the
office-mates
,
warehouse-men
,
and
others
—
individually
and
in
groups
,
communicating
together
.
Tune
in
to
ideas
and
build
on
them
.

Relational
management
builds
relationships
:
synergistic
energies/connections
with
minds
and
emotions
of
the
employees
.
It
primes
the
feeling
of
loyalty
to
the
business
and
a
vestment
in
the
desire
to
improve
the
processes
and
mechanisms
.
Individuals
tend
to
be
more
accountable
to
the
management
with
whom
they
have
relationships
beyond
just
their
daily
work
duties
,
particularly
when
the
individuals
are
fully-valued
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Ask
helpful
,
reasonable
questions
and
openly
receive
the
friendly
answers
.
Listen
to
what
your
coworkers
are
seeing
in
their
part
of
the
work
,
school
or
game
.
Listen
to
what
they
are
thinking
and
analyze
thoughts
with
a
high
level
of
empathy
.

Learn
what
is
happening
out
there

What
was

is
each
of
the
other

or
company
marketers
doing
that
you

What

Try

walking

discussing
in
classrooms

patrolling
the

where
you
can
learn
from

Circulate
,
meet
new
faces
and
idea
sets
.
—
Find
out
what
everyone
is
thinking
and
dreaming
.
Do
this
all
the
time
even
if
associates
are
uncomfortable
going
around
the
room
and
meeting
others
.
This
is
fun
,
engaging
,
and
expanding
to
the
soul
and
to
the
mind
.
You
will
likely
find
that
you
improve
understandings
,
enthusiasm
and
social
flexibility
and
also
develop
facility
in
targeting
critical
insights
,
then
capitalizing
upon
them
.

Encourage
teammates

the

Cash
in
the
value
of
insight
gained
by
talking
to
formalize
and
expand
plans
—
big
and
small
—
that
you
can
press
into
execution
successfully
.
Prime
the
idea
flow
by
constantly
talking
with
different
people
,
by
listening
to
what
they
say
and
then
by
working
together
to
crystallize
their
view
of
a
super
path
forward
.
It
is
n’t
your
place
to
draw
up
the
&quot;
vision
&quot;
of
(
and
for
)
your
enterprise
all
on
your
own
.
The
team
wins
when
everyone
is
talking
to
and
engaging
with
a
variety
of
team
members
.
Honor
the
knowledge
that
each
great
idea
starts
with
a
conversation
between
two
people
and
grow
using
the
natural
feed
of
energy
by
that
continuing
relationship
.
