The
following
is
an
interview
with
Ms.
Boulding
,
conducted
via
email
,
over
a
week
ago
.
</p>
<p>
She
did
not
respond
to
two
of
the
main
questions
:
“
Previous
to
this
campaign
,
have
you
been
politically
involved
?
How
will
you
apply
your
previous
work/volunteer/life
experience
to
serving
your
constituents
?
”
and
“
What
would
you
say
are
the
three
hottest
topics
this
election
,
in
your
riding
?
What
would
you
and
your
party
do
to
address
these
issues
?
”
Being
unanswered
,
these
questions
were
edited
out
of
the
interview
,
which
otherwise
is
published
as
received
.

Why
are
you
running
for
political
office
,
why
at
the
federal
level
,
why
this
party
,
and
why
in
this
riding
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
I
am
not
a
new
candidate
,
this
is
my
third
federal
election
and
I
have
also
run
in
an
Ontario
Provincial
election
.
I
have
been
an
NDP
my
whole
adult
life
and
come
from
a
family
of
CCFers
and
NDPers
.
I
have
lived
in
this
riding
for
17
years
and
am
very
concerned
about
the
decisions
being
made
by
the
federal
government
for
the
past
number
of
years
and
wish
to
improve
the
lives
of
all
Canadians
-
a
prosperous
Canada
that
leaves
no
one
behind
.
The
corporate
interests
have
overwhelmed
the
government
's
agenda
and
it
is
time
that
it
is
a
more
balanced
view
of
Canada
and
the
lives
of
Canadians
—
old
and
young
,
women
and
men
.

Are
there
any
misconceptions
about
you
,
your
leader
,
or
your
party
and
platform
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
Jack
and
the
party
have
prepared
the
best
platform
of
any
party
and
our
message
is
certainly
reaching
people
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
There
are
more
ways
than
ever
to
get
your
message
out
,
from
the
traditional
campaign
fliers
and
lawn
signs
,
to
new
media
like
websites
,
Facebook
,
and
YouTube
.
The
tried-and-true
routes
get
the
message
out
to
the
masses
much
easier
,
but
digital
alternatives
are
much
more
measurable
in
how
many
are
seeing
or
interacting
with
your
campaign
.
What
seems
to
be
the
most
effective
,
from
your
experience
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
This
is
a
very
rural
riding
and
while
we
certainly
use
e-mail
and
websites
as
supportive
tools
,
mail
,
door
to
door
,
mainstreeting
and
phoning
people
are
still
necessary
as
many
do
not
have
internet
(
especially
high
speed
)
,
many
areas
do
n't
even
have
cell
phone
reception
and
we
have
a
large
low
income
population
that
is
having
trouble
making
ends
meet
let
alone
pay
for
internet
connection
.
All
of
these
concerns
are
factored
into
how
we
manage
the
campaign
and
how
we
get
the
word
out
.
We
have
a
very
large
riding
and
it
is
difficult
to
get
to
every
community
,
though
we
make
our
best
effort
.
Our
communities
also
provide
us
with
opportunities
for
the
voters
to
hear
what
we
have
to
say
-
there
are
10
all
candidate
meetings
scheduled
to
date
.
