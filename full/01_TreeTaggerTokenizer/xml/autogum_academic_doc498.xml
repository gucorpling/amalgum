<p>
Considering
the
properties
and
biological
role
of
silicon
,
we
evaluated
the
effects
of
nutritional
supplementation
with
silicon-enriched
spirulina
on
vascular
remodeling
induced
by
hypertension
in
a
SHR
rat
model
.
Our
study
showed
highly
beneficial
effects
including
attenuation
of
arterial
pressure
and
improvement
of
vascular
reactivity
.
These
benefits
were
associated
with
reduction
in
arterial
thickness
and
stiffness
caused
by
the
structural
remodeling
of
the
aortic
wall
in
SHR
.
They
were
mainly
attributable
to
Si
enrichment
.
</p>
<p>
Beneficial
and
safe
effects
of
SpSi
supplementation
were
previously
reported
in
high
fat
diet-induced
models
of
atherosclerosis
in
hamsters
and
metabolic
syndrome
in
rats
.
Improvement
of
glucose
tolerance
,
insulin
resistance
,
or
dyslipidemia
were
evidenced
with
both
SpSi
and
Sp
supplementation
.
However
,
only
SpSi
had
beneficial
effects
on
arterial
function
.
No
toxicity
or
side
effects
of
SpSi
supplement
were
otherwise
observed
.
Increase
of
arterial
stiffness
,
reduction
of
arterial
compliance
,
and
distensibility
marked
by
fragmentation
of
elastin
are
the
main
consequences
of
arterial
remodeling
occurring
in
hypertension
,
obesity
and
aging
.
Vascular
remodeling
in
hypertension
is
characterized
by
altered
ultrastructure
due
to
reduction
in
elastin
and
increase
in
fibrous
tissue
.
Here
,
we
assessed
the
effect
of
SpSi
on
the
ultrastructural
,
mechanical
and
functional
changes
characterized
in
SHR
thoracic
aorta
.
These
modifications
consisted
of
(
i
)
arterial
wall
hypertrophy
,
(
ii
)
fragmentation
,
linearization
,
and
refolding
of
elastic
fibers
,
and
(
iii
)
impaired
contractile
and
vasorelaxant
responses
.
These
changes
typified
the
degenerative
processes
leading
to
the
reduction
of
compliance
and
distensibility
described
in
hypertension
and
associated
with
aging
.
Indeed
,
in
SHR
aorta
,
our
results
showed
enlarged
internal
diameter
and
media
thickening
,
increased
elastin
fragmentation
ratio
,
and
lower
elastin
and
collagen
levels
than
in
normotensive
animals
.
Consequently
,
contractility
was
impaired
as
evidenced
by
the
decreased
response
and
sensitivities
to
KCl-induced
depolarization
and
PE
.
The
vasorelaxant
responses
to
both
Ach
and
SNP
were
also
reduced
.
The
enhanced
effect
of
L-NAME
on
PE-induced
contraction
suggested
that
the
decrease
in
the
vasodilator
capacity
of
aorta
in
SHR
is
due
to
both
the
alteration
of
vascular
smooth
muscle
function
and
NO
bioavailability
.
</p>
<p>
After
three
months
of
supplementation
,
SpSi
substantially
corrected
and
even
normalized
most
of
the
defects
identified
in
SHR
aorta
.
First
,
aortic
hypertrophy
was
reduced
as
shown
by
morphologic
analysis
.
Higher
level
of
elastin
fiber
density
and
mRNA
level
were
associated
to
a
decrease
in
MMP-9
expression
,
suggesting
that
both
enhanced
elastin
biosynthesis
and
reduced
extracellular
matrix
contributed
to
media
thinning
.
It
is
known
that
hypertensive
vascular
remodeling
involves
reorganization
and
impairment
of
the
extracellular
matrix
and
that
MMPs
play
an
important
role
in
this
remodeling
.
Second
,
we
observed
an
improvement
of
vascular
function
after
SpSi
supplementation
.
Contractile
and
vasorelaxant
responses
were
increased
in
association
with
an
increased
sensitivity
to
the
agonists
and
antagonists
tested
and
a
better
NO
bioavailability
.
Finally
,
we
found
that
SHR
animals
supplemented
with
SpSi
had
lower
arterial
pressure
than
control
SHR
.
Arterial
pressure
,
although
significantly
reduced
,
was
still
higher
than
normal
pressure
which
may
explain
the
lack
of
benefit
on
cardiac
parameters
in
our
experimental
conditions
(
hypertension
already
established
,
3
months
of
supplementation
)
.
</p>
<p>
Another
interesting
result
in
our
study
is
that
supplementation
with
Sp
alone
had
no
effect
in
SHR
suggesting
that
the
benefits
observed
with
SpSi
are
genuine
effects
of
Si
.
The
nutritional
essentiality
of
Si
is
undeniable
.
This
organic
element
appears
as
an
important
structural
component
of
the
aortic
wall
which
contributes
to
elastin
and
collagen
synthesis
and
stability
.
Data
from
animal
and
human
studies
demonstrated
that
dietary
Si
mitigates
the
risk
of
cardiovascular
diseases
.
Si
in
drinking
water
has
been
inversely
correlated
with
mortality
rates
due
to
coronary
heart
diseases
in
Finland
.
Reduced
damage
and
thickening
of
elastic
fibers
were
observed
in
the
aortic
wall
after
silicon
supplementation
in
rabbit
models
of
diet-induced
atherosclerosis
.
Moreover
,
our
results
are
in
line
with
a
previous
study
reporting
reduction
in
systolic
arterial
pressure
after
supplementation
with
soluble
silicon
in
SHR
.
In
that
study
,
arterial
structure
was
not
investigated
and
enhancement
of
intracellular
magnesium
uptake
was
evoked
as
a
possible
mechanism
.
This
is
not
inconsistent
with
our
findings
as
Si
is
supposed
to
contribute
to
biological
function
and
affect
retention
or
function
of
other
minerals
,
such
as
aluminum
or
magnesium
.
Various
mechanisms
are
potentially
involved
in
the
beneficial
effects
of
Si
.
Here
,
a
major
result
in
our
study
is
that
SpSi
supplementation
reverses
elastic
fiber
degradation
which
is
likely
to
contribute
to
the
overall
benefit
.
The
observed
regenerative
changes
of
the
vascular
wall
are
in
line
with
a
Si-related
beneficial
effect
.
However
,
quantification
of
Si
level
in
the
aortic
tissue
is
warranted
to
validate
this
hypothesis
.
