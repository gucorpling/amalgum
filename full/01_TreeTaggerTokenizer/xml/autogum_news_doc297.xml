</p>
<p>
At
a
press
conference
,
the
head
of
Sadr
's
parliamentary
bloc
Nassar
Rubaie
,
read
a
statement
from
al-Sadr
:
&quot;
Considering
the
public
interest
,
we
found
that
it
was
necessary
to
issue
an
order
to
the
ministers
of
the
Sadr
bloc
to
immediately
withdraw
from
the
Iraqi
government
,
&quot;
The
statement
continued
,
&quot;
The
six
ministries
shall
be
handed
over
to
the
government
itself
,
hoping
that
this
government
would
give
these
responsibilities
to
independent
bodies
who
wish
to
serve
the
interests
of
the
people
and
the
country
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Al-Maliki
was
happy
the
Sadrists
respected
the
political
process
.
The
move
could
have
threatened
to
topple
his
government
,
but
so
far
the
Sadrist
Movement
is
still
part
of
the
ruling
coalition
.
