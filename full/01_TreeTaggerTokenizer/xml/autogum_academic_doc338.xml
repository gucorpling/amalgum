Introduction
</head>
<p>
The
advances
in
camera
technology
now
necessitate
the
development
of
a
high-resolution
complementary
metal-oxide-semiconductor
(
CMOS
)
image
sensor
.
However
,
a
high-resolution
camera
requires
a
pixel
pitch
smaller
than
1.0
μm
to
allow
accumulation
of
numerous
pixels
in
the
limited
sensor
area
.
Accordingly
,
the
aspect
ratio
is
worsened
by
maintaining
the
pixel
height
in
a
small
pixel
pitch
.
If
the
pixel
depth
gets
thinner
,
the
color
filter
(
CF
)
or
the
photodiode
should
also
be
thinner
.
However
,
the
thickness
of
the
CF
has
pigment
limitations
,
and
making
the
photodiode
thinner
is
difficult
because
of
the
lower
light
absorption
at
long
wavelengths
.
Therefore
,
the
optical
performance
of
a
small-sized
pixel
deteriorates
due
to
low
sensitivity
and
high
crosstalk
,
which
lead
to
a
lower
performance
of
CMOS
image
sensors
.
</p>
<p>
Many
approaches
are
available
for
enhancing
the
sensitivity
and
crosstalk
for
a
small
pixel
.
Particularly
good
examples
include
new
optical
pixel
structures
,
such
as
the
stacked
grid
structure
between
color
filters
,
the
lensed
CF
,
and
the
front-inner
lens
image
sensor
.
The
stacked
grid
structure
is
located
between
the
color
filters
,
and
it
blocks
the
optical
crosstalk
to
increase
sensitivity
.
However
,
the
grids
cannot
be
adapted
to
small
pixels
because
the
CF
width
reduces
and
adversely
affects
the
sensitivity
by
shrinking
the
absorption
area
.
In
,
a
lensed
CF
is
proposed
to
reduce
crosstalk
and
enhance
the
sensitivity
by
uniting
the
micro
lens
and
a
color
filter
.
However
,
the
height
and
the
radius
of
curvature
(
ROC
)
of
this
structure
are
difficult
to
process
equally
.
The
front-inner
lens
is
proposed
to
enhance
the
sensitivity
by
adding
a
lens
to
the
front
side
to
serve
as
the
interconnection
layer
in
a
shallow
photodiode
.
However
,
the
complicated
structure
of
the
front
inner
lens
creates
substantial
difficulty
in
conducting
general
processes
.
</p>
<p>
Conversely
,
different
approaches
are
available
to
obtain
high
sensitivity
by
changing
the
color
filter
array
(
CFA
)
.
A
CFA
with
a
white
color
filter
has
been
studied
because
a
white
color
filter
transmits
incident
light
at
all
wavelengths
.
The
WRGB
(
white
,
red
,
green
,
blue
)
CFA
indicates
that
one
of
the
green
pixels
of
the
Bayer
CFA
was
replaced
with
a
white
pixel
.
The
RGBW
CFA
consisting
of
50
%
white
CF
has
also
been
developed
to
improve
the
sensitivity
and
resolution
.
Fifty
percent
of
the
total
area
of
the
RGBW
CFA
is
occupied
by
the
white
CF
,
25
%
by
the
green
CF
,
and
12.5
%
by
the
red
and
blue
CF
.
The
RGBW
CFA
consisting
of
75
%
white
CF
with
a
color
separation
process
was
also
introduced
.
The
low-illumination
signal-to-noise
ratios
of
the
luminance
signal
are
improved
by
increasing
the
white
CF
area
.
Moreover
,
the
color
reproducibility
of
the
WRGB
pattern
is
comparable
with
the
Bayer
pattern
.
According
to
this
research
,
the
WRGB
CFA
demosaicing
result
has
a
similar
spatial
resolution
,
color
reproduction
,
and
better
color
aliasing
artifact
levels
compared
to
the
Bayer
CFA
demosaicing
result
by
the
post-processing
method
.
However
,
much
crosstalk
is
induced
with
increasing
sensitivity
,
especially
for
a
small
pixel
.
Because
the
white
color
filter
transmits
a
lot
of
light
,
some
of
the
light
enters
the
other
pixel
’s
photodiode
.
This
problem
still
requires
a
solution
.
</p>
<p>
In
this
work
,
we
propose
a
quad-WRGB
structure
with
spatial-deep
trench
isolation
(
S-DTI
)
and
a
spatial-tungsten
grid
(
S-WG
)
to
solve
the
small
pixel
problems
,
such
as
low
sensitivity
and
high
crosstalk
.
The
quad-WRGB
CFA
provides
a
four-fold
expansion
of
each
color
filter
.
The
S-DTI
and
S-WG
are
located
every
four
pixels
for
efficient
reduction
of
the
crosstalk
.
The
optical
performance
is
investigated
by
simulating
the
suggested
structure
and
comparing
it
with
typical
structures
with
the
CFA
,
DTI
,
and
WG
using
a
commercial
3D
optical
simulator
for
precise
analysis
.
Section

describes
the
concept
of
the
quad-RGBW
pixel
structure
having
S-DTI
and
S-WG
,
and
Section

presents
the
simulation
results
and
discusses
the
results
.
Conclusions
are
presented
in
Section
