Create
a
Dance
Moms
Audio
Swap
</head>
<p>
If
you
've
ever
seen
one
of
the
&quot;
Dance
Moms
&quot;
performances
,
you
'll
already
know
that
they
dance
to
certain
music
that
fits
the
performance
.
Do
any
search
on
YouTube
for
&quot;
Dance
Moms
Audio
Swap
&quot;
,
and
you
'll
come
across
a
collection
of
videos
of
performances
that
have
been
changed
and
cut
.
In
just
the
same
way
,
you
can
create
a
Dance
Moms
Audio
Swap
.
And
although
less
frequently
done
,
you
can
also
use
audio
swapping
in
other
ways
than
Dance
Moms
Audio
Swaps
.
