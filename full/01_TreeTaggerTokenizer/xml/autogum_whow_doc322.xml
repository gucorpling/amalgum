Remember
that
when
the
host
or
hostess
of
a
party
does
make
a
special
vegetarian
dish
for
you
,
be
sure
to
thank
them
at
the
party
,
and
also
send
them
a
note
following
the
party
.

Know
that
when
someone
offers
you
a
non-vegetarian/non-vegan
dish
to
try
,
you
can
simply
say
,
&quot;
No
Thanks
&quot;
.
Make
a
point
to
mention
how
much
you
liked
a
vegetarian
dish
.

,
vegetable

,
bean
chili
,
salad

Let
people
bring
their
own
dishes
as
well
.
While
vegan
and
vegetarian
meals
are
no
different
than
regular
meals
(
except
for
the
fact
that
they
do
n't
have
animal
products
)
and
are
just
as
tasty
,
some
people
may
not
care
for
them
or
be
open
to
trying
them
.

Be
polite
and
patient
when
asking
the
waiter
about
which
dishes
could
be
made
without
animal
products
.
If
you
do
ask
a
lot
of
the
servers
,

Realize
that
you
may
have
to
skimp
a
bit
or
make
do
.
If
all
of
their
entrees
use
meat
or
animal
products
,
it
might
be
easier
to
just
order
a
sandwich
and
a
few
&quot;
safe
&quot;
side
dishes
instead
of
insisting
they
make
special
accommodations
.
This
is
especially
wise
in
busy
restaurants
.

If
at
all
possible
,
contact
the
restaurant
<hi rend="italic">
before
</hi>
you
arrive
and
inform
them
of
your
special
requirements
.
Most
chefs
are
happy
to
accommodate
any
diet
,
some
even
see
it
as
a
welcome
change
of
pace
.
However
,
a
little
time
for
planning
can
mean
the
difference
between
passable
food
and
stunning
food
.

If
little
is
available
,
be
gracious
and
simply
order
a
drink
and
some
side
dishes
.
Remember
that
dining
out
should
also
be
about
the
company
,
and
raising
a
fuss
can
make
for
an
uncomfortable
if
not
ruined
dining
experience
.

If
you
know
you
are
stuck
going
to
a
restaurant
that
has
little
to
offer
,
be
proactive
--
eat
before
you
go
,
and
order
coffee
and
dessert
,
or
a
soda
and
salad
at
the
destination
.

If
you
are
with
a
group
of
co-workers
,
there
often
is
one
&quot;
motherly
&quot;
person
in
the
group
who
encourages
you
to
order
some
meat
because
he
or
she
noticed
you
did
n't
.
Just
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Smile">
smile
</ref>
and
say
you
are
happy
with
what
you
ordered
.
</item>
<item>
Most
of
the
time
,
two
or
three
side
dishes
will
be
a
satisfying
meal

When
going
out
for
the
day
,
it
's
always
good
to
carry
a
protein
bar
with
you
,
so
if
you
ca
n't
find
someplace
to
have
lunch
or
dinner
,
you
'll
at
least
have
some
food
.
