Transmission
Schemes
</head>
<p>
In
this
section
,
a
conventional
non-jamming
scheme
and
two
source
cooperative
jamming
schemes
are
presented
for
the
considered
buffer-aided
relay
IoT
networks
.
</p>
<head>
3.1

NJ
Scheme
</head>
<p>
The
total
transmission
is
divided
into
two
hops
.
In
the
first
hop
,
the
source
sensor
<hi rend="italic">
S
</hi>
sends
the
signal
to
the
relay
sensor
while
intercepted
by
<hi rend="italic">
K
</hi>
eavesdroppers
.
Hence
,
the
received
SNR
at
and
can
be
,
respectively
,
expressed
as
(
4
)
(
5
)
where
denotes
the
transmit
power
of
the
source
sensor
,
which
obeys
the
uniform
power
allocation
for
ease
of
analysis
.
and
represent
the
channel
gains
of
link
and
,
is
the
variance
of
the
additive
white
Gaussian
noise
(
AWGN
)
.
</p>
<p>
Similar
to
the
first
hop
,
the
received
SNR
at
<hi rend="italic">
D
</hi>
and
can
be
,
respectively
,
given
by
(
6
)
(
7
)
where
is
the
transmit
power
of
the
selected
relay
sensor
,
and
and
denote
the
channel
gains
of
link
and
,
respectively
.
</p>
<p>
Due
to
the
presence
of
multiple
eavesdroppers
,
we
take
both
NCE
and
CE
scenarios
into
account
.
</p>
<p>
In
the
NCE
scenario
,
the
eavesdroppers
decode
information
individually
without
interactions
.
Hence
,
the
received
signal-to-noise
ratio
(
SNR
)
at
the
eavesdroppers
of
the
first
and
second
hops
can
be
,
respectively
,
given
by
(
8
)
(
9
)
</p>
<p>
In
the
CE
scenario
,
all
eavesdroppers
can
exchange
the
information
with
each
other
and
adopt
the
maximal
ratio
combining
(
MRC
)
for
enhancing
the
intercept
ability
.
Thus
,
the
instantaneous
SNR
of
the
eavesdroppers
’
channels
for
the
first
and
second
hops
are
expressed
as
(
10
)
(
11
)
where
denotes
the
channel
vector
between
the
source
sensor
and
the
eavesdroppers
.
Similarly
,
represents
the
channel
vector
between
the
selected
relay
sensor
and
the
eavesdroppers
.
</p>
<p>
The
NJ
scheme
is
a
benchmark
invoked
for
the
purpose
of
comparison
,
which
can
also
be
applicable
for
the
practical
application
scenario
due
to
it
lower
complexity
.

SCJ
Scheme
</head>
<p>
In
this
case
,
when
the
second
hop
is
selected
,
the
source
sensor
can
send
jamming
signals
to
the
eavesdroppers
with
the
transmit
power
,
which
degrades
the
quality
of
eavesdroppers
’
channels
effectively
without
interfering
other
nodes
.
Furthermore
,
due
to
the
total
power
constraint
,
we
have
,
where
denotes
the
transmit
power
of
the
source
sensor
when
transmitting
useful
information
.
Similar
to
the
NJ
scheme
,
the
power
allocation
follows
the
uniform
allocation
rule
,
i.
e.
,
,
.
</p>
<p>
The
first
hop
of
the
SCJ
scheme
is
the
same
as
the
NJ
scheme
,
hence
we
have
and
.
In
the
second
hop
,
the
received
signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio
(
SINR
)
at
is
given
by
(
12
)
where
denotes
the
link
of
when
<hi rend="italic">
S
</hi>
acts
as
a
jamming
node
.
</p>
<p>
Thus
,
for
the
NCE
scenario
,
the
received
SNR
and
SINR
at
the
eavesdroppers
of
the
first
and
second
hops
can
be
written
as
(
13
)
(
14
)
</p>
<p>
For
the
CE
mode
,
the
received
SNR
and
SINR
of
the
eavesdroppers
’
channel
for
the
first
and
second
hops
are
given
by
(
15
)
(
16
)
where
represents
the
channel
vector
between
the
source
sensor
and
the
eavesdroppers
when
the
source
acts
as
a
jamming
node
.

SCJ-OPA
Scheme
</head>
<p>
To
further
enhance
the
physical
layer
security
for
the
SCJ
scheme
,
the
optimal
power
allocation
operation
is
employed
at
the
source
sensor
node
under
the
SCJ-OPA
scheme
.
Similar
to
the
section
above
,
we
still
assume
that
.
Then
,
we
have
.
Given
and
where
denotes
the
power
allocation
factor
.
We
aim
to
find
the
optimal
power
allocation
factor
to
minimize
the
secrecy
outage
probability
of
the
considered
system
.
Therefore
,
the
optimization
problem
can
be
written
as
(
17
)
where
represents
the
overall
secrecy
outage
probability
of
the
system
.
We
derive
the
expression
of
the
secrecy
outage
probability
and
solve
the
optimization
in
the
following
section
.
Moreover
,
making
an
appropriate
substitution
of
the
parameters
,
i.
e.
,
and
,
the
received
SNR
or
SINR
at
the
corresponding
node
under
the
SCJ-OPA
scheme
can
be
obtained
easily
,
hence
is
omitted
.
</p>
<p>
Now
,
according
to
the
authors
of
,
the
achievable
secrecy
rate
of
the
first
and
second
hops
can
be
,
respectively
,
expressed
as
(
18
)
(
19
)
where
