<p>
The
impact
assessment
method
we
propose
is
intended
as
a
sub-method
of
the
life
cycle
assessment
method
.
LCA
has
been
an
established
method
to
analyse
the
potential
attribution
of
environmental
impacts
of
value
chains
to
products
for
over
30
years
.
Its
principles
and
requirements
are
specified
in
ISO
14040
and
ISO
14044
.
The
goal
of
an
LCA
is
to
highlight
hotspots
of
potential
environmental
impacts
in
production
processes
,
to
compare
the
potential
impacts
of
alternative
materials
and
to
improve
the
environmental
performance
of
products
.
Potential
impacts
are
assessed
via
a
number
of
impact
categories
,
e.
g.
,
climate
change
,
acidification
and
land
use
.
The
following
four
steps
are
determined
by
the
ISO
.
In
the
first
step
,
the
system
under
investigation
and
the
objectives
of
the
LCA
are
defined
including
the
system
boundaries
and
the
relevant
impact
categories
.
In
the
second
step
,
the
product
inventory
is
analysed
,
i.
e.
,
all
material
and
energy
inputs
and
outputs
for
all
processes
in
the
value
chain
are
compiled
.
The
third
step
is
the
impact
assessment
as
such
.
The
system
inputs
and
outputs
are
quantified
for
each
impact
category
.
For
example
,
for
the
impact
category
Global
Warming
,
this
means
that
the
data
is
translated
into
an
amount
of
CO2
equivalent
.
The
last
step
of
an
LCA
is
the
presentation
and
interpretation
of
the
results
.
A
detailed
description
of
LCA
and
its
features
can

The
method
introduced
in
this
article
can
be
categorized
as
an
impact
assessment
method
for
the
integration
of
biodiversity
into
LCA
.
In
fact
,
it
is
an
impact
assessment
method
which
aims
to
quantify
potential
environmental
impacts
of
land
use
on
biodiversity
.
The
development
of
impact
assessment
methods
quantifying
land
use
impacts
started
in
the
early
1990s
with
Heijungs
et
al.
.
They
were
the
first
to
describe
the
impact
of
land
use
as
the
product
of
area
and
time
,
but
at
that
point
without
the
consideration
of
soil
qualities
.
Later
on
,
the
UN
Environment
Life
Cycle
Initiative
(
formerly
known
as
UNEP-SETAC
Life
Cycle
Initiative
)
defined
the
impacts
of
land
use
as
a
function
of
quality
(
Q
)
,
area
(
A
)
and
time
(
t
)
.
In
this
framework
,
the
quality
can
be
any
indicator
on
which
land
use
of
a
specific
area
has
an
impact
over
a
specific
period
.
For
example
,
soil
quality
,
water
storage
capacity
or
,
as
presented
in
this
article
,
biodiversity
.
Two
types
of
land
use
can
be
differentiated
—
land
transformation
and
land
occupation
.
As
illustrated
in
<figure>
Figure
1
</figure>
,
land
transformation
is
the
change
from
a
reference
situation
(
Qref
)
to
another
quality
status
at
one
specific
time
(
t0
)
.
Occupation
means
the
continuation
of
the
(
typically
lower
)
quality
status
over
a
time
period
(
from
t0
to
tfin
)
.
The
change
of
the
quality
(
ΔQ
)
can
either
be
temporary
if
it
is
reversible
,
or
permanent
if
it
is
(
partly
or
entirely
)
irreversible
.
</p>
<p>
This
approach
is
the
basis
for
all
impact
assessment
methods
quantifying
impacts
of
land
use
,
and
thus
also
for
the
method
presented
here
.

State
of

Art
in
Biodiversity
LCIA
</head>
<p>
One
consensus
in
LCA
research
is
that
beside
climate
change
,
pollution
,
unsustainable
use
of
resources
and
invasive
species
,
the
main
threat
to
biodiversity
is
the
loss
of
habitat
driven
by
the
use
of
land
for
anthropogenic
purposes
.
Thus
,
biodiversity
,
including
genetic
,
species
and
ecosystem
diversity
as
defined
by
the
Convention
on
Biological
Diversity
,
can
be
one
aspect
that
represents
quality
(
Q
)
within
the
framework
presented
ahead
(
see
<figure>
Figure
1
</figure>
)
.
Several
life
cycle
impact
assessment
(
LCIA
)
methods
consider
biodiversity
as
a
so-called
end
point
indicator
.
Nevertheless
,
there
is
no
consensus
on
which
indicators
to
use
to
represent
impacts
of
land
use
on
biodiversity
in
LCIA
.
In
current
research
,
two
main
directions
can
be
distinguished
:
LCIA
methods
which
link
land
use
to
species
richness
(
positing
:
Q
=
species
richness
)
,
and
LCIA
methods
which
link
ecological
conditions
to
impacts
on
biodiversity
(
positing
:
Q
=
function
of
ecological
conditions
)
.
For
the
former
approach
,
species
richness
of
e.
g.
,
vascular
plants
is
commonly
used
as
an
indicator
,
often
amended
with
species
richness
of
several
animal
taxa
.
The
latter
approach
is
usually
based
on
a
set
of
quantifiable
conditions
,
e.
g.
,
deadwood
availability
in
forest
ecosystems
.
Additionally
,
new
developments
also
aim
to
assess
the
impacts
on
functional
diversity
(
e.
g.
,
)
.
However
,
these
are
only
applicable
in
very
limited
contexts
to
date
.
The
LCIA
method
presented
in
this
article
calculates
the
impact
on
biodiversity
based
on
the
conditions
that
in
all
likelihood
define
the
biodiversity
on
the
patch
of
land
under
investigation
.
