<hi rend="bold">
Why
are
you
running
for
political
office
,
why
at
the
federal
level
,
why
this
party
,
and
why
in
this
riding
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
I
have
decided
to
run
for
political
office
because
I
think
we
live
in
a
great
country
,
and
I
want
to
do
my
part
to
continue
building
up
on
the
heritage
of
our
ancestors
.
</p>
<p>
When
this
country
was
founded
,
the
preamble
of
the
constitution
states
&quot;
Whereas
Canada
is
founded
upon
principles
that
recognize
the
supremacy
of
God
and
the
rule
of
law
...
&quot;
.
At
the
federal
level
,
we
have
seen
many
examples
where
this
fact
is
not
upheld
.
</p>
<p>
The
Christian
Heritage
party
is
the
only
federal
party
which
supports
the
whole
constitution
as
written
,
and
will
base
it
laws
upon
the
principles
set
out
in
the
Bible
.
</p>
<p>
I
am
running
in
this
riding
because
the
riding
that
I
live
in
already
had
a
candidate
in
this
riding
,
and
Brandon-Souris
is
the
closest
to
where
I
live
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Previous
to
this
campaign
,
have
you
been
politically
involved
?
How
will
you
apply
your
previous
work/volunteer/life
experience
to
serving
your
constituents
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
This
is
my
first
political
experience
.
However
,
in
my
work
as
a
First
Nation
consultant
,
I
have
had
much
experience
dealing
with
political
issues
,
both
at
the
federal
and
provincial
level
.
I
am
also
volunteering
as
a
member
of
the
parent
’s
advisory
committee
in
our
children
’s
school
,
and
have
volunteered
in
the
past
as
a
lay
pastor
of
a
church
.
</p>
<p>
The
experiences
have
taught
me
how
to
listen
to
people
’s
concerns
and
explain
any
positions
that
I
have
taken
in
decisions
,
while
at
the
same
time
hearing
their
concerns
and
taking
those
concerns
to
the
appropriate
people
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
As
you
campaign
around
your
riding
,
it
's
likely
that
some
issues
are
mentioned
more
often
by
voters
,
than
other
issues
.
What
would
you
say
are
the
three
hottest
topics
this
election
,
in
your
riding
?
What
would
you
and
your
party
do
to
address
these
issues
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
The
Brandon-Souris
riding
is
a
large
riding
with
diverse
interests
and
concerns
.
This
riding
includes
people
living
in
a
city
,
family
farms
,
and
First
Nations
.
Therefore
it
is
difficult
to
identify
major
issues
.
</p>
<p>
That
said
,
It
appears
that
the
three
hottest
topics
that
I
have
encountered
so
far
in
no
particular
order
are
:
</p>
<p>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
The
farmer
’s
concerns
about
the
<hi rend="bold">
Canadian
Wheat
Board
</hi>
.
</item>
<item>
The
family
concerns
about
the
<hi rend="bold">
lack
of
support
for
family
with
only
one
income
</hi>
.
</item>
<item>
The
First
Nation
concerns
are
the
<hi rend="bold">
settling
of
land
claims
</hi>
.
</item>
</list>
</p>
<p>
In
each
of
these
and
other
issues
,
the
Christian
Heritage
Party
have
a
platform
which
can
be
viewed
on
the
party
website
at
www
.
chp
.
ca
.
In
terms
of
the
issues
listed
above
,
our
party
supports
the
dismantling
of
the
Canadian
Wheat
Board
,
offering
a
$
1,000
monthly
child-care
support
for
families
in
which
one
parent
stays
at
home
with
the
children
,
and
we
believe
that
First
Nation
land
claims
should
be
settled
quickly
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Is
there
any
misconceptions
about
you
,
your
leader
,
or
your
party
and
platform
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
Being
a
small
federal
party
,
I
have
found
that
there
is
a
lack
of
knowledge
of
our
party
more
than
a
misconception
.
We
do
not
have
access
to
the
same
dollars
that
the
five
larger
parties
and
given
from
our
tax
dollars
based
on
the
number
of
votes
in
the
last
election
.
This
money
can
be
used
by
the
larger
parties
for
advertising
which
we
cannot
afford
and
makes
it
more
difficult
to
get
our
message
out
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
There
's
a
more
ways
than
ever
to
get
your
message
out
,
from
the
traditional
campaign
fliers
and
lawn
signs
,
to
new
media
like
websites
,
Facebook
,
and
YouTube
.
The
tried-and-true
routes
get
the
message
out
to
the
masses
much
easier
,
but
digital
alternatives
are
much
more
measurable
in
how
many
are
seeing
or
interacting
with
your
campaign
.
What
seems
to
be
the
most
effective
,
from
your
experience
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
Since
this
is
my
first
campaign
,
I
have
not
comment
on
this
at
this
time
.
