As
Wyant
emerged
from
the
house
he
paused
once
more
to
glance
up
at
its
scarred
brick
facade
.
The
marble
hand
drooped
tragically
above
the
entrance
:
in
the
waning
light
it
seemed
to
have
relaxed
into
the
passiveness
of
despair
,
and
Wyant
stood
musing
on
its
hidden
meaning
.
But
the
Dead
Hand
was
not
the
only
mysterious
thing
about
Doctor
Lombard
’s
house
.
What
were
the
relations
between
Miss
Lombard
and
her
father
?
Above
all
,
between
Miss
Lombard
and
her
picture
?
She
did
not
look
like
a
person
capable
of
a
disinterested
passion
for
the
arts
;
and
there
had
been
moments
when
it
struck
Wyant
that
she
hated
the
picture
.
</p>
<p>
The
sky
at
the
end
of
the
street
was
flooded
with
turbulent
yellow
light
,
and
the
young
man
turned
his
steps
toward
the
church
of
San
Domenico
,
in
the
hope
of
catching
the
lingering
brightness
on
Sodoma
’s
St.
Catherine
.
</p>
<p>
The
great
bare
aisles
were
almost
dark
when
he
entered
,
and
he
had
to
grope
his
way
to
the
chapel
steps
.
Under
the
momentary
evocation
of
the
sunset
,
the
saint
’s
figure
emerged
pale
and
swooning
from
the
dusk
,
and
the
warm
light
gave
a
sensual
tinge
to
her
ecstasy
.
The
flesh
seemed
to
glow
and
heave
,
the
eyelids
to
tremble
;
Wyant
stood
fascinated
by
the
accidental
collaboration
of
light
and
color
.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly
he
noticed
that
something
white
had
fluttered
to
the
ground
at
his
feet
.
He
stooped
and
picked
up
a
small
thin
sheet
of
note-paper
,
folded
and
sealed
like
an
old-fashioned
letter
,
and
bearing
the
superscription
:
--
</p>
<p>
To
the
Count
Ottaviano
Celsi
.
</p>
<p>
Wyant
stared
at
this
mysterious
document
.
Where
had
it
come
from
?
He
was
distinctly
conscious
of
having
seen
it
fall
through
the
air
,
close
to
his
feet
.
He
glanced
up
at
the
dark
ceiling
of
the
chapel
;
then
he
turned
and
looked
about
the
church
.
There
was
only
one
figure
in
it
,
that
of
a
man
who
knelt
near
the
high
altar
.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly
Wyant
recalled
the
question
of
Doctor
Lombard
’s
maid-servant
.
Was
this
the
letter
she
had
asked
for
?
Had
he
been
unconsciously
carrying
it
about
with
him
all
the
afternoon
?
Who
was
Count
Ottaviano
Celsi
,
and
how
came
Wyant
to
have
been
chosen
to
act
as
that
nobleman
’s
ambulant
letter-box
?
</p>
<p>
Wyant
laid
his
hat
and
stick
on
the
chapel
steps
and
began
to
explore
his
pockets
,
in
the
irrational
hope
of
finding
there
some
clue
to
the
mystery
;
but
they
held
nothing
which
he
had
not
himself
put
there
,
and
he
was
reduced
to
wondering
how
the
letter
,
supposing
some
unknown
hand
to
have
bestowed
it
on
him
,
had
happened
to
fall
out
while
he
stood
motionless
before
the
picture
.
</p>
<p>
At
this
point
he
was
disturbed
by
a
step
on
the
floor
of
the
aisle
,
and
turning
,
he
saw
his
lustrous-eyed
neighbor
of
the
table
d’hote
.
</p>
<p>
The
young
man
bowed
and
waved
an
apologetic
hand
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
do
not
intrude
?
”
he
inquired
suavely
.
</p>
<p>
Without
waiting
for
a
reply
,
he
mounted
the
steps
of
the
chapel
,
glancing
about
him
with
the
affable
air
of
an
afternoon
caller
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
see
,
”
he
remarked
with
a
smile
,
“
that
you
know
the
hour
at
which
our
saint
should
be
visited
.
”
</p>
<p>
Wyant
agreed
that
the
hour
was
indeed
felicitous
.
</p>
<p>
The
stranger
stood
beamingly
before
the
picture
.
</p>
<p>
“
What
grace
!
What
poetry
!
”
he
murmured
,
apostrophizing
the
St.
Catherine
,
but
letting
his
glance
slip
rapidly
about
the
chapel
as
he
spoke
.
</p>
<p>
Wyant
,
detecting
the
manoeuvre
,
murmured
a
brief
assent
.
</p>
<p>
“
But
it
is
cold
here
--
mortally
cold
;
you
do
not
find
it
so
?
”
The
intruder
put
on
his
hat
.
“
It
is
permitted
at
this
hour
--
when
the
church
is
empty
.
And
you
,
my
dear
sir
--
do
you
not
feel
the
dampness
?
You
are
an
artist
,
are
you
not
?
And
to
artists
it
is
permitted
to
cover
the
head
when
they
are
engaged
in
the
study
of
the
paintings
.
”
</p>
<p>
He
darted
suddenly
toward
the
steps
and
bent
over
Wyant
’s
hat
.
</p>
<p>
“
Permit
me
--
cover
yourself
!
”
he
said
a
moment
later
,
holding
out
the
hat
with
an
ingratiating
gesture
.
</p>
<p>
A
light
flashed
on
Wyant
.
</p>
<p>
“
Perhaps
,
”
he
said
,
looking
straight
at
the
young
man
,
“
you
will
tell
me
your
name
.
My
own
is
Wyant
.
”
</p>
<p>
The
stranger
,
surprised
,
but
not
disconcerted
,
drew
forth
a
coroneted
card
,
which
he
offered
with
a
low
bow
.
On
the
card
was
engraved
:
--
</p>
<p>
Il
Conte
Ottaviano
Celsi
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
am
much
obliged
to
you
,
”
said
Wyant
;
“
and
I
may
as
well
tell
you
that
the
letter
which
you
apparently
expected
to
find
in
the
lining
of
my
hat
is
not
there
,
but
in
my
pocket
.
”
</p>
<p>
He
drew
it
out
and
handed
it
to
its
owner
,
who
had
grown
very
pale
.
</p>
<p>
“
And
now
,
”
Wyant
continued
,
“
you
will
perhaps
be
good
enough
to
tell
me
what
all
this
means
.
”
</p>
<p>
There
was
no
mistaking
the
effect
produced
on
Count
Ottaviano
by
this
request
.
His
lips
moved
,
but
he
achieved
only
an
ineffectual
smile
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
suppose
you
know
,
”
Wyant
went
on
,
his
anger
rising
at
the
sight
of
the
other
’s
discomfiture
,
“
that
you
have
taken
an
unwarrantable
liberty
.
I
do
n’t
yet
understand
what
part
I
have
been
made
to
play
,
but
it
’s
evident
that
you
have
made
use
of
me
to
serve
some
purpose
of
your
own
,
and
I
propose
to
know
the
reason
why
.
”
</p>
<p>
Count
Ottaviano
advanced
with
an
imploring
gesture
.
</p>
<p>
“
Sir
,
”
he
pleaded
,
“
you
permit
me
to
speak
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
expect
you
to
,
”
cried
Wyant
.
“
But
not
here
,
”
he
added
,
hearing
the
clank
of
the
verger
’s
keys
.
“
It
is
growing
dark
,
and
we
shall
be
turned
out
in
a
few
minutes
.
”
