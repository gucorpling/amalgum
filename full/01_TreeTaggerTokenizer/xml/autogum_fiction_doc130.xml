V.
A
Girl
Captain
</head>
<p>
When
Wilbur
came
on
deck
the
morning
after
the
sinking
of
the
bark
he
was
surprised
to
find
the
schooner
under
way
again
.
Wilbur
and
Charlie
had
berthed
forward
during
that
night
--
Charlie
with
the
hands
,
Wilbur
in
the
Captain
's
hammock
.
The
reason
for
this
change
of
quarters
had
been
found
in
a
peremptory
order
from
Moran
during
the
dog-watch
the
preceding
evening
.
</p>
<p>
She
had
looked
squarely
at
Wilbur
from
under
her
scowl
,
and
had
said
briefly
and
in
a
fine
contralto
voice
,
that
he
had
for
the
first
time
noted
:
“
I
berth
aft
,
in
the
cabin
;
you
and
the
Chinaman
forward
.
Understand
?
”
</p>
<p>
Moran
had
only
forestalled
Wilbur
's
intention
;
while
after
her
almost
miraculous
piece
of
seamanship
in
the
rescue
of
the
schooner
,
Charlie
and
the
Chinese
crew
accorded
her
a
respect
that
was
almost
superstitious
.
</p>
<p>
Wilbur
met
her
again
at
breakfast
.
She
was
still
wearing
men
's
clothing
--
part
of
Kitchell
's
outfit
--
and
was
booted
to
the
knee
;
but
now
she
wore
no
hat
,
and
her
enormous
mane
of
rye-colored
hair
was
braided
into
long
strands
near
to
the
thickness
of
a
man
's
arm
.
The
redness
of
her
face
gave
a
startling
effect
to
her
pale
blue
eyes
and
sandy
,
heavy
eyebrows
,
that
easily
lowered
to
a
frown
.
She
ate
with
her
knife
,
and
after
pushing
away
her
plate
Wilbur
observed
that
she
drank
half
a
tumbler
of
whiskey
and
water
.
</p>
<p>
The
conversation
between
the
two
was
tame
enough
.
There
was
no
common
ground
upon
which
they
could
meet
.
To
her
father
's
death
--
no
doubt
an
old
matter
even
before
her
rescue
--
she
made
no
allusion
.
Her
attitude
toward
Wilbur
was
one
of
defiance
and
suspicion
.
Only
once
did
she
relax
:
</p>
<p>
“
How
did
you
come
to
be
aboard
here
with
these
rat-eaters
--
you
're
no
sailor
?
”
she
said
abruptly
.
</p>
<p>
“
Huh
!
”
laughed
Wilbur
,
mirthlessly
;
“
huh
!
I
was
shanghaied
.
”
</p>
<p>
Moran
smote
the
table
with
a
red
fist
,
and
shouted
with
sonorous
,
bell-toned
laughter
.
</p>
<p>
“
Shanghaied
?
--
you
?
Now
,
that
is
really
good
.
And
what
are
you
going
to
do
now
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
What
are
you
going
to
do
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Signal
the
first
home-bound
vessel
and
be
taken
into
Frisco
.
I
've
my
insurance
to
collect
(
Wilbur
had
given
her
the
'
Letty
's
'
papers
)
and
the
disaster
to
report
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Well
,
I
'm
not
keen
on
shark-hunting
myself
,
”
said
Wilbur
.
But
Moran
showed
no
interest
in
his
plans
.
</p>
<p>
However
,
they
soon
found
that
they
were
not
to
be
permitted
to
signal
.
At
noon
the
same
day
the
schooner
sighted
a
steamship
's
smoke
on
the
horizon
,
and
began
to
raise
her
rapidly
.
Moran
immediately
bound
on
the
ensign
,
union
down
,
and
broke
it
out
at
the
peak
.
</p>
<p>
Charlie
,
who
was
at
the
wheel
,
spoke
a
sentence
in
Chinese
,
and
one
of
the
hands
drew
his
knife
across
the
halyards
and
brought
the
distress
signal
to
the
deck
.
Moran
turned
upon
Charlie
with
an
oath
,
her
brows
knitted
.
</p>
<p>
“
No
!
No
!
”
sang
Charlie
,
closing
his
eyes
and
wagging
his
head
.
“
No
!
Too
muchee
los
'
time
;
no
can
stop
.
You
come
downside
cabin
;
you
an
'
one-piece
boss
number
two
(
this
was
Wilbur
)
have
um
chin-chin
.
”
</p>
<p>
The
odd
conclave
assembled
about
Kitchell
's
table
--
the
club-man
,
the
half-masculine
girl
in
men
's
clothes
,
and
the
Chinaman
.
The
conference
was
an
angry
one
,
Wilbur
and
Moran
insisting
that
they
be
put
aboard
the
steamship
,
Charlie
refusing
with
calm
obstinacy
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
have
um
chin-chin
with
China
boys
las
'
nigh
'
.
China
boy
heap
flaid
,
no
can
stop
um
steamship
.
Heap
flaid
too
much
talkee-talkee
.
No

;
go

now
;
go

.
Los
'
heap

;
go

.
I
no
savvy
sail
um

,
China
boy
no
savvy
sail
um

.
I
tink
um
you
savvy
(
and
he
pointed
to
Moran
)
.
I
tink
um
you
savvy
plenty
heap
much
disa

.
Boss
number
two
,
him
no
savvy
sail
um
boat
,
but
him
savvy
plenty
many
all
same
.
'
</p>
<p>
“
And
we
're
to
stop
on
board
your
dough-dish
and
navigate
her
for
you
?
”
shouted
Moran
,
her
face
blazing
.
</p>
<p>
Charlie
nodded
blandly
:
“
I
tink
um
yass
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
And
when
we
get
back
to
port
,
”
exclaimed
Wilbur
,
“
you
think
,
perhaps
I
--
we
wo
n't
make
it
interesting
for
you
?
”
</p>
<p>
Charlie
smiled
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
tink
um
Six
Company
heap
rich
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Well
,
get
along
,
”
ordered
Moran
,
as
though
the
schooner
was
her
property
,
“
and
we
'll
talk
it
over
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
China
boy
like
you
heap
pretty
big
,
”
said
Charlie
to
Moran
,
as
he
went
out
.
“
You
savvy
sail
um
boat
all
light
;
wanta
you
fo
'
captain
.
But
,
”
he
added
,
suddenly
dropping
his
bland
passivity
as
though
he
wore
a
mask
,
and
for
an
instant
allowing
the
wicked
malevolent
Cantonese
to
come
to
the
surface
,
“
China
boy
no
likee
funnee
business
,
savvy
?
”
Then
with
a
smile
of
a
Talleyrand
he
disappeared
.
</p>
<p>
Moran
and
Wilbur
were
helpless
for
the
present
.
They
were
but
two
against
seven
Chinamen
.
They
must
stay
on
board
,
if
the
coolies
wished
it
;
and
if
they
were
to
stay
it
was
a
matter
of
their
own
personal
safety
that
the
“
Bertha
Millner
”
should
be
properly
navigated
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
'll
captain
her
,
”
concluded
Moran
,
sullenly
,
at
the
end
of
their
talk
.
“
You
must
act
as
mate
,
Mr.
Wilbur
.
And
do
n't
get
any
mistaken
idea
into
your
head
that
,
because
I
'm
a
young
girl
and
alone
,
you
are
going
to
run
things
your
way
.
I
do
n't
like
funny
business
any
better
than
Charlie
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Look
here
,
”
said
Wilbur
,
complaining
,
“
do
n't
think
I
'm
altogether
a
villain
.
I
think
you
're
a
ripping
fine
girl
.
You
're
different
from
any
kind
of
girl
I
ever
met
,
of
course
,
but
you
,
by
jingo
,
you're
--
you
're
splendid
.
There
in
the
squall
last
evening
,
when
you
stood
at
the
wheel
,
with
your
hair
--
