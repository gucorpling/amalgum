Hakkari

is
a
city
in

<p>
The
city
of
Hakkari
itself
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
.
Lots
of
army
quarters
but
everyday
life
seems
pretty
normal
.
Getting
there
makes
it
worth
the
trip
,
as
you
are
literally
in
the
<hi rend="italic">
most
</hi>
remote
city
of
the
country
,
near
the
corner
where
Turkish
,
<ref target="Iran">
Iranian
</ref>
,
and
<ref target="Iraq">
Iraqi
</ref>
borders
meet
.
</p>
<p>
People
seem
to
be
indifferent
to
tourists
(
or
perhaps
just
a
little
cautious
)
but
usually
react
in
a
friendly
way
if
you
want
to
take
their
pictures
.
You
will
hear
very
little
<ref target="Turkish%20phrasebook">
Turkish
</ref>
.
Almost
everybody
in
the
streets
speaks
<ref target="Kurdish%20phrasebook">
Kurdish
</ref>
.
</p>
<p>
Before
<ref target="World%20War%20I">
World
War
I
</ref>
,
the
surrounding
mountainous
area
was
densely
populated
by
the
<hi rend="bold">
Chaldeans
</hi>
,
who
still
call
the
area
home
to
a
smaller
degree
.
The
Chaldeans
are
Eastern
Catholics
who
reverted
to
communion
with
the
Roman
Catholic
Church
after
the
schism
of
1552
,
when
they
broke
from
the
Syriac
Orthodox
Church
,
which
in
its
turn
broke
from
mainstream
<ref target="Christianity">
Christianity
</ref>
in
the
schism
of
431
that
came
about
after
the
Council
of
<ref target="Ephesus">
Ephesus
</ref>
.
In
1692
,
a
smaller
group
of
Chaldeans
(
re-)broke
their
communion
with
Rome
,
declaring
themselves
to
be
the
members
of
the
Assyrian
Church
of
the
East
,
an
independent
Eastern
Christian
denomination
with
a
patriarchate
in
the
village
of
Qodchanis
(
modern
Konak
)
,
northeast
of
Hakkari
.
(
In
1918
,
the
patriarchate
was
moved
to
<ref target="Iraqi%20Kurdistan">
Iraqi
Kurdistan
</ref>
,
and
the
former
church
in
Qodchanis
now
lays
in
ruins
.

Frequent
buses
from
Van
make
Hakkari
easily
accessible
.
</p>
<head>
Get
around
</head>
<p>
As
Hakkari
is
not
a
big
place
most
of
the
town
is
within
walking
distance
.
(
But
do
read
the
&quot;
Stay

&quot;
passage
.
)
It
does
spread
out
,
however
,
over
various
hills

Hakkari
has
three
hotels

None
of
them
has
its

This

hotel
is
pretty
modern
and
pretty
good
value
for
money

Make
sure
you
get
to

<hi rend="italic">

Negotiate
.
They
expect
you
to
haggle
.
They
might
start
with
80
TL/person
.
Try
to
settle
for
60
.
But
if
you
have
the
right

,
you
will
enjoy
the

<p>
Travelling
there
is
pretty
safe
as
long
as
you
stick
to
the
main
roads
and/or
use
public
transport
.
Going
for
a
wild
walk
(
to
take
pictures
)
on
your
own
even
to
the
top
of
one
of
the
hills
close
to
the
city
could
let
you
end
up
next
to
a
military
zone
.
That
could
be
<hi rend="italic">
very
</hi>
unpleasant
as
you
may
be
thought
to
be
a
PKK
agent
and
treated
as
such
.
You
should
always
have
your
passport
or
ID
with
you
.
To
a
frustrated
and
rightly
fearful
soldier
in
these
regions
(
not
the
most
comfortable
place
to
be
deployed
)
,
it
seems
to
be
difficult
to
differentiate
between
a
tourist
and
a
terrorist
.

several

Van
</ref>
daily
leaving
from
the

to
all

The
only
bus
southwest
to
<ref target="%C5%9E%C4%B1rnak">
Şırnak
</ref>
leaves
pretty
early
in
the
morning
(
7AM
)
,
though

<p>
Check

big
bus
companies
like
Vangölü

or

.
Due
to
the
regional
conflicts
there
might
be
ID
controls
on
the
buses
.
In
case
of
bombings
roads
might
also
be
closed
,
so
do
not
rely
on
too
tight
a
schedule
.
