The
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_Nations">
United
Nations
</ref>
(
UN
)
suspended
all
of
its
operations
in
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Gaza">
Gaza
</ref>
from
yesterday
,
after
the
bombing
of
a
convoy
of
UN
aid
trucks
which
killed
one
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Palestine">
Palestinian
</ref>
driver
,
and
wounded
three
others
.
Thursday
was
the
second
day
of
attacks
on
UN
targets
after
three
UN
schools
housing
refugees
were
bombed
on
Tuesday
,
killing
over
50
civilians
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
UNRWA
decided
to
suspend
all
its
operations
in
the
Gaza
Strip
because
of
the
increasing
hostile
actions
against
its
premises
and
personnel
,
&quot;
Adnan
Abu
Hasna
,
a
Gaza-based
spokesman
for
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United%20Nations%20Relief%20and%20Works%20Agency">
United
Nations
Relief
and
Works
Agency
</ref>
(
UNRWA
)
,
said
yesterday
.
Richard
Miron
,
spokesman
for
the
UN
said
that
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Israel">
Israeli
</ref>
military
had
been
notified
in
advance
of
the
coordinates
of
the
relief
trucks
saying
,
&quot;
This
underlines
the
fundamental
insecurity
inside
Gaza
at
a
time
when
we
are
trying
to
address
the
dire
humanitarian
needs
of
the
population
there
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
bombing
of
the
UN
trucks
was
the
last
straw
for
the
UN
,
already
angered
after
Israeli
tanks
fired
on
a
UN
school
housing
refugees
killing
50
including
an
entire
family
of
seven
young
children
.
The
UN
said
that
they
had
given
Israel
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS">
GPS
</ref>
coordinates
of
their
schools
,
and
demanded
accountability
for
the
attacks
.
Israel
's
government
says
it
is
investigating
the
incidents
.
</p>
<p>
More
schools
were
attacked
including
the
al-Fakhora
School
killing
40
people
,
many
of
them
women
and
children
.
Hours
before
the
attack
on
the
al-Fakhora
School
was
an
attack
on
Asma
Elementary
School
which
killed
three
Palestinian
cousins
.
The
cousin
's
father
said
the
bodies
were
so
mangled
he
could
n't
tell
the
bodies
apart
,
&quot;
We
came
to
the
school
when
the
Israelis
warned
us
to
leave
,
&quot;
he
said
.
&quot;
We
hoped
it
would
be
safe
.
We
were
20
in
one
room
.
We
had
no
electricity
,
no
blankets
,
no
food
.
&quot;
Suddenly
we
heard
a
bomb
that
shook
the
school
.
Windows
smashed
.
Children
started
to
scream
.
A
relative
came
and
told
me
one
of
my
sons
was
killed
.
I
found
my
son
's
body
with
his
two
cousins
.
They
were
cut
into
pieces
by
the
shell
.
&quot;
Like
al-Fakhora
,
Asma
Elementary
is
an
UNRWA
school
.

<p>
The
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/International_Committee_of_the_Red_Cross">
International
Committee
of
the
Red
Cross
</ref>
(
ICRC
)
said
on
yesterday
that
they
were
trying
for
four
days
to
get
their
ambulances
to
a
Gaza
neighborhood
before
being
allowed
to
by
Israeli
military
forces
.
After
getting
there
,
they
said
,
they
found
four
starving
children
sitting
next
to
the
bodies
of
their
dead
mothers
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
This
is
a
shocking
incident
,
&quot;
said
Pierre
Wettach
,
ICRC
chief
for
Israel
and
the
occupied
Palestinian
territories
.
&quot;
The
Israeli
military
must
have
been
aware
of
the
situation
but
did
not
assist
the
wounded
.
Neither
did
they
make
it
possible
for
us
or
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Palestinian_Red_Crescent">
Palestinian
Red
Crescent
</ref>
to
assist
the
wounded
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Israel
granted
a
three-hour
ceasefire
yesterday
that
they
gave
for
aid
workers
to
enter
areas
that
they
had
closed
off
.
50
bodies
were
recovered
during
the
ceasefire
,
raising
the
death
toll
to
763
,
including
more
than
200
children
,
since
air
raids
first
began
on
December
27
.
3,121
people
have
also
been
wounded
.
Eight
Israeli
soldiers
and
three
civilians
have
died
in
the
same
period
.
Israeli
forces
also
shot
a
Palestinian
man
in
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/West_Bank">
West
Bank
</ref>
during
a
protest
against
Israel
's
actions
in
Gaza
.
Yesterday
,
a
Palestinian
man
was
killed
by
Israeli
forces
after
a
confrontation
in
the
West
Bank
Jewish
settlement
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma'ale%20Adumim">
Ma'ale
Adumim

near
