West
on
his

DS
:
Were
you
at
a
point
where
you
did
n’t
necessarily
want
to
die
,
but
you
just
did
n’t
care
if
you
lived
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
BW
:
</hi>
That
’s
pretty
much
it
,
yeah
.
You
put
your
finger
on
it
.
There
is
a
point
that
you
can
reach
in
your
life
where
you
do
n’t
want
to
live
but
you
have
n’t
made
the
decision
to
die
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
Whatever
happens
happens
.
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
BW
:
</hi>
Yeah
.
You
let
the
wind
blow
you
around
.
I
have
a
zillion
stories
.
I
should
write
a
book
.
These
are
stories
that
you
think
,
'
No
,
that
could
n’t
be
true
.
That
could
n’t
possibly
be
true
.
'
I
was
in
radio
around
the
same
time
too
.
I
went
back
to
playing
music
in
the
early
eighties
after
a
hiatus
.
I
started
playing
again
with
a
couple
of
people
and
I
was
also
working
radio
but
I
was
in
a
constant
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackout%20(alcohol-related%20amnesia)">
blackout
</ref>
.
And
people
said
I
was
good
on
the
radio
.
I
do
n’t
know
what
I
did
or
said
.
I
just
used
to
come
in
there
and
turn
the
place
upside
down
.
I
was
too
good
to
fire
.
But
they
did
n’t
know
what
to
do
with
me
,
you
know
.
I
’d
come
in
in
the
middle
of
a
night
—
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
And
that
would
almost
egg
you
on
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
BW
:
</hi>
No
,
no
.
It
was
n’t
that
.
They
would
n’t
just
grab
me
and
throw
me
up
against
a
wall
and
say
,
“
Listen
,
you
little
fuck
,
you
’re
going
to
rehab
.
”
I
got
away
with
this
kind
of
behavior
and
it
was
awful
because
I
was
terrorizing
people
.
Not
during
the
day
.
At
night
.
And
stories
.
There
would
always
be
stories
and
then
it
would
make
the
papers
.
You
know
,
that
kind
of
stuff
.
I
finally
cracked
up
a
car
and
I
was
in
for
non-payment
of
rent
and
the
judge
says
,
'
I
do
n’t
care
about
this
non-payment
of
rent
thing
,
but
you
’re
doing
a
week
in
Charles
Street
Jail
for
this
DWI
that
you
never
answered
for
.
'
This
was
before
the
advent
of
computers
.
Now
,
they
press
a
button
and
it
spits
out
everything
.
But
back
then
,
you
could
screw
up
in
one
town
and
then
go
to
another
town
and
do
exactly
the
same
thing
and
they
could
never
put
them
together
because
everything
was
on
paper
.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
Now
it
’s
all
electronic
.
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
BW
:
</hi>
But
I
was
n’t
proud
of
that
.
That
was
the
lowest
point
of
my
life
.
But
I
’ve
been
sober
for
longer
than
I
was
a
user
.
Twenty-two
years
.

Is
West
glad
he
experienced
addiction
?

<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
Are
you
in
some
way
glad
that
you
went
through
the
drug
and
alcohol
abuse
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
BW
:
</hi>
I
could
ask
you
the
same
thing
and
I
do
n't
mean
to
pull
a
&quot;
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Donald_Rumsfeld">
Donald
Rumsfeld
</ref>
,
&quot;
interviewing
myself
.
But
I
could
ask
you
the
same
thing
.
Are
you
glad
?
Because
if
you
are
where
you
are
and
it
seems
okay
,
then
you
had
to
have
gone
through
those
things
for
you
to
be
the
total
sum
of
your
experiences
which
led
you
to
the
very
spot
and
the
very
phone
you
’re
talking
on
.
You
know
what
I
mean
?
And
so
it
’s
almost
like
no
matter
what
you
did
,
if
you
finally
get
yourself
together
and
you
mean
well
and
things
are
going
okay
,
it
’s
like
,
'
Well
,
it
had
to
be
that
way
.
'
The
universe
obviously
had
to
teach
me
something
.
