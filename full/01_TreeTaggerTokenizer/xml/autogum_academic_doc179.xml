In
this
section
the
numerical
results
obtained
by
the
Gallerano
et
al.
numerical
model
are
compared
with
the
experimental
measurements
by
Ting
and
Kirby
.
The
test
conducted
by
Ting
and
Kirby
consisted
of
realizing
a
spilling
breaking
wave
on
a
sloping
beach
.
It
is
possible
to
examine
the
wave
energy
dissipation
in
the
surf
zone
due
to
the
turbulence
by
means
of
the
turbulence
model
.
The
experimental
wave
tank
was
long
,
wide
,
and
deep
and
consisted
of
a
beach
with
a
constant
slope
equal
to
connected
to
a
region
with
a
constant
depth
equal
to
the
wavemaker
was
placed
at
the
left
end
of
the
wave
tank
.
In
this
paper
,
in
order
to
save
computational
time
,
we
numerically
reproduced
only
the
final
eighteen
meters
of
the
experimental
arrangement
shown
in
<figure>
Figure
2
</figure>
,
and
the
abscissa
indicates
the
toe
of
the
slope
where
the
still
water
depth
is
equal
to
.

The
computational
grid
adopted
for
all
the
numerical
simulations
consisted
of
grid
cells
in
the
horizontal
direction
in
which
spanned
from
to
and
the
grid
spacing
was
.
In
the
vertical
direction
,
grid
cells
were
used
.
As
shown
in
<figure>
Figure
3
</figure>
,
the
mesh
was
refined
at
the
top
and
bottom
boundaries
.
For
this
test
,
cnoidal
waves
with
period
and
wave
height
were
imposed
as
input
boundary
conditions
.
In
the
swash
region
,
a
wetting
–
drying
treatment
was
used
.

Spilling
Breaking
Test
without
Turbulence
Model
</head>
<p>
In
this
subsection
we
present
briefly
the
numerical
results
obtained
without
the
turbulence
model
.
</p>
<p>
<figure>
Figure
4
</figure>
shows
the
distribution
of
the
wave
crest
and
wave
trough
in
the
cross-shore
direction
,
together
with
the
mean
water
level
,
obtained
by
the
Gallerano
et
al.
numerical
model
in
which
the
turbulence
model
was
switched
off
.
The
mean
water
level
and
the
wave
crest
and
trough
,
shown
in
<figure>
Figure
4
</figure>
,
were
computed
by
performing
,
respectively
,
a
time-average
and
a
phase-average
,
over
five
wave
periods
of
the
date
extracted
from
the
numerical
simulation
,
once
the
simulation
reached
a
quasi-stationary
state
.
In
the
same
figure
,
the
experimental
results
by
Ting
and
Kirby
and
the
numerical
results
by
Ma
are
also
shown
.
In
the
shoaling
zone
(
)
the
numerical
results
obtained
by
the
Gallerano
et
al.
numerical
model
fit
quite
well
with
the
experimental
results
,
while
after
the
initial
wave
breaking
point
(
)
the
numerical
results
overestimated
the
experimental
ones
.
As
shown
in
<figure>
Figure

</figure>
,
similar
numerical
results
were
obtained
by
Ma
et
al.

Spilling
Breaking
Test
with
Turbulence
Model
</head>
<p>
<figure>
Figure
5
</figure>
shows
the
distribution
of
the
wave
crest
and
wave
trough
in
the
cross-shore
direction
,
together
with
the
mean
water
level
,
obtained
by
the
Gallerano
et
al.
numerical
model
in
which
the
turbulence
model
is
the
standard
proposed
by
Rodi
.
From
this
figure
,
it
is
possible
to
notice
that
for
this
test
case
the
standard
turbulence
model
produces
an
excessive
non-physical
decrease
in
the
wave
height
with
respect
to
the
experimental
results
.
</p>
<p>
<figure>
Figure
6
</figure>
shows
a
snapshot
of
the
instantaneous
spatial
distribution
of
the
turbulent
kinetic
energy
(
a
,
b
)
and
the
turbulent
eddy
viscosity
(
c
,
d
)
,
in
two
different
time
steps
,
obtained
by
the
Gallerano
et
al.
numerical
model
in
which
the
turbulence
model
is
the
standard
proposed
by
Rodi
.
From
this
figure
,
it
can
be
noticed
that
the
turbulent
kinetic
energy
is
generated
in
correspondence
with
the
wave
fronts
in
all
the
surf
zone
,
also
before
,
where
the
initial
wave
breaking
point
is
located
according
to
the
experimental
measurements
.
<figure>
Figure
6
</figure>
also
shows
that
,
by
using
the
standard
turbulence
model
,
the
simulated
wave
fronts
are
very
smooth
,
due
to
an
excess
of
the
turbulent
eddy
viscosity
produced
by
the
modelled
turbulent
kinetic
energy
.
</p>
<p>
From
<figure>
Figure
5
</figure>
and
<figure>
Figure
6
</figure>
it
can
be
deduced
that
,
for
this
test
case
,
the
standard
turbulence
model
produces
an
excess
of
turbulent
kinetic
energy
and
turbulent
eddy
viscosity
,
which
entails
very
small
simulated
wave
heights
and
very
smooth
wave
fronts
in
the
whole
surf
zone
.

<figure>
Figure
7
</figure>
shows
the
distribution
of
the
wave
crest
and
wave
trough
in
the
cross-shore
direction
,
together
with
the
mean
water
level
,
obtained
by
the
Gallerano
et
al.
numerical
model
in
which
the
turbulence
model
is
the
modified
turbulence
proposed
in
this
paper
.
In
the
same
figure
,
the
above
numerical
results
are
compared
with
the
experimental
results
by
Ting
and
Kirby
and
the
numerical
results
obtained
by
the
Gallerano
et
al.
numerical
model
in
which
the
turbulence
model
is
switched
off
.
From
this
figure
,
it
is
possible
to
notice
that
the
initial
wave
breaking
point
is
correctly
predicted
by
the
modified
turbulence
model
;
the
modified
turbulence
model
adequately
represents
the
distribution
of
the
wave
crest
and
wave
trough
before
and
after
the
initial
wave
breaking
point
.
