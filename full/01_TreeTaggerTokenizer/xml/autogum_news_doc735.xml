expressed
their
opposition
at

hearing

to
a
local
detainment
provision

Secure
Communities
includes
a
provision
that
ICE
can
ask
state
and
local
detention
facilities
to
hold
anyone
arrested
who
might
be
in
the
US
without
adequate
documentation
until
ICE
has
time
to
review
their
case

The
comments
came
in
a
public
hearing
of
a
policy
working
group
of
the
Public
Safety
and
Justice
Committee
,
convened
to
discuss
a
November
7
recommendation
by
District
Attorney
Jeff
Rosen
to
honor
ICE
detainer
requests
for
serious
and
violent
offenders
.
Since
October
18
,
2011
,
Santa
Clara
County
has
refused
ICE
requests
to
detain
individuals
who
would
otherwise
be
released
.
</p>
<p>
Another
opportunity
for
public
comment
on
this
occurred
this
Thursday
,
at
the
monthly
meeting
of
the
Public
Safety
and
Justice
Committee
of
the
Santa
Clara
County
Board
of
Supervisors
.
Supporters
of
DA
Rosen
's
proposal
had
earlier
asked
their
people
to
email
the
supervisors
and
attend
this
meeting
and
the
Board
of
Supervisors
'
Meeting
next
Tuesday
,
February
12
.
No
public
comments
were
made
at
this
Thursday
's
meeting
.
</p>
<p>
The
January
31
hearing
began
with
comments
by
approximately
25
of
the
audience
of
roughly
35
â€“
40
,
all
of
which
opposed
the
DA
's
proposal
.
They
said
public
safety
was
enhanced
under
the
current
policy
because
many
in
the
immigrant
community
have
less
reason
to
fear
that
they
or
people
they
care
about
would
be
deported
if
the
police
were
called
.
Sheriff
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurie%20Smith">
Laurie
Smith
</ref>
then
described
an
individual
who
is
now
in
prison
with
a
rape
conviction
for
an
event
that
would
have
been
prevented
if
the
detention
request
from
ICE
had
been
honored
.
Several
in
the
audience
replied
by
asking
how
many
other
criminals
would
go
free
because
people
refused
to
report
or
testify
as
a
result
of
increased
fear
of
deportation
.
</p>
<p>
Comments
supporting
the
current
policy
have
been
made
by
people
who
did
not
attend
.

by
Supervisor
Dave
Cortese
,
acting
Public
Defender
Molly
O'Neal
,
and
Director
of
the
Domestic
Violence
Advocacy
Consortium
Cynthia
Hunter
.
They
wrote
,
&quot;
There
is
nothing
more
valuable
to
public
safety
than
community
trust
in
local
law
enforcement
because
it
establishes
residents
'
willingness
to
report
crimes
and
cooperate
with
police
.
But
that
trust
will
break
down
immeasurably
in
immigrant
communities
if
residents
face
the
debilitating
fear
of
deportation
.
This
is
especially
true
in
Santa
Clara
County
,
where
two-thirds
of
residents
live
in
immigrant
households
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Since
the
January
31
hearing
,
support
for
the
position
of
the
Sheriff
and
the
DA
has
begun
to
materialize
with
at
least
one
conservative
group
asking
their
followers
to
email
the
supervisors
and
attend
public
meetings
such
as
the
one
this
Thursday
and
the
Board
of
Supervisors
'
meeting
next
Tuesday
,
February
12
.
</p>
<p>
The
policy
adopted
October
18
,
2011
stated
Santa
Clara
County
would
honor
ICE
detention
requests
&quot;
for
individuals
who
have
been
convicted
of
a
serious
or
violent
felony
,
&quot;
provided
ICE
agreed
in
writing
to
reimburse
the
county
for
the
additional
expense
.
DA
Rosen
's
November
7
presentation
claimed
honoring
ICE
holds
would
&quot;
produce
an
undetermined
amount
of
cost
savings
by
reducing
probation
costs
&quot;
,
as
individuals
otherwise
on
probation
would
be
transferred
to
federal
detention
.
Reports
from
Colorado
and
Los
Angeles
have
claimed
that
ICE
holds
averaged
over
20
days
.
ICE
claims
an
official
limit
of
at
most
two
days
.
</p>
<p>
Los
Angeles
is
currently
being
sued
over
questionable
detentions
of
a
number
of
individuals
including
a
British
filmmaker
named
Duncan
Roy
,
who
was
held
for
89
days
.
If
Los
Angeles
loses
,
it
appears
local
taxpayers
may
be
liable
.
</p>
<p>
After
DA
Rosen
's
presentation
on
November
7
,
the
Santa
Clara
County
Public
Safety
and
Justice
Committee
referred
this
issue
to
its
policy
review
working
group
,
which
held
various
private
meetings
,
failed
to
reach
a
consensus
,
and
then
organized
the
public
meeting
of
January
31
.
The
next
official
action
on
this
issue
is
currently
scheduled
for
the
March
7
meeting
of
the
Public
Safety
and
Justice
Committee
.
