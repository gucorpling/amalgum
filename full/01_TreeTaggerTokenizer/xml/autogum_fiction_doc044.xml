AT
AN
UPPER
WINDOW
</head>
<p>
It
was
very
early
the
next
morning
--
a
time
of
sun
and
dew
.
The
confused
beginnings
of
many
birds
'
songs
spread
into
the
healthy
air
,
and
the
wan
blue
of
the
heaven
was
here
and
there
coated
with
thin
webs
of
incorporeal
cloud
which
were
of
no
effect
in
obscuring
day
.
All
the
lights
in
the
scene
were
yellow
as
to
colour
,
and
all
the
shadows
were
attenuated
as
to
form
.
The
creeping
plants
about
the
old
manor-house
were
bowed
with
rows
of
heavy
water
drops
,
which
had
upon
objects
behind
them
the
effect
of
minute
lenses
of
high
magnifying
power
.
</p>
<p>
Just
before
the
clock
struck
five
Gabriel
Oak
and
Coggan
passed
the
village
cross
,
and
went
on
together
to
the
fields
.
They
were
yet
barely
in
view
of
their
mistress
's
house
,
when
Oak
fancied
he
saw
the
opening
of
a
casement
in
one
of
the
upper
windows
.
The
two
men
were
at
this
moment
partially
screened
by
an
elder
bush
,
now
beginning
to
be
enriched
with
black
bunches
of
fruit
,
and
they
paused
before
emerging
from
its
shade
.
</p>
<p>
A
handsome
man
leaned
idly
from
the
lattice
.
He
looked
east
and
then
west
,
in
the
manner
of
one
who
makes
a
first
morning
survey
.
The
man
was
Sergeant
Troy
.
His
red
jacket
was
loosely
thrown
on
,
but
not
buttoned
,
and
he
had
altogether
the
relaxed
bearing
of
a
soldier
taking
his
ease
.
</p>
<p>
Coggan
spoke
first
,
looking
quietly
at
the
window
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
She
has
married
him
!
&quot;
he
said
.
</p>
<p>
Gabriel
had
previously
beheld
the
sight
,
and
he
now
stood
with
his
back
turned
,
making
no
reply
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
fancied
we
should
know
something
to-day
,
&quot;
continued
Coggan
.
&quot;
I
heard
wheels
pass
my
door
just
after
dark
--
you
were
out
somewhere
.
&quot;
He
glanced
round
upon
Gabriel
.
&quot;
Good
heavens
above
us
,
Oak
,
how
white
your
face
is
;
you
look
like
a
corpse
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Do
I
?
&quot;
said
Oak
,
with
a
faint
smile
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Lean
on
the
gate
:
I
'll
wait
a
bit
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
All
right
,
all
right
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
They
stood
by
the
gate
awhile
,
Gabriel
listlessly
staring
at
the
ground
.
His
mind
sped
into
the
future
,
and
saw
there
enacted
in
years
of
leisure
the
scenes
of
repentance
that
would
ensue
from
this
work
of
haste
.
That
they
were
married
he
had
instantly
decided
.
Why
had
it
been
so
mysteriously
managed
?
It
had
become
known
that
she
had
had
a
fearful
journey
to
Bath
,
owing
to
her
miscalculating
the
distance
:
that
the
horse
had
broken
down
,
and
that
she
had
been
more
than
two
days
getting
there
.
It
was
not
Bathsheba
's
way
to
do
things
furtively
.
With
all
her
faults
,
she
was
candour
itself
.
Could
she
have
been
entrapped
?
The
union
was
not
only
an
unutterable
grief
to
him
:
it
amazed
him
,
notwithstanding
that
he
had
passed
the
preceding
week
in
a
suspicion
that
such
might
be
the
issue
of
Troy
's
meeting
her
away
from
home
.
Her
quiet
return
with
Liddy
had
to
some
extent
dispersed
the
dread
.
Just
as
that
imperceptible
motion
which
appears
like
stillness
is
infinitely
divided
in
its
properties
from
stillness
itself
,
so
had
his
hope
undistinguishable
from
despair
differed
from
despair
indeed
.
</p>
<p>
In
a
few
minutes
they
moved
on
again
towards
the
house
.
The
sergeant
still
looked
from
the
window
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Morning
,
comrades
!
&quot;
he
shouted
,
in
a
cheery
voice
,
when
they
came
up
.
</p>
<p>
Coggan
replied
to
the
greeting
.
&quot;
Bai
n't
ye
going
to
answer
the
man
?
&quot;
he
then
said
to
Gabriel
.
&quot;
I
'd
say
good
morning
--
you
need
n't
spend
a
hapenny
of
meaning
upon
it
,
and
yet
keep
the
man
civil
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Gabriel
soon
decided
too
that
,
since
the
deed
was
done
,
to
put
the
best
face
upon
the
matter
would
be
the
greatest
kindness
to
her
he
loved
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Good
morning
,
Sergeant
Troy
,
&quot;
he
returned
,
in
a
ghastly
voice
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
A
rambling
,
gloomy
house
this
,
&quot;
said
Troy
,
smiling
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Why
--
they
MAY
not
be
married
!
&quot;
suggested
Coggan
.
&quot;
Perhaps
she
's
not
there
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Gabriel
shook
his
head
.
The
soldier
turned
a
little
towards
the
east
,
and
the
sun
kindled
his
scarlet
coat
to
an
orange
glow
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
But
it
is
a
nice
old
house
,
&quot;
responded
Gabriel
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Yes
--
I
suppose
so
;
but
I
feel
like
new
wine
in
an
old
bottle
here
.
My
notion
is
that
sash-windows
should
be
put
throughout
,
and
these
old
wainscoted
walls
brightened
up
a
bit
;
or
the
oak
cleared
quite
away
,
and
the
walls
papered
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
It
would
be
a
pity
,
I
think
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Well
,
no
.
A
philosopher
once
said
in
my
hearing
that
the
old
builders
,
who
worked
when
art
was
a
living
thing
,
had
no
respect
for
the
work
of
builders
who
went
before
them
,
but
pulled
down
and
altered
as
they
thought
fit
;
and
why
should
n't
we
?
'
Creation
and
preservation
do
n't
do
well
together
,
'
says
he
,
'
and
a
million
of
antiquarians
ca
n't
invent
a
style
.
'
My
mind
exactly
.
I
am
for
making
this
place
more
modern
,
that
we
may
be
cheerful
whilst
we
can
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
military
man
turned
and
surveyed
the
interior
of
the
room
,
to
assist
his
ideas
of
improvement
in
this
direction
.
Gabriel
and
Coggan
began
to
move
on
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Oh
,
Coggan
,
&quot;
said
Troy
,
as
if
inspired
by
a
recollection
&quot;
do
you
know
if
insanity
has
ever
appeared
in
Mr.
Boldwood
's
family
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Jan
reflected
for
a
moment
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
once
heard
that
an
uncle
of
his
was
queer
in
his
head
,
but
I
do
n't
know
the
rights
o't
,
&quot;
he
said
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
It
is
of
no
importance
,
&quot;
said
Troy
,
lightly
.
&quot;
Well
,
I
shall
be
down
in
the
fields
with
you
some
time
this
week
;
but
I
have
a
few
matters
to
attend
to
first
.
So
good-day
to
you
.
We
shall
,
of
course
,
keep
on
just
as
friendly
terms
as
usual
.
I
'm
not
a
proud
man
:
nobody
is
ever
able
to
say
that
of
Sergeant
Troy
.
However
,
what
is
must
be
,
and
here
's
half-a-crown
to
drink
my
health
,
men
.
