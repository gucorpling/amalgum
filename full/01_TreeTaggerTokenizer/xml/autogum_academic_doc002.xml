Oxidative
Modification
of
rRNA
</head>
<p>
rRNA
constitutes
the
structural
and
functional
core
of
the
ribosome
.
ROS
can
affect
RNA
in
a
multitude
of
ways
,
including
chemical
modification
of
the
base
and
sugar
moieties
,
generation
of
abasic
sites
,
and
strand
breaks
.
Guanine
is
the
most
easily
oxidized
nucleobase
and
best
studied
in
this
respect
.
An
oxidized
form
of
guanine
,
8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine
(
8-hydroxyguanine
;
8-oxo-G
)
,
is
a
ubiquitous
oxidative
lesion
,
readily
detectable
in
cellular
nucleic
acids
.
When
present
in
mRNA
,
8-oxo-G
interferes
with
decoding
,
possibly
through
the
formation
of
a
Hoogsteen
pair
with
adenine
when
the
base
rotates
around
the
N-glycosidic
bond
.
The
altered
base-pairing
capacity
of
8-oxo-G
can
also
perturb
RNA
folding
.
A
recent
study
revealed
a
variety
of
outcomes
when
8-oxo-G
was
incorporated
into
model
RNA
substrates
,
from
stabilization
of
existing
structural
motifs
to
their
destabilization
and
rearrangements
into
new
structures
.
Since
ribosome
activities
in
translation
depend
on
many
precisely
tuned
conformational
changes
and
movements
within
its
rRNA
framework
,
oxidation
of
the
bases
that
are
critical
for
maintaining
the
correct
rRNA
structure
may
impair
ribosome
functions
.
It
seems
therefore
likely
that
the
need
to
withstand
a
certain
degree
of
oxidation
was
one
of
the
forces
in
shaping
the
evolution
of
the
ribosome
.
A
striking
disappearance
of
many
guanines
from
mitochondrial
rRNA
and
reduced
overall
RNA
content
may
be
two
such
evolutionary
adaptations
that
“
hardened
”
mitoribosomes
against
damage
from
the
abundant
ROS
generated
inside
mitochondria
.

<p>
The
extent
of
cellular
RNA
oxidation
was
reported
to
exceed
that
of
DNA
when
cells
were
directly
treated
with
H2O2
or
subjected
to
conditions
that
induce
secondary
oxidative
damage
,
such
as
UVA
irradiation
and
ammonia
overload
.
In
one
study
,
exposure
of
<hi rend="italic">
E.
coli
</hi>
cells
to
H2O2
was
shown
to
induce
a
dosage-dependent
increase
of
8-oxo-G
in
all
tested
RNA
types
,
including
rRNA
.
By
comparing
8-oxo-G
levels
after
in
vitro
H2O2
treatment
of
RNAs
in
their
native
and
denatured
forms
,
the
same
study
concluded
that
folding
of
rRNA
did
not
protect
it
against
oxidative
damage
.
Similar
conclusions
were
made
by
Willi
and
colleagues
,
who
used
an
8-oxo-G
antibody
to
immunoprecipitate
oxidized
RNA
from
H2O2-treated
<hi rend="italic">
E.
coli
</hi>
cells
.
</p>

A
large
body
of
observations
points
to
the
association
of
oxidized
RNA
with
disease
.
High
8-oxo-G
content
in
cytoplasmic
and
nucleolar
RNA
was
found
in
vulnerable
neurons
in
Alzheimer′s
disease
(
AD
)
,
Parkinson
’s
disease
,
and
neurons
of
the
hippocampal
region
and
temporal
neocortex
in
patients
with
Lewy
body
dementia
.
Elevated
levels
of
8-oxo-G
in
RNA
were
also
detected
in
neuropsychiatric
disorders
,
including
schizophrenia
,
depressive
,
and
bipolar
disorders
.
Furthermore
,
RNA
extracted
from
atherosclerotic
plaques
was
heavily
modified
with
8-oxo-G
.
Although
links
between
8-oxo-G
and
human
pathologies
have
been
based
largely
on
the
analysis
of
total
RNA
,
rRNA
is
the
most
abundant
cellular
RNA
type
,
which
typically
accounts
for
about
80
%
of
the
total
RNA
,
from
which
one
can
reasonably
assume
that
oxidative
damage
to
ribosomes
in
all
these
pathological
conditions
must
be
widespread
.
Studies
that
focused
specifically
on
rRNA
confirmed
it
to
be
a
major
target
of
the
8-oxo-G
modification
in
patients
with
AD
and
mild
cognitive
impairment
,
a
condition
that
often
precedes
AD
.
