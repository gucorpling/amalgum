account
,
you
can
add
them

,
having

do
this
cautiously

an
account
for

grandchild

you
can
do
this
by
adding
their
name
to
your

.
This
has
to
be
done
in
a
specific
part
of
the
form
that
is
usually
designated
for
&quot;
investments
on
behalf
of
a
minor
.
&quot;
They
cannot
have
their
own
account
if
they
are
under
18
years
old

,
by
having
their
name
on

this
is

address

helps
the
investment
company
and
the
government
ensure
that
you
are
allowed
to
open
an
account
and
it
gives
them
somewhere
to
send
correspondence

can
use
the
correct
pronouns
with
you
