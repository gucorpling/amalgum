Find
the
right
sources
.
If
you
want
to
know
about
Buddhism
,
do
not
ask
a
Scientologist
;
likewise
,
do
not
ask
a
Christian
about
Satanism
.
Be
conscious
that
contradicting
'
Satanic
'
organizations
will
offer
different
information
on
Satanism
.
This
is
their
opinion
;
they
are
entitled
to
it
,
but
if
you
want
to
research
Satanism
(
not
just
an
offshoot
of
it
)
you
should
seek
the
source/founding
of
the
religion
.
At
The
Church
of
Satan
's
website
you
can
find
all
the
information
you
need
or
methods
in
which
to
obtain
further
information
such
as
The
Satanic
Bible
.

Define
your
terms
.
There
is
a
difference
between
Satanism
and
Devil-Worship
.
Satanism
,
being
referred
to
here
in
this
Wiki-how
,
is
the
religion
formed
by
Anton
Szandor
LaVey
based
on
The
Satanic
Bible
.
Devil
worship
refers
to
the
practice
of
believing
in
the
reverse
of
Christianity
.
There
are
also
theistic
or
traditional
Satanists
who
believe
in
a
real
Satan
,
which
members
of
the
Church
of
Satan
do
not
.

churches

formed
after

Church
