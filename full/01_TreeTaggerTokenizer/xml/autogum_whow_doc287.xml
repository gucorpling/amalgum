Tips

<list type="unordered">
<item>
Depending
on
the
cooking
method
you
may
need
to
add
liquid
like
milk
or
water
or
stock
.
For
example
,
cooking
in
a
pot
on
a
stove
requires
additional
liquid
because
of
evaporation
.
Using
a
pressure
cooker
should
use
little
or
no
extra
liquid
.
Also
remember
that
additions
like
pasta
will
require
additional
cooking
liquid(s)
.
It
is
better
to
have
a
little
more
liquid
than
necessary
than
not
enough
.
</item>
<item>
Use
an
instant
read
thermometer
to
check
meat
temperature
-
as
long
as
the
meat
exceeds
175F
you
should
be
safe
.

and
casserole
recipes

size
the
recipe
large
enough
,
you

Some
recipes
you
can
portion
out

food
bags

them

just
remove
the
container(s)/bag(s

meat(s)
in
a
recipe
can
pose
health
dangers

the

stirring
the
pot

stove
top

pot
.
