.
In
this
brief
lifetime
she
accomplished
,
perhaps
,
more
than
any
composer
who
ever
lived
,
for
she
provided
the
piano
of
absolutely
every
tasteless
sentimental
person
in
the
so-called
civilised
world
with
a
piece
of
music
which
that
person
,
however
unaccomplished
in
a
dull
technical
sense
,
could
play
.
It
is
probable
that
if
the
market
stalls
and
back-street
music
shops
of
Britain
were
to
be
searched
The
Maiden
's
Prayer
would
be
found
to
be
still
selling
,
and
as
for
the
Empire
at
large
,
Messrs.
Allen
of
Melbourne
reported
in
1924
,
sixty
years
after
the
death
of
the
composer
,
that
their
house
alone
was
still
disposing
of
10,000
copies
a
year
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
composition
is
a
short
piano
piece
for
intermediate
pianists
.
Some
have
liked
it
for
its
charming
and
romantic
melody
,
and
others
have
described
it
as
&quot;
sentimental
salon
tosh
.
&quot;
The
pianist
and
academic
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Loesser">
Arthur
Loesser
</ref>
described
it
as
a
&quot;
dowdy
product
of
ineptitude
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
American
musician
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Wills">

arranged
the
piece
in
