A
WRITER'S
REQUEST
OF
HIS
MASTER
</head>
<p>
Let
me
never
tag
a
moral
to
a
story
,
nor
tell
a
story
without
a
meaning
.
Make
me
respect
my
material
so
much
that
I
dare
not
slight
my
work
.
Help
me
to
deal
very
honestly
with
words
and
with
people
because
they
are
both
alive
.
Show
me
that
as
in
a
river
,
so
in
a
writing
,
clearness
is
the
best
quality
,
and
a
little
that
is
pure
is
worth
more
than
much
that
is
mixed
.
Teach
me
to
see
the
local
colour
without
being
blind
to
the
inner
light
.
Give
me
an
ideal
that
will
stand
the
strain
of
weaving
into
human
stuff
on
the
loom
of
the
real
.
Keep
me
from
caring
more
for
books
than
for
folks
,
for
art
than
for
life
.
Steady
me
to
do
my
full
stint
of
work
as
well
as
I
can
:
and
when
that
is
done
,
stop
me
,
pay
what
wages
Thou
wilt
,
and
help
me
to
say
,
from
a
quiet
heart
,
a
grateful
AMEN
.

PREFACE
</head>
<p>
In
every
life
worth
writing
about
there
is
a
ruling
passion
,
--
“the
very
pulse
of
the
machine
.
”
Unless
you
touch
that
,
you
are
groping
around
outside
of
reality
.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes
it
is
romantic
love
:
Natures
masterpiece
of
interested
benevolence
.
In
almost
all
lives
this
passion
has
its
season
of
empire
.
Therefore
,
and
rightly
,
it
is
the
favourite
theme
of
the
storyteller
.
Romantic
love
interests
almost
everybody
,
because
almost
everybody
knows
something
about
it
,
or
would
like
to
know
.
</p>
<p>
But
there
are
other
passions
,
no
less
real
,
which
also
have
their
place
and
power
in
human
life
.
Some
of
them
come
earlier
,
and
sometimes
they
last
longer
,
than
romantic
love
.
They
play
alongside
of
it
and
are
mixed
up
with
it
,
now
checking
it
,
now
advancing
its
flow
and
tingeing
it
with
their
own
colour
.
</p>
<p>
Just
because
love
is
so
universal
,
it
is
often
to
one
of
the
other
passions
that
we
must
look
for
the
distinctive
hue
,
the
individual
quality
of
a
life-story
.
Granted
,
if
you
will
,
that
everybody
must
fall
in
love
,
or
ought
to
fall
in
love
,
How
will
he
do
it
?
And
what
will
he
do
afterwards
?
These
are
questions
not
without
interest
to
one
who
watches
the
human
drama
as
a
friend
.
The
answers
depend
upon
those
hidden
and
durable
desires
,
affections
,
and
impulses
to
which
men
and
women
give
themselves
up
for
rule
and
guidance
.
</p>
<p>
Music
,
nature
,
children
,
honour
,
strife
,
revenge
,
money
,
pride
,
friendship
,
loyalty
,
duty
,
--
to
these
objects
and
others
like
them
the
secret
power
of
personal
passion
often
turns
,
and
the
life
unconsciously
follows
it
,
as
the
tides
in
the
sea
follow
the
moon
in
the
sky
.
</p>
<p>
When
circumstances
cross
the
ruling
passion
,
when
rocks
lie
in
the
way
and
winds
are
contrary
,
then
things
happen
,
characters
emerge
,
slight
events
are
significant
,
mere
adventures
are
transformed
into
a
real
plot
.
What
care
I
how
many
“
hair-breadth
'
scapes
”
and
“
moving
accidents
”
your
hero
may
pass
through
,
unless
I
know
him
for
a
man
?
He
is
but
a
puppet
strung
on
wires
.
His
kisses
are
wooden
and
his
wounds
bleed
sawdust
.
There
is
nothing
about
him
to
remember
except
his
name
,
and
perhaps
a
bit
of
dialect
.
Kill
him
or
crown
him
,
--
what
difference
does
it
make
?
</p>
<p>
But
go
the
other
way
about
your
work
:
</p>
<p>
“
Take
the
least
man
of
all
mankind
,
as
I
;
Look
at
his
head
and
heart
,
find
how
and
why
He
differs
from
his
fellows
utterly
,
”
--
</p>
<p>
and
now
there
is
something
to
tell
,
with
a
meaning
.
</p>
<p>
If
you
tell
it
at
length
,
it
is
a
novel
,
--
a
painting
.
If
you
tell
it
in
brief
,
it
is
a
short
story
,
--
an
etching
.
But
the
subject
is
always
the
same
:
the
unseen
,
mysterious
,
ruling
passion
weaving
the
stuff
of
human
nature
into
patterns
wherein
the
soul
is
imaged
and
revealed
.
</p>
<p>
To
tell
about
some
of
these
ruling
passions
,
simply
,
clearly
,
and
concretely
,
is
what
I
want
to
do
in
this
book
.
The
characters
are
chosen
,
for
the
most
part
,
among
plain
people
,
because
their
feelings
are
expressed
with
fewer
words
and
greater
truth
,
not
being
costumed
for
social
effect
.
The
scene
is
laid
on
Nature
's
stage
because
I
like
to
be
out-of-doors
,
even
when
I
am
trying
to
think
and
learning
to
write
.

He
entered
the
backwoods
village
of
Bytown
literally
on
the
wings
of
the
wind
.
It
whirled
him
along
like
a
big
snowflake
,
and
dropped
him
at
the
door
of
Moody
's
“
Sportsmen
's
Retreat
,
”
as
if
he
were
a
New
Year
's
gift
from
the
North
Pole
.
His
coming
seemed
a
mere
chance
;
but
perhaps
there
was
something
more
in
it
,
after
all
.
At
all
events
,
you
shall
hear
,
if
you
will
,
the
time
and
the
manner
of
his
arrival
.
</p>
<p>
It
was
the
last
night
of
December
,
some
thirty-five
years
ago
.
All
the
city
sportsmen
who
had
hunted
the
deer
under
Bill
Moody
's
direction
had
long
since
retreated
to
their
homes
,
leaving
the
little
settlement
on
the
border
of
the
Adirondack
wilderness
wholly
under
the
social
direction
of
the
natives
.
</p>
<p>
The
annual
ball
was
in
full
swing
in
the
dining-room
of
the
hotel
.
At
one
side
of
the
room
the
tables
and
chairs
were
piled
up
,
with
their
legs
projecting
in
the
air
like
a
thicket
of
very
dead
trees
.
