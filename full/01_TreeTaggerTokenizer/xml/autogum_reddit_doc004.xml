Dating
in
your
30s
is
weird
...
</head>
<sp who="#unknown">
<p>
It
's
also
tough
.
It
's
also
confusing
.
You
can
have
a
career
,
financial
stability
,
be
subjectively
attractive
,
fit
,
have
enough
hobbies
to
make
you
a
well-rounded
person
,
be
social
,
put
yourself
in
environments
where
you
'd
think
you
'd
meet
someone
,
join
all
the
dating
sites
and
use
all
the
apps
...
and
still
,
nothing
.
I
'm
halfway
through
my
30s
now
,
and
the
spot
I
'm
in
is
where
it
's
like
of
course
I
want
to
meet
someone
,
but
at
this
age
,
I
get
easily
exhausted
at
the
thought
of
putting
in
a
ton
of
effort
only
to
realize
there
's
usually
little
to
no
reward
in
it
pertaining
to
resolving
my
dating
life
.
It
's
almost
as
if
there
's
more
unnecessary
stress
and
less
courtesy
when
all
you
're
trying
to
be
is
a
human
trying
to
genuinely
connect
with
another
human
.
This
is
not
being
pessimistic
either
,
but
just
a
fact
of
how
eventually
dating
wears
me
out
easily
at
this
stage
.
I
have
friends
where
the
process
has
been
pretty
easy
,
so
seeing
that
does
n't
light
a
fire
in
me
either
.
One
friend
of
mine
who
is
a
girl
who
never
dated
in
her
entire
life
until
two
years
ago
signed
up
for
Match
and
met
a
guy
within
two
months
.
They
're
living
together
now
and
very
happy
.
Another
friend
of
mine
married
a
girl
who
accidentally
messaged
him
on
facebook
because
he
had
the
same
name
as
a
former
college
friend
of
hers
,
and
one
thing
led
to
another
.
That
sort
of
easy
,
effortless
strike
of
luck
<hi rend="bold">
never
</hi>
happens
to
me
haha
I
still
put
myself
on
dating
sites
every
now
and
then
without
expecting
much
,
and
always
look
for
opportunities
out
there
in
the
real
world
to
potentially
be
introduced
to
someone
new
,
yet
I
would
be
lying
if
I
did
n't
say
there
's
also
those
nights
where
I
see
that
things
are
n't
changing
,
I
get
tired
by
that
thought
,
and
really
do
n't
care
.

I
was
in
the
same
boat
in
my
30s
.
Got
in
a
relationship
...
and
it
blew
up
horribly
last
year
.
Now
I
'm
sort
-of
dating
in
my
40s
.
My
own
reflection
:
I
'm
not
going
to
pack
it
in
or
anything
dramatic
when
it
comes
to
dating
or
not
dating
.
But
I
've
had
the
token
rebound
relationship
,
and
I
've
had
a
few
very
uninspiring
first
dates
.
My
biggest
realizations
:
</p>
<p>
1
.
I
've
never
enjoyed
dating
that
much
;
</p>
<p>
2
.
I
'm
not
yet
ready
to
date
someone
seriously
;
</p>
<p>
3
.
I
am
capable
of
being
happy
as
a
solo
act
,
as
long
as
I
take
responsibility
for
my
happiness
;
</p>
<p>
4
.
I
do
n't
entirely
know
what
I
'm
looking
for
in
a
woman
,
but
I
have
a
good
idea
what
I
'm
not
looking
for
;
</p>
<p>
5
.
I
may
not
meet
the
right
woman
anytime
soon
;
</p>
<p>
6
.
I
may
pass
through
middle
age
alone
;
and
,
</p>
<p>
7
.
All
of
this
is
perfectly
OK
.
