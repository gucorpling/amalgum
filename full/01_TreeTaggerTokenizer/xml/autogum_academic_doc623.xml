Introduction
</head>
<p>
The
gut
microbiota
is
an
ecological
community
constituted
by
a
large
number
of
bacteria
,
archaea
,
protists
,
fungi
and
viruses
.
The
microbiota
produces
multiple
metabolites
that
may
cross
the
intestinal
barrier
and
exert
biological
effects
.
The
microbiota
also
impacts
on
the
integrity
of
the
gut
barrier
.
Gut
barrier
dysfunction
may
result
in
bacterial
translocation
from
the
intestines
with
increased
plasma
lipopolysaccharides
(
LPS
)
.
Multiple
studies
have
found
a
relationship
between
the
microbiota
and
adequate
metabolic
,
hormonal
and
immunologic
homeostasis
.
Gut
dysbiosis
,
i.
e.
,
an
altered
composition
of
the
intestinal
microbiota
in
disease
is
associated
with
poor
health
outcomes
.
Dysbiosis
may
be
treated
with
probiotics
,
i.
e.
,
live
strains
of
selected
bacteria
,
or
prebiotics
,
food
components
that
modulate
the
microbiota
.
Multiple
metabolic
,
cardiovascular
,
and
respiratory
diseases
including
type
2
diabetes
mellitus
,
obesity
,
systemic
and
pulmonary
hypertension
,
atherosclerosis
,
heart
failure
and
chronic
respiratory
diseases
have
been
linked
to
impaired
gut
microbiota
.
Dysbiosis
is
frequently
characterized
by
:
(
a
)
lower
microbial
diversity
and
richness
,
(
b
)
changes
in
the
relative
abundance
of
phyla
with
an
increased

Firmicutes
</hi>
to
<hi rend="italic">
Bacteroidetes
</hi>
ratio
(
F/B
)
,
and
(
c
)
changes
in
short
chain
fatty
acids
(
SCFA
)
producing
bacteria
with
a
relative
increase
in
lactate-producing
bacteria
and
a
relative
decrease
in
acetate-
and
butyrate-producing
bacteria
.

Vitamin
D
is
produced
from
dermal
exposure
to
sunlight
or
from
the
diet
and
is
converted
in
the
liver
into
25-OH-cholecaciferol
or
calcifediol
(
25OHVitD
)
,
whose
measure
serves
as
an
indicator
of
the
vitamin
D
status
.
This
is
further
metabolized
mainly
in
the
kidney
into
1-α,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol
,
the
most
active
form
,
also
named
calcitriol
,
which
activates
the
vitamin
D
receptor
(
VDR
)
.
Vitamin
D
deficiency
,
which
causes
rickets
and
osteomalacia
,
is
very
common
worldwide
due
to
insufficient
solar
light
exposure
and/or
a
reduced
dietary
intake
.
Besides
this
well-known
regulatory
role
in
the
calcium-phosphorus
and
bone
homeostasis
,
vitamin
D
is
also
involved
in
the
control
of
other
physiological
processes
,
such
as
cellular
growth
,
intracellular
metabolism
and
innate
and
adaptive
immunity
.
Vitamin
D
deficiency
has
also
been
related
to
infection
,
cancer
and
respiratory
and
cardiovascular
diseases
.
Immune
cells
and
peripheral
tissues
can
also
synthetize
calcitriol
and
express
VDR
.
Thus
,
vitamin
D
has
been
proposed
to
have
immunomodulatory
properties
and
insufficient
vitamin
D
levels
may
lead
to
dysregulation
of
immune
responses
.
Moreover
,
vitamin
D
is
able
to
induce
the
expression
of
antibacterial
proteins
and
exert
antibiotic
effects
in
a
variety
of
cell
types
.
</p>
<p>
We
hypothesized
that
a
deficiency
in
vitamin
D
induces
changes
in
the
gut
microbiota
.
