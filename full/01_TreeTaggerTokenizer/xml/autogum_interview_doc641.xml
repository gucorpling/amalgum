What
was
the
audience
reaction
to
your
show
like
?

Milly
Bea

</hi>
As
we
were
performing
on
2
small
stages
simultaneously
,
in
the
terracing
,
behind
and
to
the
either
side
of
the
main
stage
,
we
were
quite
a
distance
from
the
audience
,
so
could
n’t
really
gauge
their
general
reaction…Those
faces
I
could
see
down
below
,
of
the
roadies
backstage
,
were
all
smiles
and
waving
fists
of
rock
…
.
We
did
hear
back
from
a
few
people
in
the
audience
that
we
looked
great
from
the
distance
and
on
the
screen
when
we
appeared
on
occasion
.
They
noted
the
massive
fire
and
our
choreography
.
</p>
<p>
The
stunt
guys
enjoyed
our
show
and
apparently
Ozzy
stopped
to
whatch
us
briefly
as
he
moved
towards
the
mainstage
!

Just
how
much
fuel
did
you
get
through
,
and
at
what
cost
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Milly
Bea
:
</hi>
We
had
over
estimated
our
fuel
usage
…
better
to
have
more
than
not
enough
I
suppose
.
We
probably
ended
up
using
8
litres
of
kerosene
for
each
15-20minute
burn
set
.
</p>
<p>
So
for
2
burns
sets
on
2
stages
for
2
nights
plus
1
rehersal
each…Making
that
a
grand
total
of
10
burns
of
8L
=80L
at
$
4
L…approx.
.

<p>
About
that.
.
I
did
n’t
do
the
figures
or
pay
too
much
attention
to
how
much
we
were
burning.
.
but
think
that
’s
a
pretty
good
guess
.

How
has
this
event
changed
things
at
Flame

?

<hi rend="bold">
Milly

:
</hi>
Flame
Fire
Productions
has
n’t
really
changed
all
that
much
as
a
result…by
the
fame
I
mean.
.
tahaha
has
n’t
really
been
any
major
influx
of
gigs
as
a
result.
.
!
!
?
But
now
,
as
a
result
of
needing
to
invest
in
more
&amp;
in
quality
gear
for
Rock2Wtgn
,
we
have
a
mass
of
new
and
gorgeous
fire
toys
and
red
hot
pvc
costumes…that
do
truly
rock
!
And
some
great
photos
and
an
awesome
experience
.

Do
you
anticipate
a

If
so

do
you

Milly

</hi>
It
would
be
great
to
be
involved
in
the
same
or
similar
event
.
I
love
the
idea
of
combining
big
Music
gigs
with
other
performing
arts
and
dance
…
in
one
night
events
as
well
as
music
festivals
.
Its
awesome
to
work
with
other
artists
and
organisers
in
creating
events
that
surround
,
immerse
the
audience
so
they
are
embraced
by
the
experience
being
communicated
and
received
through
all
the
senses
,
visual
,
sound
etc
...
.
whether
Rock
or
whatever
!

What
was
your
personal
opinion
of
the
bands
performing
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Milly
Bea
:
</hi>
I
find
my
personal
opinion
of
the
bands
performing
quite
entertaining
really…I
never
really
realized
or
experienced
the
art
of
Rock
theatre
and
I
did
find
it
both
disturbing
and
comical
as
well
as
rocking.
.
KISS
were
outrageous
!
!
Their
outfits
?
!
The
studs
!
!
The
boots
!
!
What
are
they
on
?
And
that
man
's
[
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene%20Simmons">
Gene
Simmons
</ref>
'
]
tongue
is
outrageous.
.
and
what
he
does
with
it
!
!
I
was
ooooeing
and
laughing
and
rocking
my
fist
in
the
air.
.
definately
entertaining.
.
Alice
Cooper
was
also
a
little
disturbing
especially
when
it
came
to
the
hitting
the
lady
dancer
routine.
.
did
n't
dig
it
…
and
the
baby
in
the
push
chair
?
.
.
a
clash
of
psycho
&amp;
comic
...
?
althou
I
did
like
some
of
his
lyrics
