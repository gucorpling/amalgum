Know
their
current
mood
and
situation
.
Before
prejudices
it
helps
that
you
know
what
they
are
experiencing
currently
.
It
helps
to
ask
:
What
mood
are
they
currently
in
?
What
could
have
caused
him
to
act
this
way
?
It
helps
if
you
can
inquire
about
his
situation
through
a
little
chat
.
Talk
to
him
about
it
;
however
be
careful
to
know
the
point
at
which
he
is
willing
to
share
.
Being
too
inquisitive
may
not
be
the
best
thing
to
do
for
some
people

Warnings

<list type="unordered">
<item>
Remember
to
have
an
open
mind
in
your
judgment
.
Remember
that
nowadays
nothing
is
impossible
,
people
are
more
than
capable
of
committing
unforgivable
acts
,
however
you
should
also
take
into
account
that
not
all
people
are
evil
,
we
should
take
into
account
our
own
human
nature
,
our
survival
instinct
,
everything
is
a
factor
.
</item>
<item>
Remember
that
it
is
in
our
human
nature
to
do
bad
things
every
now
and
then
.
However
always
remember
that
there
are
limits
in
life
where
bad
things
are
not
just
your
everyday
bad
things
.

Remember
that
attempting
to
understand
people
is
very
hard
,
if
you
have
experience
in
psychology
(
even
if
you
do
n't
)
you
know
that
even
with
years
of
experience
and
training
nothing
can
quite
prepare
you
for
each
individual
.
</item>
<item>
Remember
that
when
doing
an
inquiry
about
people
,
respect
their
privacy
,
sometimes
it
's
best
to
leave
some
people
alone
.
