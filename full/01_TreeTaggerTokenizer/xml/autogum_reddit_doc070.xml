Hey
/r/leagueoflegends
-
we
are
/u/AdamJ200
,
/u/FSat
,
/u/MarineRevenge
(
moonmarooned
elsewhere
)
,
and
/u/ristiummask
(
previously
ristiuMMask
)
.
We
are
some
of
the
most
reputable
Garens
on
the
planet
.
In
our
group
,
3
of
us
have
hit
Masters
on
Garen
at
different
times
,
several
of
us
have
written
guides
for
Garen
both
as
text
or
in
video
form
,
and
we
all
are
responsible
for
some
of
the
different
build
innovations
that
have
happened
on
Garen
over
every
ranked
season
in
this
game
.

-
back
when
fervor
keystone
was
a
thing
-
you
name
it
,
one
of
us
has
probably
had
some
amount
of
influence
in
that
build
for
Garen
.
)
Today
we
want
to
discuss
Garen
with
the
community
,
Garen
is
currently
being
looked
at
for
buffs
by
riot
(
much
needed
especially
in
higher
elos
of
play
)
but
the
group
of
us
are
n't
entirely
sure
we
agree
with
what
â€™s
being
done
.
We
also
feel
there
are
MANY
misconceptions
about
Garen
,
even
within
riot
itself
.
One
of
the
casters
in
recent
times
famously
mentioned
how
Garen
has
&quot;
one
of
the
best
early
games
&quot;
but
this
statement
has
been
false
since
2015
.
Here
are
some
examples
to
begin
with
before
we
discuss
:
<hi rend="bold">
Garen
's
a
strong
lane
bully/dominator
-
Garen
's
level
1
stats
are
decent
but
scale
so
poorly
most
bruiser
type
champions
,
and
especially
other
juggernauts
,
outscale
him
very
hard
ever
since
levels
3-4
.
Garen
currently
only
bullies
Irelia
</hi>
Garen
's
a
good
lategame
scaler
-
Garen
's
lategame
has
improved
thanks
to
Juggernaut
rework
,
but
still
is
very
poor
when
compared
with
other
Juggernauts
's
lategame
<hi rend="bold">
Garen
's
E
is
a
huge
damage
source
-
Garen
's
E
is
indeed
a
decent
damage
source
,
but
the
fact
it
runs
over
3
seconds
,
and
the
speed
at
which
the
output
happens
is
variable
and
depends
on
level
makes
it
so
that
early
game
damage
is
A
)
inconsistent
,
and
B
)
just
poor
in
general
.
A
)
is
explained
because
of
isolation
mechanic
forcing
his
damage
down
,
and
B
)
is
explained
by
maths
:
3
autoattacks
happen
at
about
the
same
speed
as
a
full
E
but
do
more
damage
up
until
level
4
.
</hi>
Garen
's
capable
of
killing
a
carry
with
only
BC
as
his
damage
item
-
This
is
only
possible
in
2
scenarios
:
A
)
strict
1v1
(
foe
isolated
,
and
CREEPS
COUNT
for
isolation
mechanic
)
or
B
)
Villain
<hi rend="bold">
Garen
's
Villain
mechanic
is
a
free
ticket
to
win
a
teamfight
-
It
is
a
free
ticket
for
actual
damage
output
towards
a
potential
carry
but
it
's
RNG
based
,
and
since
we
have
no
control
over
the
mechanic
so
we
end
up
not
enjoying
it
either
.
You
hate
it
and
we
'd
like
to
have
more
control
over
it
exchange
for
actual
quality
of
life
improvement
.
We
've
answered
alot
of
questions
over
the
course
of
around
4
hours
.
If
you
have
any
other
questions
post
them
here
.
VOD
of
the
Live
answers
will
be
posted
on
these
channels
for
those
who

Do
you
actually
KNOW
how
the
villain
mechanic
works
?
It
just
makes
0
sense
to
me
at
times
,
I
've
been
convinced
it
was
bugged
when
it
came
out
,
but
never
got
changed
