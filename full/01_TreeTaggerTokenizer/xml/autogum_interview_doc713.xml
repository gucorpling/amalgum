Q
:
</hi>
Why
do
you
want
to
represent
this
particular
ward
on
council
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
A
:
</hi>
I
live
in
ward
33
,
so
it
was
convenient
,
but
also
it
is
next
door
to
my
long
standing
home
in
scarborough
where
I
grew
up
the
past
30
years
.
I
understand
the
social
,
political
,
economic
,
and
cultural
fabric
of
toronto
,
ontario
,
and
canadian
society
.
I
have
lived
almost
my
entire
life
in
East
Toronto
,
so
am
familiar
with
all
the
issues
and
cultural
demands
.
In
short
,
East
Toronto
is
not
a
theater
for
police
to
terrorize
in
the
media
,
nor
a
war
games
playground
,
whereby
asians
are
used
as
an
instrument
to
justify
excessive
police
budgets
.

Q

</hi>
How
are
you
currently
involved
in
the
community

</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
A
:
</hi>
I
have
focused
my
life
's
work
on
understanding
and
publishing
on
issues
of
big
picture
importance
to
3
levels
of
government
to
ensure
that
Canada
does
not
become
the
social
,
political
,
economic
,
and
moral
bankruptcy
of
the
United
States
.
And
I
am
content
to
see
the
benefits
of
my
hard
work
the
past
few
years
.
I
am
a
very
charitable
time
giving
person
.
I
committed
my
time
and
abilities
to
the

Q
:
</hi>
What
does
Toronto
mean
to
you
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
A
:
</hi>
The
past
decade
has
been
one
of
stagnation
for
several
reasons
:
First
,
fiscal
slash
and
burn
policies
by
Federal
Liberals
,
and
Ontario
Conservatives
.
Second
,
Police
and
TTC
unions
rape
and
extort
the
tax
payers
for
unending
higher
wages
.
Let
me
be
very
clear
,
THE
PUBLIC
IS
NOT
A
BANK
ROLE
FOR
UNIONS
TO
MAKE
RIDICULOUS
WAGE
DEMANDS
UPON
SO
THEIR
SALARIES
KEEP
PACE
WITH
INFLATION
-
this
is
the
role
of
banks
and
financial
markets
!
The
result
of
this
is
Toronto
has
become
a
welfare
state
that
is
headed
for
bankruptcy
-
if
things
do
not
change
quickly
.
</p>
<p>
Toronto
must
be
a
model
mega
city
in
our
global
village
.
Toronto
must
demonstrate
leadership
in
private
and
public
sector
innovation
to
ensure
social
,
political
,
and
economic
growth
.
A
homeless
man
or
young
child
should
be
able
to
walk
into
a
court
and
find
justice
-with
little
or
no
cost
,
and
without
fear
of
persecution
.
