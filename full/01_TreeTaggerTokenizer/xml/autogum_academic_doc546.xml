Discussion
and
Conclusions
</head>
<p>
In
this
systematic
review
we
have
summarized
twenty-four
studies
focused
on
the
evaluation
of
soft-tissue
prediction
software
for
maxillofacial
surgery
.
The
treated
software
are
commonly
used
in
clinical
procedures
to
have
a
preview
of
the
patients
’
outcome
after
corrective
surgery
;
the
most
common
methodologies
on
which
these
software
are
based
are
the
mass
spring
model
,
the
finite
element
model
and
the
mass
tensor
model
,
each
of
them
with
its
advantages
and
disadvantages
.
MSM
presents
an
easy
architecture
and
a
low
memory
usage
but
it
has
no
real
biomechanical
foundations
;
FEM
is
more
relevant
from
a
biomechanical
point
of
view
,
but
it
has
a
high
computational
cost
and
a
rather
long
simulation
time
;
MTM
tries
to
combine
the
advantages
of
MSM
and
of
FEM
.
In
particular
,
the
lip
region
is
the
most
difficult
to
predict
,
since
lips
do
not
rely
on
bony
structures
;
moreover
,
it
is
difficult
to
replicate
the
same
lip
position
from
one
acquisition
to
another
.
Due
to
this
particularity
,
lips
are
supposed
to
be
particularly
involved
in
involuntary
displacements
caused
by
surgeries
performed
on
different
facial
areas
.
The
difficulty
in
accurately
predicting
the
appearance
of
this
sub
region
is
a
crucial
point
in
the
development
of
a
prediction
method
,
since
it
is
particularly
related
to
aesthetic
self-perception
and
satisfaction
of
the
patient
.
With
respect
to
the
traditional
algorithms
based
on
hard-
to
soft-tissue
ratio
,
methodologies
involving
biomechanical
models
of
viscoelasticity
of
the
soft
tissue
to
mimic
its
elastic
deformation
seems
to
be
able
to
give
a
more
realistic
simulation
.
Despite
the
number
of
computer
programs
dedicated
to
three-dimensional
prediction
and
surgical
planning
,
maxillofacial
practitioners
often
prefer
to
rely
on
conventional
two-dimensional
methods
.
This
fact
could
be
explained
with
the
overall
results
given
by
these
methodologies
,
which
seem
to
be
only
partially
relevant
and/or
reliable
in
the
practice
of
daily
clinical
activity
.
Concerning
the
works
based
on
Maxilim
,
Shafi
et
al.
found
that
this
software
makes
a
clinically
satisfactory
prediction
of
soft
tissue
changes
,
but
with
an
over-prediction
of
the
position
of
the
upper
lip
;
according
to
Liebregts
et
al.
,
its
accuracy
is
influenced
by
the
magnitude
of
maxillary
and
mandibular
movements
,
by
the
age
of
the
patient
and
by
the
usage
of
V-Y
closure
,
and
these
authors
further
reported
a
low
predictability
of
lower
and
upper
lips
.
Moreover
,
a
general
tendency
was
reported
towards
an
under-prediction
in
the
area
around
the
cheek
and
chin
and
towards
an
over-prediction
at
the
mandibular
inferior
border
.
It
was
suggested
that
Maxilim
inaccuracy
in
the
prediction
of
the
lip
region
might
be
due
to
the
modelling
algorithm
,
i.
e.
,
mass
tensor
,
and
might
indicate
a
non-linear
response
of
the
upper
lip
.
The
study
by
De
Riu
et
al.
,
although
not
directly
focused
on
soft
tissue
prediction
,
reports
that
inaccuracies
in
virtual
planning
are
primarily
due
to
the
soft-tissue
virtual
model
.

<p>
With
regard
to
Dolphin
software
,
Resnick
et
al.
reported
that
the
ability
to
predict
3D
soft
tissue
changes
was
limited
,
with
an
accuracy
that
may
be
acceptable
for
linear
changes
but
not
for
lateral
facial
points
.
Peterman
et
al.
reported
various
degrees
of
accuracy
at
each
soft-tissue
landmark
in
the
horizontal
and
vertical
axes
;
lower
lip
prediction
was
the
least
accurate
.
A
similar
result
of
low
prediction
accuracy
for
the
lower
lip
region
is
reported
by
Pektas
et
al.
.
Conversely
,
two
articles
affirmed
that
the
statistical
differences
between
Dolphin
soft
tissue
prediction
and
the
real
outcome
of
the
patient
did
not
invalidate
the
software
prediction
,
as
it
was
close
to
real
surgical
results
.
Dolphin
3D
imaging
uses
a
landmark-based
photographic
morphing
algorithm
that
was
developed
for
two-dimensional
prediction
and
then
adapted
to
three-dimensional
prediction
;
this
could
be
an
explanation
for
its
imprecisions
.
Moreover
,
it
requires
plotting
79
landmarks
on
the
CT
volume
(
42
for
the
hard
tissue
and
37
for
the
soft
tissue
)
;
the
localization
of
such
a
large
number
of
points
seems
to
require
too
much
time
for
a
stable
usage
in
clinical
daily
practice
.

Among
the
other
considered
software
,
SurgiCase_CMF
was
analyzed
by
Bianchi
et
al.
and
Marchetti
et
al.
;
they
reported
that
the
percentage
of
error
was
less
than
2
mm
for
the
majority
of
patients
,
but
in
both
studies
an
important
error
in
the
areas
of
lips
and
chin
was
reported
.
Khambay
et
al.
,
Terzic
et
al.
and
Ullah
et
al.
used
3dMDvultus
to
predict
soft
tissue
changes
;
in
general
,
they
reported
that
its
use
on
specific
anatomical
regions
was
more
meaningful
than
on
the
full
face
.
Moreover
,
they
reported
an
insufficient
prediction
accuracy
particularly
for
the
lower
part
of
the
face
with
errors
exceeding
3
mm
,
and
for
nasal
and
paranasal
regions
.
Surprisingly
,
prediction
results
seemed
to
be
reliable
for
lips
and
chin
.
