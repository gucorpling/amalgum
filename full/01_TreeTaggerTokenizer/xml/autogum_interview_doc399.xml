Why
have
you
chosen
to
involve
yourself
in
the
political
process
?
Why
did
you
choose
to
run
in
this
constituency
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
The
basic
grouping
of
our
society
,
the
family
,
has
been
undermined
by
government
for
years
.
Parents
are
involved
in
a
struggle
with
the
government
to
raise
their
families
.
</p>
<p>
Parents
are
penalised
should
they
wish
to
educate
their
children
with
their
values
.
They
must
either
pay
public
school
taxes
and
pay
the
cost
of
private
schooling
or
pay
public
school
taxes
and
purchase
supplies
and
home
school
their
children
or
send
their
children
to
public
school
to
have
them
taught
values
contrary
to
their
family
values
.
</p>
<p>
Our
teenagers
are
encouraged
to
leave
home
at
16
years
because
the
government
will
provide
them
with
student
welfare
.
Our
government
will
not
provide
the
love
and
direction
parents
will
,
they
will
simply
offer
our
children
a
way
to
elude
family
discipline
and
live
without
rules
.
Then
we
can
all
deplore
our
society
where
teenagers
are
violent
and
out
of
control
.
</p>
<p>
Our
government
has
undermined
the
vows
of
marriage
by
reducing
them
to
a
contract
then
offering
us
ways
to
break
the
contract
.
They
've
redefined
the
function
of
marriage
to
make
it
simply
a
sexual
contract
between
any
two
adults
.
</p>
<p>
It
's
for
this
reason
that
I
have
entered
the
political
process
in
Ontario
.
</p>

What
prior
political
experience
do
you
have
?
What
skills
and
insight
can
you
bring
to
office
,
from
other
non-political
positions
you
may
have
held
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
I
have
served
twice
as
a
candidate
for
the
federal
Christian
Heritage
Party
.
I
am
able
offer
creative
solutions
to
problems
.
I
am
able
to
work
with
different
people
to
achieve
a
common
goal
.
I
am
willing
to
stand
alone
,
if
I
must
,
against
pressure
to
conform
to
an
idea
or
course
of
action
.
I
am
thrifty
with
other
people
's
money
,
such
as
tax
dollars
,
as
well
as
my
own
.
I
believe
in
personal
responsibility
for
our
actions
...
not
excuses
.
I
am
a
good
listener
,
I
have
spent
11
years
volunteering
at
a
distress
centre
.

Which
of
your
competitors
do
you
expect
to
pose
the
biggest
challenge
to
your
candidacy
?
Why
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
All
of
them
because
they
all
seek
a
mandate
from
the
people
of
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell
.
