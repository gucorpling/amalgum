(
Military

)
.
They
were
travelling

Members

the
MST
destroyed
the

with
scythes
,
and
set

</p>
<p>
The
policemen
were
pursuing

Oliveira
Rodrigues
is
accused

assaulting
banks
and
robbery
of
goods
transported
by

in
the
roads
of
the
region
.
He
hid
at
the

camp
known
as

&quot;
(

The
peasants

The
MST
says
that
the
former
MST

was
already
banished
from
the
moviment
.
The
MST
says
the
peasants
did
n't
know
that
the
three
men
were
policemen
,
that
Oliveira
Rodrigues
deceived
the
other
peasants
,
and
that
the
policemen
could
not
be
identified
as
police
officers
.
The
MST
say
they
have
previously
brought
Oliveira
Rodrigues
to
the
attention
of
the
police
for
the
alleged
theft
of
a
motorcycle
and
beating
of
a
woman
.

Amorim

been
invited
to
go
to
the
town
Police
Station
and
explain
to
the
police
that
the
MST
has
already
denounced
Oliveira
Rodrigues
.
According
to
the
Police
Comissaire
Antônio
Carlos
Câmara
there
are
no
recorded
complaints
concerning
Oliveira
Rodrigues
from
the
MST
at
the
police
station
.
