Not
Your
Typical
Sea-Monkeys
</head>
<sp who="#Torpenta">
<p>
Usually
,
you
only
find
trouble
at
8601
Charcoal
Street
.
Especially
if
you
go
there
at
night
.
Several
miles
of
cracked
asphalt
road
is
littered
with
battered
homes
and
broken
dreams
,
along
with
the
occasional
liquor
store
and
gas
station
.
However
,
a
long
time
ago
,
there
was
a
hidden
gem
in
this
forsaken
area
;
an
old
,
brick
store
with
a
faint
yellow
sign
which
read
&quot;
Novelty
Goods
&quot;
.
In
hindsight
,
most
of
the
trinkets
and
items
were
nothing
more
than
a
fool
's
treasure
cove
.
However
,
even
window
shopping
at
&quot;
Novelty
Goods
&quot;
was
a
priceless
escape
from
the
nearby
slums
of
reality
.
At
least
,
it
was
until
the
store
went
out
of
business
.
Soon
after
,
my
family
moved
away
and
we
struggled
elsewhere
.
My
cousin
,
Howard
,
was
one
of
my
only
true
friends
and
we
stayed
in
touch
despite
the
distance
.
Howard
loved
that
store
almost
as
much
as
I
did
,
but
those
memories
are
tarnished
.
Howard
died
on
8601
Charcoal
Street
.
He
bled
out
from
a
gun
shot
at
the
decayed
ruins
of
&quot;
Novelty
Goods
&quot;
.
The
gaping
hole
in
my
heart
was
only
torn
further
when
I
learned
about
the
strangest
possession
that
he
left
to
my
care
.
Howard
's
will
dictated
that
I
receive
a
key
to
his
storage
shed
less
than
a
few
miles
from
his
home
.
The
storage
unit
contained
a
wide
variety
of
gag-gifts
and
oddities
from
&quot;
Novelty
Goods
&quot;
.
Howard
had
spent
his
childhood
gathering
as
much
memorabilia
before
the
store
closed
.
I
remembered
all
of
the
merchandise
except
for
an
outlier
;
a
turquoise
box
with
a
cartoon
depicting
a
sunken
ruined
city
.
The
box
was
warped
from
moisture
damage
but
the
label
was
legible
.
It
was
called
&quot;
Atlantis
:
the
Sea-Monkey
Civilization
Kit
&quot;
.
I
contemplated
whether
or
not
to
bother
with
the
kit
.
I
mean
,
could
the
sea
monkeys
still
have
been
viable
?
I
flipped
the
box
over
to
see
a
dark
,
blue
background
with
rays
of
blurred
light
near
the
top
of
the
box
.
The
description
on
the
back
was
also
faded
,
but
I
could
decipher
a
few
parts
of
the
paragraph
:
&quot;
These
Sea-Monkeys
have
been
designed
for
optimal
lifespans
.
Your
new
pets
will
start
in
a
cryptobiosis
state
so
that
they
'll
grow
whenever
you
're
ready
to
begin
!
&quot;
The
rest
of
the
writing
was
indecipherable
,
except
for
an
ominous
warning
written
in
red
ink
at
the
bottom
of
the
box
which
read
,
&quot;
COMPANY
IS
NOT
LIABLE
OR
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
BEHAVIOR
AND
ACTIONS
OF
MODIFIED
SEA-MONKEY
ORGANISMS
.
&quot;
The
curiosity
of
the
cryptic
warning
was
the
final
crack
that
withheld
the
dam
of
reasoning
.
Any
logical
argument
to
leave
it
behind
in
its
concrete
tomb
was
made
void
.
It
did
n't
take
me
long
to
arrive
home
;
I
threw
my
keys
on
the
counter
and
sliced
through
the
top
of
the
box
.
A
small
pamphlet
only
offered
simple
instructions
for
the
kit
:
&quot;
Mix
nutrient
pack
with
warm
water
.
Add
patented
organisms
to
water
.
For
best
results
,
add
a
single
hair
to
your
organisms
.
&quot;
OK
,
so
the
last
ingredient
was
odd
but
I
went
along
with
it
.
I
plucked
a
stray
,
blonde
hair
off
the
floor
from
my
pet
,
Captain
,
as
he
curiously
watched
.
The
kit
also
came
with
plastic
scenery
of
roman
columns
and
white
monoliths
to
decorate
the
tank
.
Imagine
my
surprise
when
I
noticed
that
the
kit
lacked
a
tank
.
I
found
my
answer
on
the
second
page
of
the
pamphlet
:
&quot;
Make
sure
that
your
Sea-Monkeys
have
as
much
space
as
possible
.
Small
tanks
make
angry
Sea-Monkeys
,
which
may
lead
to
undesired
consequences
.
&quot;
The
instructions
did
not
require
salt
water
,
so
I
took
a
set
of
old
plastic
tubs
and
chopped
them
apart
through
the
middle
.
Then
I
assembled
the
pieces
with
epoxy
to
make
an
enormous
,
shallow
tank
.
I
added
sand
to
coat
the
bottom
and
crafted
my
civilization
's
cradle
;
a
simple
town
with
an
atrium
in
the
center
along
with
concentric
rings
formed
by
small
dens
.
A
plastic
kelp
forest
lied
beyond
the
town
's
border
for
exploration
and
I
placed
a
lamp
above
the
pool
to
simulate
the
Sun
above
their
homes
.
Finally
,
I
mixed
the
ingredients
and
waited
for
signs
of
life
.
Captain
obediently
guarded
the
pool
as
I
shrugged
off
to
bed
.
When
I
returned
home
,
Captain
gestured
for
me
to
follow
him
back
to
the
tub
.
His
excitement
was
contagious
as
he
yelped
for
my
approval
.
He
had
successfully
managed
his
post
to
protect
the
critters
.
In
less
than
24
hours
,
the
tub
's
water
stirred
and
I
noticed
tiny
shadows
darting
through
the
pool
.
Most
of
the
creatures
seemed
to
hide
in
the
dens
during
the
day
.
So
on
the
following
night
,
I
turned
off
the
large
overhead
lamp
and
waited
for
my
Sea-Monkeys
.
The
last
rays
from
sunset
cracked
through
the
blinds
to
reveal
crowds
of
Sea-Monkeys
on
primitive
streets
and
searching
through
the
artificial
forest
.
I
did
n't
believe
my
eyes
.
So
I
called
a
friend
over
to
verify
my
sanity
.
&quot;
Yeah
,
you
're
not
crazy
,
Zach
.
It
looks
like
your
loyal
subjects
built
roads
.
&quot;
Eddy
congratulated
me
.
&quot;
Do
you
have
any
more
of
these
things
?
What
are
they
anyway
,
brine
shrimp
?
&quot;
Eddy
asked
.
I
tried
to
catch
one
of
them
but
they
were
too
fast
for
my
hands
.
So
I
checked
the
kit
for
further
details
but
turned
up
empty-handed
.
I
rummaged
through
the
other
packs
and
noticed
two
more
pouches
of
&quot;
Sea-Monkeys
&quot;
inside
the
box
.
&quot;
I
guess
you
can
try
to
find
out
for
yourself
.
&quot;
I
offered
as
I
gave
him
one
of
the
Sea-Monkey
packets
.
&quot;
Just
make
sure
you
follow
the
instructions
,
no
matter
how
crazy
they
seem
.
&quot;
I
added
and
placed
the
pamphlet
in
his
hand
.
A
few
days
passed
and
Eddy
had
n't
mentioned
anything
about
his
sea
monkeys
.
I
figured
that
he
was
just
too
busy
or
maybe
that
he
had
forgotten
about
the
creatures
,
but
I
still
decided
to
send
him
a
text
message
:
&quot;
Hey
.
How
did
it
go
?
&quot;
Several
minutes
passed
before
I
received
a
response
:
&quot;
Very
well
.
Come
visit
.
See
for
yourself
.
&quot;
Eddy
only
lived
a
few
blocks
away
so
I
patted
Captain
's
head
and
scratched
behind
his
ears
.
&quot;
You
're
in
charge
of
Atlantis
while
I
'm
gone
.
OK
,
buddy
?
&quot;
I
stated
to
Captain
as
he
wagged
his
tail
.
At
this
point
,
the
sky
was
already
dark
and
I
knew
that
Eddy
's
Sea-Monkeys
should
have
been
active
.
I
knocked
on
his
door
and
waited
for
a
reply
.
After
a
moment
,
I
realized
that
his
door
was
unlocked
,
so
I
walked
inside
.
The
living
room
of
his
apartment
was
dark
but
I
could
see
light
creeping
underneath
the
door
of
his
room
.
&quot;
Hey
,
it
's
me
.
Your
door
was
unlocked
so
I
just
let
myself
in
!
&quot;
I
shouted
.
&quot;
Ohh
...
sorry
...
.
&quot;
Eddy
groaned
from
his
room
.
&quot;
Are
you
alright
?
You
do
n't
sound
well
.
&quot;
I
asked
while
stepping
forward
with
caution
.
Eddy
's
door
creaked
open
as
he
responded
,
&quot;
I
just
need
a
moment
.
I
'm
...
.
.
fine
.
&quot;
I
flicked
on
the
light-switch
for
the
living
room
but
nothing
happened
.
So
I
stumbled
through
the
darkness
as
I
searched
for
his
remote
.
I
rummaged
my
hands
along
the
surface
of
Eddy
's
messy
coffee-table
while
sitting
on
his
coarse
couch
.
&quot;
I
ca
n't
find
your
remote
.
Also
,
your
lights
are
busted
.
&quot;
I
commented
while
I
scratched
along
my
legs
.
Eddy
poked
his
head
from
his
room
.
His
brown
hair
was
disheveled
and
his
face
was
pale
.
&quot;
I
think
I
left
it
in
my
room
...
.
let
me
look
.
&quot;
Eddy
answered
as
he
slowly
disappeared
into
his
bedroom
.
&quot;
Wait
,
do
n't
worry
about
that
.
Just
let
me
see
you
.
You
sound
horrible
.
&quot;
I
commanded
as
I
followed
him
into
his
room
.
A
cold
,
stiff
hand
grabbed
my
neck
from
the
right
side
as
I
entered
his
room
.
A
set
of
bloody
,
crudely-insulated
wires
were
woven
from
his
hands
and
traversed
along
the
walls
of
his
room
.
Bundles
of
wires
were
hooked
to
Eddy
's
other
appendages
and
a
cable
was
implanted
near
the
base
of
his
skull
.
Eddy
's
faded
pupils
stared
vacantly
at
me
as
I
noticed
an
extended
mechanical
claw
from
underneath
his
bed
.
The
claw
operated
a
power
box
at
the
base
of
the
bed
and
smaller
claws
pulled
and
plugged
wires
with
calculated
precision
and
speed
.
&quot;
Eddy
!
&quot;
I
cried
as
I
gasped
for
air
from
his
reinforced
grip
.
I
could
feel
my
lungs
slowly
burning
while
my
heart
skipped
beats
.
I
was
being
strangled
by
my
friend
's
corpse
.
&quot;
You
're
not
going
anywhere
.
Not
until
you
give
...
.
what
we
need
.
&quot;
The
raspy
voice
from
Eddy
's
cadaver
dictated
.
Adrenaline
pumped
through
my
veins
as
I
reached
over
with
my
free
hand
and
ripped
a
bundle
of
wires
away
from
Eddy
's
arm
.
A
furious
gurgling
sound
echoed
from
underneath
Eddy
's
bed
as
his
shoulder
slumped
over
.
However
,
his
grip
was
tighter
than
rigor
mortis
as
I
desperately
tried
to
pry
away
the
remaining
wires
from
his
nerves
.
I
collapsed
to
the
floor
and
catched
my
breath
while
a
sloshing
noise
came
from
the
abyssal
living
room
behind
me
.
I
gathered
my
courage
and
sprinted
for
the
door
-
only
to
fall
over
onto
the
floor
.
The
automaton
formerly
known
as
Eddy
lurched
forward
as
his
cables
dragged
along
the
wooden
floor
boards
.
&quot;
Do
n't
protest
.
Resistance
is
futile
.
&quot;
Eddy
's
corpse
warned
as
he
tried
to
grab
my
leg
.
I
thrashed
my
legs
like
a
wild
fish
as
Eddy
's
cyborg-cadaver
bent
over
.
My
foot
miraculously
snagged
along
a
set
of
wires
attached
to
his
hips
.
The
cords
became
loose
as
I
pulled
my
leg
back
and
the
automaton
fell
to
the
floor
.
At
this
point
,
the
light
from
the
bedroom
revealed
the
brackish
horror
that
once
was
Eddy
's
living
room
.
His
couch
was
covered
in
splashes
of
crusted
,
dry
blood
stains
.
All
of
Eddy
's
kitchenware
were
scattered
over
the
floor
;
cups
and
bowls
were
filled
to
the
brim
with
red
water
.
Each
body
of
water
was
connected
by
a
series
of
capillary
tubing
which
were
filled
with
tiny
shadows
.
The
other
hand
of
Eddy
's
remains
grabbed
my
ankle
as
I
tried
to
shrug
him
off
.
His
arm
repeatedly
went
up
and
down
as
if
it
was
stuck
in
a
loop
while
his
head
was
unnaturally
bent
against
the
floor
.
So
I
went
in
for
the
final
assault
and
ripped
the
largest
bundle
of
nerve
wires
from
the
back
of
Eddy
's
neck
.
&quot;
HOW
DARE
YOU
-
&quot;
The
grave
,
rage-filled
voice
from
Eddy
yelled
before
it
finally
ceased
to
move
.
I
ca
n't
imagine
what
Eddy
's
real
final
words
were
before
his
pets
had
murdered
him
.
I
did
n't
spend
too
much
time
as
I
bolted
out
from
the
door
and
tripped
down
the
stairs
which
led
to
the
ground
floor
.
My
ears
were
ringing
as
I
vomited
over
the
pavement
and
the
blasting
noise
from
sirens
approached
our
location
.
The
last
thing
that
I
remembered
were
flashing
blue
and
red
lights
before
I
passed
out
from
exhaustion
.
The
police
spent
over
12
hours
interrogating
me
over
the
incident
and
to
validate
my
story
.
They
came
to
the
conclusion
that
there
is
n't
anyway
that
I
could
have
accomplished
the
murder
but
they
still
believe
that
I
might
have
had
an
accomplice
.
The
police
were
perplexed
when
I
was
horrified
about
being
free
to
leave
.
That
's
because
one
thought
replays
over
in
my
mind
;
the
fate
of
Captain
and
how
I
'm
too
scared
to
go
back
home
.
UPDATE
:
I
spent
the
first
hour
or
so
denying
my
own
existence
after
my
release
.
After
several
missed
calls
,
only
then
did
I
realize
that
I
traveled
less
than
a
block
away
from
the
police
station
.
It
took
me
awhile
before
I
mustered
the
courage
to
return
home
-
and
even
longer
for
the
city
buses
to
get
me
there
.
I
gave
myself
a
pep
talk
as
I
approached
my
apartment
.
&quot;
They
're
just
tiny
animals
,
Zach
.
They
're
nothing
that
you
ca
n't
handle
.
&quot;
I
whispered
to
myself
.
My
hands
shook
as
I
fumbled
for
my
keys
.
My
sweaty
palm
turned
the
knob
and
I
paused
for
a
moment
.
I
pulled
the
door
and
reluctantly
crossed
the
threshold
.
My
living
room
was
silent
and
appeared
normal
,
besides
the
kitchen
light
that
I
forgot
to
turn
off
before
I
went
to
Eddy
's
place
.
&quot;
Captain
!
&quot;
I
called
out
but
did
not
receive
a
reply
.
I
inspected
my
entire
apartment
until
only
my
room
with
the
Sea-Monkey
tank
remained
.
I
gently
knocked
on
the
door
and
whispered
,
&quot;
Captain
?
&quot;
A
soft
bark
startled
me
from
the
other
side
.
Then
I
heard
Captain
jump
to
his
feet
and
trot
inside
the
room
.
I
opened
the
door
and
feared
for
the
worst
.
Make-shift
tapestry
from
torn
bed-sheets
hung
from
the
ceiling
in
an
elaborated
pattern
at
Captain
's
resting
spot
.
Aluminum
foil
wire
wire
tied
to
nails
was
integrated
into
what
appeared
to
be
a
simple
circuit
.
There
was
a
conveyor
belt
that
was
connected
to
the
circuit
which
transported
an
empty
cup
.
The
conveyor
belt
dipped
the
cup
into
Captain
's
snack
bag
and
brought
forth
a
doggy-treat
,
which
carried
the
package
over
the
bed
.
Captain
eagerly
licked
his
lips
as
he
casually
crawled
to
the
middle
of
the
conveyor
belt
and
snatched
the
treat
.
A
few
other
mechanical
contraptions
covered
my
bedroom
.
Construction
led
from
the
pool
to
the
bathroom
with
a
series
of
tracks
that
were
being
constructed
along
the
edges
of
the
tank
.
I
gasped
in
my
amazement
.
The
civilization
had
built
itself
around
its
guardian
,
and
true
master
,
Captain
.
I
turned
my
head
back
to
Captain
as
he
begged
me
with
his
big
eyes
and
softly
growled
.
&quot;
Yes
,
you
can
keep
them
-
for
now
.
Just
make
sure
that
they
stay
out
of
trouble
!
&quot;
I
ordered
Captain
as
he
yelped
with
joy
.
So
I
plopped
myself
on
the
couch
,
watched
some
TV
,
and
passed
out
from
exhaustion
.
It
was
n't
until
evening
that
I
awoke
from
Captain
's
cries
.
My
eyes
shot
open
and
I
struggled
to
lift
myself
off
the
couch
but
fell
to
the
floor
.
My
feet
were
bound
above
the
ankles
with
barbed
wires
.
An
unholy
cacophony
of
chirping
and
squeaking
startled
me
to
notice
squirrels
on
the
floor
with
me
.
At
least
,
they
were
once
squirrels
:
each
of
the
desecrated
animals
had
a
battery
wrapped
around
its
back
with
small
wires
connecting
all
over
the
poor
bodies
.
The
reanimated
squirrels
had
bloodshot
eyes
,
but
were
not
hollow
like
the
eyes
from
Eddy
's
corpse
.
A
swarm
of
fuzzy
dots
moved
around
the
iris
and
pupils
of
the
corpses
as
their
arms
and
legs
twitched
.
The
small
,
devious
parasites
filled
the
eyes
of
the
victims
until
the
red
was
replaced
by
a
somber
,
souless
shade
of
darkness
.
The
cyborg-cadavers
displayed
their
decayed
fangs
as
they
sprinted
toward
my
face
.
A
loud
bark
came
from
the
other
side
of
the
room
as
Captain
charged
forth
to
the
rescue
.
His
jaw
snagged
the
first
abomination
like
the
doggy-treat
from
earlier
but
the
other
reanimated
squirrels
gathered
around
Captain
.
Meanwhile
,
more
mechanical-vermin
swarmed
through
the
windows
and
approached
my
bedroom
.
Captain
's
Sea-Monkeys
had
defended
against
the
hostile
invaders
but
our
citizens
were
doomed
.
The
pool
churned
and
bubbled
as
my
Sea-Monkeys
were
being
pillaged
and
my
apartment
became
a
realm
of
warfare
and
bloodshed
.
The
city
of
Atlantis
was
annihilated
.
Captain
's
valiant
last-stand
paid
off
to
buy
us
enough
time
to
escape
.
We
retreated
through
the
door
.
Eddy
's
Sea-Monkeys
may
have
won
the
battle
but
we
planned
on
winning
the
war
.
We
knew
if
there
was
a
solution
,
then
there
would
only
be
one
place
to
find
it
,

Street
