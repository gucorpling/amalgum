Boston/East
Boston
</head>
<p>
A
lot
of
neighborhoods
claim
to
be
diverse
,
but
<hi rend="bold">
<ref target="http://eastbostonchamber.com">
East
Boston
</ref>
</hi>
is
the
real
deal
.
&quot;
Eastie
&quot;
,
as
the
locals
call
it
,
has
always
been
a
welcoming
place
for
immigrants
hoping
to
gain
a
toehold
in
<ref target="Boston">
Boston
</ref>
.
Rapid
gentrification
along
the
waterfront
has
begun
to
take
hold
,
and
it
remains
to
be
seen
what
impacts
that
will
have
on
this
working
class
community
.
</p>
<head>
Understand
</head>
<p>
Like
much
of
the
rest
of
the
Boston
area
,
East
Boston
was
originally
a
series
of
five
islands
and
marshy
tidal
bogs
.
Each
of
the
islands
were
used
either
for
farming
or
the
grazing
of
livestock
,
and
military
fortifications
were
constructed
when
necessary
.
The
two
largest
islands
(
Noddle
's
and
Breed
's
)
make
up
the
modern
commercial
and
residential
heart
of
Eastie
.
The
three
smaller
(
Governors
,
Apple
,
and
Bird
)
were
combined
with
infill
over
the
years
to
create
Logan
International
Airport
.
</p>
<p>
In
the
1830s
,
the
owner
of
the
largest
island
,
William
Sumner
,
formed
a
company
to
direct
expansion
in
the
area
.
The
railroad
was
brought
in
and
ferries
started
service
to
try
and
connect
East
Boston
to
the
rest
of
the
mainland
.
While
those
ventures
did
n't
work
out
so
well
,
the
urban
planning
that
was
done
around
this
time
remains
.
Visitors
today
will
see
one
of
the
few
areas
of
Boston
actually
laid
out
on
a
grid
.
This
was
also
a
prosperous
period
for
locals
involved
in
the
Clipper
ship
industry
,
which
flourished
here
.
So
renowned
were
the
shipbuilders
,
Eastie
would
remain
popular
in
the
maritime
trades
long
after
the
time
of
wooden
ships
had
passed
.
</p>
<p>
The
ships
carried
more
than
just
cargo
,
they
also
brought
with
them
new
arrivals
and
new
ideas
.
A
great
many
Canadians
,
Irish
,
Russian
and
European
Jewish
immigrants
would
appear
throughout
the
19th
century
.
The
Italians
arrived
at
the
dawn
of
the
20th
century
,
and
a
growing
population
required
additional
housing
.
It
's
during
this
period
when
the
streets
first
became
lined
with
ever
present
three
deckers
,
providing
affordable
housing
for
the
recent
immigrants
.
The
fine
Victorian
mansions
and
sea
captain
's
homes
would
remain
atop
Eagle
Hill
,
of
course
,
along
with
many
handsome
brick
bow
fronts
in
Jeffries
Point
.
</p>
<p>
The
construction
of
the
airport
beginning
in
the
1920s
was
transformational
.
Also
extremely
close
to
downtown
Boston
,
the
noise
and
pollution
from
the
air
traffic
kept
housing
prices
affordable
.
This
provided
a
landing
space
for
the
most
recent
influx
of
people
hailing
from
South
and
Central
America
,
the
Caribbean
,
and
South
East
Asia
.
Nothing
stays
the
same
forever
,
and
today
developers
are
moving
in
to
capitalize
on
Eastie
's
waterfront
views
and
adjacency
to
downtown
.
</p>
<head>
Get
in
</head>
<p>
Clearly
<ref target="http://www.massport.com/logan-airport/">
<hi rend="bold">
Logan
International
Airport
</hi>
</ref>
is
the
neighborhood
's
defining
characteristic
,
see
<ref target="Boston%23By_plane">
Boston
by
plane
</ref>
for
all
the
gritty
details
.
There
are
,
however
,
a
few
other
ways
to
get
here
that
do
n't
involve
undergoing
a
full
body
patdown
.
</p>
<head>
By
public
transit
</head>
<p>
The
easiest
and
most
popular
option
is
the
Blue
line
,
running
trains
every
5-13
minutes
depending
on
the
current
time
and
day
.
It
pops
up
above
the
harbor
at
<hi rend="bold">
Maverick
</hi>
station
,
before
continuing
on
to
the
<hi rend="bold">
Airport
</hi>
,
<hi rend="bold">
Wood
Island
</hi>
,
<hi rend="bold">
Orient
Heights
</hi>
,
and
<hi rend="bold">
Suffolk
Downs
</hi>
stops
.
It
then
keeps
chugging
right
along
into
<ref target="Revere">
Revere
</ref>
,
the
next
town
north
.
The
other
way
of
getting
here
is
on
the
Silver
line
SL1
branch
.
It
's
great
for
going
to
the
airport
,
but
not
much
else
.
The
Silver
line
bus
makes
5
stops
,
one
at
each
of
Logan
's
terminals
,
and
does
not
connect
you
with
the
Blue
line
.
</p>
<p>
Busses
run
here
(
quite
a
number
of
them
!
)
,
but
none
departing
from
Eastie
can
get
you
across
the
harbor
and
into
Boston
proper
.
A
few
busses
do
leave
from
Wonderland
station
in
Revere
.
They
drive
to
either
Haymarket
or
South
Station
,
and
a
couple
will
stop
at
the
airport
.
Of
busses
that
<hi rend="italic">
do
</hi>
run
here
,
the
<hi rend="bold">
#114
</hi>
,
<hi rend="bold">
#116
</hi>
,
and
<hi rend="bold">
#117
</hi>
start
at
Maverick
station
and
cross
the
Mystic
river
to
get
you
into
<ref target="Chelsea">
Chelsea
</ref>
.
The
<hi rend="bold">
#120
</hi>
and
<hi rend="bold">
#121
</hi>
run
from
Maverick
also
,
but
they
stay
within
the
neighborhood
and
in
most
cases
the
Blue
line
and
your
own
two
feet
will
be
the
superior
option
.
</p>
<p>
One
other
infrequently
used
option
are
the
MBTA
commuter
boats
.
Take
the
F2H
from
<hi rend="bold">
Logan
Ferry
Terminal
</hi>
for
boats
to
Long
Wharf
,
<ref target="Hingham">
Hingham
</ref>
,
and
<ref target="Hull">
Hull
</ref>
.
These
ferries
run
year
round
,
but
call
ahead
if
it
looks
like
extreme
,
icy
ocean
conditions
could
be
an
issue
.
Water
taxis
are
also
available
,
taking
you
to
any
dock
in
the
city
with
about
10
minutes
notice
.
</p>
<head>
By
car
</head>
<p>
Driving
in
East
Boston
is
n't
the
best
idea
,
but
not
impossible
.
Actually
the
most
challenging
thing
is
getting
your
car
over
here
in
the
first
place
.
Three
tunnels
provide
access
,
the
older
<hi rend="bold">
Callahan
</hi>
and
<hi rend="bold">
Sumner
</hi>
tunnels
are
crowded
,
slow
and
their
location
is
n't
great
.
The
<hi rend="bold">
Ted
Williams
</hi>
tunnel
,
built
during
the
Big
Dig
,
offers
the
fastest
and
easiest
connection
.
All
the
tunnels
are
equally
expensive
for
non-resident
visitors
.
If
you
're
coming
from
the
north
,
congested
and
crumbling
routes
<hi rend="bold">
1A
</hi>
and
<hi rend="bold">
145
</hi>
will
bring
you
in
.
There
are
a
few
parking
garages
,
and
most
streets
in
town
are
resident
parking
only
24
hours
a
day
.
The
city
issues
$
40
tickets
for
parking
in
these
spaces
without
a
sticker
.
