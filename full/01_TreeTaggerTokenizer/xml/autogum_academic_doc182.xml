Biofilms
</head>
<p>
As
mentioned
above
,
the
most
common
problems
of
stents
are
due
to
their
clogging
due
to
the
formation
of
biofilm
and
adhesion
of
biological
substances
that
pass
through
the
stent
.
Biofilm
represents
the
most
widespread
way
of
microbial
growth
in
nature
and
is
critical
for
the
development
of
clinical
infections
.
It
is
produced
by
bacteria
and
host
products
that
tend
to
adhere
to
different
surfaces
.
They
create
huge
colonies
known
as
biofilms
.
Existence
in
biofilms
is
for
them
more
advantageous
because
biofilm
provides
protection
for
their
cells
,
maintains
a
homeostasis
,
and
creates
a
barrier
that
isolates
bacteria
from
the
surroundings
.
There
is
extensive
communication
between
bacteria
and
the
effective
horizontal
transfer
of
resistance
and
virulence
genes
that
make
bacteria
very
resistant
.
Thus
,
bacteria
cells
in
biofilm
are
more
resistant
to
toxic
substances
,
UV
radiation
,
mechanical
damage
,
bacteriophages
,
or
predators
.
They
are
also
more
resistant
to
the
immune
system
and
antibiotics
in
a
human
or
animal
body
.
The
surface
of
the
material
is
very
quickly
occupied
by
bacteria
because
the
host
products
create
a
biofilm
on
the
material
that
helps
to
bind
the
bacteria
.
This
process
takes
place
in
five
stages
,
as
can
be
seen
in

Biofilms
affect
many
medical
applications
and
are
a
serious
medical
problem
at
the
present
time
.
They
are
found
,
for
example
,
in
catheters
,
stents
,
contact
lenses
,
and
many
other
implants
.
Biomaterials
at
risk
of
attaching
bacteria
together
with
corresponding
body
fluids
and
major
components
of
the
host
products
for
bacterial
growth
are
classified
in
Table
1
.
The
biofilm
’s
high
resistance
to
antibacterial
agents
results
in
a
great
risk
of
infection
and
therefore
creates
a
very
hazardous
situation
for
patient
health
.
Microbial
cells
that
live
in
biofilms
have
greater
resistance
to
antimicrobial
substances
than
cells
that
live
alone
in
planktonic
form
.
Due
to
this
resistance
,
the
treatment
of
biofilm
infections
is
very
difficult
.
Infected
implants
must
be
removed
from
the
patient
’s
body
.
This
procedure
is
usually
expensive
and
dangerous
for
patients
because
surgical
procedures
can
cause
other
complications
.
Millions
of
implants
and
catheters
are
used
for
treatment
every
year
.
Table
2
shows
examples
of
implants
prone
to
the
infections
of
biofilms
.
</p>
<p>
For
this
reason
,
new
materials
are
being
developed
to
reduce
the
risk
of
biofilm
formation
and
infection
.
These
materials
are
based
on
polymer
composites
or
polymers
with
surfaces
modified
with
an
antimicrobial
agent
.
In
addition
,
other
options
based
on
physical
surface
properties
such
as
surface
roughening
,
or
vice
versa
smooth
surface
,
super
hydrophobic
,
etc.
should
be
considered
.
