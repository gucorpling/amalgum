The
first
leg
of
the
match
ended
1-1
,
giving
Chelsea
the
advantage
thanks
to
the
away
goals
rule
,
and
Porto
needed
a
win
or
a
draw
of
2
all
or
higher
to
advance
to
the
next
round
.
Porto
fielded
a
defensive
side
,
leaving
Portuguese
international
striker
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helder%20Postiga">
Helder
Postiga
</ref>
out
of
the
starting
lineup
,
while
Chelsea
featured
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andriy%20Shevchenko">
Andriy

</ref>
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didier%20Drogba">

Drogba
</ref>
on
attack
.
</p>
<p>
Shevchenko
almost
opened
the
scoring
early
in
the
game
,
having
a
poweful
shot
from
20
yard
fly
just
over
the
bar
and
out
of
play
.
The
early
attack
did
little
to
inspire
Chelsea
though
,
as
they
looked
sluggish
for
the
first
parts
of
the
game
.
Porto
took
advantage
of
Chelsea
's
poor
start
,
and
scored
in
the
15th
minute
on
a
counter
attack
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisandro%20López">
Lopez
</ref>
quickly
passed
the
ball
up
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucho%20González">
Gonzales
</ref>
in
the
center
of
the
pitch
,
who
split
the
defence
with
a
well
aimed
ball
that
released
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricardo%20Quaresma">
Quaresma
</ref>
on
a
break
away
.
The
Portuguese
player
made
no
mistake
about
his
shot
,
and
slid
it
neatly
past
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petr%20Čech">
Petr
Cech
</ref>
to
give
the
visiting
team
the
lead
.
Chelsea
vainly
attempted
to
draw
level
,
but
none
of
their
first
half
chances
were
able
to
find
the
target
to
trouble
keeper
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helton%20Arruda">

Helton
</ref>
.
Chelsea
had
a
claim
for
a
penalty
nearing
35
minutes
when
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arjen%20Robben">
Arjen
Robben
</ref>
after
he
was
apparently
tripped
up
by
Raul
Moreiles
,
but
the
Dutch
midfielded
was
awarded
a
yellow
card
instead
for
his
theatrical
dive
.
Chelsea
's
defence
supplied
the
most
attack
for
the
English
Champions
,
as
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley%20Cole">
Ashley
Cole
</ref>
made
a
fine
cross
into
the
box
which
was
poorly
cleared
by
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricardo%20Costa%20(footballer,%20born%201981)">

Costa
</ref>
,
and
the
Ball
broke
for
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael%20Ballack">

Ballack
</ref>
.
Costa
was
quick
to
justify
his
mistake
and
he
poked
the
ball
away
from
Ballack
before
he
could
get
a
shot
away
.
The
biggest
worry
for
Porto
came
when
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge%20Fucile">
Jorge
Fucile
</ref>
was
struck
in
the
face
by
the
trailing
arm
off
a
teammate
,
and
left
the
field
with
blood
streaming
from
his
nose
.
</p>
<p>
The
second
half
saw
Fucile
retake
the
pitch
,
his
injury
obviously
not
too
serious
.
Chelsea
made
a
change
to
start
the
second
half
,
adding
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John%20Obi%20Mikel">
John
Obi
Mikel
</ref>
in
place
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude%20Makélélé">

.
It
took
Chelsea
only
3
minutes
after
the
restart
to
get
back
into
the
match
,
and
the
goal
came
through
Arjen
Robben
.
The
Dutchman
cleaved
a
shot
from
25
yards
,
and
even
though
it
lack
power
,
de
Helton
was
not
able
to
get
a
grip
on
it
and
the
ball
slipped
past
him
into
the
net
.
The
goal
tied
not
only
the
game
,
but
also
the
series
,
and
the
scoreline
would
force
extra
time
.
Chelsea
would
n't
allow
the
game
to
get
that
far
though
,
and
Ashley
Cole
,
Andriy
Shevchenko
and
Michael
Ballack
all
contributed
to
the
winning
goal
.
A
cross
by
Cole
was
headed
down
by
Shevy
,
and
neatly
volleyed
into
the
net
by
the
German
Ballack
.
Porto
pressed
,
but
the
Chelsea
defence
easily
coped
,
and
Chelsea
advanded
to
next
round
of
the
Champions
League
.
