OFF
FOR
HONDURAS
</head>
<p>
Just
what
Tom
's
thoughts
were
,
Ned
,
of
course
,
could
not
guess
.
But
by
the
flush
that
showed
under
the
tan
of
his
chum
's
cheeks
the
young
financial
secretary
felt
pretty
certain
that
Tom
was
a
bit
apprehensive
of
the
outcome
of
Professor
Beecher
's
call
on
Mary
Nestor
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
So
he
is
going
to
see
her
about
'
something
important
,
'
Ned
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
That
's
what
some
members
of
his
party
called
it
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
And
they
're
waiting
here
for
him
to
join
them
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Yes
.
And
it
means
waiting
a
week
for
another
steamer
.
It
must
be
something
pretty
important
,
do
n't
you
think
,
to
cause
Beecher
to
risk
that
delay
in
starting
after
the
idol
of
gold
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Important
?
Yes
,
I
suppose
so
,
&quot;
assented
Tom
.
&quot;
And
yet
even
if
he
waits
for
the
next
steamer
he
will
get
to
Honduras
nearly
as
soon
as
we
do
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
How
is
that
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
The
next
boat
is
a
faster
one
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Then
why
do
n't
we
take
that
?
I
hate
dawdling
along
on
a
slow
freighter
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Well
,
for
one
thing
it
would
hardly
do
to
change
now
,
when
all
our
goods
are
on
board
.
And
besides
,
the
captain
of
the
<hi rend="italic">
Relstab
</hi>
,
on
which
we
are
going
to
sail
,
is
a
friend
of
Professor
Bumper
's
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Well
,
I
'm
just
as
glad
Beecher
and
his
party
are
n't
going
with
us
,
&quot;
resumed
Ned
,
after
a
pause
.
&quot;
It
might
make
trouble
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Oh
,
I
'm
ready
for
any
trouble
HE
might
make
!
&quot;
quickly
exclaimed
Tom
.
</p>
<p>
He
meant
trouble
that
might
be
developed
in
going
to
Honduras
,
and
starting
the
search
for
the
lost
city
and
the
idol
of
gold
.
This
kind
of
trouble
Tom
and
his
friends
had
experienced
before
,
on
other
trips
where
rivals
had
sought
to
frustrate
their
ends
.
</p>
<p>
But
,
in
his
heart
,
though
he
said
nothing
to
Ned
about
it
,
Tom
was
worried
.
Much
as
he
disliked
to
admit
it
to
himself
,
he
feared
the
visit
of
Professor
Beecher
to
Mary
Nestor
in
Fayetteville
had
but
one
meaning
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
wonder
if
he
's
going
to
propose
to
her
,
&quot;
thought
Tom
.
&quot;
He
has
the
field
all
to
himself
now
,
and
her
father
likes
him
.
That
's
in
his
favor
.
I
guess
Mr.
Nestor
has
never
quite
forgiven
me
for
that
mistake
about
the
dynamite
box
,
and
that
was
n't
my
fault
.
Then
,
too
,
the
Beecher
and
Nestor
families
have
been
friends
for
years
.
Yes
,
he
surely
has
the
inside
edge
on
me
,
and
if
he
gets
her
to
throw
me
over
--
--
Well
,
I
wo
n't
give
up
without
a
fight
!
&quot;
and
Tom
mentally
girded
himself
for
a
battle
of
wits
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
He
's
relying
on
the
prestige
he
'll
get
out
of
this
idol
of
gold
if
his
party
finds
it
,
&quot;
thought
on
the
young
inventor
.
&quot;
But
I
'll
help
find
it
first
.
I
'm
glad
to
have
a
little
start
of
him
,
anyhow
,
even
if
it
is
n't
more
than
two
days
.
Though
if
our
vessel
is
held
back
much
by
storms
he
may
get
on
the
ground
first
.
However
,
that
ca
n't
be
helped
.
I
'll
do
the
best
I
can
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
These
thoughts
shot
through
Tom
's
mind
even
as
Ned
was
asking
his
questions
and
making
comments
.
Then
the
young
inventor
,
shaking
his
shoulders
as
though
to
rid
them
of
some
weight
,
remarked
:
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Well
,
come
on
out
and
see
the
sights
.
It
will
be
long
before
we
look
on
Broadway
again
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
When
the
chums
returned
from
their
sightseeing
excursion
,
they
found
that
Professor
Bumper
had
arrived
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Where
's
Professor
Bumper
?
&quot;
asked
Ned
,
the
next
day
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
In
his
room
,
going
over
books
,
papers
and
maps
to
make
sure
he
has
everything
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
And
Mr.
Damon
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Tom
did
not
have
to
answer
that
last
question
.
Into
the
apartment
came
bursting
the
excited
individual
himself
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Bless
my
overshoes
!
&quot;
he
cried
,
&quot;
I
've
been
looking
everywhere
for
you
!
Come
on
,
there
's
no
time
to
lose
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
What
's
the
matter
now
?
&quot;
asked
Ned
.
&quot;
Is
the
hotel
on
fire
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Has
anything
happened
to
Professor
Bumper
?
&quot;
Tom
demanded
,
a
wild
idea
forming
in
his
head
that
perhaps
some
one
of
the
Beecher
party
had
tried
to
kidnap
the
discoverer
of
the
lost
city
of
Pelone
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Oh
,
everything
is
all
right
,
&quot;
answered
Mr.
Damon
.
&quot;
But
it
's
nearly
time
for
the
show
to
start
,
and
we
do
n't
want
to
be
late
.
I
have
tickets
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
For
what
?
&quot;
asked
Tom
and
Ned
together
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
The
movies
,
&quot;
was
the
laughing
reply
.
&quot;
Bless
my
loose
ribs
!
but
I
would
n't
miss
him
for
anything
.
He
's
in
a
new
play
called
'
Up
in
a
Balloon
Boys
.
'
It
's
great
!
&quot;
and
Mr.
Damon
named
a
certain
comic
moving
picture
star
in
whose
horse-play
Mr.
Damon
took
a
curious
interest
.
Tom
and
Ned
were
glad
enough
to
go
,
Tom
that
he
might
have
a
chance
to
do
a
certain
amount
of
thinking
,
and
Ned
because
he
was
still
boy
enough
to
like
moving
pictures
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
wonder
,
Tom
,
&quot;
said
Mr.
Damon
,
as
they
came
out
of
the
theater
two
hours
later
,
all
three
chuckling
at
the
remembrance
of
what
they
had
seen
,
&quot;
I
wonder
you
never
turned
your
inventive
mind
to
the
movies
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Maybe
I
will
,
some
day
,
&quot;
said
Tom
.
</p>
<p>
He
spoke
rather
uncertainly
.
The
truth
of
the
matter
was
that
he
was
still
thinking
deeply
of
the
visit
of
Professor
Beecher
to
Mary
Nestor
,
and
wondering
what
it
portended
.
</p>
<p>
But
if
Tom
's
sleep
was
troubled
that
night
he
said
nothing
of
it
to
his
friends
.
He
was
up
early
the
next
morning
,
for
they
were
to
leave
that
day
,
and
there
was
still
considerable
to
be
done
in
seeing
that
their
baggage
and
supplies
were
safely
loaded
,
and
in
attending
to
the
last
details
of
some
business
matters
.
