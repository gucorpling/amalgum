Introduction

<p>
The
devastating
threat
of
antimicrobial
resistance
(
AMR
)
to
global
human
health
is
unquestionable
.
Antimicrobials
are
losing
their
effectiveness
in
treating
infections
,
due
to
the
rapid
emergence
of
AMR
and
the
drying
up
of
antimicrobial
pipelines
.
The
difficult-to-treat
AMR
infections
require
longer
hospital
stays
and
more
costly
treatment
,
increase
morbidity
and
mortality
,
and
reduce
productivity
;
therefore
,
increasing
the
economic
burden
of
the
countries
.
In
recent
years
,
this
global
health
crisis
has
been
gaining
much
attention
in
Malaysia
,
and
Malaysia
has
been
striving
hard
to
combat
it
via
different
approaches
.
The
major
contributing
factors
of
AMR
are
known
to
be
overuse
and
misuse
of
antimicrobials
.
</p>
<p>
Antibiotic
consumption
by
the
elderly
population
was
found
to
be
between
11
%
to
45
%
,
with
a
significant
rise
over
the
past
decade
.
As
much
as
18
%
of
the
total
antibiotic
prescriptions
in
older
adults
was
unnecessary
,
with
54
%
of
them
prescribed
for
acute
respiratory
conditions
.
Healthcare
providers
face
challenges
in
adequately
diagnosing
and
managing
infections
in
this
vulnerable
population
because
of
the
altered
drug
metabolism
in
this
particular
group
,
the
common
occurrence
of
drug
–
drug
interactions
due
to
polypharmacy
and
lower
medication
adherence
.
Nursing
homes
or
long
term
care
facilities
in
the
United
States
and
Australia
were
found
to
be
a
reservoir
for
AMR
pathogens
due
to
excessive
,
inappropriate
and
prolonged
broad-spectrum
antimicrobial
use
,
inadequate
infection
control
and
increased
risk
of
pathogen
colonization
.
The
prevalence
of
antimicrobial
consumption
in
nursing
homes
was
reported
to
be
11
%
in
the
United
States
,
where
only
66
%
of
it
was
documented
for
therapeutic
use
.
</p>
<p>
The
reported
incidence
of
infections
was
higher
in
the
older
adult
population
because
of
the
presence
of
chronic
comorbidities
,
deteriorating
organ
functions
and
reduced
host
defence
system
.
Older
adults
also
have
poorer
outcomes
as
a
consequence
of
infections
,
including
higher
mortality
,
compared
to
adults
of
other
age
groups
.
Atypical
clinical
presentations
of
infections
,
undertreatment
or
overtreatment
,
high
risk
of
multidrug-resistant
organism
acquisition
,
rapid
disease
progression
and
prolonged
recovery
all
contribute
to
poorer
outcomes
in
the
elderly
.
Moreover
,
older
adults
who
were
living
alone
have
lower
health
literacy
and
hence
lower
self-management
abilities
,
contributing
to
poorer
health
.
</p>
<p>
A
lack
of
knowledge
on
antibiotic
use
in
the
general
public
has
been
reported
,
with
more
than
half
of
them
who
thought
that
antibiotics
are
useful
in
treating
viral
infections
,
and
about
one
half
of
them
would
stop
taking
antibiotics
when
they
felt
better
.
Those
who
were
aware
of
antibiotic
resistance
were
unaware
that
misuse
of
antibiotics
could
lead
to
this
global
crisis
.
Those
who
had
poor
knowledge
of
antibiotic
use
were
associated
with
a
higher
probability
of
antibiotic
self-medication
and
practices
of
using
leftover
antibiotics
,
sharing
antibiotics
,
keeping
antibiotics
for
future
use
and
stopping
antibiotics
when
symptoms
disappear
.
Inappropriate
practices
related
to
antibiotics
,
including
self-medication
,
were
reported
to
be
common
among
older
adults
.
In
one
study
,
a
considerable
proportion
of
older
adults
(
77.8
%
)
who
had
antibiotic
use
within
the
past
six
months
were
found
to
have
experience
of
receiving
antibiotics
without
prescriptions
.
However
,
only
a
few
studies
reported
the
lack
of
knowledge
and
poor
attitude
on
antibiotic
use
and
resistance
among
older
adults
.
</p>
<p>
Patients
who
were
unaware
of
the
consequences
of
antibiotic
overuse
to
the
community
were
found
to
expect
antibiotics
from
their
prescriber
.
Studies
have
found
that
those
who
incorrectly
believed
that
antibiotics
will
work
for
viral
infections
were
more
likely
to
expect
antibiotics
from
prescribers
.
Patients
’
expectations
of
antibiotics
are
found
to
be
an
important
predictor
of
antibiotic
prescribing
.
Expectations
for
antibiotics
for
common
cold
were
found
among
older
adults
when
they
felt
sick
enough
to
visit
a
physician
,
although
most
of
them
disagreed
that
antibiotics
could
speed
the
recovery
.
</p>
<p>
To
our
knowledge
,
many
studies
have
been
done
to
assess
the
knowledge
of
antibiotic
use
and
resistance
;
however
,
there
has
been
limited
research
targeting
vulnerable
population
groups
,
including
older
adults
.
Due
to
the
paucity
of
information
in
this
area
,
we
conducted
a
study
among
the
older
adult
population
in
Malaysia
to
assess
their
knowledge
on
antibiotic
use
and
resistance
and
their
expectations
towards
the
need
for
antibiotics
.
This
study
also
aimed
to
assess
the
relationship
between
knowledge
,
expectations
and
practices
related
to
antibiotic
use
among
older
adults
.
