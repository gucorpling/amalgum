<p>
Healthcare
is
at
the
top
of
the
list
of
provincial
and
local
issues
.
There
are
still
an
estimated
one
million
Ontarians
without
a
doctor
,
and
my
riding
is
no
exception
.
We
have
also
suffered
from
chronic
under-funding
for
healthcare
.
A
PC
government
would
ensure
there
is
catch-up
funding
for
Durham
and
other
GTA-905
communities
as
well
as
any
other
areas
of
rapid
growth
.
This
will
allow
local
hospitals
to
continue
to
provide
the
outstanding
care
Durham
residents
depend
upon
.
</p>
<p>
The
local
economy
is
foremost
in
the
minds
of
Durham
residents
.
Ontario
has
been
hit
hard
by
the
loss
of
an
estimated
140,000
good
jobs
in
the
manufacturing
sector
.
The
Oshawa
/
Durham
area
is
no
exception
.
All
levels
of
government
along
with
unions
,
business
,
education
,
and
individuals
citizens
must
work
together
to
build
a
strong
local
economy
based
on
energy
,
manufacturing
and
agriculture
.
</p>
<p>
Durham
Riding
also
faces
quality
of
life
issues
that
include
gridlock
and
the
need
for
improved
public
transit
,
support
for
agriculture/rural
communities
,
and
protection
of
our
environment
.

<hi rend="bold">
What
should
be
the
first
order
of
business
in
the
39th
Legislative
Assembly
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
Restoring
trust
and
confidence
in
government
.
The
past
four
years
have
been
marred
by
dozens
of
broken
promises
from
a
government
that
promised
not
to
raise
taxes
on
the
campaign
trail
and
then
introduced
the
$
2.6
billion-per-year
health
tax
.
Other
broken
promises
range
from
tackling
gridlock
on
our
highways
to
closing
the
coal-powered
generating
stations
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Are
the
property
taxes
in
your
riding
at
a
fair
level
for
the
amount
of
services
received
in
the
municipality
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
When
property
assessment
rises
suddenly
over
a
few
years
,
it
puts
pressure
on
retirees
and
persons
on
modest
incomes
who
own
a
house
.
I
fully
support
a
five
per
cent
cap
on
the
annual
assessment
increase
for
as
long
as
an
individual
owns
his
or
her
home
.
In
addition
,
the
Municipal
Property
Assessment
Corporation
should
be
required
to
justify
higher
assessment
instead
of
demanding
that
homeowners
prove
why
their
assessment
is
too
high
.
</p>
<p>
Ontario
can
do
better
in
forging
a
new
partnership
between
the
provincial
government
and
municipalities
.
Local
taxes
should
be
used
primarily
for
local
needs
and
not
to
pay
for
provincial
programs
unfairly
imposed
on
a
community
.
There
should
be
long-term
,
multi-year
funding
arrangements
for
municipalities
.
A
PC
government
under
John
Tory
is
committed
to
speed
up
the
municipal
review
process
so
that
we
can
start
the
reforms
before
the
next
provincial
budget
.
</p>
<p>
How
can
the
province
lead
the
way
in
stimulating
job
creation
?
</p>
<p>
By
reducing
the
burden
of
red
tape
on
small
business
,
reducing
inter-provincial
trade
barriers
,
helping
to
create
a
skilled
workforce
,
lowering
taxes
for
individuals
as
well
as
lowering
the
business
capital
tax
,
providing
a
stable
,
affordable
supply
of
electricity
and
by
encouraging
innovations
.
