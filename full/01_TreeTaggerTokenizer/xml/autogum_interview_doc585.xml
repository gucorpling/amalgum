You
mentioned
Australia
being
like
a
country
of
summer
sports
.
What
attracted
you
to
winter
sport
in
the
first
place
?
</p>
<p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Mitchell
Gourley
:
</hi>
I
think
it
's
a
better
sport
.

</hi>
Australians
,
considering
we
do
n't
have
many
hills
,
Australians
do
love
skiing
,
those
that
do
it
.
It
's
a
unique
sport
in
the
sense
that
you
get
to
travel
at
high
speeds
,
on
different
mountains
all
over
the
world
,
under
your
own
power
,
going
down
a
hill
at
130
or
something
<ref target="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kilometer">
k
's
</ref>
an
hour
,
that
sort
of
thing
.
You
do
n't
get
...
to
me
,
running
up
and
down
a
track
,
or
...
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Toby
Kane
:
</hi>
I
think
to
me
it
's
a
fun
sport
.
There
are
n't
that
many
sports
that
people
,
a
lot
of
people
,
spend
<hi rend="italic">
heaps
</hi>
of
their
own
money
to
go
and
do
,
as
a
pastime
.
As
something
that
they
want
to
do
on
the
holidays
and
with
their
family
and
all
that
kind
of
stuff
.
It
's
kind
of
cool
that
that
's
what
we
do
.
Like
,
lots
of
people
would
spend
a
sh-tload
of
money
to
go
skiing
,
and
that
's
our
sport
.
Not
many
people
would
pay
a
heap
of
money
to
stare
at
a
black
line
in
a
pool
,
or
to
run
around
a
track
against
the
clock
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Cameron
Rahles-Rahbula
:
</hi>
Yeah
,
we
love
it
,
and
that
's
why
I
've
done
it
for
so
many
years
,
because
I
love
the
sport
.
I
mean
,
racing
's
one
thing
but
if
I
did
n't
enjoy
skiing
I
would
n't
be
here
and
there
's
not
a
day
when
...
I
mean
you
have
cold
days
and
weather
and
stuff
,
but
you
do
n't
...
for
us
to
get
out
and
get
on
the
hill
is
n't
a
burden
I
do
n't
think
in
the
same
way
as
other
sports
can
be
.

Toby
Kane
:
</hi>
I
think
the
change
for
me
—
I
think
I
can
speak
for
Cam
as
well
,
'
cause
he
's
been
around
for
a
while
—
the
change
between
racing
in
so
many
classes
to
racing
in
so
few
probably
kept
us
around
,
I
think
.
It
made
it
a
lot
more
competitive
;
it
made
it
a
lot
more
of
a
challenge
,
that
previously
it
would
n't
have
been
,
and
I
think
if
we
took
an
LW2
class
right
now
we
'd
be
getting
similar
results
to
what
Michael
got
in
Salt
Lake
City
,
so
,
the
fact
that
it
did
get
a
lot
more
competitive
is
probably
why
I
've
been
here
for
so
long
,
in
the
challenge
to
keep
competing
and
keep
improving
and
keep
performing
at
the
highest
level
.
