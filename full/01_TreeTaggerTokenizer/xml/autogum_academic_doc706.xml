Discussion
</head>
<p>
In
this
review
we
used
science
mapping
to
uncover
influential
authors
,
articles
,
and
journals
on
ISD
,
as
well
as
to
reveal
the
origin
of
the
knowledge
base
and
enhance
our
understanding
of
the
intellectual
structure
of
the
research
field
.
We
employed
bibliometric
analysis
and
considered
1690
SCOPUS-indexed
articles
published
between
1985
and
2018
.
The
next
two
sections
give
an
overview
of
the
limitations
of
the
review
and
propose
our
understanding
of
the
findings
.

Interpretation
and
Implications
of
the
Findings
</head>
<p>
Interestingly
,
the
combined
term
‘
Circular
Economy
’
did
not
emerge
in
the
keyword
analysis
.
The
similarities
and
differences
between
the
two
terminologies
Circular
Economy
and
sustainability
are
not
clear
and
indefinite
.
</p>
<p>
The
knowledge
base
started
to
appear
in
the
academic
sphere
around
1985
,
but
it
was
not
until
2015
that
the
interest
in
this
topic
took
off
,
where
a
high
increase
of
publications
can
be
noted
.
The
greater
interest
may
be
due
to
the
higher
mediatization
of
the
general
bad
development
the
earth
takes
and
on
the
recent
release
of
the
SDGs
by
the
United
Nations
.
A
future
growth
of
this
research
field
can
be
thus
expected
,
where
solutions
to
diverse
development
issues
will
be
proposed
,
i.
e.
,
ocean
cleaning
,
combating
pollution
through
e-mobility
.
</p>
<p>
The
paucity
of
works
from
African
countries
as
well
as
from
the
Middle
East
is
on
the
first
sight
not
explainable
with
the
data
at
hand
and
the
software
package
we
used
.
However
,
an
explanation
might
be
given
by
the
fact
that
they
have
in
relative
terms
fewer
academic
institutions
than
developed
societies
.
The
temporal
map
shows
increasing
numbers
of
publications
coming
from
Asia
,
a
trend
which
is
likely
to
continue
.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore
,
we
can
deduct
from
the
analysis
that
a
high
interest
in
the
last
couple
of
years
around
innovation
in
sustainability
emerged
and
that
Anglo-American
societies
contributed
the
most
to
the
knowledge
base
.
A
high
interest
in
this
topic
resides
in
the
developed
countries
,
in
contrast
to
the
underdeveloped
countries
,
which
might
be
affected
most
by
the
outcome
of
the
application
of
the
SDGs
,
yet
thus
far
,
exhibit
less
attention
.
</p>
<p>
Innovation
in
general
,
but
also
innovation
in
the
context
of
sustainable
development
affects
many
parts
of
human
life
and
should
thus
be
treated
with
more
concern
.
The
keyword
co-occurrence
analysis
(
<figure>
Figure
9
</figure>
and
<figure>
Figure
10
</figure>
)
covers
the
three
dimensions
of
sustainable
development
:
Economic
,
social
,
and
environmental
.
This
also
mirrors
the
SDGs
by
the
United
Nations
,
where
goals
eight
and
nine
represent
the
economic
dimension
,
goals
four
,
five
,
and
16
the
social
dimension
,
and
goals
six
,
seven
,
12
,
13
,
14
,
and
15
the
environmental
dimension
.
The
dimension
‘
environmental
’
was
also
recognized
as
the
basis
of
sustainable
development
in
the
keyword
co-occurrence
network
.
The
topical
foci
of
ISD
given
by
the
temporal
overlay
on
the
keyword
co-occurrence
map
also
reflects
the
resonance
of
the
report
by
the
United
Nations
about
sustainable
development
.
Therefore
,
it
is
safe
to
say
that
the
keyword
analysis
also
represents
the
three
dimensions
of
sustainable
development
.
What
is
striking
is
that
most
keywords
also
occur
in
the
United
Nations
report
‘
<hi rend="italic">
Transforming
our
World
:
The
Agenda
for
Sustainable
Development
</hi>
’
(
e.
g.
,
developing
countries
,
world
,
economic
growth
,
environmental
policy
,
education
,
renewable
energy
,
technological
development
,
climate
change
,
industrial
development
,
global
warming
,
ecosystem
)
.
It
seems
that
the
research
front
is
in
alignment
with
the
SDGs
,
and
that
innovation
,
especially
linked
to
sustainable
development
,
has
great
potential
to
accelerate
human
progress
.
According
to
Sachs
,
the
pressure
to
take
action
is
on
a
global
as
well
as
on
local
levels
,
and
that
different
earth
systems
such
as
the
carbon
,
nitrogen
,
and
water
cycles
are
affected
.
As
an
example
,
point
44
of
the
United
Nations
report
can
be
reviewed
.
It
states
that
,
</p>
<blockquote>
“
We
acknowledge
the
importance
for
international
financial
institutions
to
support
,
in
line
with
their
mandates
,
the
policy
space
of
each
country
,
in
particular
developing
countries
.
”
</blockquote>
<p>
This
phrase
highlights
the
importance
of
the
collaboration
with
financial
institutions
,
and
thus
the
potential
investments
,
in
order
to
achieve
an
improvement
in
the
condition
of
life
for
individuals
in
developing
countries
.
‘
Investment
’
and
‘
developing
countries
’
are
also
identified
as
keywords
(
see
above
)
by
the
temporal
overlay
keyword
co-occurrence
map
with
a
recent
high
interest
.
In
alignment
with
the
keyword
‘
planning
’
this
makes
sense
and
calls
for
planned
and
coordinated
actions
for
environmental
protection
,
and
more
general
for
sustainable
development
.
</p>
<p>
Goal
nine
needs
to
be
highlighted
in
the
context
of
innovation
.
This
goal
states
that
the
objective
by
the
United
Nations
is
to
“
promote
inclusive
and
sustainable
industrialization
and
foster
innovation
”
(
p.
17
)
.
The
importance
of
innovation
to
reach
sustainable
development
is
also
recognized
by
Ashford
and
Hall
,
as
well
as
in
the
keyword
co-occurrence
map
.
Therefore
,
innovation
plays
a
major
role
for
the
direction
of
sustainable
development
.
