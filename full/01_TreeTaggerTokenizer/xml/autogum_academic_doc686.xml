Conclusions
</head>
<p>
Against
the
background
of
severe
air
pollution
and
rigorous
government
policies
to
mitigate
the
problem
,
it
has
become
necessary
to
reduce
pollutant
control
costs
without
adversely
affecting
employment
.
To
accomplish
these
goals
,
we
developed
an
emission
rights
futures
trading
model
for
joint
air
pollution
control
that
accounts
for
employment
,
and
then
examined
SO2
control
in
our
study
area
in
2017
as
a
case
study
of
the
model
.
The
results
show
that
under
the
JCM
,
whether
or
not
we
accounted
for
employment
affected
both
the
cost
of
pollution
control
and
employment
.
When
we
accounted
for
employment
,
the
JCM
both
increased
employment
and
reduced
pollution
control
costs
compared
with
the
JCM
results
without
accounting
for
employment
.
Furthermore
,
compared
with
the
TCM
,
the
JCM
both
increased
employment
and
decreased
the
control
cost
.
</p>
<p>
The
JCM
in
the
present
study
can
help
polluted
regions
balance
environmental
control
with
economic
development
to
ensure
that
residents
of
the
affected
areas
can
earn
a
living
whilst
also
having
a
healthier
environment
.
The
model
also
accounts
for
differences
in
the
cost
of
pollution
control
among
the
cooperating
regions
,
and
uses
futures-based
trading
methods
to
achieve
a
“
win-win
”
effect
,
thereby
increasing
the
ability
to
achieve
sustainable
development
.
Although
we
focused
on
pollution
control
within
a
single
region
of
a
country
,
it
should
be
possible
to
extend
the
method
to
encourage
countries
to
cooperate
in
regional
air
pollution
control
.
The
trading
model
for
emission
rights
futures
proposed
in
this
paper
can
not
only
effectively
stimulate
cooperation
among
regions
in
pollution
control
and
decrease
pollution
control
costs
,
but
also
represents
a
financial
instrument
that
can
be
traded
in
financial
markets
,
thereby
increasing
the
variety
of
financial
instruments
available
,
and
improving
the
flexibility
of
financial
markets
to
deal
with
risks
.
The
United
States
and
other
developed
countries
have
begun
trading
emissions
future
and
options
,
and
have
achieved
some
success
.
For
example
,
the
Chicago
’s
Climate
Futures
Exchange
started
the
SO2
futures
trading
in
2003
,
and
the
European
Climate
Exchange
began
the
emission
rights
futures
and
options
trading
for
major
atmospheric
pollutants
in
2005
.
However
,
because
the
financial
markets
of
developing
countries
such
as
China
are
immature
and
the
associated
financial
regulations
are
strict
,
these
countries
have
not
yet
adopted
emission
rights
futures
and
options
trading
.
However
,
the
emission
rights
futures
trading
model
proposed
in
this
paper
is
effective
enough
to
encourage
developing
countries
to
test
their
ability
to
promote
joint
air
pollution
control
.
Furthermore
,
the
JCM
proposed
in
this
paper
can
be
used
for
additional
pollutant
control
measures
in
other
countries
.
This
model
has
a
high
potential
to
improve
air
quality
and
fight
climate
change
.
