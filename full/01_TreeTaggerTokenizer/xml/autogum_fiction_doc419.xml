“
Have
you
observed
,
mademoiselle
,
that
the
painters
and
sculptors
of
the
Middle
Ages
,
when
they
placed
two
figures
in
adoration
,
one
on
each
side
of
a
fair
Saint
,
never
failed
to
give
them
a
family
likeness
?
When
you
here
see
your
name
among
those
that
are
dear
to
me
,
and
under
whose
auspices
I
place
my
works
,
remember
that
touching
harmony
,
and
you
will
see
in
this
not
so
much
an
act
of
homage
as
an
expression
of
the
brotherly
affection
of
your
devoted
servant
,

THE
PURSE
</head>
<p>
For
souls
to
whom
effusiveness
is
easy
there
is
a
delicious
hour
that
falls
when
it
is
not
yet
night
,
but
is
no
longer
day
;
the
twilight
gleam
throws
softened
lights
or
tricksy
reflections
on
every
object
,
and
favors
a
dreamy
mood
which
vaguely
weds
itself
to
the
play
of
light
and
shade
.
The
silence
which
generally
prevails
at
that
time
makes
it
particularly
dear
to
artists
,
who
grow
contemplative
,
stand
a
few
paces
back
from
the
pictures
on
which
they
can
no
longer
work
,
and
pass
judgement
on
them
,
rapt
by
the
subject
whose
most
recondite
meaning
then
flashes
on
the
inner
eye
of
genius
.
He
who
has
never
stood
pensive
by
a
friend
’s
side
in
such
an
hour
of
poetic
dreaming
can
hardly
understand
its
inexpressible
soothingness
.
Favored
by
the
clear-obscure
,
the
material
skill
employed
by
art
to
produce
illusion
entirely
disappears
.
If
the
work
is
a
picture
,
the
figures
represented
seem
to
speak
and
walk
;
the
shade
is
shadow
,
the
light
is
day
;
the
flesh
lives
,
eyes
move
,
blood
flows
in
their
veins
,
and
stuffs
have
a
changing
sheen
.
Imagination
helps
the
realism
of
every
detail
,
and
only
sees
the
beauties
of
the
work
.
At
that
hour
illusion
reigns
despotically
;
perhaps
it
wakes
at
nightfall
!
Is
not
illusion
a
sort
of
night
to
the
mind
,
which
we
people
with
dreams
?
Illusion
then
unfolds
its
wings
,
it
bears
the
soul
aloft
to
the
world
of
fancies
,
a
world
full
of
voluptuous
imaginings
,
where
the
artist
forgets
the
real
world
,
yesterday
and
the
morrow
,
the
future
--
everything
down
to
its
miseries
,
the
good
and
the
evil
alike
.
</p>
<p>
At
this
magic
hour
a
young
painter
,
a
man
of
talent
,
who
saw
in
art
nothing
but
Art
itself
,
was
perched
on
a
step-ladder
which
helped
him
to
work
at
a
large
high
painting
,
now
nearly
finished
.
Criticising
himself
,
honestly
admiring
himself
,
floating
on
the
current
of
his
thoughts
,
he
then
lost
himself
in
one
of
those
meditative
moods
which
ravish
and
elevate
the
soul
,
soothe
it
,
and
comfort
it
.
His
reverie
had
no
doubt
lasted
a
long
time
.
Night
fell
.
Whether
he
meant
to
come
down
from
his
perch
,
or
whether
he
made
some
ill-judged
movement
,
believing
himself
to
be
on
the
floor
--
the
event
did
not
allow
of
his
remembering
exactly
the
cause
of
his
accident
--
he
fell
,
his
head
struck
a
footstool
,
he
lost
consciousness
and
lay
motionless
during
a
space
of
time
of
which
he
knew
not
the
length
.
</p>
<p>
A
sweet
voice
roused
him
from
the
stunned
condition
into
which
he
had
sunk
.
When
he
opened
his
eyes
the
flash
of
a
bright
light
made
him
close
them
again
immediately
;
but
through
the
mist
that
veiled
his
senses
he
heard
the
whispering
of
two
women
,
and
felt
two
young
,
two
timid
hands
on
which
his
head
was
resting
.
He
soon
recovered
consciousness
,
and
by
the
light
of
an
old-fashioned
Argand
lamp
he
could
make
out
the
most
charming
girl
’s
face
he
had
ever
seen
,
one
of
those
heads
which
are
often
supposed
to
be
a
freak
of
the
brush
,
but
which
to
him
suddenly
realized
the
theories
of
the
ideal
beauty
which
every
artist
creates
for
himself
and
whence
his
art
proceeds
.
The
features
of
the
unknown
belonged
,
so
to
say
,
to
the
refined
and
delicate
type
of
Prudhon
’s
school
,
but
had
also
the
poetic
sentiment
which
Girodet
gave
to
the
inventions
of
his
phantasy
.
The
freshness
of
the
temples
,
the
regular
arch
of
the
eyebrows
,
the
purity
of
outline
,
the
virginal
innocence
so
plainly
stamped
on
every
feature
of
her
countenance
,
made
the
girl
a
perfect
creature
.
Her
figure
was
slight
and
graceful
,
and
frail
in
form
.
Her
dress
,
though
simple
and
neat
,
revealed
neither
wealth
nor
penury
.
</p>
<p>
As
he
recovered
his
senses
,
the
painter
gave
expression
to
his
admiration
by
a
look
of
surprise
,
and
stammered
some
confused
thanks
.
He
found
a
handkerchief
pressed
to
his
forehead
,
and
above
the
smell
peculiar
to
a
studio
,
he
recognized
the
strong
odor
of
ether
,
applied
no
doubt
to
revive
him
from
his
fainting
fit
.
Finally
he
saw
an
old
woman
,
looking
like
a
marquise
of
the
old
school
,
who
held
the
lamp
and
was
advising
the
young
girl
.
</p>
<p>
“
Monsieur
,
”
said
the
younger
woman
in
reply
to
one
of
the
questions
put
by
the
painter
during
the
few
minutes
when
he
was
still
under
the
influence
of
the
vagueness
that
the
shock
had
produced
in
his
ideas
,
“
my
mother
and
I
heard
the
noise
of
your
fall
on
the
floor
,
and
we
fancied
we
heard
a
groan
.
The
silence
following
on
the
crash
alarmed
us
,
and
we
hurried
up
.
Finding
the
key
in
the
latch
,
we
happily
took
the
liberty
of
entering
,
and
we
found
you
lying
motionless
on
the
ground
.
My
mother
went
to
fetch
what
was
needed
to
bathe
your
head
and
revive
you
.
You
have
cut
your
forehead
--
there
.
Do
you
feel
it
?
