Distinguish
Mennonites
from
Amish
</head>
<p>
Both
the
Amish
and
Mennonites
stem
from
similar
cultural
and
religious
heritages
,
making
it
tricky
to
distinguish
between
the
two
.
Luckily
,
there
are
several
ways
to
figure
out
whether
someone
is
Amish
or
a
Mennonite
without
having
to
straightforwardly
ask
them
.
By
looking
at
their
clothing
or
asking
them
questions
about
things
like
their
education
or
religious
meeting
places
,
you
'll
soon
know
whether
they
're
Amish
or
a
Mennonite
.

Find
out
if
they
’re
interested
in
higher
education
.
The
Amish
usually
do
n’t
allow
any
type
of
higher
education
because
they
think
it
gets
in
the
way
of
their
faith
.
However
,
Mennonites
do
accept
higher
education
.
Ask
the
person
if
they
’re
in
school
or
getting
a
degree
to
find
out
if
they
’re
Amish
or
a
Mennonite
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
If
they
’re
young
you
might
ask
,
“
Are
you
planning
on
going
to
college
?
”
</item>
<item>
Ask
an
older
person
a
question
like
,
“
Did
you
choose
to
earn
a
degree
?
”
to
see
if
they
’re
Amish
or
a
Mennonite
.
</item>
<item>
Ask
about
their
beliefs
on
going
to
college
too
,
if
desired
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Check
whether
they
use
technology
or
electricity
.
Amish
people
do
n’t
use
technology
,
and
instead
of
using
cars
,
they
prefer
to
use
horse-drawn
carriages
instead
.
They
also
avoid
using
electricity
.
Mennonites
are
more
accepting
of
technology
of
all
kinds
,
and
they
do
use
cars
as
well
as
electricity
.
Asking
or
finding
out
if
they
drive
cars
or
use
electricity
is
an
easy
way
to
figure
out
if
they
’re
Amish
or
not
.
<list type="unordered">

Mennonites
allow
electricity
and
telephones
in
the
home
.
</item>
<item>
Some
Amish
groups
may
have
one
telephone
that
they
use
collectively
.

<item>
Look
at
their
clothing
to
figure
out
if
they
're
Amish
or
Mennonites
.
Amish
people
tend
to
dress
more
conservatively
in
plain
clothing
,
with
women
wearing
dresses
or
head
coverings
.
Mennonites
do
n’t
have
a
strict
dress
code
and
are
often
dressed
like
everyday
people
.
If
you
see
people
dressed
very
modestly
,
it
’s
likely
that
they
’re
Amish
as
opposed
to
Mennonites
.

The
Amish
wear
solid-colored
clothing
in
blues
,
grays
,
whites
,
and
blacks
.
Men
wear
black
suits
and
straw
or
felt
hats
,
while
the
women
wear
dresses
and
prayer
caps

Find
out
how
much
they
interact
with
the
outside
world
.
The
Amish
are
a
tight
knit
community
and
tend
not
to
get
involved
in
everyday
society
.
Mennonites
are
close
to
the
opposite
—
they
're
well-integrated
into
modern
society
and
have
lots
of
involvement
with
other
people
.

Because
the
Amish
are
so
isolated
,
their
jobs
often
include
agricultural
work
in
their
communities
.
</item>
<item>
Mennonites
live
among
regular
communities
and
often
have
regular
jobs
as
well
.

Evaluating
Their
Religious
Practices
</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Ask
where
they
have
their
church
services
.
Mennonites
have
their
church
services
in
meeting
houses
while
Amish
people
meet
in
smaller
places
like
homes
,
barns
,
or
shops
.
By
asking
the
person
where
they
meet
for
church
,
you
’ll
be
able
to
figure
out
whether
they
’re
Amish
or
a
Mennonite
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
You
could
also
ask
them
what
language
they
use
during
the
service
—
German
or
Pennsylvania
Dutch
is
often
used
by
the
Amish
,
while
English
is
primarily
used
by
the
Mennonites
.

<item>
Use
the
size
of
their
worship
group
to
help
you
decide
if
they
’re
Amish
or
Mennonites
.
The
Amish
tend
to
worship
in
smaller
groups
because
of
space
limitations
—
they
’re
expected
to
host
church
services
in
their
houses
.
Mennonites
worship
in
large
meeting
spaces
,
meaning
their
groups
can
get
quite
large
.
While
an
Amish
worship
group
might
have
15-20
people
in
it
,
a
Mennonite
group
could
have
50-100
people
.
</item>
<item>
Find
out
if
they
do
missionary
work
or
only
stay
in
their
communities
.
Mennonites
are
known
for
their
outreach
in
the
community
,
going
on
missionary
trips
around
the
world
to
actively
help
others
.
They
use
this
as
a
way
to
spread
their
religious
beliefs
while
assisting
those
in
need
.
The
Amish
do
all
of
their
charitable
giving
close
to
home
and
do
n’t
tend
to
stray
from
their
community
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
If
you
think
someone
might
be
a
Mennonite
,
ask
them
if
they
do
any
missionary
work
to
find
out
for
sure
.

Tips

<list type="unordered">
<item>
Know
that
there
are
always
exceptions
,
so
ask
several
different
types
of
questions
to
find
out
for
sure
whether
the
person
is
Amish
or
a
Mennonite
.
</item>
<item>
If
all
else
fails
,
politely
ask
them
.
It
's
likely
that
they
'll
be
glad
to
tell
you
and
happy
that
you
're
interested
in
learning
about
their
lifestyle
.
