After

he
accused

failing
to
pay

Controversy
over
replacement
</head>
<p>
When
the
sultan
replaced
Mustafa
Pasha
with
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Çeşteci_Ali_Pasha">
Çeşteci
Ali
Pasha
</ref>
after
only
five
months
in
office
,
as
the
custom
of
the
sultans
was
to
change
the
governors
of
Egypt
in
rapid
succession
,
the
local
Ottoman
troops
marched
to
the
new
<hi rend="italic">

'
s
house
and
demanded
the
bonus

they
usually
received
when
the
governor
was
replaced
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-France1796-47-5">

</ref>
The
new
<hi rend="italic">

delayed
them
until
the
next
day
and
at
the
same
time
asked
them
to
bring
Mustafa

to
him
,
as
the
<hi rend="italic">

'
s
initial
task
was
to
analyze
the
affairs

;
one
of
the
paintings
belonging
to
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seraglio">

was
lost
,
and
it
was
suspected

had
taken
it
for
himself

However
,
the
army
refused
this
request

telling
him
,
</p>
<p>
&quot;
We
cannot
seize
the
person
of

,
nor
make
any
inquiry
after
his
effects

let
them
appoint
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjak-bey">

for
guards
,
and
let

The
entire
army
then
reportedly
swore
on
the
Quran
to
be
resolute
in
their
will
.
The
next
day
,
11
October
1623
,
the
armies
and
the
sanjak-beys
had
Mustafa
Pasha
read
the
sultan
's
orders
for
his
replacement
and
audit
.
When
the
army
members
again
demanded
compensation
from
the
new
<hi rend="italic">
kaymakam
</hi>
and
deputy
governor
,
they
reproached
the
soldiers
by
saying
that
they
constantly
demanded
the
same
thing
every
three
months
,
to
which
the
soldiers
replied
,
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Why
,
then
,
does
the
sultan
,
our
master
,
change
the
beylerbeys
(
governors
)
of
the
province
every
three
months
,
to
the
great
injury
of
the
inhabitants
?
If
he
chooses
to
nominate
every
day
new
beylerbeys
,
we
shall
also
demand
every
day
new
contributions
.

When
the
deputy
governor
replied
that
he
could
not
compensate
the
soldiers
until
the
new
governor
arrived
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo">

</ref>
,
the
soldiers
grew
enraged
and
nearly
killed
him
and
the
<hi rend="italic">
kaymakam
</hi>
before
they
escaped
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-France1796-48-6">
[

</ref>
The
soldiers
then
declared
,
&quot;
We
will
have
no
other
governor
than
Mustafa
;
let
Ali
return
to
the
place
from
whence
he
came
.

</p>
<p>
As
the
soldiers
welcomed
Mustafa
Pasha
back
as
governor
,
he
privately
wrote
to
the
sultan
to
ask
for
a
confirmation
of
his
re-commencement
of
the
office
,
with
many
local
figures
also
writing
to
the
sultan
on
his
behalf
.

When
the
soldiers
were
informed
that
the
now-unemployed
replacement
governor
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Çeşteci_Ali_Pasha">
Çeşteci
Ali
Pasha
</ref>
had
landed
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria">
Alexandria
</ref>
,
they
sent
messengers
to
inform
him
of
what
had
occurred
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-France1796-48-6">
[

</ref>
Ali
Pasha
,
angry
at
the
news
,
proceeded
to
put
one
of
the
messengers
in
chains
,
but
the
troops
in
the
area
loyal
to
Mustafa
Pasha
released
the
messenger
,
destroyed
Ali
Pasha
's
camp
,
and
forced
him
to
reembark
on
his
ship
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-France1796-49-7">
[

When
a
wind
accidentally
brought
his
ship
back
to
the
port
,
Mustafa
Pasha
had
his
troops
fire
cannonballs
at
the
ship
.
Because
of
unfavorable
wind
conditions
,
Ali
Pasha
was
forced
to
spend
the
winter
in
another
port
before
heading
back
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul">
Constantinople
</ref>
.
</p>
<p>
No
news
arrived
from
the
capital
confirming
or
denying
whether
Mustafa
Pasha
was
the
rightful
governor
,
and
the
populace
began
to
grow
uneasy
.
Finally
,
on
16
February
1624
,
a

reportedly
confiscated

Furthermore

experienced
a

which

largely
restricted
to

killed
approximately

To
mollify
and
hasten
the
grieving
process
(
and
possibly
to
avoid
further
contagion
from
corpses
)
,
Mustafa
Pasha
banned
all
funerals
,
and
the
bodies
were
carried
through
the
streets
and
buried
without
