<p>
Note
that
the

is
a
point
of
political
dispute
,
with
unionists
advocating
the
longer

,
and
nationalists
advocating
the
shorter
.
A
common
attempt
at
compromise
is
to
refer
to
the
county
as
&quot;
Londonderry
&quot;
and
the
city
as
&quot;
Derry
&quot;
,
but
this
is
by
no
means
universally
accepted
.
Because
of
this
,
a
peculiar
situation
arises
as
there
is
no
common
consensus
either
in
politics
or
elsewhere
as
to
which
name
is
preferred
;
the
city

is
officially
known

the

recognised

Situated
on
the
banks
of
River
Foyle
,
Derry
is
the
second
largest
city
in
Northern
Ireland
and
one
of
the
oldest
inhabited
places
in
the
whole
island
of
Ireland
.
As
they
say
there
,
'
Derry
was
a
city
when
Belfast
was
still
a
swamp
'
.
Derry
's
history
dates
back
over
1,450
years
,
a
lasting
reminder
of
the
early
inhabitants
of
the
area
is
the
Iron
Age
fort
,
just
over
the
border
in
<ref target="County%20Donegal">
County
Donegal
</ref>
,
known
as
the
<ref target="Burt%20%28Republic%20of%20Ireland%29">
Grianan
of
Aileach
</ref>
.
</p>
<p>
In
the
6th
Century
St
Columba/Colmcille
established
a
monastery
in
Derry
.
Shifting
ten
centuries
later
to
the
Plantation
of
Ulster
,
King
James
I
of
England
had
the
wealthy
guilds
of
London
build
up
the
city
of
Derry
(
hence
the
title
Londonderry
)
and
surround
it
by
the
defensive
walls
that
still
ring
the
city
today
.
</p>
<p>
These
walls
witnessed
one
of
the
most
prominent
events
in
the
history
of
Derry
.
In
1688
the
city
was
laid
siege
by
the
Earl
of
Antrim
and
the
Catholic
forces
of
James
II
,
the
English
king
who
was
deposed
in
favour
of
Protestant
William
of
Orange
.
The
settlers
of
the
city
who
were
protestant
,
barricaded
themselves
within
the
walls
,
when
a
group
of
apprentice
boys
from
London
on
seeing
the
oncoming
forces
,
locked
the
city
gates
and
so
started
the
Great
Siege
of
Derry
.
</p>
<p>
The
siege
was
to
be
the
longest
in
British
history
,
lasting
some
105
days
,
during
which
an
estimated
third
of
the
city
’s
then
population
of
30,000
died
through
disease
and
starvation
.
When
James
II
himself
rode
up
to
the
city
walls
and
lay
down
terms
for
surrender
he
was
greeted
with
shouts
of
‘
No
Surrender
’
.
The
siege
was
finally
broken
when
the
relief
ship
Mountjoy
broke
the
boom
which
was
laid
across
the
River
Foyle
beside
the
city
.
</p>
<p>
However
the
legacy
of
the
Great
Siege
of
Derry
lasted
for
centuries
with
the
Catholic
and
Protestant
communities
in
Derry
still
largely
divided
today
.
During
the
years
of
the
Troubles
,
Derry
witnessed
some
of
the
most
prominent
and
terrible
events
of
those
times
.
It
was
on
Derry
's
Bogside
area
that
British
soldiers
shot
dead
14
civil
rights
protesters
in
what
became
known
as
Bloody
Sunday
.
The
majority
of
the
Bogside
murals
commemorate
this
tragic
loss
of
innocents
.
</p>
<p>
Since
the
peace
process
in
Northern
Ireland
,
Derry
is
slowly
emerging
as
an
upbeat
cosmopolitan
city
with
great
potential
and
huge
tourist
interest
.
In
July
2010
,
Derry
was
awarded
City
of
Culture
for
2013
.
A
lot
of
Derry
’s
sights
are
meshed
with
its
history
,
the
16th
Century
walls
which
surround
the
city
are
among
the
oldest
and
the
best
preserved
citadel
walls
in
Europe
.
</p>
<p>
A
huge
percentage
of
Derry
’s
population
fall
into
the
20
–
30
age
group
and
there
are
plenty
of
places
to
cater
for
them
with
lots
of
clothes
shops
and
boutiques
,
pubs
,
bars
and
clubs
and
Derry
's
traditional
Irish
and
folk
music
scene
are
well
established
.
