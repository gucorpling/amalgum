The
Leprechaun
</head>
<p>
The
shell
carried
us
straight
back
to
the
house
of
Yolara
.
Larry
was
awaiting
me
.
We
stood
again
before
the
tenebrous
wall
where
first
we
had
faced
the
priestess
and
the
Voice
.
And
as
we
stood
,
again
the
portal
appeared
with
all
its
disconcerting
,
magical
abruptness
.
</p>
<p>
But
now
the
scene
was
changed
.
Around
the
jet
table
were
grouped
a
number
of
figures
--
Lugur
,
Yolara
beside
him
;
seven
others
--
all
of
them
fair-haired
and
all
men
save
one
who
sat
at
the
left
of
the
priestess
--
an
old
,
old
woman
,
how
old
I
could
not
tell
,
her
face
bearing
traces
of
beauty
that
must
once
have
been
as
great
as
Yolara
's
own
,
but
now
ravaged
,
in
some
way
awesome
;
through
its
ruins
the
fearful
,
malicious
gaiety
shining
out
like
a
spirit
of
joy
held
within
a
corpse
!
</p>
<p>
Began
then
our
examination
,
for
such
it
was
.
And
as
it
progressed
I
was
more
and
more
struck
by
the
change
in
the
O'Keefe
.
All
flippancy
was
gone
,
rarely
did
his
sense
of
humour
reveal
itself
in
any
of
his
answers
.
He
was
like
a
cautious
swordsman
,
fencing
,
guarding
,
studying
his
opponent
;
or
rather
,
like
a
chess-player
who
keeps
sensing
some
far-reaching
purpose
in
the
game
:
alert
,
contained
,
watchful
.
Always
he
stressed
the
power
of
our
surface
races
,
their
multitudes
,
their
solidarity
.
</p>
<p>
Their
questions
were
myriad
.
What
were
our
occupations
?
Our
system
of
government
?
How
great
were
the
waters
?
The
land
?
Intensely
interested
were
they
in
the
World
War
,
querying
minutely
into
its
causes
,
its
effects
.
In
our
weapons
their
interest
was
avid
.
And
they
were
exceedingly
minute
in
their
examination
of
us
as
to
the
ruins
which
had
excited
our
curiosity
;
their
position
and
surroundings
--
and
if
others
than
ourselves
might
be
expected
to
find
and
pass
through
their
entrance
!
</p>
<p>
At
this
I
shot
a
glance
at
Lugur
.
He
did
not
seem
unduly
interested
.
I
wondered
if
the
Russian
had
told
him
as
yet
of
the
girl
of
the
rosy
wall
of
the
Moon
Pool
Chamber
and
the
real
reasons
for
our
search
.
Then
I
answered
as
briefly
as
possible
--
omitting
all
reference
to
these
things
.
The
red
dwarf
watched
me
with
unmistakable
amusement
--
and
I
knew
Marakinoff
had
told
him
.
But
clearly
Lugur
had
kept
his
information
even
from
Yolara
;
and
as
clearly
she
had
spoken
to
none
of
that
episode
when
O'Keefe
's
automatic
had
shattered
the
Keth-smitten
vase
.
Again
I
felt
that
sense
of
deep
bewilderment
--
of
helpless
search
for
clue
to
all
the
tangle
.
</p>
<p>
For
two
hours
we
were
questioned
and
then
the
priestess
called
Rador
and
let
us
go
.
</p>
<p>
Larry
was
sombre
as
we
returned
.
He
walked
about
the
room
uneasily
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Hell
's
brewing
here
all
right
,
&quot;
he
said
at
last
,
stopping
before
me
.
&quot;
I
ca
n't
make
out
just
the
particular
brand
--
that
's
all
that
bothers
me
.
We
're
going
to
have
a
stiff
fight
,
that
's
sure
.
What
I
want
to
do
quick
is
to
find
the
Golden
Girl
,
Doc
.
Have
n't
seen
her
on
the
wall
lately
,
have
you
?
&quot;
he
queried
,
hopefully
fantastic
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Laugh
if
you
want
to
,
&quot;
he
went
on
.
&quot;
But
she
's
our
best
bet
.
It
's
going
to
be
a
race
between
her
and
the
O'Keefe
banshee
--
but
I
put
my
money
on
her
.
I
had
a
queer
experience
while
I
was
in
that
garden
,
after
you
'd
left
.
&quot;
His
voice
grew
solemn
.
&quot;
Did
you
ever
see
a
leprechaun
,
Doc
?
&quot;
I
shook
my
head
again
,
as
solemnly
.
&quot;
He
's
a
little
man
in
green
,
&quot;
said
Larry
.
&quot;
Oh
,
about
as
high
as
your
knee
.
I
saw
one
once
--
in
Carntogher
Woods
.
And
as
I
sat
there
,
half
asleep
,
in
Yolara
's
garden
,
the
living
spit
of
him
stepped
out
from
one
of
those
bushes
,
twirling
a
little
shillalah
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
'
It
's
a
tight
box
ye
're
gettin
'
in
,
Larry
avick
,
'
said
he
,
'
but
do
n't
ye
be
downhearted
,
lad
.
'
</p>
<p>
&quot;
'
I
'm
carrying
on
,
'
said
I
,
'
but
you
're
a
long
way
from
Ireland
,
'
I
said
,
or
thought
I
did
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
'
Ye
've
a
lot
o
'
friends
there
,
'
he
answered
.
'
An
'
where
the
heart
rests
the
feet
are
swift
to
follow
.
Not
that
I
'm
sayin
'
I
'd
like
to
live
here
,
Larry
,
'
said
he
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
'
I
know
where
my
heart
is
now
,
'
I
told
him
.
'
It
rests
on
a
girl
with
golden
eyes
and
the
hair
and
swan-white
breast
of
Eilidh
the
Fair
--
but
me
feet
do
n't
seem
to
get
me
to
her
,
'
I
said
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
brogue
thickened
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
An
'
the
little
man
in
green
nodded
his
head
an
'
whirled
his
shillalah
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
'
It
's
what
I
came
to
tell
ye
,
'
says
he
.
'
Do
n't
ye
fall
for
the
Bhean-Nimher
,
the
serpent
woman
wit
'
the
blue
eyes
;
she
's
a
daughter
of
Ivor
,
lad
--
an
'
do
n't
ye
do
nothin
'
to
make
the
brown-haired
coleen
ashamed
o
'
ye
,
Larry
O'Keefe
.
I
knew
yer
great
,
great
grandfather
an
'
his
before
him
,
aroon
,
'
says
he
,
'
an
'
wan
o
'
the
O'Keefe
failin
's
is
to
think
their
hearts
big
enough
to
hold
all
the
wimmen
o
'
the
world
.
A
heart
's
built
to
hold
only
wan
permanently
,
Larry
,
'
he
says
,
'
an
'
I
'm
warnin
'
ye
a
nice
girl
do
n't
like
to
move
into
a
place
all
cluttered
up
wid
another
's
washin
'
an
'
mendin
'
an
'
cookin
'
an
'
other
things
pertainin
'
to
general
wife
work
.
Not
that
I
think
the
blue-eyed
wan
is
keen
for
mendin
'
an
'
cookin
'
!
'
says
he
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
'
You
do
n't
have
to
be
comin
'
all
this
way
to
tell
me
that
,
'
I
answer
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
'
Well
,
I
'm
just
a
tellin
'
you
,
'
he
says
.
'
Ye
've
got
some
rough
knocks
comin
'
,
Larry
.
In
fact
,
ye
're
in
for
a
devil
of
a
time
.
But
,
remember
that
ye
're
the
O'Keefe
,
'
says
he
.
'
An
'
while
the
bhoys
are
all
wid
ye
,
avick
,
ye
've
got
to
be
on
the
job
yourself
.
