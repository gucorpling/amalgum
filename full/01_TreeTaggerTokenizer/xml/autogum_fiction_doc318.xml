Mistura

This
solution
deposits
in
a
few
hours
the
greater
part
of
the
strychnine
salt
as
an
insoluble
bromide
in
transparent
crystals
.
A
lady
in
England
lost
her
life
by
taking
a
similar
mixture
:
the
precipitated
strychnine
collected
at
the
bottom
,
and
in
taking
the
last
dose
she
swallowed
nearly
all
of
it
!
</hi>
</p>
<p>
“
Now
there
was
,
of
course
,
no
bromide
in
Dr.
Wilkins
’
prescription
,
but
you
will
remember
that
I
mentioned
an
empty
box
of
bromide
powders
.
One
or
two
of
those
powders
introduced
into
the
full
bottle
of
medicine
would
effectually
precipitate
the
strychnine
,
as
the
book
describes
,
and
cause
it
to
be
taken
in
the
last
dose
.
You
will
learn
later
that
the
person
who
usually
poured
out
Mrs.
Inglethorp
’s
medicine
was
always
extremely
careful
not
to
shake
the
bottle
,
but
to
leave
the
sediment
at
the
bottom
of
it
undisturbed
.
</p>
<p>
“
Throughout
the
case
,
there
have
been
evidences
that
the
tragedy
was
intended
to
take
place
on
Monday
evening
.
On
that
day
,
Mrs.
Inglethorp
’s
bell
wire
was
neatly
cut
,
and
on
Monday
evening
Mademoiselle
Cynthia
was
spending
the
night
with
friends
,
so
that
Mrs.
Inglethorp
would
have
been
quite
alone
in
the
right
wing
,
completely
shut
off
from
help
of
any
kind
,
and
would
have
died
,
in
all
probability
,
before
medical
aid
could
have
been
summoned
.
But
in
her
hurry
to
be
in
time
for
the
village
entertainment
Mrs.
Inglethorp
forgot
to
take
her
medicine
,
and
the
next
day
she
lunched
away
from
home
,
so
that
the
last
—
and
fatal
—
dose
was
actually
taken
twenty-four
hours
later
than
had
been
anticipated
by
the
murderer
;
and
it
is
owing
to
that
delay
that
the
final
proof
—
the
last
link
of
the
chain
—
is
now
in
my
hands
.
”
</p>
<p>
Amid
breathless
excitement
,
he
held
out
three
thin
strips
of
paper
.
</p>
<p>
“
A
letter
in
the
murderer
’s
own
hand-writing
,
<hi rend="italic">
mes
amis
!
</hi>
Had
it
been
a
little
clearer
in
its
terms
,
it
is
possible
that
Mrs.
Inglethorp
,
warned
in
time
,
would
have
escaped
.
As
it
was
,
she
realized
her
danger
,
but
not
the
manner
of
it
.
”
</p>
<p>
In
the
deathly
silence
,
Poirot
pieced
together
the
slips
of
paper
and
,
clearing
his
throat
,
read
:
</p>
<p>
Dearest
Evelyn
:
</p>
<p>
‘
You
will
be
anxious
at
hearing
nothing
.
It
is
all
right
—
only
it
will
be
to-night
instead
of
last
night
.
You
understand
.
There
’s
a
good
time
coming
once
the
old
woman
is
dead
and
out
of
the
way
.
No
one
can
possibly
bring
home
the
crime
to
me
.
That
idea
of
yours
about
the
bromides
was
a
stroke
of
genius
!
But
we
must
be
very
circumspect
.
A
false
step
—
—
’
</p>
<p>
“
Here
,
my
friends
,
the
letter
breaks
off
.
Doubtless
the
writer
was
interrupted
;
but
there
can
be
no
question
as
to
his
identity
.
We
all
know
this
hand-writing
and
—
—
”
</p>
<p>
A
howl
that
was
almost
a
scream
broke
the
silence
.
</p>
<p>
“
You
devil
!
How
did
you
get
it
?
”
</p>
<p>
A
chair
was
overturned
.
Poirot
skipped
nimbly
aside
.
A
quick
movement
on
his
part
,
and
his
assailant
fell
with
a
crash
.
</p>
<p>
“
<hi rend="italic">
Messieurs
,
mesdames
</hi>
,
”
said
Poirot
,
with
a
flourish
,
“
let
me
introduce
you
to
the
murderer
,
Mr.
Alfred
Inglethorp
!

CHAPTER
XIII
.
POIROT
EXPLAINS
</head>
<p>
“
Poirot
,
you
old
villain
,
”
I
said
,
“
I
’ve
half
a
mind
to
strangle
you
!
What
do
you
mean
by
deceiving
me
as
you
have
done
?
”
</p>
<p>
We
were
sitting
in
the
library
.
Several
hectic
days
lay
behind
us
.
In
the
room
below
,
John
and
Mary
were
together
once
more
,
while
Alfred
Inglethorp
and
Miss
Howard
were
in
custody
.
Now
at
last
,
I
had
Poirot
to
myself
,
and
could
relieve
my
still
burning
curiosity
.
</p>
<p>
Poirot
did
not
answer
me
for
a
moment
,
but
at
last
he
said
:
</p>
<p>
“
I
did
not
deceive
you
,
<hi rend="italic">
mon
ami
</hi>
.
At
most
,
I
permitted
you
to
deceive
yourself
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Yes
,
but
why
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Well
,
it
is
difficult
to
explain
.
You
see
,
my
friend
,
you
have
a
nature
so
honest
,
and
a
countenance
so
transparent
,
that
—
<hi rend="italic">
enfin
</hi>
,
to
conceal
your
feelings
is
impossible
!
If
I
had
told
you
my
ideas
,
the
very
first
time
you
saw
Mr.
Alfred
Inglethorp
that
astute
gentleman
would
have
—
in
your
so
expressive
idiom
—
‘
smelt
a
rat
’
!
And
then
,
<hi rend="italic">
bonjour
</hi>
to
our
chances
of
catching
him
!
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
think
that
I
have
more
diplomacy
than
you
give
me
credit
for
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
My
friend
,
”
besought
Poirot
,
“
I
implore
you
,
do
not
enrage
yourself
!
Your
help
has
been
of
the
most
invaluable
.
It
is
but
the
extremely
beautiful
nature
that
you
have
,
which
made
me
pause
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Well
,
”
I
grumbled
,
a
little
mollified
.
“
I
still
think
you
might
have
given
me
a
hint
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
But
I
did
,
my
friend
.
Several
hints
.
You
would
not
take
them
.
Think
now
,
did
I
ever
say
to
you
that
I
believed
John
Cavendish
guilty
?
Did
I
not
,
on
the
contrary
,
tell
you
that
he
would
almost
certainly
be
acquitted
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Yes
,
but
—
—
”
</p>
<p>
“
And
did
I
not
immediately
afterwards
speak
of
the
difficulty
of
bringing
the
murderer
to
justice
?
Was
it
not
plain
to
you
that
I
was
speaking
of
two
entirely
different
persons
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
No
,
”
I
said
,
“
it
was
not
plain
to
me
!
”
</p>
<p>
“
Then
again
,
”
continued
Poirot
,
“
at
the
beginning
,
did
I
not
repeat
to
you
several
times
that
I
did
n’t
want
Mr.
Inglethorp
arrested
<hi rend="italic">
now
</hi>
?
That
should
have
conveyed
something
to
you
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Do
you
mean
to
say
you
suspected
him
as
long
ago
as
that
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Yes
.
To
begin
with
,
whoever
else
might
benefit
by
Mrs.
Inglethorp
’s
death
,
her
husband
would
benefit
the
most
.
There
was
no
getting
away
from
that
.
When
I
went
up
to
Styles
with
you
that
first
day
,
I
had
no
idea
as
to
how
the
crime
had
been
committed
,
but
from
what
I
knew
of
Mr.
Inglethorp
I
fancied
that
it
would
be
very
hard
to
find
anything
to
connect
him
with
it
.
When
I
arrived
at
the
château
,
I
realized
at
once
that
it
was
Mrs.
Inglethorp
who
had
burnt
the
will
;
and
there
,
by
the
way
,
you
cannot
complain
,
my
friend
,
for
I
tried
my
best
to
force
on
you
the
significance
of
that
bedroom
fire
in
midsummer
.
