MY
DEAREST
,
SWEETEST
AMELIA
,
</head>
<p>
With
what
mingled
joy
and
sorrow
do
I
take
up
the
pen
to
write
to
my
dearest
friend
!
Oh
,
what
a
change
between
to-day
and
yesterday
!
Now
I
am
friendless
and
alone
;
yesterday
I
was
at
home
,
in
the
sweet
company
of
a
sister
,
whom
I
shall
ever
,
ever
cherish
!
</p>
<p>
I
will
not
tell
you
in
what
tears
and
sadness
I
passed
the
fatal
night
in
which
I
separated
from
you
.
YOU
went
on
Tuesday
to
joy
and
happiness
,
with
your
mother
and
YOUR
DEVOTED
YOUNG
SOLDIER
by
your
side
;
and
I
thought
of
you
all
night
,
dancing
at
the
Perkins
's
,
the
prettiest
,
I
am
sure
,
of
all
the
young
ladies
at
the
Ball
.
I
was
brought
by
the
groom
in
the
old
carriage
to
Sir
Pitt
Crawley
's
town
house
,
where
,
after
John
the
groom
had
behaved
most
rudely
and
insolently
to
me
(
alas
!
'
twas
safe
to
insult
poverty
and
misfortune
!
)
,
I
was
given
over
to
Sir
P.
'
s
care
,
and
made
to
pass
the
night
in
an
old
gloomy
bed
,
and
by
the
side
of
a
horrid
gloomy
old
charwoman
,
who
keeps
the
house
.
I
did
not
sleep
one
single
wink
the
whole
night
.
</p>
<p>
Sir
Pitt
is
not
what
we
silly
girls
,
when
we
used
to
read
Cecilia
at
Chiswick
,
imagined
a
baronet
must
have
been
.
Anything
,
indeed
,
less
like
Lord
Orville
cannot
be
imagined
.
Fancy
an
old
,
stumpy
,
short
,
vulgar
,
and
very
dirty
man
,
in
old
clothes
and
shabby
old
gaiters
,
who
smokes
a
horrid
pipe
,
and
cooks
his
own
horrid
supper
in
a
saucepan
.
He
speaks
with
a
country
accent
,
and
swore
a
great
deal
at
the
old
charwoman
,
at
the
hackney
coachman
who
drove
us
to
the
inn
where
the
coach
went
from
,
and
on
which
I
made
the
journey
OUTSIDE
FOR
THE
GREATER
PART
OF
THE
WAY
.
</p>
<p>
I
was
awakened
at
daybreak
by
the
charwoman
,
and
having
arrived
at
the
inn
,
was
at
first
placed
inside
the
coach
.
But
,
when
we
got
to
a
place
called
Leakington
,
where
the
rain
began
to
fall
very
heavily
--
will
you
believe
it
?
--
I
was
forced
to
come
outside
;
for
Sir
Pitt
is
a
proprietor
of
the
coach
,
and
as
a
passenger
came
at
Mudbury
,
who
wanted
an
inside
place
,
I
was
obliged
to
go
outside
in
the
rain
,
where
,
however
,
a
young
gentleman
from
Cambridge
College
sheltered
me
very
kindly
in
one
of
his
several
great
coats
.
</p>
<p>
This
gentleman
and
the
guard
seemed
to
know
Sir
Pitt
very
well
,
and
laughed
at
him
a
great
deal
.
They
both
agreed
in
calling
him
an
old
screw
;
which
means
a
very
stingy
,
avaricious
person
.
He
never
gives
any
money
to
anybody
,
they
said
(
and
this
meanness
I
hate
)
;
and
the
young
gentleman
made
me
remark
that
we
drove
very
slow
for
the
last
two
stages
on
the
road
,
because
Sir
Pitt
was
on
the
box
,
and
because
he
is
proprietor
of
the
horses
for
this
part
of
the
journey
.
&quot;
But
wo
n't
I
flog
'
em
on
to
Squashmore
,
when
I
take
the
ribbons
?
&quot;
said
the
young
Cantab
.
&quot;
And
sarve
'
em
right
,
Master
Jack
,
&quot;
said
the
guard
.
When
I
comprehended
the
meaning
of
this
phrase
,
and
that
Master
Jack
intended
to
drive
the
rest
of
the
way
,
and
revenge
himself
on
Sir
Pitt
's
horses
,
of
course
I
laughed
too
.
</p>
<p>
A
carriage
and
four
splendid
horses
,
covered
with
armorial
bearings
,
however
,
awaited
us
at
Mudbury
,
four
miles
from
Queen
's
Crawley
,
and
we
made
our
entrance
to
the
baronet
's
park
in
state
.
There
is
a
fine
avenue
of
a
mile
long
leading
to
the
house
,
and
the
woman
at
the
lodge-gate
(
over
the
pillars
of
which
are
a
serpent
and
a
dove
,
the
supporters
of
the
Crawley
arms
)
,
made
us
a
number
of
curtsies
as
she
flung
open
the
old
iron
carved
doors
,
which
are
something
like
those
at
odious
Chiswick
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
There
's
an
avenue
,
&quot;
said
Sir
Pitt
,
&quot;
a
mile
long
.
There
's
six
thousand
pound
of
timber
in
them
there
trees
.
Do
you
call
that
nothing
?
&quot;
He
pronounced
avenue
--
EVENUE
,
and
nothing
--
NOTHINK
,
so
droll
;
and
he
had
a
Mr.
Hodson
,
his
hind
from
Mudbury
,
into
the
carriage
with
him
,
and
they
talked
about
distraining
,
and
selling
up
,
and
draining
and
subsoiling
,
and
a
great
deal
about
tenants
and
farming
--
much
more
than
I
could
understand
.
Sam
Miles
had
been
caught
poaching
,
and
Peter
Bailey
had
gone
to
the
workhouse
at
last
.
&quot;
Serve
him
right
,
&quot;
said
Sir
Pitt
;
&quot;
him
and
his
family
has
been
cheating
me
on
that
farm
these
hundred
and
fifty
years
.
&quot;
Some
old
tenant
,
I
suppose
,
who
could
not
pay
his
rent
.
Sir
Pitt
might
have
said
&quot;
he
and
his
family
,
&quot;
to
be
sure
;
but
rich
baronets
do
not
need
to
be
careful
about
grammar
,
as
poor
governesses
must
be
.
</p>
<p>
As
we
passed
,
I
remarked
a
beautiful
church-spire
rising
above
some
old
elms
in
the
park
;
and
before
them
,
in
the
midst
of
a
lawn
,
and
some
outhouses
,
an
old
red
house
with
tall
chimneys
covered
with
ivy
,
and
the
windows
shining
in
the
sun
.
&quot;
Is
that
your
church
,
sir
?
&quot;
I
said
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Yes
,
hang
it
,
&quot;
(
said
Sir
Pitt
,
only
he
used
,
dear
,
A
MUCH
WICKEDER
WORD
)
;
&quot;
how
's
Buty
,
Hodson
?
Buty
's
my
brother
Bute
,
my
dear
--
my
brother
the
parson
.
Buty
and
the
Beast
I
call
him
,
ha
,
ha
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Hodson
laughed
too
,
and
then
looking
more
grave
and
nodding
his
head
,
said
,
&quot;
I
'm
afraid
he
's
better
,
Sir
Pitt
.
He
was
out
on
his
pony
yesterday
,
looking
at
our
corn
.
