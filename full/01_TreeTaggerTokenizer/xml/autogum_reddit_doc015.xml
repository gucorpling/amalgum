As
a
reservist
,
we
have
several
training
weekends
for
us
to
sharpen
our
skills
(
and
get
drunk
with
old
buddies
)
.
Myself
and
a
few
others
from
my
unit
were
selected
to
attend
one
such
weekend
all
the
way
in
Victoria
,
BC
(
our
unit
is
in
Southern
Ontario
which
is
pretty
much
the
other
side
of
Canada
)
.
Come
Friday
afternoon
,
me
and
another
guy
(
we
’ll
call
him
Tango
)
met
up
at
the
airport
to
board
our
flight
.
The
original
plan
is
to
take
an
flight
to
Vancouver
,
then
transfer
to
a
different
plane
to
fly
to
Victoria
.
When
me
and
Tango
were
shooting
the
shit
,
both
of
us
realized
we
were
only
given
boarding
passes
for
the
Vancouver-bound
flight
when
we
checked
in
.
This
was
kind
of
a
big
deal
since
we
need
the
Victoria
boarding
pass
to
,
you
know
,
actually
be
able
to
get
on
the
flight
to
Victoria
.
We
brought
this
up
with
the
clerk
at
the
gate
,
who
just
told
us
something
along
the
lines
of
“
they
’ll
sort
you
guys
out
in
Vancouver
”
.
They
did
n’t
.
When
we
got
off
at
Vancouver
,
it
turns
out
the
city
suffered
from
the
rare
snowfall
and
the
entire
airport
was
barely
running
.
Of
course
,
this
meant
our
flight
to
Victoria
got
cancelled
and
we
did
n’t
know
a
thing
until
we
actually
got
to
Vancouver
.
We
landed
at
an
ungodly
late
hour
too
,
so
of
course
there
’s
no
ferry
service
either
.
Fortunately
,
the
folks
organizing
the
training
weekend
know
about
our
situation
,
so
we
were
allowed
to
show
up
late
to
base
the
next
day
without
any
consequences
.
The
two
of
us
had
to
hunker
down
in
a
hotel
for
the
night
somewhere
and
take
the
ferry
across
the
next
day
.
This
is
where
things
get
interesting
.
After
we
collected
our
luggage
(
two
standard-issue
olive
drab
duffel
bags
)
,
we
headed
to
the
arrival
area
to
discuss
what
to
do
next
.
Suddenly
,
this
older
gentleman
wearing
a
leather
jacket
came
up
to
us
and
asked
us
if
we
needed
any
help
.
We
were
pretty
confused
by
this
until
he
told
us
he
’s
military
too
(
and
implied
those
duffel
bags
gave
us
away
)
.
That
was
when
I
realized
the
leather
jacket
was
an
<ref target=" http://www.canex.ca/royal-canadian-air-force-leather-flight-jacket-17.html">
Air
Force
flight
jacket
</ref>
without
any
rank
insignia
or
name
tags
.
<hi rend="bold">
Okay
,
this
guy
has
got
to
be
an
officer
.
</hi>
I
think
to
myself
as
Tango
and
I
explained
our
situation
to
the
man
,
who
told
us
he
’s
been
the
exact
same
situation
plenty
of
times
before
and
that
he
was
waiting
for
his
son
’s
flight
.
He
told
us
about
all
the
hotels
nearby
and
even
started
calling
them
one-by-one
to
see
if
any
of
them
had
rooms
.
Before
he
took
out
his
phone
,
however
,
he
told
us
something
.
“
By
the
way
,
I
’m
Colonel
(
name
withheld
)
.
”
Well…shit
.
Here
’s
a
4-ringer
(
RCN
and
RCAF
O-6
insignia
is
4
rings
around
the
sleeves
)
helping
out
a
lowly
E-3
and
E-4
.
I
take
out
my
phone
as
well
to
help
take
off
some
of
the
Colonel
’s
workload
.
Because
a
shitload
of
flights
got
cancelled
,
pretty
much
all
the
hotels
in
Vancouver
were
full
.
The
two
of
us
kept
calling
for
about
an
hour
before
we
finally
found
a
vacancy
.
After
booking
a
room
for
the
night
,
the
Colonel
told
us
to
stay
put
until
his
son
’s
flight
landed
(
that
did
n’t
take
too
long
compared
to
the
series
of
phone
calls
we
had
to
make
)
so
he
can
give
all
of
us
a
ride
.
We
kept
shooting
the
shit
all
the
way
to
the
hotel
,
where
the
Colonel
got
out
of
the
car
with
us
to
made
sure
we
checked
in
and
that
there
were
n’t
any
complications
.
Because
the
hotel
was
n’t
exactly
that
cheap
,
he
also
had
us
take
pictures
of
his
ID
(
did
n’t
have
his
business
cards
on
him
)
and
told
us
he
’ll
vouch
for
us
if
the
bean
counters
gave
us
shit
for
our
travel
expenses
.
After
we
said
our
farewells
,
the
Colonel
told
us
:
“
When
you
get
to
base
tomorrow
,
tell
them
the
Air
Force
came
to
the
Navy
’s
rescue
tonight
.
”
I
doubt
I
’ll
ever
be
able
to
pay
him
back
,
but
I
sure
can
pay
it
forward
.
I
’m
just
waiting
for
the
chance
.

Good
!
Those
Ohioans
on
the
other
side
of
the
lake
can
get
unruly
at
times
,
best
to
have
some
men
at
the
ready
.
Oh
,
and
if
you
need
ideas
on
how
to
invade
Ohio
,
just
watch
the
big
D-Day
reenactment
that
takes
place
in
Conneaught
,
to
the
east
of
Cleveland
.
</p>
<p>
Just
leave
the
surrounding
states
out
of
it
and
you
'll
be
good
.
Bonus
points
if
you
take
out
a
few
Ohio
Big
10
sports
teams
while
you
're
at
it
.
