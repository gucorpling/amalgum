Calculate
a
Light
Year
</head>
<p>
At
first
glance
,
you
may
think
that
a
light
year
is
a
measure
of
time
given
that
it
has
the
word
year
in
it
.
Light
years
are
actually
a
measure
of
distance
that
uses
light
as
a
standard
.
If
you
have
ever
told
a
friend
you
are
about
five
minutes
away
,
you
have
also
used
time
as
a
measure
of
distance
.
The
distances
between
stars
across
the
universe
are
very
great
,
so
astronomers
use
light
years
as
a
larger
unit
than
miles
or
kilometers
.
To
calculate
the
actual
distance
of
a
light
year
,
you
simply
need
to
multiply
the
speed
of
light
by
the
number
of
seconds
in
a
year
.

Define
the
light
year
.
A
light
year
is
a
measure
of
distance
equal
to
how
far
light
travels
in
one
Earth
year
.
Because
distances
across
the
universe
are
so
large
,
astronomers
use
light
years
.
Without
light
years
,
discussing
the
distance
between
two
stars
would
require
the
use
of
large
,
unruly
numbers
.

Another
measure
of
distance
you
may
come
across
when
learning
astronomy
is
the
parsec
.
It
is
equal
to
3.26
light
years
.
It
is
another
way
to
simplify
the
numbers
used
to
calculate
and
discuss
astronomical
distances
.

Write
the
formula
for
distance
.
Using
the
common
physics
formula
,
distance
equals
rate
times
time
or
d
=
r
x
t
,
you
can
calculate
how
long
a
light
year
is
:
Light
Year
=
(
speed
of
light
)
x
(
one
year
)
.
Since
speed
of
light
is
represented
by
the
variable
“
c
”
,
you
can
rewrite
the
equation
as
d
=
c
x
t
,
where
d
is
the
distance
of
a
light
year
,
c
is
the
speed
of
light
and
t
is
time
.

If
you
want
to
know
the
distance
of
a
light
year
in
kilometers
,
you
will
need
to
find
the
speed
of
light
in
kilometers
per
second

If
you
want
miles
,
you
will
need
the
speed
of
light
in

Define
the
speed
of
light
.
Light
in
a
vacuum
travels
at
a
velocity
of
186,000
miles
per
second
.
This
is
the
equivalent
of
299,792
kilometers
per
second
or
670,616,629
miles
per
hour
.
Here
we
will
use
the
velocity
in
miles-per-second

Calculate
the
number
of
seconds
in
a
year
.
To
find
the
number
of
seconds
in
a
year
,
you
will
do
a
series
of
multiplications
by
conversions
units
.
To
convert
years
to
seconds
you
will
multiply
the
number
of
days
in
a
year
times
the
number
of
hours
in
a
day
,
times
the
number
of
minutes
in

,
times
the
number
of

in

Now
that

you

plug
