<list type="ordered">
<item>
Take
wet
wipes
for
your
face
.
This
is
a
good
idea
because
the
showers
at
such
festivals
are
slightly
unhygienic
and
probably
cold
.

Do
n't
buy
lunch
,
bring
it
packed
in
a
cool
pack
.
This
will
keep
it
well
refrigerated
and
you
do
n't
have
to
sample
any
of
the
fast
food
stuff
!
But
if
greasy
spoons
(
which
are
quite
nice
as
an
occasional
treat
)
are
your
thing
,
then
take
plenty
of
money
because
food
and
drinks
there
tend
to
be
twice
as
much
as
the
average
KFC
where
you
live
.

Stay
Safe

</hi>
If
kids
are
coming
with
you
,
have
them
at
your
side
at
<hi rend="bold">
all
</hi>
times
.
Children
get
lost
very
,
very
easily
at
these
things
and
your
child/children
getting
lost
can
be
a
very
traumatic
experience
.
But
if
you
do
get
lost
,
make
sure
you
report
it
to
one
of
the
festival
tents
;
these
should
be
located
in
several
places
around
the
grounds
.
Also
,
a
good
tip
is
to
write
your
mobile/cell
phone
number
on
your
child
's
arm
so
if
someone
can
ring
you
if
they
find
your
child
.

Make
sure
all
your
money
is
in
your
wallet
,
not
in
your
tent
.
It
is
a
lot
safer
there
than
it
is
around
the
tent
.

If
you
're
crowdsurfing
be
very
careful
.
12
%
of
A&amp;E
emergencies
are
due
to
dangerous
actions
at
gigs
.

If
you
are
staying
until
Monday
morning
(
this
is
possible
at
Roskilde
)
,
do
n't
go
too
far
away
from
your
tent
,
or
at
least
take
all
your
belongings
out
of
it
.
Sunday
night
is
bonfire
night
,
and
they
might
trash
or
burn
your
tent
!
Alternatively
,
take
it
down
(
if
it
's
worth
taking
down
)
and
leave
at
a
cloakroom
or
in
a
car
.
<figure rend="Survive a Festival Step 6.jpg">

<item>
Put
a
brightly
coloured
ribbon
around
your
tent
to
know
where
yours
is
.
Walking
back
from
a
gig
in
the
middle
of
the
night
can
be
a
real
nightmare
otherwise
!

Take
plenty
of
dry
clothes
!
Wet
clothes
can
be
horrific
to
wear
the
next
day
!

Most
importantly
<hi rend="italic">
do
not
</hi>
be
tempted
to
try
any
drugs
regardless
of
what
other
people
say
.
They
will
completely
wreck
your
festival
experience
and
you
could
get
very
very
much
in
trouble
-
by
the
police
and
getting
hurt
by
using
the
drugs
themselves
.

Do
n't
get
too
wasted
,
you
will
forget
your
experience
and
wake
up
with
a
banging
hangover

Never
expect
an
on-site
cashpoint

Either
they
're
not
there
or
the
line
is
ten
thousand
miles
long
