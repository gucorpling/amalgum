Does
Molossia
have
its
own
flag
,
currency
or
national

?

<hi rend="bold">
President
Baugh
:
</hi>
Absolutely
,
what
would
a
country
be
without
those
things
?
Our
flag
has
three
horizontal
stripes
,
blue
,
white
and
green
(
from
the
top
)
.
The
blue
stands
for
the
Molossian
sky
,
almost
always
blue
,
the
white
stands
for
the
nearby
mountains
,
white
with
snow
much
of
the
year
,
and
the
green
stands
for
the
green
of
the
desert
foliage
in
the
spring
.
It
flies
every
day
in
front
of
Government
House
.
</p>
<p>
Our
currency
is
the
Valora
,
and
comes
in
both
paper
and
coin
formats
,
the
latter
being
poker
chips
,
instead
of
traditional
coins
.
Our
national
anthem
is
&quot;
Molossia
,
Nation
in
the
Desert
&quot;
,
with
lyrics
written
by
me
and
set
to
the
Albanian
national
anthem
.
I
'm
sure
they
do
n't
mind
.

What

President

</hi>
Our
official
language
is
English
,
but
we
borrow
from
Esperanto
sometimes
,
such
as
for
the
name
of
our
capital
,
&quot;
Espera
&quot;
and
our
money
the
Valora
.
We
have
no
problem
borrowing
from
other
languages
,
as
well
,
and
we
also
use
the
Deseret
Alphabet
as
an
alternate
writing
script
.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">
President
Baugh
:
</hi>
Well
,
officially
,
Molossia
is
a
republic
,
complete
with
a
constitution
.
Sadly
,
things
are
in
such
disarray
over
the
border
from
us
,
that
I
had
no
choice
but
to
suspend
the
constitution
and
declare
martial
law
.
It
's
unfortunate
,
but
the
security
of
my
nation
is
paramount
,
and
the
best
way
to
ensure
that
is
to
rule
by
decree
.
So
far
,
no
one
has
complained
,
and
anyway
,
I
'm
a
rather
benevolent
dictator
.

Yes

we

the

Yes
,
we
have
a
Navy
in
the
desert
.
Our
Navy
has
been
involved
in
several
exploration
expeditions
during
its
three
years

We
are
quite
proud
of
our

The
Molossian
Navy
has
their
own
academy
,
which
is
open
for
all
to
join
online

Tell
us
about
that

</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
President
Baugh
:
</hi>
Indeed
,
I
opened
the
Naval
Academy
several
years
ago
as
the
Molossian
Military
Academy
,
taking
advantage
of
my
strong
military
background
.
When
I
founded
the
Molossian
Navy
,
it
was
natural
to
turn
the
Military
Academy
into
and
Naval
Academy
.
In
the
years
before
and
since
,
the
Academy
has
produced
dozens
of
graduates
.
The
Academy
is
free
to
all
applicants
,
and
includes
lessons
and
tests
on
military
leadership
,
tactics
,
seamanship
and
naval
battles
.
Once
an
individual
has
taken
all
four
tests
successfully
,
he
or
she
can
purchase
a
certificate
of
completion
,
and
can
then
purchase
on
honorary
commission
in
the
Molossian
Navy
.
We
offer
honorary
commissions
in
the
rank
of
captain
,
commodore
and
admiral
.
