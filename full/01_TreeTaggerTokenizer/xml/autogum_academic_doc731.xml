Introduction
</head>
<p>
Copper
is
among
the
most
important
metals
in
the
U.S.
due
to
its
widespread
use
in
the
economy
in
large
amounts
in
both
commercial
and
residential
sectors
.
The
economic
value
of
the
copper
metal
is
driven
by
its
unique
properties
and
wide
range
of
applications
.
The
growth
in
demand
for
copper
globally
,
coupled
with
environmental
impacts
of
extraction
and
processing
,
speak
to
the
need
for
assessment
of
the
life
cycle
of
the
material
and
its
circularity
,
so
that
reserves
may
be
prolonged
and
the
embedded
energy
and
environmental
footprint
of
copper
may
be
improved
.
Several
research
studies
have
attempted
to
assess
the
criticality
of
future
demand
for
materials
generally
metals
,
and
even
specifically
copper
,
but
such
assessments
typically
do
not
take
into
account
the
relevance
of
circularity
and
the
circular
economy
,
focusing
mostly
on
the
front-end
of
the
material
life
cycle
and
not
assessing
end-of-life
(
EoL
)
and
scrap
flows
which
play
a
major
role
in
meeting
demand
and
material
availability
.
Previous
works
differ
from
this
study
in
that
their
time
frame
of
forecasts
tend
to
be
shorter
term
,
or
the
scope
of
the
forecast
did
not
include
a
complete
material
life
cycle
,
but
only
a
subset
of
the
entire
material
life
.
For
example
,
one
study
,
which
analyzed
75
years
of
data
to
make
long-term
projections
of
material
stocks
focused
on
the
accumulation
of
all
materials
in
only
the
use
phase
in
both
the
U.S.
and
Japan
.
In
contrast
,
the
present
study
focused
on
the
complete
life
cycle
of
a
single
material
.
Another
study
,
by
Schandl
et
al.
focused
on
production
and
consumption
of
materials
,
but
in
larger
regions
,
which
may
be
problematic
in
that
trends
have
been
shown
to
vary
dramatically
even
within
a
region
depending
on
economic
development
.
Existing
studies
specific
to
copper
include
a
long-term
forecast
for
the
U.S.
focused
only
on
the
front
end
of
material
life
cycle
,
a
long-term
outlook
for
intensity
of
use
and
in-use
stocks
that
is
global
in
focus
with
general
regional
breakdowns
,
a
global
outlook
of
supply
and
demand
,
nonspecific
to
the
U.S.
,
as
well
as
a
forecast
for
global
and
U.S.
copper
,
but
only
of
production
.
There
is
a
need
for
regionally
high-resolution
analyses
of
complete
life
cycles
of
specific
materials
.

This
study
investigated
prospects
for
circularity
in
the
future
(
up
to
2030
)
by
forecasting
material
flows
including
production
,
use
,
and
recovery
of
copper
in
the
U.S.
An
assessment
of
the
environmental
footprint
associated
with
the
projected
primary
and
secondary
copper
production
was
also
performed
.
Material
demand
patterns
generally
have
been
studied
since
the
1950s
,
and
socio-economic
theories
have
predicted
“
dematerialization
”
or
“
decoupling
”
of
material
consumption
from
economic
growth
and
development
for
several
decades
,
though
the
predicted
absolute
decrease
in
material
consumption
has
not
been
observed
at
the
scale
of
the
national
economy
.
However
,
starting
around
the
year
2000
,
copper
consumption
,
both
absolute
and
per
capita
,
and
from
both
primary
and
secondary
copper
sources
,
in
the
U.S.
has
declined
steadily
following
steady
growth
throughout
the
20th
century
.
In
the
development
of
material
flow
forecasts
,
therefore
,
inclusion
of
indicators
that
represent
dematerialization
or
decoupling
,
which
can
be
represented
by
material
efficiency
measurements
,
was
done
and
potential
implications
for
the
copper
circular
economy
into
the
future
were
considered
.
