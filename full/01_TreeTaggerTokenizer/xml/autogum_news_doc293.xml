New
reports
have
emerged
detailing
the
extent
of
the
efforts
by
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Iran">
Iranian
</ref>
government
to
purge
Western
cultural
influence
in
Iran
that
is
deemed
un-Islamic
.
Based
on
Iran
's
Islamic
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharia">

law
,
non-compliance
results
in
legal
punishment
because
the
state
sees
itself
responsible
in
executing
punishment
for
Islamic
theological
sins
.

<p>
Newspaper
headlines
such
as
&quot;
Western
hairstyles
...
have
been
banned
&quot;
re-iterated
the
legal
status
of
Western
hairstyles
;
barbers
who
offer
to
what
officials
consider
un-Islamic
hairdos
,
provide
make-up
services
,
and
pluck
eyebrows
have
been
warned
that
they
can
face
month-long
suspension
or
revocation
of
their
licenses

Barber
clients
who
violate

policies
will

,
fines

imprisonment

Iranian
male
youth
are
not
supposed
to
sport
outlandish
hairstyles

use
gel
to
make
their
hair
stand

Additionally
,
the
ban
on
neckties
remains
in
place
.
This
ban
evades
the
attention
of
those
outside
Iran
albeit
attentive
observers
realize
that
,
for
example
,
not
one
of
non-clerical
members
of
the
Iranian
government
wears
a
necktie
.

has
called
for
moderation
and
consideration

Many

Council
,
created
during
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic%20Cultural%20Revolution">

,
indicated
that
it
would
filter
immoral
video

audio
messages
sent

According
to
Iranian
television
statement
,
&quot;
In

to
prevent
possible
misuse
of

No

would
be
filtered
such

the
type

divulged

guns
and
so
forth
,
they
need
to
spread
cultural
values
that
lead
to
moral

corruption

.
They
have
said
this
many
times
.
I
recently
read
in
the
news
that
one
of
them
,
a
senior
official
in
an
important
American
political
center
,
said
:
&quot;
Instead
of
bombs
,
send
them
miniskirts
.
&quot;
He
is
right
.
If
they
arouse
sexual
desires
in
any
given
country
,
if
they
spread
unrestrained
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex%20segregation%20in%20Islam">
mixing

men
and
women
</ref>
,
and
if
they
lead
youth
to
behavior
to
which
they
are
naturally
inclined
by
instincts
,
there
will
no
longer
be
any
need
for
artillery
and
guns
against
that
nation
.

Following
the
Islamic
Revolution
,
the
Revolutionary
Guards
is
reported
to
have
cut
women
’s
lips
with
razors
because
the
women
were
wearing
lipstick
.
This
was
done
in
public
view
to
deter
others
.
