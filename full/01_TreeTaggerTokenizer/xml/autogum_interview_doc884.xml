AS
</hi>
:
I
read
several
quotes
from
Steven
Hassan
from
the
internet
that
made
total
sense
to
me
,
so
I
ordered
his
book
.
It
's
a
fantastic
read
.
I
learned
quite
a
lot
about
mind
control
and
particularly
found
it
interesting
and
true
that
a
key
aspect
of
mind
control
is
INFORMATION
CONTROL
.
If
one
can
control
the
information
that
you
are
allowed
to
receive
,
then
you
can
really
control
their
thinking
.
They
would
n't
be
equipped
with
all
of
the
ACTUAL
information
to
be
able
to
analyze
and
made
a
sane
decision
about
something
.
In
Scientology
and
especially
in
the
Sea
Organization
,
information
is
controlled
intensively
.
This
includes
ALL
communication
via
telephone
or
mail
–
incoming
and
outgoing
–
being
screened
through
security
personnel
in
order
to
detect
any
antagonism
regarding
Scientology
from
the
&quot;
outside
&quot;
,
no
televisions
allowed
,
no
internet
access
,
not
being
permitted
to
listen
to
or
read
any
article
that
said
anything
negative
about
Scientology
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
News
&quot;
was
obtained
by
the
numerous
Scientology
events
,
covering
the
&quot;
unprecedented
expansion
and
world-wide
acceptance
of
Scientology
&quot;
.
It
was
a
lie
,
but
it
kept
those
not
in-the-know
thinking
that
we
were
doing
well
,
so
we
need
to
keep
working
our
guts
out
.
It
was
astonishing
to
see
when
I
left
that
Scientology
had
a
BAD
reputation
of
tearing
apart
families
,
of
attacking
critics
,
of
scamming
people
out
of
their
money
,
etc.
</p>
<p>
I
saw
how
Tom
Cruise
(
supposedly
the
BEST
Scientology
disseminator
in
the
world
)
was
losing
it
on
Oprah
Winfrey
's
couch
and
with
Mat
Lauer
.
He
was
actually
a
laughing
stock
in
the
&quot;
real
world
&quot;
.
But
to
Scientology
,
per
David
Miscavige
,
Tom
Cruise
is
the
most
dedicated
Scientologist
he
knows
and
was
responsible
for
booming
Scientology
around
the
world
.
Well
,
the
statistics
I
saw
while
in
management
for
two
decades
did
n't
have
a
Tom
Cruise
&quot;
boom
&quot;
of
expansion
.
In
fact
,
we
were
constantly
trying
to
find
what
was
causing
a
lack
of
expansion
in
the
various
sectors
of
Scientology
.
</p>
<p>
So
,
information
control
is
a
very
important
aspect
of
mind
control
to
understand
and
watch
for
.
</p>
<p>
Another
book
I
found
to
be
very
beneficial
after
leaving
Scientology
was
<hi rend="italic">
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man's%20Search%20for%20Meaning">
Man
's
Search
for
Meaning
</ref>
</hi>
by
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor%20Frankl">
Viktor
Frankl
</ref>
.
It
answered
a
lot
for
me
.

You
described
in
chapter
6
,
being
assigned
to
a
sub-division
of
the
Rehabilitation
Project
Force
,
called
the
&quot;
RPF
's
RPF
&quot;
.
How
was
this
different
from
the
main
RPF
itself
?
What
typical
tasks
were
you
ordered
to
perform
?
Were
there
many
other
women
assigned
to
this
unit
?
Were
women
given
different
roles
or
treated
differently
than
men
while
on
the
RPF
or
the
RPF
's
RPF
?

<hi rend="bold">
AS
</hi>
:
The
Rehabilitation
Project
Force
(
or
RPF
)
is
described
by
the
church
as
a
program
offering
a
second
chance
to
Sea
Org
members
who
have
become
unproductive
or
have
strayed
from
the
church
's
codes
,
involving
intensive
physical
labor
at
church
facilities
and
auditing
and
study
sessions
to
address
the
individual
's
personal
problems
.
I
have
a
much
harsher
definition
after
spending
a
total
of
5
½
years
on
this
program
:
A
controlled
slave
labor
camp
to
which
is
assigned
anyone
arbitrarily
deemed
a
liability
for
actions
(
or
thoughts
)
considered
to
be
in
opposition
to
the
group
.
