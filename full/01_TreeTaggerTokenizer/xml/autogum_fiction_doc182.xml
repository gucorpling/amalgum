The
Coast

<p>
When
he
had
somewhat
recovered
,
Rob
sat
up
and
looked
around
him
.
The
elder
sailor
was
kneeling
in
earnest
prayer
,
offering
grateful
thanks
for
his
escape
from
suffering
and
death
.
The
younger
one
lay
upon
the
ground
sobbing
and
still
violently
agitated
by
recollections
of
the
frightful
experiences
he
had
undergone
.
Although
he
did
not
show
his
feelings
as
plainly
as
the
men
,
the
boy
was
none
the
less
gratified
at
having
been
instrumental
in
saving
the
lives
of
two
fellow-beings
.
</p>
<p>
The
darkness
was
by
this
time
rapidly
enveloping
them
,
so
Rob
asked
his
companions
to
gather
some
brushwood
and
light
a
fire
,
which
they
quickly
did
.
The
evening
was
cool
for
the
time
of
year
,
and
the
heat
from
the
fire
was
cheering
and
grateful
;
so
they
all
lay
near
the
glowing
embers
and
fell
fast
asleep
.
</p>
<p>
The
sound
of
voices
aroused
Rob
next
morning
,
and
on
opening
his
eyes
and
gazing
around
he
saw
several
rudely
dressed
men
approaching
.
The
two
shipwrecked
sailors
were
still
sound
asleep
.
</p>
<p>
Rob
stood
up
and
waited
for
the
strangers
to
draw
near
.
They
seemed
to
be
fishermen
,
and
were
much
surprised
at
finding
three
people
asleep
upon
the
bluff
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Whar
'
n
thunder
'
d
ye
come
from
?
&quot;
asked
the
foremost
fisherman
,
in
a
surprised
voice
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
From
the
sea
,
&quot;
replied
the
boy
.
&quot;
My
friends
here
are
shipwrecked
sailors
from
the
'
Cynthia
Jane
.
'
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
But
how
'd
ye
make
out
to
climb
the
bluff
?
&quot;
inquired
a
second
fisherman
;
&quot;
no
one
ever
did
it
afore
,
as
we
knows
on
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Oh
,
that
is
a
long
story
,
&quot;
replied
the
boy
,
evasively
.
</p>
<p>
The
two
sailors
had
awakened
and
now
saluted
the
new-comers
.
Soon
they
were
exchanging
a
running
fire
of
questions
and
answers
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Where
are
we
?
&quot;
Rob
heard
the
little
sailor
ask
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Coast
of
Oregon
,
&quot;
was
the
reply
.
&quot;
We
're
about
seven
miles
from
Port
Orford
by
land
an
'
about
ten
miles
by
sea
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Do
you
live
at
Port
Orford
?
&quot;
inquired
the
sailor
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
That
's
what
we
do
,
friend
;
an
'
if
your
party
wants
to
join
us
we
'll
do
our
best
to
make
you
comf'table
,
bein
'
as
you
're
shipwrecked
an
'
need
help
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Just
then
a
loud
laugh
came
from
another
group
,
where
the
elder
sailor
had
been
trying
to
explain
Rob
's
method
of
flying
through
the
air
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Laugh
all
you
want
to
,
&quot;
said
the
sailor
,
sullenly
;
&quot;
it
's
true
--
ev'ry
word
of
it
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Mebbe
you
think
it
,
friend
,
&quot;
answered
a
big
,
good-natured
fisherman
;
&quot;
but
it
's
well
known
that
shipwrecked
folks
go
crazy
sometimes
,
an
'
imagine
strange
things
.
Your
mind
seems
clear
enough
in
other
ways
,
so
I
advise
you
to
try
and
forget
your
dreams
about
flyin
'
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Rob
now
stepped
forward
and
shook
hands
with
the
sailors
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
see
you
have
found
friends
,
&quot;
he
said
to
them
,
&quot;
so
I
will
leave
you
and
continue
my
journey
,
as
I
'm
in
something
of
a
hurry
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Both
sailors
began
to
thank
him
profusely
for
their
rescue
,
but
he
cut
them
short
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
That
's
all
right
.
Of
course
I
could
n't
leave
you
on
that
island
to
starve
to
death
,
and
I
'm
glad
I
was
able
to
bring
you
away
with
me
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
But
you
threatened
to
drop
me
into
the
sea
,
&quot;
remarked
the
little
sailor
,
in
a
grieved
voice
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
So
I
did
,
&quot;
said
Rob
,
laughing
;
&quot;
but
I
would
n't
have
done
it
for
the
world
--
not
even
to
have
saved
my
own
life
.
Good-by
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
He
turned
the
indicator
and
mounted
skyward
,
to
the
unbounded
amazement
of
the
fishermen
,
who
stared
after
him
with
round
eyes
and
wide
open
mouths
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
This
sight
will
prove
to
them
that
the
sailors
are
not
crazy
,
&quot;
he
thought
,
as
he
turned
to
the
south
and
sped
away
from
the
bluff
.
&quot;
I
suppose
those
simple
fishermen
will
never
forget
this
wonderful
occurrence
,
and
they
'll
probably
make
reg'lar
heroes
of
the
two
men
who
have
crossed
the
Pacific
through
the
air
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
He
followed
the
coast
line
,
keeping
but
a
short
distance
above
the
earth
,
and
after
an
hour
's
swift
flight
reached
the
city
of
San
Francisco
.
</p>
<p>
His
shoulders
were
sore
and
stiff
from
the
heavy
strain
upon
them
of
the
previous
day
,
and
he
wished
more
than
once
that
he
had
some
of
his
mother
's
household
liniment
to
rub
them
with
.
Yet
so
great
was
his
delight
at
reaching
once
more
his
native
land
that
all
discomforts
were
speedily
forgotten
.
</p>
<p>
Much
as
he
would
have
enjoyed
a
day
in
the
great
metropolis
of
the
Pacific
slope
,
Rob
dared
not
delay
longer
than
to
take
a
general
view
of
the
place
,
to
note
its
handsome
edifices
and
to
wonder
at
the
throng
of
Chinese
inhabiting
one
section
of
the
town
.
</p>
<p>
These
things
were
much
more
plainly
and
quickly
viewed
by
Rob
from
above
than
by
threading
a
way
through
the
streets
on
foot
;
for
he
looked
down
upon
the
city
as
a
bird
does
,
and
covered
miles
with
a
single
glance
.
</p>
<p>
Having
satisfied
his
curiosity
without
attempting
to
alight
,
he
turned
to
the
southeast
and
followed
the
peninsula
as
far
as
Palo
Alto
,
where
he
viewed
the
magnificent
buildings
of
the
university
.
Changing
his
course
to
the
east
,
he
soon
reached
Mount
Hamilton
,
and
,
being
attracted
by
the
great
tower
of
the
Lick
Observatory
,
he
hovered
over
it
until
he
found
he
had
attracted
the
excited
gaze
of
the
inhabitants
,
who
doubtless
observed
him
very
plainly
through
the
big
telescope
.
</p>
<p>
But
so
unreal
and
seemingly
impossible
was
the
sight
witnessed
by
the
learned
astronomers
that
they
have
never
ventured
to
make
the
incident
public
,
although
long
after
the
boy
had
darted
away
into
the
east
they
argued
together
concerning
the
marvelous
and
incomprehensible
vision
.
Afterward
they
secretly
engrossed
the
circumstance
upon
their
records
,
but
resolved
never
to
mention
it
in
public
,
lest
their
wisdom
and
veracity
should
be
assailed
by
the
skeptical
.
