Sure
.
That
’s
what
I
mean
about
some
people
having
naturally
quirky
voices
.
You
’ve
heard
people
in
your
life
,
like
you
meet
a
girl
,
a
full-grown
woman
,
who
goes
[
<hi rend="italic">
in
high
pitched
squeal
</hi>
]
,
“
I
wanted
to
ask
you
.
”
And
you
go
,
'
Drop
the
act
.
Is
this
a
put-on
?
'
And
I
go
,
“
Shit
,
you
should
be
doing
cartoons
!

DS

Is
how
you
developed
your
talent
when
you
were
younger
based
upon
imitating
others
?
You
would
hear
things
that
would
leave
impressions
on
you
and
you
would
want
to
imitate
them
?
But
<hi rend="italic">
why
</hi>
would
you
want

imitate
them

<hi rend="bold">

Because
I
had
no
role
models
.
My
dad
was
a
certifiable
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sociopath">
psycho
</ref>
and
he
made
my
life
a
living
hell
and
it
was
a
horror
chamber
where
I
grew
up
and
when
I
grew
up
.
The
guy
used
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child%20abuse">
beat
the
daylights
out
of
me

left
and
right
,
for
any
random
reason
.
He
was
a
raving

.
I
grew
up
with
him
making
fun
of
me
.
I
was
forced
to
retreat
into
a
world
where
I
could
n’t
get
hurt
or
beat
up
or
anything
like
that
.

It

</hi>
Well
yeah
.
You
gotta
understand
,
it
was
like
I
was
a
little
kid
.
I
’m
not
a
magical
being
.
My
dad
tried
to
kill
me
about
fifteen
times
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
So
when
you
would
escape
into
those
voices
,
you
felt
a
sense
of
safety
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
BW
:
</hi>
Yes
.
'
Cause
I
was
surrounded
by
things
that
would
n’t
be
a
threat
to
me
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS

And
things
that
you
could
control
through
your
own
voice

BW
:
</hi>
Yes

Whereas
you

</hi>
I
was
like
an
alien
;
I
was
an
observation
unit
,
trying
to
study
the
human
condition
,
not
consciously
,
but
because
I
had
to
.
I
could
tell
you
the
kind
of
night
I
was
going
to
have
from
the
sound
of
the
key
in
the
door
or
the
way
the
car
pulled
up
.
I
was
hyper
vigilant
.
So
all
I
was
,
was
this
unit
from
space
that
had
nothing
but
data
gathering
and
sensory
equipment
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
What
was
your
dad
’s
reaction
to
your
doing
voices
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
BW
:
</hi>
It
did
n’t
register
on
the
radar
because
,
number
one
,
I
was
n’t
really
doing
it
in
the
time
I
spent
with
him
.
The
other
thing
was
that
he
was
a
frustrated
talent
.
He
could
sit
down
at
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/piano">
piano
</ref>
and
just
start
playing
it
,
having
no
lessons
or
training
.
He
could
do
dialogs
and
he
could
do
voices
.
He
was
very
funny
,
you
know
,
among
his
friends
and
all
that
.
He
was
also
a
musician
,
a
drummer
.
And
I
became
a
musician
except
I
was
n’t
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/drummer">
drummer
</ref>
,
I
was
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guitar%20player">
guitar
player
</ref>
.
The
thing
is
,
he
could
never
make
it
pay
.
All
he
had
was
a
string
of
jobs
.
Driving
a
beer
truck
then
driving
a
soda
pop
truck
then
driving
an
ice
cream
truck
.
You
know
what
I
mean
?
Like
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph%20Kramden">

kind
of
thing
.
