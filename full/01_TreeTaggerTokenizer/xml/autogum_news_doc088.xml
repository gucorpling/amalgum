According
to
a
government
official
,
at
least
26
people
were
killed
in
a
stampede
on
Thursday
at
a
historic
mosque
in
the
northwestern
city
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbuktu">
Timbuktu
</ref>
,
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Mali">
Mali
</ref>
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
There
were
26
killed
and
40
wounded
,
&quot;
Oumar
Sangare
,
the
Internal
Ministry
spokesman
,
told
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters">
Reuters
</ref>
.
However
,
other
news
agency
reports
put
the
death
toll
as
low
as
fifteen
.
</p>
<p>
An
official
,
who
requested
to
remain
anonymous
,
said
the
accident
could
have
begun
as
a
result
of
renovation
work
on
the
Djingareyber
mosque
â€”
which
is
made
primarily
of
mud
,
and
was
built
in
the
fourteenth
century
.
Construction
work
blocked
off
some
of
the
roads
,
and
that
could
have
been
a
factor
in
the
incident
.
&quot;
The
mosque
is
being
renovated
,
financed
by
the
Aga
Khan
,
and
the
work
is
carried
out
by
South
African
specialists
,
&quot;
the
official
told
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence%20France-Presse">
Agence
France-Presse
</ref>
(
AFP
)
news
agency
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Because
of
these
renovations
,
the
passage
on
the
north
side
of
the
mosque
is
closed
off
.
On
that
side
,
to
get
through
,
the
faithful
found
an
improvised
alleyway
.
But
the
alley
could
n't
take
the
number
of
people
using
it
.
So
there
was
a
stampede
.
Somebody
shouted
'
someone
has
died
'
and
panic
took
over
,
&quot;
the
same
official
went
on
to
say
.
</p>
<p>
Others
have
remarked
that
rescue
services
responded
&quot;
very
quickly
&quot;
to
the
stampede
,
and
helped
the
&quot;
many
injured
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinhua">
Xinhua
</ref>
news
agency
reports
the
stampede
started
when
an
elderly
woman
fell
in
one
of
the
town
streets
near
the
city
's
main
mosque
,
where
a
sermon
was
being
conducted
in
front
of
a
large
crowd
;
a
passersby
then
rushed
to
assist
the
woman
,
apparently
disrupting
the
crowd
's
movement
and
causing
the
stampede
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
People
were
circling
the
mosque
,
a
ritual
at
each
Mouloud
[
the
observance
of
the
Prophet
Mohammed
's
birthday
]
and
there
was
a
huge
crowd
build
up
,
&quot;
commented
Mohamed
Bandjougou
,
one
of
the
witnesses
to
the
event
,
to
AFP
by
telephone
.
&quot;
There
were
at
least
fifteen
dead
.
The
bodies
were
taken
to
the
morgue
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Authorities
warned
the
number
of
injured
may
actually
be
higher
than
reported
,
saying
that
&quot;
we
cannot
rule
out
the
fact
that
the
number
of
those
injured
will
increase
because
some
of
them
are
still
hiding
in
their
homes
instead
of
coming
to
the
hospital
.
&quot;
A
hospital
source
commented
that
some
of
the
people
hurt
were
in
critical
condition
,
and
needed
to
be
evacuated
to
the
capital
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamako">
Bamako
</ref>
,
as
soon
as
possible
.
</p>
<p>
The
mosque
's
imam
,
who
gave
his
name
as
Asseyuti
,
commented
on
the
incident
.
&quot;
We
're
in
mourning
.
What
happened
is
a
real
trauma
.
We
accept
the
will
of
God
.
He
gives
us
life
,
he
takes
it
away
,
&quot;
he
said
.

According
to
an
official
statement
,
Malian
president
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amandou%20Toumani%20Toure">
