<p>
I
believe
in
discipline
and
respect
for
teachers
and
administrators
,
but
I
believe
in
school
choice
.
I
do
n’t
believe
in
the
Teacher
’s
Unions
taking
teachers
monies
and
lobbying
in
Washington
on
causes
that
the
Teachers
may
not
believe
in
.
I
would
enact
Child
Support
Revisions
to
help
good
Dads
who
take
care
of
their
children
without
the
government
interfering
.
I
would
enact
a
Private
Medical
CO-OP
that
pays
dividends
for
those
who
remain
healthily
while
we
pay
for
whatever
health
problems
the
sick
may
have
,
with
no
co-pays
and
including
all
dental
,
vision
home
care
,
long
term
and
short
term
care
.
This
plan
may
have
some
government
oversight
by
the
Attorney
General
.

Campaigning
for
the
American
presidency
is
one
of
the
most
expensive
exercises
in
the
world
.
How
do
you
deal
with
the
cost
and
fundraising
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
I
do
n’t
have
an
expert
to
fundraise
for
me
,
so
I
campaign
over
the
internet
and
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/YouTube">
YouTube
</ref>
.
I
travel
when
the
funds
are
available
.
I
'm
reaching
people
in
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/France">
France
</ref>
and
all
over
America
.
They
are
shocked
that
I
respond
to
them
,
when
I
'm
not
out
physically
campaigning
or
doing
interviews
.
People
would
support
me
if
I
were
on
the
news
and
was
getting
support
that
way
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Do
you
have
a
running
mate
yet
?
Who
are
they
?
What
are
you
looking
for
in
a
running
mate
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
I
do
n’t
yet
have
a
running
mate
.
They
have
to
care
about
our
country
and
not
try
to
be
positioning
for
a
powerful
position
.
They
have
to
want
to
take
care
of
business
and
carry
out
my
platform
and
be
objective
.
I
do
n’t
like
“
yes
”
people
.
I
can
deal
with
constructive
criticism
,
because
the
things
I
’m
doing
are
to
better
our
country
.
The
More
Than
A
Woman
”
Presidential
Campaign
is
not
about
me
.
It
’s
about
us
“
WE
The
People
”
and
how
we
can
pursue
happiness
without
so
much
Government
Interference
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Can
you
win
the
2008
Presidential
election
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
Yes
,
if
I
had
the
same
media
coverage
and
had
been
invited
to
participate
in
the
debates
the
News
Media
have
and
are
sponsoring
for
only
Republicans
or
Democrats
and
their
so-called
Front
runners
,
yet
excluding
the
Independent
Candidate
.
</p>
<p>
I
've
proven
what
I
can
do
on
Fox
News
's
<hi rend="italic">
The
O'Reilly
Factor
</hi>
.
Feel
free
to
look
at
the
actual
segment
on
my
Presidential
Website
www.rbwforpres2008.com
.
Fox
received
thousands
of
emails
from
people
who
said
they
liked
what
I
had
to
say
about
the
issue
I
was
talking
about
.
People
want
to
see
me
on
the
news
programs
,
because
I
have
the
answers
to
the
problems
most
ca
n't
figure
out
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Can
any
third
party
or
independent
candidate
ever
win
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
Yes
,
especially
if
the
National
news
would
stop
being
so
partisan
.
At
least
the
voters
would
know
every
Candidate
running
and
their
platforms
.
If
57
%
of
the
people
are
Independents
that
means
the
voters
are
being
disenfranchised
all
over
the
country
.
The
voters
have
the
right
and
yet
have
no
idea
they
can
vote
for
any
of
us
100+
Candidate
out
there
.
I
will
make
sure
they
know
.
Why
not
?
