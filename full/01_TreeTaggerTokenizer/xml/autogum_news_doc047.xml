Taylor
gifted

Taylor
is
claimed
to
have
ordered
seizure
of
Sierra

's
diamond
deposits
by
RUF
soldiers
.
</p>
<p>
It
was
claimed
in
court
that
child
soldiers
were
used
in
conflict
,
as
diamond
mine
guards
,
and
to
carry
out
amputations

<p>
The
court
,
which
has
spent
a
year
considering
its
verdicts
,
unanimously
found
Taylor
guilty
.
It
ruled
Taylor
knew
at
least
from
1997
the
full
extent
of
RUF
activities
in
Sierra
Leone
,
and
that
he
helped
bankroll
activities
dealing
in
blood
diamonds

A
judge
said
more
than
a
thousand
youngsters
had
'
RUF
'
carved
into
their
skin
to
prevent
escape
.
From
the
moment
he
receives
the
full
judgement
Taylor
has
two
weeks
in
which
to
file
an
appeal
