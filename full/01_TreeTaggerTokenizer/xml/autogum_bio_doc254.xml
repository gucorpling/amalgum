Before
he
left
for
Yanina
,
however
,
he
was
disturbed
by
rumours
of
a
possible
revolt
among
the
Greeks
of
the
Morea
.
His
fears
were
allayed
,
however
,
when
an
assembly
of
Greek
notables
visited
him
on
8
November
1820
in
Tripoli
.
Thus
,
on
6
January
1821
,
he
left
Tripoli
for
the
north
,
leaving
behind
his
treasury
and
his
harem
,
while
his
deputy
(
<hi rend="italic">

kaimakam
</ref>
</hi>
)
Mehmed
Salih
with
a
force
of
1,000
Albanians
remained
to
maintain
order
.
However
,
only
a
few
months
later
,
while
the
Ottoman
armies
were
besieging
Yanina
,
the
first
uprisings
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_War_of_Independence">

War
of

</ref>
took
place
.
</p>
<p>
Hurshid
immediately
informed
the
Sultan
of
the
events
,
and
without
waiting
for
instructions
,
reacted
by
sending
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omer_Vryonis">
Omer
Vryonis
</ref>
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Köse_Mehmed_Pasha">

Pasha
</ref>
to
suppress
the
revolt
first
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Greece">
Central
Greece
</ref>
and
then
to
cross
over
to
the
Peloponnese
and
quell
the
uprising
in
its
heartland
.
At
the
same
time
,
he
dispatched
his
chief
of
staff
Mustafa
Bey
with
3,000
men
to
reinforce
the
garrison
of
Tripoli
.
Hurshid
himself
remained
in
Yanina
to
supervise
the
last
stages
of
the
siege
.
Despite
his
rapid
reaction
,
his
plans
ultimately
failed
:
Vryonis
and
Köse
Mehmed
failed
to
suppress
the
revolt
in
Central
Greece
,
while
the
reinforcements
of
Mustafa
Bey
were
insufficient
to
save
Tripoli
,
which
fell
to
the
Greeks
under
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodoros_Kolokotronis">
Theodoros
Kolokotronis
</ref>
after
a
prolonged
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Tripolitsa">
siege
</ref>
,
on
23
September
1821
.
Despite
the
general
massacre
of
the
Muslim
inhabitants
,
Hurshid
's
harem
and
a
part
of
his
treasure
were
saved
.
Finally
,
in
January
1822
,
he
killed
Ali
Pasha
through
treason
,
and
sent
his
severed
head
to
the
Sultan
,
and
his
star
seemed
on
the
rise
again
.
He
assembled
an
army
of
80,000
men
(
a
huge
number
by
Balkan
standards
)
and
was
about
to
march
in
order
to
finally
crush
the
Greek
uprising
,
when
disaster
struck
.
His
political
enemies
in
Constantinople
,
alarmed
at
the
fame
and
power
he
had
achieved
and
the
prestige
that
the
successful
ending
of
both
Ali
Pasha
's
and
the
Greek
revolts
would
bring
him
,
accused
him
of
misappropriating
a
large
part
of
Ali
's
treasure
.
Hurshid
had
sent
40,000,000
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Turkish_piastre">
piasters
</ref>
,
with
a
statement
that
they
had
been
found
in
Ali
's
vaults
,
while
the
Sultan
's
ministers
calculated
Ali
's
fortune
at
over
500,000,000
piasters
.
When
they
asked
him
to
send
a
detailed
account
,
the
offended
Hurshid
did
not
reply
.
Shortly
after
that
,
he
was
denounced
for
abuse
of
public
treasure
and
fell
in
disgrace
.
He
was
removed
from
his
positions
,
and
replaced
as
<hi rend="italic">
serasker
</hi>
and
<hi rend="italic">
mora
valisi
</hi>
by
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmud_Dramali_Pasha">
Mahmud
Dramali
Pasha
</ref>
.
Hurshid
was
ordered
to
remain
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larissa">
Larissa
</ref>
to
attend
to
the
provisioning
of
Dramali
's
army
.
</p>
<p>
When
news
began
arriving
in
Constantinople
of
the
failure
of
Dramali
's
expedition
at
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Dervenakia">
Dervenakia
</ref>
,
the
Sultan
ordered
Hurshid
to
take
matters
in
his
own
hand
and
salvage
what
he
could
of
the
situation
.
However
,
his
opponents
continued
to
plot
against
him
,
and
agents
were
sent
to
kill
him
.
Although
he
was
informed
of
the
threat
to
his
person
,
Hurshid
did
not
react
.
Instead
,
he
committed
suicide
by
taking
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison">
poison
</ref>
on
30
November
1822
.
