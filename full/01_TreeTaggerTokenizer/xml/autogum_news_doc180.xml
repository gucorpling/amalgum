of

,
was
fired
upon
by
snipers
.
</p>
<p>
No
injuries
were
reported
in
the
attack
,
but
the
UN
says
at
least
one
vehicle
was
destroyed
and
several
were
shot
at
.
It
's
not
clear
whether
rebels
or
the
Syrian
army
were
responsible
for
the
attack
.
The
team
left
the
scene
and
returned
at
a
later
time
with
a
new
vehicle
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
What
I
am
told
is
that
despite
the
very
difficult
circumstances
,
our
team
replaced
their
car
and
returned
to
the
suburbs
of
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Damascus">
Damascus
</ref>
to
carry
out
their
investigation
,
&quot;
said
UN
Secretary-General
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Ban_Ki-moon">
Ban
Ki-moon
</ref>
in
a
statement
on
Monday
.
Both
the
rebels
and
Syrian
government
are
said
to
have
been
granted
&quot;
safe
&quot;
passage
while
performing
their
investigation
which
has
to
be
completed
in
14
days
,
not
including
any
possible

<p>
The
team
arrived
on
August
18
and
is
investigating
the
scene
of
an
alleged
chemical
weapons
attack
that
occurred
on
August
21
in
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghouta">
Ghouta
</ref>
suburb
of
Damascus
.
Reports
say
anywhere
between
100
and
1,300
people
were
killed
in
the
attack
which
is
being
blamed
on
government
forces
,
something
they
deny
.
&quot;
We
hope
that
the
results
will
clarify
the
issue
and
will
help
to
dispel
numerous
speculations
around
the
alleged
use
of
the
Syrian
chemical
weapons
while
simultaneously
creating
a
positive
background
for
the
moves
towards
the
start
of
the
political
process
of
settlement
of
the
Syrian
crisis

Lukashevich

This
is
n't
the
first
time
a
UN
convoy
has
been
targeted
in
Syria
.
In
May
2012
a
convoy
was
hit
by
an
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvised%20Explosive%20Device">
Improvised
Explosive
Device
</ref>
(
IED
)
while
one
of
their
human
rights
groups
reported
a
Syrian
military
attack
on
civilians
at
a
nearby
funeral
in
the
Syrian
town
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan%20Shaykhun">

Sheikhoun

in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idlib%20Governorate">

province
</ref>
.
Three
Marked
UN
vehicles
were
damaged
in
the
attack
but
no
one
was
injured
.
</p>
<p>
The
latest
attack
on
the
UN
comes
as
a
US
government
official
called
their
current
investigation
&quot;
too
late
to
be
credible
.
&quot;
Following
the
alleged
chemical
attack
on
August
21
,
the
Syrian
army
heavily
bombed
the
area
against
what
they
called
rebel
strongholds
.
&quot;
The
fact
is
that
much
of
the
evidence
could
have
been
destroyed
by
that
artillery
bombardment

Two
reports

newspaper

The

suggest
the
U.S.
might
not
wait
for
the
team
to
finish
their
investigation
.
According
to
the
reports
,
U.S.

have
been

Civilians
began
protesting
against
Assad
in
March
of
2011
.
One
of
the
first
cities
government
forces
began
to
attack
in
an
effort
to
stop
the
protests
was
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Homs,_Syria">

In
July
of
that
year
,
at
least
one
person
was
killed
and
dozens
injured
when
government
forces
opened
fire
on
protesters
.
Late
that
month
,
government
forces
launched
an
offensive
against

across

resulting
in
around
100
deaths
in
