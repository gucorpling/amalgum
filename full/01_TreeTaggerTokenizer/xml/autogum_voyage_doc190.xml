Olango
Island
</head>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Olango
Island
</hi>
is
in
<ref target="Cebu%20Province">
Cebu
Province
</ref>
,
just
offshore
from
(
east
of
)
Mactan
Island
and
<ref target="Lapu-Lapu">
Lapu-Lapu
</ref>
city
.
It
is
known
mainly
for
its
wildlife
sanctuary
but
also
has
some
fine
beaches
and
dive
sites
.
The
Olango
Island
Group
includes
Olango
and
six
smaller
islands
nearby
.
The
main
town
and
main
port
is
<hi rend="bold">
Santa
Rosa
</hi>
on
the
west
coast
.
</p>
<p>
Much
of
the
terrain
is
mangrove
swamp
,
home
to
large
numbers
of
birds
and
also
,
unfortunately
,
to
many
<ref target="mosquitoes">

</p>
<head>
Understand
</head>
<p>
Olango
is
fairly
densely
populated
—
30,000
people
as
of
2010
in
about
10
sq
km
(
4
sq
miles
)
—
and
it
is
part
of
<ref target="Metro%20Cebu">
Metro
Cebu
</ref>
,
the
country
's
second-largest
urban
region
.
However
,
it
feels
distinctly
rural
;
there
are
no
roads
wider
than
two
lanes
and
many
are
not
paved
,
there
are
few
buildings
higher
than
two
storeys
and
many
one-storey
nipa
huts
,
quite
a
few
homes
lack
running
water
,
and
various
sorts
of
livestock
run
loose
.
</p>
<p>
Despite
the
rural
impression
,
Olango
is
probably
not
a
destination
for
backpackers
on
a
tight
budget
;
the
accommodation
open
to
tourists
is
all
resorts
.
These
are
not
as
expensive
as
resorts
in
some
other
areas
,
but
still
more
than
cheap
hotels
elsewhere
.
</p>
<p>
The
island
lacks
things
like
shopping
malls
or
even
a
large
market
;
residents
generally
go
to
Lapu-Lapu
for
those
.
There
are
sari-sari
shops
,
fruit
stalls
and
barbecue
places
,
and
Santa
Rosa
has
a
pharmacy
and
a
small
hospital
with
an
ambulance
,
but
facilities
are
generally
quite
limited
.
</p>
<p>
Administratively
the
Olango
Group
is
split
like
<ref target="Mactan%20Island">
Mactan
Island
</ref>
to
the
west
;
the
larger
northern
part
is
included
in
Lapu-Lapu
city
while
some
of
the
south
is
in
<ref target="C%C3%B3rdova%20%28Cebu%29">

.
</p>
<head>
Get
in
</head>
<p>
There
are
several
ferries
,
only
a
few
of
which
carry
vehicles
.
The
most-used
route
is
from
a
pier
next
to
the
Hilton
Hotel
on
the
Lapu-Lapu
side
to
Santa
Rosa
on
Olango
.
Officially
,
it
is
the
Punta
Engaño
Pier
but
locals
call
it
the
and
taxi
drivers
may
know
the
destination
as
Movenpick
.
The
resort
hotel
next
to
it
was
Hilton
but
is
now
Movenpick
.
An
important
pier
on
Olango
island
itself
is
the
.
</p>
<p>
There
are
also
boats
from
the
Hilton
pier
to
<ref target="Getafe%20%28Bohol%29">
Getafe
</ref>
on
<ref target="Bohol">
Bohol
</ref>
.
</p>
<p>
Getting
to
and
from
the
pier
is
easiest
by
taxi
,
about
₱300
from
downtown
Cebu
.
<ref target="Mactan-Cebu%20International%20Airport">
Mactan-Cebu
International
Airport
</ref>
is
located
in
Lapu-Lapu
,
not
far
from
the
pier
;
a
taxi
to
or
from
there
is
only
about
₱30
.
There
are
also
<ref target="jeepney">

cities
.
</p>
<p>
These
boats
carry
passengers
,
bicycles
,
motorcycles
and
freight
,
but
not
cars
.
They
seat
about
40
people
,
have
outriggers
,
and
look
like
the
photo
.
Cost
is
₱15
plus
a
₱5
terminal
fee
and
the
ride
takes
about
20
minutes
.
Boats
run
every
half
hour
or
so
during
daylight
hours
,
but
there
are
fairly
often
delays
while
freight
is
loaded
or
unloaded
.
The
boats
do
not
run
in
bad
weather
and
are
small
enough
that
those
with
sensitive
stomachs
may
be
uncomfortable
with
even
a
mild
swell
.
</p>
<p>
Boarding
one
of
these
ferries
is
an
interesting
experience
;
the
gangplanks
are
narrow
,
they
move
because
one
end
is
on
the
boat
,
not
all
have
a
railing
,
and
on
some
the
railings
or
even
the
floor
have
gaps
.
However
,
crew
members
are
very
helpful
about
reaching
out
with
a
stabilizing
hand
where
needed
,
and
sometimes
two
of
them
will
hold
up
a
long
bamboo
pole
to
provide
a
railing
.
There
are
porters
moving
freight
on
and
off
the
boat
;
one
of
them
will
be
happy
to
handle
your
luggage
for
a
few
pesos
.
</p>
<p>
There
are
lots
of
other
boats
,
mostly
smaller
than
the
ferries
,
around
the
pier
.
Many
offer
&quot;
island-hopping
&quot;
trips
to
some
of
the
smaller
islands
in
the
area
.
Boats
direct
to
resorts
on
Olango
can
also
be
arranged
,
either
by
contacting
the
resort
ahead
of
time
or
just
<ref target="haggling">
haggling
</ref>
with
boat
men
around
the
pier
.
</p>
<p>
There
is
occasionally
a
small
RoRo
ferry
between
the
Hilton
and
Santa
Rosa
piers
,
mainly
carrying
freight
and
trucks
loaded
with
freight
.
</p>
<head>
Get
around
</head>
<p>
The
commonest
mode
of
transport
on
the
island
is
a
motorcycle
plus
sidecar
rig
known
as
a
<ref target="Philippines%23By_tricycle">
pedicab
</ref>
.
These
are
more
expensive
on
the
island
than
elsewhere
;
most
rides
cost
₱120
.
</p>
<p>
Bringing
your
own
bicycle
or
motorcycle
would
be
practical
;
the
ferries
can
carry
those
,
traffic
on
the
island
is
light
,
and
the
main
roads
are
mostly
paved
though
often
quite
narrow
.
You
need
to
drive
slowly
and
watch
for
potholes
,
wandering
animals
,
and
children
playing
in
the
street
.
At
night
,
beware
of
motorcycles
running
without
lights
.
