Teerlinc
is
best
known
for
her
pivotal
position
in
the
rise
of
the
portrait
miniature
.
She
might
have
trained

Attributing
Teerlinc
's
works
is
challenging
because
she
did
not
always
sign
them
.
However
,
there
are
a
few
existing
paintings
that
are
suspected
to
be
Teerlinc
's
due
to
the
fact
she
was
the
only
active
miniaturist
of
prominence
in
English
court
between
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Holbein_the_Younger">
Hans
Holbein

</ref>
in

and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Hilliard">

</ref>
in
the
1570s
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-12">
[

</ref>
Some
scholars
also
speculate
that
many
of
the
miniatures
were
lost
in
the
fire
at
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Whitehall">

A
1983
exhibition
at
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_and_Albert_Museum">
Victoria
and
Albert

</ref>
represented
&quot;
the
first
occasion
when
a
group
of
miniatures
has
been
assembled
which
can
be
attributed
to
Levina
Teerlinc
&quot;
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Strong:52-5">

Since
the
exhibition
also
performed
the
same
function
for
her
predecessor
as
court
miniaturist
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_Hornebolte">
Lucas
Hornebolte
</ref>
,
it
was
especially
useful
in
developing
consensus
on
attributions
.
Five
miniatures
and
two
illuminated
manuscript
sheets
were
in
the
group
,
including
a
miniature
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Katherine_Grey">

from

Royal
Collection
</ref>
(
both
of
these
possibly
of
the
young
Elizabeth
I
,
and
private
collections
)
.
Strong
considered
there
was
&quot;
a
convincing
group
of
miniatures
that
emerge
as
the
work
of
a
single
hand
,
one
whose
draughtsmanship
is
weak
,
whose
paint
is
thin
and
transparent
and
whose
brushwork
loose
&quot;
.
