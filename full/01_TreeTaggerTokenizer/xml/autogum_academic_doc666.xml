Tropism
of
YFV
</head>
<p>
In
humans
,
after
transcutaneous
inoculation
,
YFV
exhibits
broad
patterns
of
tissue
tropism
and
is
disseminated
systemically
via
infection
of
multiple
white
cell
subsets
.
With
respect
to
organ
tropism
,
the
liver
is
the
primary
target
,
although
the
heart
,
kidneys
,
liver
,
spleen
,
and
less
frequently
,
the
brain
tissue
,
can
support
YFV
replication
.
The
natural
host
range
of
YFV
includes
humans
,
non-human
primates
and
mosquitos
.
Additionally
,
wild
animals
from
the
diverse
orders
Artiodactyla
,
Carnivora
and
the
superorder
Xenarthra
have
been
reported
to
be
serologically
positive
for
anti-YFV
antibodies
,
and
the
elicitation
of
antibody
responses
against
YFV
indicates
a
potentially
productive
infection
within
these
species
,
indicating
that
diverse
mammalian
species
could
represent
YFV
potential
reservoirs
(
see
Section
8.3
)
.

Mouse
Models
for
YFV
</head>
<p>
YFV
research
is
currently
limited
as
it
remains
challenging
and
expensive
to
establish
workflows
with
non-human
primates
.
While
YFV
has
a
limited
host
species-tropism
,
artificial
infection
of
laboratory
mice
and
hamsters
is
possible
,
although
the
course
of
disease
differs
from
that
observed
in
humans
.
Nevertheless
,
a
number
of
studies
in
genetically
modified
or
humanized
mice
have
yielded
insights
into
YFV
infection
and
dissemination
in
vivo
.
Single
cell-tracking
of
YFV-17D
dissemination
in
different
mouse
models
identified
novel
YFV
replication
reservoirs
in
secondary
lymphoid
compartments
,
with
hematopoietic
STAT1
knockout
increasing
virus-induced
pathogenicity
.
Double-humanized
mice
have
been
developed
,
possessing
both
human
immune
systems
and
hepatocytes
,
and
these
animals
represent
ideal
tools
for
monitoring
systemic
YFV
infection
in
vivo
as
both
compartments
are
permissive
for
YFV
.
In
addition
to
hepatotropism
,
YFV
can
also
be
neurotropic
in
rodents
,
primates
and
humans
.
In
contrast
to
polio
virus
and
reovirus
,
which
infect
the
brain
via
the
CNS
,
YFV-17D
infects
brain
tissue
by
crossing
the
blood-brain
barrier
.
A
mouse-neurovirulent
strain
(
SPYF
)
based
on
the
Porterfield
17D
(
PYF17D
)
strain
was
derived
by
additional
passaging
in
SCID
mice
,
exhibiting
enhanced
neurovirulence
and
neuroinvasiveness
.
This
enhanced
neurotopism
was
correlated
with
13
amino
acid
substitutions
,
five
of
which
were
located
in
the
E
protein
.
Arboviruses
can
encounter
dissemination
barriers
in
mosquitos
,
restricting
the
spreading
of
the
virus
within
the
vector
species
.
These
include
innate
immunity
related
pathways
as
well
as
physical
tissue
barriers
associated
with
the
midgut
and
salivary
glands
.
However
,
while
patterns
of
YFV-17D
dissemination
in
immunocompetent
mice
were
restricted
,
infection
of
<hi rend="italic">
IFNAR
</hi>
knockout
mice
resulted
in
broad
dissemination
preceding
viral
clearance
,
indicating
that
no
barriers
to
dissemination
exist
in
the
absence
of
type
I
IFN
.
Furthermore
,
while
I
and
II
type
IFNs
contribute
to
control
of
YFV-17D
infection
,
type
III
IFN
was
demonstrated
to
have
immunomodulatory
functions
and
was
protective
against
YFV-17D
neuroinvasion
in
mouse
models
.
YFD-17D
infection
of
IFN-α/β
receptor
and
STAT1
signaling
molecule
deficient
mice
resulted
in
systemic
viscerotropic
infection
:
a
course
of
disease
which
resembles
that
observed
in
humans
rather
than
the
typical
encephalitic
disease
course
commonly
reported
for
mice
.
Finally
,
while
many
flaviviruses
share
the
common
ability
to
antagonize
IFN
signaling
and
therefore
enhance
viral
replication
,
the
YFV
NS5
is
unable
to
bind
murine
STAT2
and
in
contrast
to
ZIKV
and
DENV
,
is
unable
to
engage
human
STAT2
in
murine
cells
.
Murine
STAT2
was
demonstrated
to
repress
YFV
replication
in
murine
cells
,
which
was
correlated
with
an
absence
of
IFN-α/β-mediated
NS5
ubiquitination
.
Together
,
these
mouse
studies
enhance
our
understanding
of
YFV
dissemination
and
host
control
in
vivo
.
These
findings
are
useful
for
the
development
of
the
next
generation
of
small
animal
disease
models
for
YFV
,
which
should
endeavor
to
recapitulate
the
disease
course
seen
in
humans
.
Thus
,
the
generation
of
an
immunocompetent
mouse
model
would
be
beneficial
,
which
could
be
realized
by
knocking
out
downstream
specific
anti-YFV
effectors
that
directly
inhibit
differential
aspects
of
the
YFV
lifecycle
,
rather
than
upstream
master-regulators
of
the
antiviral
response
.
Screening
approaches
could
identify
such
factors
.
