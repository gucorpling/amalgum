held
an
exclusive

with
Jeremy
Hanke
,
editor
of
<hi rend="italic">

Magazine
</hi>
.
The
magazine
,
which
is
free
to
read
online
,
was
started
as
a
resource
for
the
low
budget
moviemaker
and

.
</p>
<p>
He
says
that
one
of
the
goals
of
the
magazine
is
to
&quot;
connect
low-budget
filmmakers
via
a
feeling
of
community
,
as
many
...
.
.
often
compete
so
viciously
against
one
another
in
film
festivals
for
coveted
&quot;
shots
&quot;
with
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema%20of%20the%20United%20States">
Hollywood
</ref>
,
that
they
can
quickly
forget
their
similarities
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
When
asked
if
films
made
on
a
shoestring
budget
can
really
compete
with
those
made
for
millions
of
dollars
,
he
replied
,
&quot;
no…yes…and
absolutely
.
Allow
me
to
explain
.
&quot;
And
so
he
does
in
the
interview

Mr.
Hanke
:
</hi>
As
a
budding
low-budget
filmmaker
at
the
beginning
of
the
new
millenia
,
I
found
that
it
was
very
hard
to
find
anyone
who
had
practical
articles
on
making
films
as
professional
as
possible
with
little
money
.
Most
of
the
video
and
film
magazines
would
talk
about
equipment
that
could
range
from
$
10,000
-
$
30,000
apiece
,
which
clearly
was
out
of
the
$7K
budget
for
my
first
film
,
which
had
come
from
scrimping
and
saving
while
working
as
a
commissioned
computer
salesman
.
As
I
did
more
research
,
I
discovered
that
statistically
,
as
many
as
70%-80
%
of
all
Indie
films
were
being
made
for
less
than
$
30,000
,
which
,
obviously
,
my
first
film
’s
budget
definitely
fell
into
.
Hollywood
considers
anything
below
$
100,000
to
have
such
a
low
budget
that
it
’s
considered
a
no-budget
film
.
Because
of
that
low
regard
,
no
one
was
wasting
their
time
making
magazines
or
websites
designed
to
help
these
less-than-no-budget
filmmakers
,
despite
the
fact
that
they
were
(
and
are
becoming
even
more
)
the
majority
of
filmmakers
in
the
world
.
</p>
<p>
With
no
publicized
help
,
I
made
my
first
two
feature
films
over
the
course
of
four
years
with
XL-1s
and
other
equipment
borrowed
from
local
colleges
,
utilizing
helpers
that
were
of
extremely
varied
experiences
and
drive
.
In
the
process
,
I
learned
a
pile
of
things
through
hard
knocks
.
</p>
<p>
After
these
films
were
mostly
completed
,
I
remember
looking
online
for
any
new
sites
that
might
have
cropped
up
devoted
to
low-budget
filmmaking
.
That
’s
when
I
found
some
devoted
to
microcinema
—
a
boutique-style
of
video-making
that
’s
largely
composed
of
home
videos
and
short
parodies
that
are
meant
to
be
shared
with
friends
and
neighbors
.
The
term
originated
in
San
Francisco
and
was
designed
to
be
similar
to
the
micro-brewery
movement
,
which
encouraged
home
brews
that
were
shared
in
communities
.
The
concepts
of
a
community
of
sharing
and
the
emphasis
on
low-budgets
were
an
encouragement
for
us
,
but
most
microcinema
never
tried
to
look
professional
or
strove
for
high
standards
,
so
it
fell
short
of
the
sort
of
help
I
was
looking
for
.
