The
proposed
AKSD
and
the
conventional
KSD
were
tested
with
various
values
of
<hi rend="italic">
K
</hi>
for
comparison
.
The
improved
K-best
SD
(
IKSD
)
algorithm
was
also
considered
for
comparison
.
In
,
three
threshold
rules
were
proposed
,
namely
,
the
adaptive
,
normalized
,
and
fixed
thresholds
.
In
this
study
,
for
comparison
,
we
tested
the
adaptive
threshold-based
IKSD
and
the
fixed
threshold-based
IKSD
.
In
addition
,
the
schemes
in
were
tested
for
comparison
.
The
radius
adaptive
<hi rend="italic">
K
</hi>
-best
decoder
(
RAKSD
)
in
employs
tree
decomposition
and
adaptive
pruning
to
reduce
the
complexity
,
whereas
the
dynamic
threshold-aided
<hi rend="italic">
K
</hi>
-best
sphere
decoder
(
DKSD
)
in
exploits
a
dynamic
threshold
to
adjust
<hi rend="italic">
K
</hi>
.
For
the
threshold
in
the
proposed
AKSD
algorithm
,
the
constant
was
set
to
1
.
For
the
initial
radius
,
we
set
,
as
in
.
The
complexity
was
measured
by
the
average
number
of
visited
nodes
.
Furthermore
,
the
mean
values
in
the
simulation
results
were
obtained
by
averaging
over
independent
channel
realizations
.
For
simulations
,
we
considered
two
large
MIMO
configurations
:
and
.

In
<figure>
Figure

</figure>
,
the
BER
comparison
results
for
a
MIMO
system
with
,
,
and
16-QAM
are
shown
.
We
can
observe
that
the
AKSD
scheme
with
relatively
small
<hi rend="italic">
K
</hi>
achieves
comparable
or
better
BER
performance
with
respect
to
the
conventional
KSD
scheme
with
large
<hi rend="italic">
K
</hi>
.
Specifically
,
the
performance
of
the
proposed
AKSD
with
is
nearly
the
same
as
that
of
the
conventional
KSD
with
at
high
SNRs
,
where
the
AKSD
achieves
an
SNR
gain
of
0.7
dB
over
the
conventional
KSD
with
at
BER
.
<figure>
Figure
1
</figure>
also
shows
that
the
AKSD
scheme
achieves
better
BER
performance
compared
to
the
adaptive
threshold-based
IKSD
and
fixed
threshold-based
IKSD
.
The
SNR
gains
of
the
AKSD
at
BER
over
the
adaptive
threshold-based
IKSD
with
and
the
fixed
threshold-based
IKSD
with
are
approximately
dB
and
dB
,
respectively
.
Moreover
,
the
AKSD
scheme
outperforms
both
the
RAKSD
and
DKSD
by
approximately
dB
and
dB
,
respectively
,
at
a
BER
of
.
</p>
<p>
<figure>
Figure

</figure>
compares
the
BER
performance
for
,
,
and
16-QAM
.
Similar
to
<figure>
Figure
1
</figure>
,
it
demonstrates
that
the
AKSD
scheme
achieves
nearly
the
same
BER
performance
with
that
of
the
conventional
KSD
scheme
with
larger
<hi rend="italic">
K
</hi>
at
high
SNRs
.
It
is
also
worth
noting
that
the
proposed
AKSD
outperforms
the
fixed
threshold-based
IKSD
with
,
achieving
an
approximate
SNR
gain
of
dB
for
BER
.
In
<figure>
Figure
2
</figure>
,
it
is
also
observed
that
the
AKSD
scheme
substantially
outperforms
the
DKSD
and
RAKSD
schemes
.
</p>
<p>
In
<figure>
Figure
3
</figure>
,
the
complexity
comparison
for
a
MIMO
system
with
and
16-QAM
is
shown
.
<figure>
Figure
3
</figure>
shows
that
the
RAKSD
scheme
requires
lower
complexity
than
the
other
compared
schemes
;
however
,
its
BER
performance
is
significantly
worse
than
those
of
the
other
schemes
,
as
shown
in
<figure>
Figure
1
</figure>
.
A
similar
observation
can
also
be
made
for
the
DKSD
scheme
.
<figure>
Figure
3
</figure>
also
shows
that
the
proposed
scheme
requires
lower
complexity
than
the
other
schemes
providing
comparable
BER
performances
.
Specifically
,
the
complexity-reduction
ratio
of
the
AKSD
at
SNR
=
20
dB
,
compared
with
the
conventional
KSD
with
is
approximately
,
whereas
they
achieve
comparable
BER
performance
,
as
shown
in
<figure>
Figure
1
</figure>
.
Furthermore
,
the
AKSD
scheme
provides
and
complexity
savings
compared
with
the
fixed
threshold-based
IKSD
and
the
adaptive
threshold-based
IKSD
,
respectively
.
We
note
that
the
AKSD
scheme
outperforms
the
fixed
threshold-based
IKSD
and
adaptive
threshold-based
IKSD
in
terms
of
BER
performance
.
In
<figure>
Figure
3
</figure>
,
it
is
also
observed
that
the
complexity
reduction
of
the
proposed
scheme
becomes
larger
as
the
SNR
increases
.
This
is
because
,
in
the
high-SNR
region
,
in
(
8
)
is
large
,
and
the
ratio
of
the
second
path
metric
to
the
first
tends
to
be
small
,
which
results
in
a
small
number
of
retained
nodes
at
each
layer
in
the
proposed
AKSD
scheme
.
</p>
<p>
<figure>
Figure

</figure>
illustrates
the
comparison
of
the
average
number
of
visited
nodes
for
a
MIMO
system
with
,
and
16-QAM
.
Similar
to
<figure>
Figure
3
</figure>
,
it
is
seen
that
the
proposed
AKSD
scheme
provides
significant
complexity
reduction
compared
to
the
other
existing
schemes
that
provide
comparable
performances
,
i.
e.
,
the
conventional
KSD
and
IKSD
.
The
complexity
reduction
ratio
of
the
AKSD
at
SNR
dB
with
respect
to
the
conventional
KSD
with
is
approximately
.
Furthermore
,
at
SNR
dB
,
the
AKSD
scheme
achieves
approximately
and
complexity
reduction
compared
to
the
adaptive
threshold-based
IKSD
and
fixed
threshold-based
IKSD
with
,
respectively
.
