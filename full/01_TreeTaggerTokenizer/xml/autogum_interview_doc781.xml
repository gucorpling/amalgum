What
do
you
feel
are
the
three
most
important
issues
to
voters
in
your
riding
?
Are
these
the
same
top
three
issues
that
are
most
important
to
you
?
What
would
you
do
to
address
these
issues
?

<p>
In
London
,
as
with
most
communities
in
Ontario
,
the
three
most
important
issues
to
voters
will
be
health
care
,
health
care
,
and
health
care
.
I
agree
that
health
care
is
important
,
but
it
ca
n't
be
addressed
in
isolation
.
We
need
to
make
sure
we
have
enough
doctors
.
We
must
also
provide
doctors
with
support
from
other
health
care
professionals
.
We
must
address
quality
of
life
issues
for
health
care
workers
,
and
the
populace
at
large
.
We
must
clean
up
our
air
,
water
and
soil
.
We
must
produce
our
food
locally
.
We
must
plan
our
communities
to
encourage
walking
and
transit
use
(
more
exercise
means
less
obesity
,
heart
disease
,
diabetes
,
and
more
transit
means
less
air
pollution
and
fewer
respirator
illnesses
)
.
We
must
discourage
sprawl
.
We
must
address
poverty
.
We
must
provide
shelter
.
To
look
at
any
one
issue
in
isolation
misses
the
point
:
our
society
is
interconnected
,
and
our
government
policy
should
be
,
too
.
</p>
<p>
The
main
issues
that
concern
me
are
sprawl
,
climate
change
,
and
peak
oil
.
Once
again
,
these
issues
are
interconnected
,
they
all
feed
one
another
,
and
we
must
address
all
of
them
together
:
better
planned
communities
means
less
commuting
,
lower
GHG
emissions
,
and
more
time
before
we
run
out
of
fossil
fuels
.
It
also
means
a
healthier
community
,
and
a
closer
,
healthier
food
supply
,
etc.

What
should
be
the
first
order
of
business
in
the
39th
Legislative
Assembly
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
Preparing
for
the
coming
energy
crisis
.
Conservation
must
be
our
watchword
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Are
the
property
taxes
in
your
riding
at
a
fair
level
for
the
amount
of
services
received
in
the
municipality
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
Currently
,
no
,
because
existing
taxpayers
must
not
only
pay
for
services
,
but
must
also
subsidize
new
development
,
expanded
infrastructure
,
and
repairing
our
existing
infrastructure
,
in
addition
to
providing
a
whole
host
of
services
downloaded
by
the
previous
government
and
not
yet
uploaded
.
And
since
property
taxes
are
really
the
only
way
municipalities
can
raise
funds
,
they
must
continually
increase
to
cover
costs
.
However
,
uploading
services
in
some
way
only
reduces
a
municipal
tax
to
replace
it
with
a
provincial
one
,
so
the
taxpayer
does
n't
see
it
as
plainly
,
but
still
pays
it
.
We
must
allow
municipalities
to
stop
subsidizing
new
development
,
and
develop
new
revenue
streams
ot
cover
costs
,
while
we
upload
some
services
to
give
them
a
little
wiggle
room
.
Municipalities
must
be
able
to
choose
their
destinies
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
How
can
the
province
lead
the
way
in
stimulating
job
creation
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
What
we
do
currently
,
propping
up
failing
industries
,
is
a
short
term
solution
.
Investing
in
sustainable
industries
:
green
power
,
green
manufacturing
,
manufacturing
based
on
renewable
resources
,
sustainable
farming
,
will
go
much
farther
.
So
will
encouraging
more
local
economies
.
Our
global
economy
is
remarkable
centralized
.
A
part
is
made
here
,
another
in
Kentucky
,
and
another
in
Hokkaido
.
The
whole
thing
is
assembled
in
Michigan
.
This
means
fewer
jobs
.
But
if
things
were
built
locally
,
and
designed
locally
,
and
sold
locally
,
and
repaired
locally
,
and
recycled
locally
,
then
we
would
have
a
much
more
vibrant
,
interesting
,
sustainable
and
flexible
economy
.
That
means
more
jobs
.
