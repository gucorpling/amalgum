And
Fanny
Brandeis
took
a
long
breath
</head>
<p>
“
The
trouble
with
the
Haynes-Cooper
infants
'
wear
department
is
that
it
does
n't
understand
women
.
There
are
millions
of
babies
born
every
year
.
An
incredible
number
of
them
are
mail
order
babies
.
I
mean
by
that
they
are
born
to
tired
,
clumsy-fingered
immigrant
women
,
to
women
in
mills
and
factories
,
to
women
on
farms
,
to
women
in
remote
villages
.
They
're
the
type
who
use
the
mail
order
method
.
I
've
learned
this
one
thing
about
that
sort
of
woman
:
she
may
not
want
that
baby
,
but
either
before
or
after
it
's
born
she
'll
starve
,
and
save
,
and
go
without
proper
clothing
,
and
even
beg
,
and
steal
to
give
it
clothes
--
clothes
with
lace
on
them
,
with
ribbon
on
them
,
sheer
white
things
.
I
do
n't
know
why
that
's
true
,
but
it
is
.
Well
,
we
're
not
reaching
them
.
Our
goods
are
unattractive
.
They
're
packed
and
shipped
unattractively
.
Why
,
all
this
department
needs
is
a
little
psychology
--
and
some
lace
that
does
n't
look
as
if
it
had
been
chopped
out
with
an
ax
.
It
's
the
little
,
silly
,
intimate
things
that
will
reach
these
women
.
No
,
not
silly
,
either
.
Quite
understandable
.
She
wants
fine
things
for
her
baby
,
just
as
the
silver-spoon
mother
does
.
The
thing
we
'll
have
to
do
is
to
give
her
silver-spoon
models
at
pewter
prices
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
It
ca
n't
be
done
,
”
said
Slosson
.
</p>
<p>
“
Now
,
wait
a
minute
,
Slosson
,
”
Fenger
put
in
,
smoothly
.
“
Miss
Brandeis
has
given
us
a
very
fair
general
statement
.
We
'll
have
some
facts
.
Are
you
prepared
to
give
us
an
actual
working
plan
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Yes
.
At
least
,
it
sounds
practical
to
me
.
And
if
it
does
to
you
--
and
to
Mr.
Slosson
--
”
</p>
<p>
“
Humph
!
”
snorted
that
gentleman
,
in
expression
of
defiance
,
unbelief
,
and
a
determination
not
to
be
impressed
.
</p>
<p>
It
acted
as
a
goad
to
Fanny
.
She
leaned
forward
in
her
chair
and
talked
straight
at
the
big
,
potent
force
that
sat
regarding
her
in
silent
attention
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
still
say
that
we
can
copy
the
high-priced
models
in
low-priced
materials
because
,
in
almost
every
case
,
it
is
n't
the
material
that
makes
the
expensive
model
;
it
's
the
line
,
the
cut
,
the
little
trick
that
gives
it
style
.
We
can
get
that
.
We
've
been
giving
them
stuff
that
might
have
been
made
by
prison
labor
,
for
all
the
distinction
it
had
.
Then
I
think
we
ought
to
make
a
feature
of
the
sanitary
methods
used
in
our
infants
'
department
.
Every
article
intended
for
a
baby
's
use
should
be
wrapped
or
boxed
as
it
lies
in
the
bin
or
on
the
shelf
.
And
those
bins
ought
to
be
glassed
.
We
would
advertise
that
,
and
it
would
advertise
itself
.
Our
visitors
would
talk
about
it
.
This
department
has
n't
been
getting
a
square
deal
in
the
catalogue
.
Not
enough
space
.
It
ought
to
have
not
only
more
catalogue
space
,
but
a
catalogue
all
its
own
--
the
Baby
Book
.
Full
of
pictures
.
Good
ones
.
Illustrations
that
will
make
every
mother
think
her
baby
will
look
like
that
baby
,
once
it
is
wearing
our
No.
29E798
--
chubby
babies
,
curly-headed
,
and
dimply
.
And
the
feature
of
that
catalogue
ought
to
be
,
not
separate
garments
,
but
complete
outfits
.
Outfits
boxed
,
ready
for
shipping
,
and
ranging
in
price
all
the
way
from
twenty-five
dollars
to
three-ninety-eight
--
”
</p>
<p>
“
It
ca
n't
be
done
!
”
yelled
Slosson
.
“
Three-ninety-eight
!
Outfits
!
”
</p>
<p>
“
It
can
be
done
.
I
've
figured
it
out
,
down
to
a
packet
of
assorted
size
safety
pins
.
We
'll
call
it
our
emergency
outfit
.
Thirty
pieces
.
And
while
we
're
about
it
,
every
outfit
over
five
dollars
ought
to
be
packed
in
a
pink
or
a
pale
blue
pasteboard
box
.
The
outfits
trimmed
in
pink
,
pink
boxes
;
the
outfits
trimmed
in
blue
,
blue
boxes
.
In
eight
cases
out
of
ten
their
letters
will
tell
us
whether
it
's
a
pink
or
blue
baby
.
And
when
they
get
our
package
,
and
take
out
that
pink
or
blue
box
,
they
'll
be
as
pleased
as
if
we
'd
made
them
a
present
.
It
's
the
personal
note
--
”
</p>
<p>
“
Personal
slop
!
”
growled
Slosson
.
“
It
is
n't
business
.
It
's
sentimental
slush
!
”
</p>
<p>
“
Sentimental
,
yes
,
”
agreed
Fanny
pleasantly
,
“
but
then
,
we
're
running
the
only
sentimental
department
in
this
business
.
And
we
ought
to
be
doing
it
at
the
rate
of
a
million
and
a
quarter
a
year
.
If
you
think
these
last
suggestions
sentimental
,
I
'm
afraid
the
next
one
--
”
</p>
<p>
“
Let
's
have
it
,
Miss
Brandeis
,
”
Fenger
encouraged
her
quietly
.
</p>
<p>
“
It's”
--
she
flashed
a
mischievous
smile
at
Slosson
--
“it
's
a
mother
's
guide
and
helper
,
and
adviser
.
A
woman
who
'll
answer
questions
,
give
advice
.
Some
one
they
'll
write
to
,
with
a
picture
in
their
minds
of
a
large
,
comfortable
,
motherly-looking
person
in
gray
.
You
know
we
get
hundreds
of
letters
asking
whether
they
ought
to
order
flannel
bands
,
or
the
double-knitted
kind
.
That
sort
of
thing
.
And
who
's
been
answering
them
?
Some
sixteen-year-old
girl
in
the
mailing
department
who
does
n't
know
a
flannel
band
from
a
bootee
when
she
sees
it
.
We
could
call
our
woman
something
pleasant
and
everydayish
,
like
Emily
Brand
.
Easy
to
remember
.
And
until
we
can
find
her
,
I
'll
answer
those
letters
myself
.
They
're
important
to
us
as
well
as
to
the
woman
who
writes
them
.
And
now
,
there
's
the
matter
of
obstetrical
outfits
.
Three
grades
,
packed
ready
for
shipment
,
practical
,
simple
,
and
complete
.
Our
drug
section
has
the
separate
articles
,
but
we
ought
to
--
”
</p>
<p>
“
Oh
,
lord
!
”
groaned
Slosson
,
and
slumped
disgustedly
in
his
seat
.
