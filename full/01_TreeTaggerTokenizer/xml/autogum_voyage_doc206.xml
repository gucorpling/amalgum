<head>
History
</head>
<p>
In
the
months
following
the
attack
on
Pearl
Harbor
in
December
1941
,
the
Japanese
drove
the
Americans
out
of
the
Philippines
,
the
British
out
of
British
Malaya
,
and
the
Dutch
out
of
the
East
Indies
.
The
Japanese
then
began
to
expand
into
the
Western
Pacific
,
occupying
many
islands
in
an
attempt
to
build
a
defensive
ring
around
their
conquests
and
threaten
the
lines
of
communication
from
the
United
States
to
Australia
and
New
Zealand
.
The
Japanese
reached
Guadalcanal
in
May
1942
.
</p>
<p>
When
an
American
reconnaissance
mission
spotted
construction
of
a
Japanese
airfield
at
Lunga
Point
on
the
north
coast
of
Guadalcanal
,
the
situation
became
critical
.
This
new
Japanese
airfield
represented
a
threat
to
Australia
itself
,
and
so
the
United
States
as
a
matter
of
urgency
,
despite
not
being
adequately
prepared
,
conducted
the
first
amphibious
landing
of
the
war
.
The
initial
landings
of
US
Marines
on
7
August
1942
secured
the
airfield
without
too
much
difficulty
,
but
holding
the
airfield
for
the
next
six
months
was
one
of
the
most
hotly
contested
campaigns
in
the
entire
war
for
the
control
of
ground
,
sea
and
skies
.
Guadalcanal
became
a
major
turning
point
in
the
war
as
it
stopped
Japanese
expansion
.
After
six
months
of
fighting
,
the
Japanese
ceased
contesting
the
control
of
the
island
.
They
finally
evacuated
the
island
at
Cape
Esperance
on
the
north
west
coast
in
February
1943
.
</p>
<p>
Immediately
after
landing
on
the
island
,
the
US
Navy
Seabees
began
finishing
the
airfield
begun
by
the
Japanese
.
It
was
then
named
Henderson
Field
after
a
Marine
aviator
killed
in
combat
during
the
Battle
of
Midway
.
Aircraft
operating
from
Henderson
Field
during
the
campaign
were
a
hodgepodge
of
Marine
,
Army
,
Navy
and
allied
aircraft
that
became
known
as
the
Cactus
Air
Force
.
They
defended
the
airfield
and
threatened
any
Japanese
ships
that
ventured
into
the
vicinity
during
daylight
hours
.
However
,
at
night
,
Japanese
naval
forces
were
able
to
shell
the
airfield
and
deliver
troops
with
supplies
,
retiring
before
daylight
.
The
Japanese
used
fast
ships
to
make
these
runs
,
and
this
became
known
as
the
Tokyo
Expres
.
So
many
ships
from
both
sides
were
sunk
in
the
many
engagements
in
and
around
the
Solomon
Island
chain
that
the
nearby
waters
were
referred
to
as
Ironbottom
Sound
.
</p>
<p>
The
Battle
of
Cape
Esperance
was
fought
on
11
October
1942
off
the
northwest
coast
of
Guadalcanal
.
In
the
battle
,
United
States
Navy
ships
intercepted
and
defeated
a
Japanese
formation
of
ships
on
their
way
down
'
the
Slot
'
to
reinforce
and
resupply
troops
on
the
island
,
but
suffered
losses
as
well
.
The
Naval
Battle
of
Guadalcanal
in
November
marked
the
turning
point
in
which
Allied
Naval
forces
took
on
the
extremely
experienced
Japanese
surface
forces
at
night
and
forced
them
to
withdraw
after
sharp
action
.
Some
Japanese
viewpoints
consider
these
engagements
,
and
the
improving
Allied
surface
capability
to
challenge
their
surface
ships
at
night
,
to
be
just
as
significant
as
the
Battle
of
Midway
in
turning
the
tide
against
them
.
