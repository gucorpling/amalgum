The

French

government
has
urged
its
citizens
to
leave

Ivory

(
CÃ´te

as
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_Nations">
United

</ref>
(
U.N.
)
warned
that
the
country
was
heading
towards
a
civil
war
.
According
to
the
U.N.
,
there
has
been
an
increase
in
the
use
of
intimidation
methods
by
elements
of
the
national

forces
loyal

&quot;
The
international
community
must
act
and
act
decisively
.
I
emphasize
again
today
what
I
have
said
earlier
:
any
attempt
to
starve
the
United
Nations
mission
into
submission
will
not
be
tolerated
.
Any
attack
on
the
United
Nations
and
its
staff
must
be
considered
an
attack
on
the
international
community
,
&quot;
said
U.N.
Secretary-General
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Ban_Ki-moon">
Ban
Ki-moon
</ref>
in
a
statement
.
He
added
that
the
techniques
of
intimidation
include
&quot;
abductions
and
killings
and
the
propagation
of
hate
speech
through
the
state
broadcasting
corporation
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile
,
the
French
government
urged
its
citizens
to
leave
the
country
.
&quot;
We
ask
those
who
can
,
to
leave
Ivory
Coast
temporarily
until
the
situation
normalises

On
Saturday
,
Gbagbo
ordered
the
U.N.
and
French
peacekeepers
to
leave
the
country
saying
,
&quot;
The
government
demands
the
departure
of
the
UNOCI
and
LICORNE
[
French
]
forces
in
Ivory
Coast
and
is
opposed
to
any
renewal
of
their
mandate

&quot;
Gbagbo
claimed
victory
in
the
nation

said

we
've
finished
with

games

<p>

he
has
n't
asked
us
to
leave
&quot;
and
that
they
