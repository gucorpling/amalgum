<p>
&quot;
They
were
the
more
physical
team
by
far
,
&quot;
Celtics
coach
Doc
Rivers
said
after
the
game
,
according
to
the
Associated
Press
.
&quot;
They
were
more
aggressive
.
They
attacked
us
the
entire
night
.
I
did
n't
think
we
handled
it
very
well
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
While
both
teams
have
displayed
consistent
defensive
showing
,
Boston
could
not
match

's
output
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
You
ca
n't
ease
into
the
game
,
especially
in
the
finals
,
&quot;
Pierce
said
,
according
to
the
Associated
Press
.
&quot;
That
's
one
of
the
better
rebounding
teams
in
the
NBA
.
We
've
just
got
to
do
a
better
job
rebounding
the
ball
,
eliminating
easy
opportunities
.
When
I
look
up
and
we
've
given
up
100
points
,
I
have
n't
seen
that
in
a
while
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
first
quarter
was
fairly
evenly
matched
,
ending
26
–
21
in
favor
of
the
Lakers
.
At
one
point
the
Lakers
were
up
16
–
10
,
but
Boston
was
able
to
close
to
within
one
point

the
lead

in

the
chance

go
up
by
more
,
but

</p>
<p>
In
the
second
quarter
,
both

remained
close
until
late
in
the
quarter
when
the
Lakers
opened
an
12-point
lead
late
in
the
final
minute
.
With
just
two
tenths
of
a
second
on
the
clock
,
Boston
's
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajon%20Rondo">
Rajon
Rondo

hit
a
three-pointer
to
bring
the
score
to
within
nine
:
50
–
41
.
</p>
<p>
At
the
half
,
Bryant
told
ABC
Sports
that
the
team
done
okay
in
the
first
half
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
We
blew
a
couple
of
assignments
,
&quot;
Bryant
,
who
had
12
points
in
the
half
,
said
of
the
Celtics
defense
.
&quot;
We
felt
like
we
could
have
stretched
the
game
a
bit
more
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
In
the
third
quarter
,
the
Lakers
continued
to
pull
away
from
the
Celtics
,
outpacing
them
by
11
points
.
With
28
seconds
left
in

quarter
,

hit
a
three-pointer

put
Los

up
84

quarter

<p>
In
the
fourth
quarter
,
Los
Angeles
could
not
extend
their
lead
and
in
the
first
four
minutes
Boston
went
on
a
10-3
run
to
close
the
gap
to
13
points
.
Both
team
scored
two
more
points
before
Gosol
slammed
home
what
turned
out
to
be
the
game-winning
points
with
6:20
left
to
put
the
Lakers
up
91
–
76
.
In
the
final
six
minutes
,
Boston
outscored
the
Lakers
13
–
11
,
but
it
was
not
enough
to
bring
the
game
back
to
single
digits

This
series
is
the
12th
between
the
two
franchises
,
dating
back
to
1959
,
with
the
Celtics
leading
the
series
9
–
2
.
The
Minneapolis
Lakers
first
appeared
in
the
Basketball
Association
of
America
—
the
precursor
to
the
NBA
—
defeating
the
Washington
Capitols
4
–
2
.
The
next
year
,
Minneapolis
defeated
Syracuse
Nationals
4
–
2
in
the
first
NBA
.
The
Celtics
first
played
in
the
NBA
finals
in
1957
,
defeating
the
St.
Louis
Hawks
4
–
3
.
</p>
<p>
In
1959
,
the
Lakers
and
Celtics
first
faced
each
other
in
the
Finals
.
The
Celtics
won
the
series
4
–
0
.
In
1962
,
the
Lakers
—
now
in
Los
Angeles
—
met
for
the
second
time
—
this
time
winning
4
–
3
.
It
was
not
until
the
eighth
meeting
—
in
1985
—
did
the
Lakers
win
.
</p>
<p>
Before
the
start
of
the
game
,
NBA
Commisioner
David
Stern
commented
on
the
historic
rivalry
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
When
I
first
became
commissioner
in
the
'
80s
,
&quot;
Stern
told
the
<hi rend="italic">
Los
Angeles
Times
</hi>
,
&quot;
I
thought
what
you
did
every
June
is
you
went
from
L.A.
to
Boston
and
back
again
,
and
it
was
interesting
to
watch
.
And
now
here
we
are
again
.
