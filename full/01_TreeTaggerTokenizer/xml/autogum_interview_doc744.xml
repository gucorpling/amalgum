the

Overclocking

(
running
computer
hardware
at
a
higher
clock
rate
than
normally
)
is
more
of
an
enjoyment
for
senior
gamers
or
engineers
,
while
the
average
computer
users
may
lack
the
basic
concepts
of
it
,
causing
hardware

It
was
nice
to
witness
this
overclocking
festival
,
and
this
is
my
second
time
after
I
saw
an
overclocking
test
at
2007

What
portion
of
the
computing
population
most
often
try
to
overclock
their
computers
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Shamino
</hi>
:
Generally
,
gamers
often
try
overclocking
because
several
games
perform
best
when
graphics
display
and
computing
are
at
optimal
conditions
.
They
needs
high-level
hardware
to
fulfill
the
requirements
of
those
games
.
But
some
senior
engineers
also
try
overclocking
tests
to
examine
performance
on
newly-developed
hardware
before
marketing
it
.
Roughly
speaking
,
any
user
who
understands
hardware
functioning
may
experiment
with
overclocking
.

I
remember
that
in
a
conference
,
an
expert
recommended
engineers
to
be
cautious
for
safety
reasons
,
why
is
that
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Shamino
</hi>
:
If
someone
wants
to
try
overclocking
,
all
hardware
should
be
waterproof
and
safety
is
a
paramount
issue
that
experts
should
be
concerned
about
.
If
they
know
the
risks
and
can
afford
the
results
of
overclocking
,
then
the
public
can
rely
on
those
experts
when
they
do
overclocking
.

SysTool
,
CPUCool

are
often
used
for
overclocking
,
but
it
depends
on
the
individual
users
to
make
their

Generally

most

recommend
3D

What
about
overclocking
for
the
general
public
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Shamino
</hi>
:
Overclocking
has
some
risks
as
I
mentioned
before
.
It
's
often
attempted
by
general
users
or
the
public
who
have
just
witnessed
someone
doing
overclocking
.
But
,
in
fact
,
if
someone
does
proper
research
over
the
Internet
before
doing
overclocking
,
then
an
relatively
safe
overclocking
test
can
be
tried
.

Just
some
facts
about
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan%20External%20Trade%20Development%20Council">
TAITRA
</ref>
:
a
Live
Test
Center
was
established
at
COMPUTEX
Taipei
in
2005
and
2006
,
but
it
was
canceled
this
year
.
Although
some
hardware
companies
won
some
awards
there
,
what
have
been
the
effects
of
the
Live
Test
Center
on
the
hardware
industry
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Shamino
</hi>
:
I
remember
that
a
foreign
magazine
set
up
this
pavilion
for
companies
to
examine
performances
in
it
.
If
they
are
seeking
to
raise
the
profile
of
this
pavilion
by
winning
awards
,
I
do
n't
think
it
's
practical
.

Many
thanks

I
think
lots
of
concepts
should
be
modified
according
to
your
advice
.
