Everyone

they
compare
to
other
people
.

Know
yourself
.
Self-knowledge
,
particularly
non-judgemental
self
knowledge
,
is
an
incredibly
important
skill
to
help
you
define
yourself
.
You
'll
need
to
understand
what
makes
you
tick
and
what
your
thought
processes
are
before
you
can
define
who
you
are
as
a
person
.

Mindfulness
means
paying
attention
to
what
you
are
thinking
and
observing
your
patterns
of
thought
.
For
instance
,
you
might
realize
that
you
have
a
tendency
to
feel
that
people
do
n't
care
what
you
think
and
that
your
opinions
are
unimportant
.
Recognizing
that
you
have
these
thoughts
and
catching
them
before
they
start
causing
you
anxiety
,
can
help
you
piece
together
the
important
parts
of
your
identity
.

When
you
start
paying
attention
to
your
thought
processes
and
patterns
you
'll
need
to
practice
attentive
non-judgment
.
This
means
being
aware
of
your
thought
patterns
and
acknowledging
them
,
but
not
beating
yourself
up
over
them
.
Everyone
has
negative
thought
patterns
and
processes
.
By
paying
attention
to
them
,
you
can
eliminate
them
from
your
mind
.

Notice
how
you
identify
yourself
.
Once
you
start
paying
attention
to
the
way
you
think
about
yourself
and
about
the
world
,
look
specifically
for
the
ways
in
which
you
identify
yourself
.
See
what
groups
and
communities
you
use
to
create
your
identity
.
All
of
these
inform
how
you
see
yourself
and
tell
you
what
you
are
letting
define
you
.
<figure rend="Be-Friends-With-Your-Midlife-Crisis-Step-1.jpg">

<item>
For
example
,
look
at
things
like
religion
,
nationality
,
sexual
identity
and
see
if
those
are
ways
you
define
yourself
.
</item>
<item>
Look
at
the
roles
you
take
on
,
such
as
your
job
,
your
position
in
your
family
(
mother
,
father
,
sister
,
brother
)
,
your
romantic
status
(
single
,
couple
,
etc.
)
.

Jot
down
thought
processes
and
self
definitions
.
To
become
adept
at
seeing
your
thought
processes
and
definitions
and
how
those
determine
how
you
act
and
who
you
are
,
write
them
down
in
a
notebook
as
you
identify
them
.
You
'll
be
able
to
see
how
you
consider
yourself
and
it
will
make
it
easier
to
eliminate
the
negative
associations
.

Talking
to
and
working
with
a
clinical
psychologist
can
greatly
help
in
uncovering
patterns
of
thinking
and
being
.
They
can
also
help
you
deal
with
the
more
negative
aspects
of
your
thinking

Record
your
negative
definitions
.
Recording
them
and
paying
attention
to
them
will
help
you
let
go
of
them
.
Getting
them
out
in
the
open
can
help
to
take
away
some
of
their
hold
on
your
mind
and
self
.

Do
n't
limit
yourself
in
negative
ways
.
Definition
of
the
self
determines
the
action
.
So
,
for
instance
,
if
you
're
defining
yourself
as
someone
who
has
bad
romantic
relationships
,
you
've
already
lost
the
potential
for
a
good
romantic
relationship
.
It
is
a
story
that
you
tell
yourself
,
and
then
because
you
believe
the
story
,
you
will
already
be
behaving
in
ways
that
make
the
story
true
.

Identify
your
core
values
.
You
do
n't
want
to
define
yourself
based
on
outside
forces
,
because
outside
forces
are
volatile
and
subject
to
constant
change
.
By
basing
your
self-definition
on
core
values
,
you
will
have
a
better
chance
of
having
a
stable
self-definition
.

You
wo
n't
lose
your
self
identity
if
you
base
it
on
values
you
hold
at
your
core
,
like
compassion
,
courage
,
integrity
.
</item>
<item>
Write
down
a
list
of
these
values
and
consciously
and
mindfully
act
them
out
in
your
daily
life
.
Therefore
,
if
courage
is
one
of
your
core
values
,
stand
up
for
someone
being
harassed
at
the
bus
stop
,
or
if
honesty
is
a
core
value
,
fess
up
to
having
lost
your
father
's
favorite
watch
.
If
compassion
is
on
that
list
,
spend
time
volunteering
at
a
homeless
shelter
.

Define
yourself
in
positive
ways
.
This
does
n't
mean
that
you
do
n't
acknowledge
the
negative
events
and
actions
that
have
happened
in
your
life
.
They
are
as
much
a
part
of
you
as
the
positive
,
but
they
do
not
define
you
.
<figure rend="Be-Friends-With-Your-Midlife-Crisis-Step-6.jpg">

This
means
do
n't
let
outside
circumstances
rule
your
identity
.
That
comes
from
within
in
,
from
the
core
values
that
you
have
already
identified
as
being
important
to
your
identity
.

Understand
that
the
negative
experiences
in
your
life
have
offered
knowledge
.
For
example
,
if
you
have
had
negative
experiences
with
romance
,
learn
from
those
experiences
.
What
have
they
taught
you
about
the
kind
of
person
you
want
to
be
?

Never
ever
forget
that
no
one

you
can
define
you
.
You
will
always
be
the

can

you
really
are

<item>
Be
honest
with
yourself
,
but
do
n't
be
overly
critical
.
This
means
do
n't
say
to
yourself
:
&quot;
I
'm
ugly
,
&quot;
or
&quot;
I
'm
stupid

Do
n't
try
to
compare
yourself
to
others
,
you
ca
n't
,
it
would
not
be
fair
,
to
them
or
to
you
,
because
you
have
different
backgrounds
,
different
insecurities
,
different
expectations
of
life
,
and
of
yourself
.
Comparing
two
people
is
like
taking
off
all
those
things
,
and
placing
them
as
products
,
to
see
which
one
is
better
.
</item>
<item>
Do
n't
put
yourself
in
a
category
by
thinking
you
should
stick
in
it
