Gagauzia
</ref>
</hi>
is
an
autonomous
region
of
<ref target="Moldova">
Moldova
</ref>
.
It
has
a
population
of
about
135,000
people
,
83
%
of
whom
are
of
the
Gagauz
Turkic
ethnic
group
.

<head>
History
</head>
<p>
According
to
some
theories
,
the
Gagauz
people
descend
from
the
Seljuq
Turks
who
settled
in
Dobruja
following
the
Anatolian
Seljuq
Sultan
Izzeddin
Keykavus
II
(
1236
–
1276
)
.
One
clan
of
Oghuz
Turks
is
known
to
have
migrated
to
the
<ref target="Balkans">
Balkans
</ref>
during
intertribal
conflicts
with
other
Turks
.
This
Oghuz
Turk
clan
converted
from
Islam
to
Orthodox
Christianity
after
settling
in
medieval
<ref target="Bulgaria">
Bulgaria
</ref>
and
were
called
Gagauz
Turks
.
A
large
group
of
the
Gagauz
later
left
Bulgaria
and
settled
in
southern
<ref target="Bessarabia">
Bessarabia
</ref>
,
along
with
a
group
of
ethnic
Bulgarians
.
Between
1812
and
1846
,
Russian
Imperial
authorities
relocated
the
Gagauz
people
from
what
is
today
eastern
Bulgaria
to
what
is
now
Moldova
.
</p>
<p>
In
August
1989
,
Moldavian
(
<ref target="Romanian%20phrasebook">
Romanian
</ref>
)
was
adopted
as
the
official
language
of
the
Republic
of
Moldova
,
replacing
Russian
.
The
Gagauz
were
also
worried
about
the
implications
for
them
if
Moldova
reunited
with
Romania
,
as
seemed
likely
at
the
time
.
In
August
1990
,
Comrat
declared
itself
an
autonomous
republic
,
but
the
Moldovan
government
annulled
the
declaration
as
unconstitutional
.
</p>
<p>
Support
for
the
Soviet
Union
remained
high
in
Gagauzia
,
with
a
referendum
in
March
1991
returning
an
almost
unanimous
vote
in
favour
of
remaining
part
of
the
USSR
.
Gagauzia
declared
itself
an
independent
republic
on
19
August
1991
.
But
when
the
Moldovan
parliament
voted
on
independence
from
the
Soviet
Union
on
27
August
1991
,
six
of
the
12
Gagauz
deputies
in
the
Moldovan
parliament
voted
in
favour
,
while
the
other
six
abstained
.
The
Moldovan
government
began
to
pay
more
attention
to
minority
rights
.
</p>
<p>
In
1994
,
the
Parliament
of
Moldova
awarded
to
&quot;
the
people
of
Gagauzia
&quot;
(
through
the
adoption
of
the
new
Constitution
of
Moldova
)
the
right
of
&quot;
external
self-determination
&quot;
.
On
23
December
1994
,
the
Parliament
of
the
Republic
of
Moldova
accepted
the
&quot;
Law
on
the
Special
Legal
Status
of
Gagauzia
&quot;
,
resolving
the
dispute
peacefully
.
Gagauzia
is
now
a
&quot;
national-territorial
autonomous
unit
&quot;
with
three
official
languages
:
Romanian
,
Gagauz
,
and
Russian
.
</p>
<p>
On
2
February
2014
,
Gagauzia
held
a
referendum
.
An
overwhelming
majority
of
voters
opted
for
closer
ties
with
Russia
over
integration
into
the
European
Union
.
They
also
said
they
preferred
the
independence
of
Gagauzia
if
Moldova
chooses
to
enter
the
EU
.
