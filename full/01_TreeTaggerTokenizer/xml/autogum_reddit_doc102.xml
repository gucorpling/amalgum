Child
support

<sp who="#lifeinabag">
<p>
I
am
assisting
my
spouse
in
trying
to
get
a
divorce
from
her
ex
.
I
will
summarize
the
key
points
and
hopefully
that
will
suffice
.
first
of
all
my
lady
is
an
incredible
woman
who
has
been
through
some
incredibly
painful
and
difficult
stuff
as
you
will
read
below
.
She
needs
to
put
this
chapter
behind
her
.
Her
and
her
ex
got
together
in
2005
,
he
had
a
pre
exisiting
son
age
1
at
the
time
.
Sons
mother
was
a
drug
addict
and
not
present
.
Her
ex
was
diagnosed
with
lymphoma
,
the
got
married
very
quickly
to
protect
the
son
if
something
happened
to
his
father
.
Almost
immediately
the
ex
was
having
a
crisis
with
his
diagnosis
and
went
and
cheated
with
an
underage
girl
.
Because
of
the
situation
she
decided
to
try
and
move
forward
and
to
carry
on
.
she
spent
the
next
7
years
caring
for
little
boy
and
very
sick
father.
.
Running
a
small
business
and
ensuring
he
made
all
his
appointments
etc.
Because
of
one
of
his
treatments
he
ended
up
with
some
fairly
significant
brain
injury
,
ie
short
term
memory
problems
,
trouble
separating
reality
and
his
dreams
,
has
some
very
strange
ideas
etc.
She
stayed
in
the
relationship
for
the
sake
of
the
son
,
and
finally
once
the
father
had
recovered
(
as
much
as
possible
)
she
realized
that
being
in
a
loveless
relationship
with
someone
with
his
issues
was
n't
something
she
could
do
anymore
.
They
separated
in
2016
,
because
the
father
was
basically
unable
to
care
for
himself
,
let
alone
his
son
.
The
boy
continued
to
live
with
my
lady
until
just
recently
.
He
's
been
having
behavioral
issues
at
age
14
and
has
decided
he
wants
to
live
with
his
father
and
grandparents
.
This
has
naturally
been
heartbreaking
for
her
but
shes
accepted
that
it
may
be
the
best
until
he
gets
past
his
issues
.
The
two
years
that
she
was
the
primary
residence
for
the
boy
she
declined
child
support
from
the
father
as
he
is
low
income
.
Now
that
the
boy
is
back
with
his
father
,
he
has
declined
any
child
support
as
well
.
The
issue
we
're
running
into
,
is
that
she
is
trying
to
file
an
uncontested
divorce
.
we
're
filling
out
the
forms
ourselves
and
it
asks
about
child
support
arrangements
.
We
've
just
put
in
that
they
have
a
verbal
agreement
that
there
shall
be
no
support
regardless
of
who
is
primarily
parenting
.
We
've
read
that
the
judge
could
deny
the
divorce
because
of
this
.
So
we
're
hoping
someone
can
tell
us
if
that
is
likely
given
the
situation
,
we
need
to
get
this
divorce
over
with
to
move
forward
with
out
lives
.
Any
advice
appreciated
.

You
100
%
need
a
lawyer
for
this
.
The
principles
under
both
the
Divorce
Act
and
the
BC
Family
Law
Act
make
it
clear
that
child
support
is
a
right
of
the
child
.
Just
because
two
people
agree
not
to
pay
money
toward
child
support
,
it
does
n't
affect
the
entitlement
of
a
child
to
support
.
The
only
consideration
when
analyzing
support
are
the
best
interests
of
the
child
.
</p>
<p>
Because
your
partner
has
significantly
stepped
into
the
role
of
a
parent
,
she
can
be
found
liable
for
support
under
both
the
Divorce
Act
and
the
BC
Family
Law
Act
.
She
needs
a
lawyer
to
help
figure
out
what
's
in
her
best
interests
in
terms
of
custody
arrangements
and
support
obligations
as
a
whole
.
This
can
also
be
affected
by
any
uneven
property
distribution
under
the
Family
Law
Act
.
