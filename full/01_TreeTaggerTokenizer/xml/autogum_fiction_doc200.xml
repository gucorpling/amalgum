WHITE
ROSES
IN
A
LAW-OFFICE
</head>
<p>
As
upon
a
world
canopied
with
storm
,
hung
with
mourning
purple
and
habited
in
black
,
did
Mr.
Flitcroft
turn
his
morning
face
at
eight
o'clock
antemeridian
Monday
,
as
he
hied
himself
to
his
daily
duty
at
the
Washington
National
Bank
.
Yet
more
than
the
merely
funereal
gloomed
out
from
the
hillocky
area
of
his
countenance
.
Was
there
not
,
i'faith
,
a
glow
,
a
Vesuvian
shimmer
,
beneath
the
murk
of
that
darkling
eye
?
Was
here
one
,
think
you
,
to
turn
the
other
cheek
?
Little
has
he
learned
of
Norbert
Flitcroft
who
conceives
that
this
fiery
spirit
was
easily
to
be
quenched
!
Look
upon
the
jowl
of
him
,
and
let
him
who
dares
maintain
that
people
--
even
the
very
Pikes
themselves
--
were
to
grind
beneath
their
brougham
wheels
a
prostrate
Norbert
and
ride
on
scatheless
!
In
this
his
own
metaphor
is
nearly
touched
&quot;
I
guess
not
!
They
do
n't
run
over
ME
!
Martin
Pike
better
look
out
how
he
tries
it
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
So
Mother
Nature
at
her
kindly
tasks
,
good
Norbert
,
uses
for
her
unguent
our
own
perfect
inconsistency
:
and
often
when
we
are
stabbed
deep
in
the
breast
she
distracts
us
by
thin
scratches
in
other
parts
,
that
in
the
itch
of
these
we
may
forget
the
greater
hurt
till
it
be
healed
.
Thus
,
the
remembrance
of
last
night
,
when
you
undisguisedly
ran
from
the
wrath
of
a
Pike
,
with
a
pretty
girl
looking
on
(
to
say
nothing
of
the
acrid
Arp
,
who
will
fling
the
legend
on
a
thousand
winds
)
,
might
well
agonize
you
now
,
as
,
in
less
hasty
moments
and
at
a
safe
distance
,
you
brood
upon
the
piteous
figure
you
cut
.
On
the
contrary
,
behold
:
you
see
no
blood
crimsoning
the
edges
of
the
horrid
gash
in
your
panoply
of
self-esteem
:
you
but
smart
and
scratch
the
scratches
,
forgetting
your
wound
in
the
hot
itch
for
vengeance
.
It
is
an
itch
which
will
last
(
for
in
such
matters
your
temper
shall
be
steadfast
)
,
and
let
the
great
Goliath
in
the
mean
time
beware
of
you
!
You
ran
,
last
night
.
You
ran
--
of
course
you
ran
.
Why
not
?
You
ran
to
fight
another
day
!

A
bank
clerk
sometimes
has
opportunities
.
</p>
<p>
The
stricken
fat
one
could
not
understand
how
it
came
about
that
he
had
blurted
out
the
damning
confession
that
he
had
visited
Beaver
Beach
.
When
he
tried
to
solve
the
puzzle
,
his
mind
refused
the
strain
,
became
foggy
and
the
terrors
of
his
position
acute
.
Was
he
,
like
Joe
Louden
,
to
endure
the
ban
of
Canaan
,
and
like
him
stand
excommunicate
beyond
the
pale
because
of
Martin
Pike
's
displeasure
?
For
Norbert
saw
with
perfect
clearness
to-day
what
the
Judge
had
done
for
Joe
.
Now
that
he
stood
in
danger
of
a
fate
identical
,
this
came
home
to
him
.
How
many
others
,
he
wondered
,
would
do
as
Mamie
had
done
and
write
notes
such
as
he
had
received
by
the
hand
of
Sam
Warden
,
late
last
night
?
</p>
<p>
&quot;
DEAR
SIR
.
&quot;
(
This
from
Mamie
,
who
,
in
the
Canaanitish
way
,
had
been
wont
to
address
him
as
&quot;
Norb
&quot;
!
)
--
&quot;My
father
wishes
me
to
state
that
after
your
remark
yesterday
afternoon
on
the
steps
which
was
overheard
by
my
mother
who
happened
to
be
standing
in
the
hall
behind
you
and
your
BEHAVIOR
to
himself
later
on
--
he
considers
it
impossible
to
allow
you
to
call
any
more
or
to
speak
to
any
member
of
his
household
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Yours
respectfully
,
&quot;
MAMIE
PIKE
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Erasures
and
restorations
bore
witness
to
a
considerable
doubt
in
Mamie
's
mind
concerning
&quot;
Yours
respectfully
,
&quot;
but
she
had
finally
let
it
stand
,
evidently
convinced
that
the
plain
signature
,
without
preface
,
savored
of
an
intimacy
denied
by
the
context
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
'
DEAR
SIR
'
!
&quot;
repeated
Norbert
,
between
set
teeth
.
&quot;
'
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
ALLOW
YOU
TO
CALL
any
more
'
!
&quot;
These
and
other
terms
of
his
dismissal
recurred
to
him
during
the
morning
,
and
ever
and
anon
he
looked
up
from
his
desk
,
his
lips
moving
to
the
tune
of
those
horrid
phrases
,
and
stared
out
at
the
street
.
Basilisk
glaring
this
,
with
no
Christian
softness
in
it
,
not
even
when
it
fell
upon
his
own
grandfather
,
sitting
among
the
sages
within
easy
eye-shot
from
the
big
window
at
Norbert
's
elbow
.
However
,
Colonel
Flitcroft
was
not
disturbed
by
the
gaze
of
his
descendant
,
being
,
in
fact
,
quite
unaware
of
it
.
The
aged
men
were
having
a
busy
morning
.
</p>
<p>
The
conclave
was
not
what
it
had
been
.
[
See
Arp
and
all
his
works
.
]
There
had
come
,
as
the
years
went
by
,
a
few
recruits
;
but
faces
were
missing
:
the
two
Tabors
had
gone
,
and
Uncle
Joe
Davey
could
no
longer
lay
claim
to
the
patriarchship
;
he
had
laid
it
down
with
a
half-sigh
and
gone
his
way
.
Eskew
himself
was
now
the
oldest
of
the
conscript
fathers
,
the
Colonel
and
Squire
Buckalew
pressing
him
closely
,
with
Peter
Bradbury
no
great
time
behind
.
</p>
<p>
To-day
they
did
not
plant
their
feet
upon
the
brass
rail
inside
the
hotel
windows
,
but
courted
the
genial
weather
out-doors
,
and
,
as
their
summer
custom
was
,
tilted
back
their
chairs
in
the
shade
of
the
western
wall
of
the
building
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
And
who
could
of
dreamed
,
&quot;
Mr.
Bradbury
was
saying
,
with
a
side-glance
of
expectancy
at
Eskew
,
&quot;
that
Jonas
Tabor
would
ever
turn
out
to
have
a
niece
like
that
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Mr.
Arp
ceased
to
fan
himself
with
his
wide
straw
hat
and
said
grimly
:
