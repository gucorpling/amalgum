The
comparison
of
orthomosaics
obtained
from
UAV
images
,
repeated
annually
,
can
be
a
very
useful
tool
for
monitoring
the
variation
of
the
boulder
positions
.
This
methodology
has
been
successfully
applied
in
both
North
Atlantic
and
Mediterranean
boulder
sites
.
UAV-derived
orthophotographs
and
digital
surface
models
(
DSMs
)
can
provide
excellent
data
and
information
on
coastal
boulder
patterns
.
Orthophotographs
allow
for
the
mapping
of
a
axes
and
b
axes
,
including
their
orientation
,
whereas
precise
values
for
c
axes
and
boulder
volume
can
be
taken
from
the
DSM
.
In
recent
years
,
after
an
initial
decade
when
the
analyses
were
mostly
dedicated
to
explaining
boulder
detachment
and
transport
mechanisms
and
distinguishing
between
those
of
tsunamigenic
and
those
of
storm
origin
,
boulder
studies
are
now
more
oriented
towards
the
observation
of
boulder
movements
and
reassemblage
after
exceptional
storm
events
.
In
addition
,
Hastewell
et
al.
have
proposed
an
innovative
technique
for
boulder
movement
reconstruction
,
using
radio
frequency
Identification
(
RFID
)
tagging
and
DGNNS
technology
.
A
single
RFID
tag
is
inserted
inside
a
boulder
and
can
be
activated
with
an
electromagnetic
signal
emitted
by
a
pole
antenna
moved
by
an
operator
also
equipped
with
a
backpack
reader
and
a
handheld
computer
.

<p>
On
the
Premantura
Promontory
,
where
the
origin
of
the
boulders
has
been
ascribed
to
storm
events
,
totally
excluding
those
of
tsunami
origin
,
and
where
boulders
analysis
began
only
recently
(
end
of
2016
)
,
a
proper
monitoring
network
including
orthophotograph
comparison
,
both
aerial
and
submarine
,
geomorphological
observation
,
instrumental
monitoring
techniques
,
and
numerical
modeling
,
is
most
definitely
needed
as
severe
storms
are
forecast
to
increase
in
the
near
future
.
</p>
<p>
Following
the
long-term
monitoring
experience
of
coastal
landslides
affecting
the
northwestern
part
of
Malta
,
a
network
of
GNSS
benchmarks
has
also
been
installed
in
Premantura
.
At
the
same
time
,
the
submarine
3D
model
,
presented
here
,
could
be
the
starting
point
for
monitoring
the
effects
of
future
storms
in
the
underwater
environment
,
that
represents
the
source
area
for
the
quarrying
and
detachment
of
future
boulders
.
Finally
,
every
day
since
early
2019
,
the
AdriSC
operational
component
has
been
providing
a
48
h
forecast
of
high-resolution
wave
parameters
,
which
can
be
used
to
detect
in
advance
whether
or
not
a
potential
storm
can
move
boulders
.
</p>
<p>
By
comparing
UAV-derived
orthophotographs
,
we
detected
the
movement
of
13
boulders
and
the
emplacement
of
a
new
one
after
a
severe
storm
.
The
western
part
of
the
boulder
field
suffered
the
intensity
of
the
last
storm
most
,
whereas
the
central
and
eastern
part
did
not
show
any
evidence
of
boulder
movements
.
This
lack
of
movement
is
related
to
the
structural
setting
of
the
promontory
,
where
,
in
the
central
and
eastern
sectors
the
boulders
(
probably
older
)
are
located
at
higher
elevations
.
Thus
,
active
erosion
occurs
in
the
western
part
of
the
Jugo
Promontory
(
Cape
Kamenjak
)
.
</p>
<p>
By
observing
boulder
movements
(
<figure>
Figure

</figure>
)
,
the
maximum
inundation
flow
of
the
storm
waves
capable
of
transporting
boulders
was
estimated
to
about
50
m
of
distance
from
the
coast
(
that
has
been
measured
considering
wave
directions
and
orientation
of
the
limestone
ramps
)
.
The
displacement
followed
the
azimuth
of
the
limestone
beds
strikes
that
,
in
turn
,
have
conditioned
the
detachment
of
rocky
material
forming
scarps
throughout
the
past
.
These
scarps
,
together
with
flat
,
gently
inclined
limestone
bedding
planes
(
pavements
)
,
have
acted
as
ramps
for
boulder
transport
.
Isolated
boulders
,
such
as
boulder
#1
(
K8
in
)
,
are
those
that
have
been
subject
to
the
largest
movements
,
while
the
boulders
gathered
in
clusters
were
only
rotated
or
toppled
,
but
remained
in
position
,
trapped
by
other
boulders
or
the
abovementioned
scarps
,
fractures
,
and
faults
.
The
latter
,
in
particular
,
have
been
enlarged
over
time
by
coastal
karst
and
marine
weathering
,
as
well
as
by
the
removal
of
small
portions
of
rocky
material
.
Some
boulders
exhibited
signs
of
fragmentation
,
due
to
collisions
with
other
boulders
or
against
the
rocky
scarps
.
</p>
<p>
The
submerged
scenario
,
accurately
obtained
using
digital
photogrammetric
reconstructions
,
is
a
high
energy
environment
,
with
fresh
detachment
scarps
and
rounded
or
sub-rounded
potholes
,
where
decimetric
cobbles
and
boulders
lie
and
move
,
causing
the
abrasion
of
the
rocky
seafloor
.
The
topographical
setting
of
the
seafloor
reflects
the
coastal
geomorphology
and
topography
,
where
limestone
beds
alternate
with
scarps
and
faults
.
With
respect
to
the
previous
underwater
geomorphological
surveying
,
any
recent
detachment
scar
has
been
noted
,
while
a
clear
detachment
niche
has
been
reconstructed
in
detail
.
The
3D
submarine
model
obtained
,
reconstructed
using
digital
photogrammetric
analysis
of
underwater
pictures
,
will
be
the
starting
point
for
future
monitoring
of
the
submerged
environment
,
both
before
and
after
exceptional
storms
,
that
may
affect
the
Adriatic
Sea
even
more
given
the
future
climate
predictions
.
