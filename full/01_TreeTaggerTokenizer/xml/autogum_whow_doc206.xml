Handle
an
Aggressive
Child
</head>
<p>
If
a
child
repeatedly
acts
aggressively
,
you
might
wonder
“
What
am
I
doing
wrong
?
”
Instead
of
getting
down
on
yourself
about
a
child
's
tendency
to
shout
,
hit
,
or
push
,
use
the
problem
as
a
benchmark
for
teaching
the
child
more
appropriate
ways
to
behave
.
Be
sure
not
to
respond
to
their
aggression
with
your
own
.
Keep
your
cool
and
show
the
child
how
to
problem-solve
common
situations
and
express
themselves
using
assertiveness
.

Reacting
to
Aggression
</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Stay
calm
.
Resist
the
urge
to
behave
aggressively
yourself
.
Take
a
few
deep
breaths
or
silently
count
to
10
to
maintain
your
composure
.

When
you
are
in
control
of
your
own
emotional
reaction
,
the
child
can
look
to
your
example
for
managing
tough
situations
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Remove
the
child
from
the
environment
.
Break
aggressive
behaviors
by
making
the
child
leave
the
situation
.
For
example
,
if
they
are
playing
rough
with
siblings
,
make
them
take
a
timeout
.
<figure rend="Handle an Aggressive Child Step 2.jpg">
</figure>
<list type="unordered">
<item>
If
they
act
up
in
the
grocery
store
,
leave
.
If
you
're
shopping
with
a
companion
,
have
that
person
escort
them
outside
.
</item>
<item>
If
the
child
purposefully
uses
aggression
to
get
out
of
undesirable
activities
or
situations
,
use
another
approach
.
Do
n't
allow
them
to
leave
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Do
n’t
spank
the
child
.
Because
you
're
trying
to
instill
the
idea
that
aggression
is
n't
the
solution
,
avoid
spanking
an
aggressive
child
.
Instead
,
use
consequences
that
help
them
actually
learn
from
their
mistakes
and
inspire
better
behavior
in
the
future
.

For
instance
,
you
might
have
the
aggressive
child
repeat
writing
a
sentence
,
like
“
I
will
not
push
in
line
.
I
will
keep
my
hands
to
myself
and
wait
until
my
turn
.
”
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Set
clear
limits
and
adhere
to
clear
consequences
.
Be
sure
the
child
knows
what
's
expected
of
them
by
explaining
the
rules
.
Post
them
in
a
common
area
,
such
as
on
the
refrigerator
or
in
the
common
room
.
When
the
child
breaks
a
rule
,
calmly
state
what
they
did
wrong
and
the
consequence
for
their
acting
out
.
<figure rend="Handle an Aggressive Child Step 4.jpg">

Say
something
like
,
“
We
do
n't
kick
one
another
,
Bryan
.
Because
you
kicked
your
brother
,
you
wo
n't
be
allowed
to
finish
watching
the
show
.
Go
to
your
room
and
read
a
book

Be
consistent
with
discipline
.
Across
situations
and
caregivers
,
it
's
important
to
maintain
consistency
.
Do
n't
overlook
aggressive
behaviors
at
home
,
but
discipline
the
child
when
they
occur
in
public
.
Similarly
,
if
one
parent
sets
a
rule
or
consequences
for
aggression
,
the
other
parent
needs
to
get
on
board
also
.

If
you
do
n't
consistently
stop
and
address
aggressive
behavior
,
the
child
wo
n't
be
motivated
(
or
reminded
)
to
change
it
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Take
a
timeout
to
regulate
your
own
emotions
if
the
child
hurts
you
.
If
you
get
caught
in
the
middle
of
the
child
's
aggression
,
take
a
moment
to
take
care
of
yourself
.
Tell
the
child
&quot;
Ow
,
you
hurt
me
!
I
will
talk
to
you
once
I
've
calmed
down
.
&quot;
Then
,
go
into
another
room
,
nurse
your
wounds
,
and
calm
down
before
enforcing
any
consequences
.

It

easy
to
respond
unfavorably
if
the
aggressive
child
has
caused
you
physical
pain

that
starts
a
cycle
of
violence

pause
and

for
something

Let
the

run
in
the
park

do
jumping
jacks

or
play
Frisbee
with
the
dog
to
release
aggressive

Some

more
frequent

Look
for
patterns
in
their
aggression

Most
kids
act
out
in
the
same
ways
over
and
over
again

Spotting
these
recurring
patterns
can
help

get
to
the
core
problem

For
instance
,
maybe
the
adolescent
is
more
likely
to
push
and
hit
when
they
are
feeling
scared

Perhaps
the
toddler
kicks
when
they
are
tired

Noticing
the
context

aggressive
behavior
can

fear

Get
feedback

Coordinate
with

caregivers

teachers

witness
aggressive
behavior

Talking

clue
you
in

cause

the
behaviors

For

maybe
the
child
has
been
acting
out
at
school
.
If
the
behaviors
are
n't
happening
at
home
or
in
other
environments
,
you
may
need
to
work
with
the
school
to
address
the
root
cause
,
which
could
be
bullying
or
even
a
learning
delay

See
a
therapist
.
If
you
feel
stumped
about
handling
the
aggressive
child
,
consider
seeing
a
professional
.
They
can
work
with
the
child
to
figure
out
the
unmet
underlying
need
that
leads
to
aggression
.
They
can
also
teach
you
more
positive
parenting
practices
to
curb
aggressive
behavior
in
the
child
.
