The
Thousand
Guilders
</head>
<p>
None
seeing
the
humble
supper
eaten
in
the
Brinker
cottage
that
night
would
have
dreamed
of
the
dainty
repast
hidden
away
nearby
.
Hans
and
Gretel
looked
rather
wistfully
toward
the
cupboard
as
they
drank
their
cupful
of
water
and
ate
their
scanty
share
of
black
bread
;
but
even
in
thought
they
did
not
rob
their
father
.
</p>
<p>
“
He
relished
his
supper
well
,
”
said
Dame
Brinker
,
nodding
sidewise
toward
the
bed
,
“
and
fell
asleep
the
next
moment
.
Ah
,
the
dear
man
will
be
feeble
for
many
a
day
.
He
wanted
sore
to
sit
up
again
,
but
while
I
made
show
of
humoring
him
and
getting
ready
,
he
dropped
off
.
Remember
that
,
my
girl
,
when
you
have
a
man
of
your
own
(
and
many
a
day
may
it
be
before
that
comes
to
pass
)
,
remember
that
you
can
never
rule
by
differing
;
‘
humble
wife
is
husband
’s
boss
.
’
Tut
!
tut
!
Never
swallow
such
a
mouthful
as
that
again
,
child
.
Why
,
I
could
make
a
meal
off
two
such
pieces
.
What
’s
in
thee
,
Hans
?
One
would
think
there
were
cobwebs
on
the
walls
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Oh
,
no
,
Mother
,
I
was
only
thinking
--
”
</p>
<p>
“
Thinking
about
what
?
Ah
,
no
use
asking
,
”
she
added
in
a
changed
tone
.
“
I
was
thinking
of
the
same
a
while
ago
.
Well
,
it
’s
no
blame
if
we
DID
look
to
hear
something
by
this
time
about
the
thousand
guilders
but
not
a
word
--
no
--
it
’s
plain
enough
he
knows
naught
about
them
.
”
</p>
<p>
Hans
looked
up
anxiously
,
dreading
lest
his
mother
should
grow
agitated
,
as
usual
,
when
speaking
of
the
lost
money
,
but
she
was
silently
nibbling
her
bread
and
looking
with
a
doleful
stare
toward
the
window
.
</p>
<p>
“
Thousand
guilders
,
”
echoed
a
faint
voice
from
the
bed
.
“
Ah
,
I
am
sure
they
have
been
of
good
use
to
you
,
vrouw
,
through
the
long
years
when
your
man
was
idle
.
”
</p>
<p>
The
poor
woman
started
up
.
These
words
quite
destroyed
the
hope
that
of
late
had
been
glowing
within
her
.
</p>
<p>
“
Are
you
awake
,
Raff
?
”
she
faltered
.
</p>
<p>
“
Yes
,
Meitje
,
and
I
feel
much
better
.
Our
money
was
well
saved
,
vrouw
,
I
was
saying
.
Did
it
last
through
all
those
ten
years
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
--
I
--
have
not
got
it
,
Raff
,
I
--
”
She
was
going
to
tell
him
the
whole
truth
when
Hans
lifted
his
finger
warningly
and
whispered
,
“
Remember
what
the
meester
told
us
.
The
father
must
not
be
worried
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Speak
to
him
,
child
,
”
she
answered
,
trembling
.
</p>
<p>
Hans
hurried
to
the
bedside
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
am
glad
you
are
feeling
better
,
”
he
said
,
leaning
over
his
father
.
“
Another
day
will
see
you
quite
strong
again
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Aye
,
like
enough
.
How
long
did
the
money
last
,
Hans
?
I
could
not
hear
your
mother
.
What
did
she
say
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
said
,
Raff
,
”
stammered
Dame
Brinker
in
great
distress
,
“
that
it
was
all
gone
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Well
,
well
,
wife
,
do
not
fret
at
that
;
one
thousand
guilders
is
not
so
very
much
for
ten
years
and
with
children
to
bring
up
...
but
it
has
helped
to
make
you
all
comfortable
.
Have
you
had
much
sickness
to
bear
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
No
,
no
,
”
sobbed
Dame
Brinker
,
lifting
her
apron
to
her
eyes
.
</p>
<p>
“
Tut
,
tut
,
woman
,
why
do
you
cry
?
”
said
Raff
kindly
.
“
We
will
soon
fill
another
pouch
when
I
am
on
my
feet
again
.
Lucky
I
told
you
all
about
it
before
I
fell
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Told
me
what
,
man
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Why
,
that
I
buried
the
money
.
In
my
dream
just
now
,
it
seemed
that
I
had
never
said
aught
about
it
.
”
</p>
<p>
Dame
Brinker
started
forward
.
Hans
caught
her
arm
.
</p>
<p>
“
Hist
!
Mother
,
”
he
whispered
,
hastily
leading
her
away
,
“
we
must
be
very
careful
.
”
Then
,
while
she
stood
with
clasped
hands
waiting
in
breathless
anxiety
,
he
once
more
approached
the
cot
.
Trembling
with
eagerness
he
said
,
“
That
was
a
troublesome
dream
.
Do
you
remember
WHEN
you
buried
the
money
,
Father
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Yes
,
my
boy
.
It
was
just
before
daylight
on
the
same
day
I
was
hurt
.
Jan
Kamphuisen
said
something
,
the
sundown
before
,
that
made
me
distrust
his
honesty
.
He
was
the
only
one
living
besides
Mother
who
knew
that
we
had
saved
a
thousand
guilders
,
so
I
rose
up
that
night
and
buried
the
money
--
blockhead
that
I
was
ever
to
suspect
an
old
friend
!
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
’ll
be
bound
,
Father
,
”
pursued
Hans
in
a
laughing
voice
,
motioning
to
his
mother
and
Gretel
to
remain
quiet
,
“
that
you
’ve
forgotten
where
you
buried
it
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Ha
!
ha
!
Not
I
,
indeed
.
But
good
night
,
my
son
,
I
can
sleep
again
.
”
</p>
<p>
Hans
would
have
walked
away
,
but
his
mother
’s
gestures
were
not
to
be
disobeyed
.
So
he
said
gently
,
“
Good
night
,
Father
.
Where
did
you
say
you
buried
the
money
?
I
was
only
a
little
one
then
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Close
by
the
willow
sapling
behind
the
cottage
,
”
said
Raff
Brinker
drowsily
.
</p>
<p>
“
Ah
,
yes
.
North
side
of
the
tree
,
was
n’t
it
,
Father
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
No
,
the
south
side
.
Ah
,
you
know
the
spot
well
enough
,
you
rogue
.
Like
enough
you
were
there
when
your
mother
lifted
it
.
Now
,
son
,
easy
.
Shift
this
pillow
so
.
Good
night
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Good
night
,
Father
!
”
said
Hans
,
ready
to
dance
for
joy
.
</p>
<p>
The
moon
rose
very
late
that
night
,
shining
in
,
full
and
clear
,
at
the
little
window
,
but
its
beams
did
not
disturb
Raff
Brinker
.
He
slept
soundly
;
so
did
Gretel
.
As
for
Hans
and
his
mother
,
they
had
something
else
to
do
.
</p>
<p>
After
making
a
few
hurried
preparations
,
they
stole
forth
with
bright
,
expectant
faces
,
bearing
a
broken
spade
and
a
rusty
implement
that
had
done
many
a
day
’s
service
when
Raff
was
a
hale
worker
on
the
dikes
.
