<p>
Luna
's
Mexican
restaurant
has
no
address
.
It
is
on
no
particular
street
,
at
no
particular
corner
;
even
its
habitues
,
its
most
enthusiastic
devotees
,
are
unable
to
locate
it
upon
demand
.
It
is
&quot;
over
there
in
the
quarter
,
&quot;
&quot;
not
far
from
the
cathedral
there
.
&quot;
One
could
find
it
if
one
started
out
with
that
intent
;
but
to
direct
another
there
--
no
,
that
is
out
of
the
question
.
It
CAN
be
reached
by
following
the
alleys
of
Chinatown
.
You
will
come
out
of
the
last
alley
--
the
one
where
the
slave
girls
are
--
upon
the
edge
of
the
Mexican
quarter
,
and
by
going
straight
forward
a
block
or
two
and
by
keeping
a
sharp
lookout
to
right
and
left
you
will
hit
upon
it
.
It
is
always
to
be
searched
for
.
Always
to
be
discovered
.
</p>
<p>
On
that
particular
Monday
evening
Blix
and
Condy
arrived
at
Luna
's
some
fifteen
minutes
before
seven
.
Condy
had
lost
himself
and
all
sense
of
direction
in
the
strange
streets
of
the
quarter
,
and
they
were
on
the
very
brink
of
despair
when
Blix
discovered
the
sign
upon
an
opposite
corner
.
</p>
<p>
As
Condy
had
foretold
,
they
had
the
place
to
themselves
.
They
went
into
the
back
room
with
its
one
mirror
,
six
tables
,
and
astonishing
curtains
of
Nottingham
lace
;
and
the
waiter
,
whose
name
was
Richard
or
Riccardo
,
according
to
taste
,
began
to
officiate
at
the
solemn
rites
of
the
&quot;
supper
Mexican
.
&quot;
Condy
and
Blix
ate
with
their
eyes
continually
wandering
to
the
door
;
and
as
the
FRIJOLES
were
being
served
,
started
simultaneously
and
exchanged
glances
.
</p>
<p>
A
man
wearing
two
marguerites
in
the
lapel
of
his
coat
had
entered
abruptly
,
and
sat
down
to
a
table
close
at
hand
.
</p>
<p>
Condy
drew
a
breath
of
suppressed
excitement
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
There
he
is
,
&quot;
he
whispered
--
&quot;Captain
Jack
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
They
looked
at
the
newcomer
with
furtive
anxiety
,
and
told
themselves
that
they
were
disappointed
.
For
a
retired
sea
captain
he
was
desperately
commonplace
.
His
hair
was
red
,
he
was
younger
than
they
had
expected
,
and
,
worst
of
all
,
he
did
look
tough
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Oh
,
poor
K.
D.
B.
!
&quot;
sighed
Blix
,
shaking
her
head
.
&quot;
He
'll
never
do
,
I
'm
afraid
.
Perhaps
he
has
a
good
heart
,
though
;
red-headed
people
are
SOMETIMES
affectionate
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
They
are
impulsive
,
&quot;
hazarded
Condy
.
</p>
<p>
As
he
spoke
the
words
,
a
second
man
entered
the
little
room
.
He
,
too
,
sat
down
at
a
nearby
table
.
He
,
too
,
ordered
the
&quot;
supper
Mexican
.
&quot;
He
,
too
,
wore
marguerites
in
his
buttonhole
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Death
and
destruction
!
&quot;
gasped
Condy
,
turning
pale
.
</p>
<p>
Blix
collapsed
helplessly
in
her
chair
,
her
hands
dropping
in
her
lap
.
They
stared
at
each
other
in
utter
confusion
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Here
's
a
how-do-you-do
,
&quot;
murmured
Condy
,
pretending
to
strip
a
TAMALE
that
Richard
had
just
set
before
him
.
But
Blix
had
pushed
hers
aside
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
What
does
it
mean
?
&quot;
whispered
Condy
across
the
table
.
&quot;
In
Heaven
's
name
,
what
does
it
mean
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
It
can
only
mean
one
thing
,
&quot;
Blix
declared
;
&quot;
one
of
them
is
the
captain
,
and
one
is
a
coincidence
.
Anybody
might
wear
a
marguerite
;
we
ought
to
have
thought
of
that
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
But
which
is
which
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
If
K.
D.
B.
should
come
now
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
But
the
last
man
looks
more
like
the
captain
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
last
man
was
a
sturdy
,
broad-shouldered
fellow
,
who
might
have
been
forty
.
His
heavy
mustache
was
just
touched
with
gray
,
and
he
did
have
a
certain
vaguely
&quot;
sober
and
industrious
&quot;
appearance
.
But
the
difference
between
the
two
men
was
slight
,
after
all
;
the
red-headed
man
could
easily
have
been
a
sea
captain
,
and
he
certainly
was
over
thirty-five
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Which
?
which
?
which
?
--
how
can
we
tell
?
We
might
think
of
some
way
to
get
rid
of
the
coincidence
,
if
we
could
only
tell
which
the
coincidence
was
.
We
owe
it
to
K.
D.
B.
In
a
way
,
Condy
,
it
's
our
duty
.
We
brought
her
here
,
or
we
are
going
to
,
and
we
ought
to
help
her
all
we
can
;
and
she
may
be
here
at
any
moment
.
What
time
is
it
now
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Five
minutes
after
seven
.
But
,
Blix
,
I
should
think
the
right
one
--
the
captain
--
would
be
all
put
out
himself
by
seeing
another
chap
here
wearing
marguerites
.
Does
either
one
of
'
em
seem
put
out
to
you
?
Look
.
I
should
think
the
captain
,
whichever
one
he
is
,
would
kind
of
GLARE
at
the
coincidence
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Stealthily
they
studied
the
two
men
for
a
moment
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
No
,
no
,
&quot;
murmured
Blix
,
&quot;
you
ca
n't
tell
.
Neither
of
them
seems
to
glare
much
.
Oh
,
Condy&quot;
--
her
voice
dropped
to
a
faint
whisper
.
&quot;
The
red-headed
one
has
put
his
hat
on
a
chair
,
just
behind
him
,
notice
?
Do
you
suppose
if
you
stood
up
you
could
see
inside
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
What
good
would
that
do
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
He
might
have
his
initials
inside
the
crown
,
or
his
whole
name
even
;
and
you
could
see
if
he
had
a
'
captain
'
before
it
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Condy
made
a
pretence
of
rising
to
get
a
match
in
a
ribbed
,
truncated
cone
of
china
that
stood
upon
an
adjacent
table
,
and
Blix
held
her
breath
as
he
glanced
down
into
the
depths
of
the
hat
.
He
resumed
his
seat
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Only
initials
,
&quot;
he
breathed
--
&quot;W
.
J.
A.
It
might
be
Jack
,
that
J.
,
and
it
might
be
Joe
,
or
Jeremiah
,
or
Joshua
;
and
even
if
he
was
a
captain
he
might
not
use
the
title
.
We
're
no
better
off
than
we
were
before
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
And
K.
D.
B.
may
come
at
any
moment
.
Maybe
she
has
come
already
and
looked
through
the
windows
,
and
saw
TWO
men
with
marguerites
and
went
away
.
She
'd
be
just
that
timid
.
What
can
we
do
?
