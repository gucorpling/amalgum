within
the
city
.

The
bus
ride
is
comfortable
,
scenic
and
takes
about
an
hour
and
a
half
(
depending
on
traffic
)
.
Upon

in
Tepoztlan
,
the
bus
may
drop

a
red
metal
guard
rail
across
from
the
bus
station
.

Get
around
</head>
<p>
Tepoztlan
is
a
small
quaint
town
and
is
easily
walkable
.
Most
of
the
activity
is
centered
around
its
main
square
and
along
the
main
avenue
,
Avenida
5
de
mayo
.
There
is
local
bus
service
to
surrounding
towns
.
</p>
<head>

</head>
<p>
There
is
an
archeological
site
at
the
top
of
an
easy-hikeable
mountain
(
assuming
you
are
in
decent
shape
--
there
are
400m
of
stairs
)
that
is
also
famous
for
its
&quot;
good
vibrations
&quot;
.
The
hike
can
take
up
to
2
hours
depending
on
your
fitness
level
.
The
pyramid
,
<hi rend="bold">
El
Tepozteco
</hi>
,
offers
wonderful
views
of
the
surrounding
area
.
The
site
may
be
reached
by
walking
down
Avenida
5
de
mayo
(
in
the
direction
away
from
where
you
entered
the
town
)
.
Continue
until
the
street
ends
to
the
steps
which
mark
the
beginning
of
the
trail
.
Make
sure
to
bring
water
with
you
.
The
hike
to
the
top
is
free
but
it
will
cost
M$
37
(
in
2010
)
to
access
the
pyramid
.
At
the
top
you
will
also
encounter
coati
,
also
known
as
a
tejón
.
These
animals
,
members
of
the
raccoon
family
,
are
curious
and
will
attempt
to
open
backpacks
to
find
food
.
</p>
<p>
There
is
also
a
beautiful
former
convent
called
<hi rend="bold">
Dominico
de
la
Navidad
</hi>
.
It
has
been
restored
and
entrance
is
free
.
It
is
located
right
off
the
main
square
.
</p>
<p>
If
you
are
curious
about
it
,
the
locals
claim
UFO
sightings
are
common
,
which
mostly
just
adds
to
the
&quot;
new
age
&quot;
vibe
of
the
town
.
Ask
about
the
&quot;
ovni
&quot;
to
hear
strange
tales
.

Temazcal
</hi>
is
an
ancient
Mexican
therapy
that
consists
of
a
little
igloo-shape
room
in
which
a
group
of
people
enter
and
medicinal
plants
are
burned
inside
it
and
the
place
gets
really
warm
.
A
guide
asks
people
to
sing
ancient
songs
to
make
the
experience
more
complete
.
Many
hotels
have
this
option
either
in
groups
or
individual
.
