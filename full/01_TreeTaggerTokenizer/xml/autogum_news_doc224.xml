summarized
two
reports
conducted
by
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_Nations">
UN
</ref>
concluding
that
the
Israeli
occupation
of
the
West
Bank
and
other
territories
is
illegal
and
&quot;
a
breach
of
the
fourth
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva%20Convention">

.
&quot;
This
is
not
the
first
time
that
the
UN
has
condemned
Israeli
breach
of
the
convention
,
but
this
comes
at
a
crucial
time
when
Israeli
blockades
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip">
Gaza
Strip
</ref>
,
according
to
Al

and
Democracy
Now
,
are
endangering
approximately
750,000
Gazans
who
rely
on
UN
and
Israeli
food
aid
for
survival
.
</p>
<p>
The
statement
by
Ban
Ki-Moon
was
made
after
the
reissue
of
two
reports
condemning
Israeli
occupation
,
&quot;
The
advisory
opinion
and
a
number
of
United
Nations
resolutions
have
all
affirmed
that
Israel
's
practice
of
constructing
settlements
—
in
effect
,
the
transfer
by
an
occupying
Power
of
parts
of
its
own
civilian
population
into
the
territory
it
occupies
—
constitutes
a
breach
of
the
Fourth
Geneva
Convention
,
&quot;
reads
the
first
report
:
Israeli
Settlements
in
the
Occupied
Palestinian
Territory
,
including
Jerusalem
,
and
the
occupied
Syrian
Golan
.
&quot;
In
addition
to
the
construction
of
the
settlements
,
other
activities
related
to
settlements
are
also
illegal
.
&quot;
These
include
the
requisition
of
land
,
the
destruction
of
houses
and
orchards
,
the
construction
of
roads
meant
for
the
use
of
settlers
only
,
the
exploitation
of
natural
resources
within
the
occupied
territory
and
the
alteration
of
the
character
and
status
of
the
Occupied
Palestinian
Territory
.
The
international
community
has
also
raised
concerns
regarding
the
depletion
of
natural
resources
as
a
result
of
settlements
,

<p>
According
to
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Al_Jazeera">
Al
Jazeera
</ref>
and
other
news
sources
,
Israel
has
sealed
off
access
to
the
Gaza
Strip
for
aid
workers
and
journalists
since
early
November
because
of
Palestinian
rocket
fire
eminating
from
the
area
.
750,000
Gazans
are
without
food
or
power
at
the
moment
,
and
some
Palestinians
see
this
as
a
violation
of
the
shaky
truce
brokered
in
July
of
this
year
.
Jacky
Rowland
,
Al
Jazeera
's
correspondent
in
Jerusalem
,
said
:
&quot;
The
ceasefire
does
n't
seem
to
be
anything
more
than
a
name
at
this
stage
.
&quot;
On
November
17th
,
Israel
allowed
some
UN
food
aid
to
pass
through
its
barricades
.
</p>
<p>
Top
UN
official
Jon
Ging
spoke
about
the
situation
,
saying
:
&quot;
These
people
have
been
reduced
to
be
dependent
on
this
food
,
and
now
we
ca
n’t
even
get
that
food
into
Gaza
.
It
’s
a
disaster
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
In
addition
to
disallowing
food
access
,
Israel
has
also
barred
foreign
journalists
from
entering
the
area
.
</p>
<p>
According
to
Democracy
Now
,
on
Tuesday
,
November
20th
,
executives
from
the
Associated
Press
,
Reuters
,
New
York
Times
,
BBC
,
CNN
,
and
other
news
sources
sent
a
letter
to
the
government
of
Israel
condemning
the
government
's
choice
to
bar
foreign
journalists
from
the
Gaza
Strip
saying
,
&quot;
We
are
gravely
concerned
about
the
prolonged
and
unprecedented
denial
of
access
to
the
Gaza
Strip
for
the
international
media
.
”
Israel
defended
themselves
by
criticizing
the
media
and
accusing
them
of
not
properly
pointing
out
the
reasoning
behind
the
blockade
of
the
Gaza
Strip
.
