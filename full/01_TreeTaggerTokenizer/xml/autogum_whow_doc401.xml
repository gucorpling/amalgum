Create
a
painting
space
.
First
find
a
quiet
private
space
with
minimal
distractions
so
it
is
easier
to
paint
,
make
sure
the
space
has
access
to
clean
water
and
sufficient
air
flow
.
Lay
down
newspaper
over
the
workspace
to
prevent
unwanted
paint
stains
.

Get
ready
to
paint
.
Fill
a
medium
cup
with
warm
soapy
water
for
cleaning
paint
brushes
.
Put
the
paints
on
the
paper
plate
to
mix
and
use
.
Secure
canvas
on
the
easel
.
Organize
all
the
materials
close
for
easy
access
while
painting
.
Finally
,
decide
what
landscape
to
paint
.
Either
find
an
image
on
the
internet
or
in
a
book
or
have
a
landscape
already
drawn
.
Pick
a
simple
landscape
with
more
background
than
detail
so
it
is
easier
to
paint
.

Prepare
the
canvas
.
First
“
activate
”
the
canvas
by
brushing
a
small
amount
of
regular
water
throughout
the
whole
canvas
preferably
using
the
4in
painter
’s
brush
,
this
allows
the
paint
to
blend
better
.

<item>
Prepare
the
colors
.
Identify
the
main
background
colors
of
each
section
,
for
example
,
on
the
example
painting
:
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Top-
Red
and
Redish-Orange
</item>
<item>
Middle-
Orange
and
Yellowish-Orange
</item>
<item>
Bottom-
Black
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Mix
paint
for
background
color
.
Mix
and
experiment
with
paint
on
the
paper
plate
to
create
the
desired
color
for
a
section
of
the
background
,
use
the
flat
medium
brush
to
stir
.
It
is
better
to
have
more
than
enough
of
a
created
color
rather
than
have
to
attempt
to
recreate
the
color
afterwards
.
Do
each
color
one
at
a
time
for
simplicity
.
