.
Ernesto
Unabia
was
one
of
seventy
confirmed
fatalities
in
the
disaster
,
which
left
eighty
more
missing
.
</p>
<p>
Unabia
was
a
37-year-old
seaman
who
worked
on
international
vessels
,
and
earned
a
₱120,000
salary
.
According
to
widow
Verna
Unabia
,
who
filed
the
case
with
her
three
children
,
he
was
going
to
work
on
for
thirteen
more
years
and
then
retire
.
Unabia
's
case
is
the
first
to
be
concluded
,
although
most
victims
settled
with
Sulpicio
without
claims
being
filed
.
</p>
<p>
Although
Sulpicio
lost
their
appeal
several
weeks
ago
,
reporters
have
only
today
received
access
to
documentation
concerning
the
case
.
</p>
<p>
Under
Philippines
law
,
employers
are
responsible
for
their
employees
actions
.
However
,
in
Pestaño
vs.
Sumayang
the
Supreme
court
ruled
that
if
it
could
be
proved
an
employer
had
taken
appropriate
diligence
when
selecting
employers
then
they
could
not
be
held
responsible
.
</p>
<p>
It
was
viewed
that
Sulpicio
was
responsible
as
they
failed
to
remove
captain
Esrum
Mahilum
from
the
vessel
despite
a
number
of
incidents
involving
the
ferry
while
he
was
in
command
of
it
.
<hi rend="italic">
Princess

had
struck
the
bottom

,

a

and

a

fire
while
berthed
at
North
Harbour
,
being

to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cebu">

</ref>
and
ultimately
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Singapore">
Singapore
</ref>
for
repairs
.
</p>
<p>
Despite
these
serious
incidents
while
the
ship
was
under
Mahilum
's
care
,
however
,
he
was
not
removed
from
captaincy
or
even
disciplined
.
A
Board
of
Marine
Inquiry
(
BMI
)
investigation
into
the
ultimate
sinking
of
the
<hi rend="italic">
Princess
of
the
Orient
</hi>
would
later
say
that
Sulpicio
did
not
have
enough
initiative
to
take
action
against
him
.
The
court
ruled
this
made
them
responsible
for
his
actions
.
</p>
<p>
On
September
18
,
1998
,
the
day
of
the
sinking
,
Captain
Mahilum
was
warned
before
starting
out
that
severe
weather
was
approaching
.
He
wrongly
calculated
that
the
storm
was
safely
distanced
and
left
port
regardless
,
running
into
the
storm
two
hours
later
.
<hi rend="italic">
Princess
of
the
Orient
</hi>
began
listing
to
the
left
and
a
distress
call
was
sent
,
but
she
sank
before
help
arrived
.
The
BMI
's
report
blamed
the
disaster
on
the
captain
making
&quot;
erroneous
maneuvers
of
the
vessel
before
it
sank
.
&quot;
He
remains
missing
to
this
day
.
</p>
<p>
After
the
court
ruled
that
this
made
Sulpicio
liable
to
pay
civil
damages
an
appeal
was
filed
,
in
which
Sulpicio
said
that
the
captain
&quot;
valiantly
tried
to
save
his
ship
up
to
the
bitter
end
.
He
heroically
went
down
with
his
ship
.
&quot;
Although
he
failed
to
properly
supervise
the
abandon
ship
order
he
gave
,
he
was
last
seen
helping
passengers
to
board
life
rafts
.
Sulpicio
further
alleged
that
careful
analysis
of
the
BMI
report
showed
he
did
not
directly
cause
the
disaster
.
</p>
<p>
The
court
rejected
the
appeal
,
with
judge
Estella
Alma
Singco
saying
that
while
the
failure
to
remove
the
captain
was
n't
the
direct
cause
,
&quot;
such
failure
doubtless
contributed
materially
to
the
loss
of
life
.
&quot;
Sulpicio
were
ordered
to
pay
P6.240
million
in
lost
earnings
,
P100,000
moral
damages
,
P50,000
indemnity
-
which
Sulpicio
had
already
offered
to
all
the
families
of
the
deceased
-
and
P50,000
in
pursuer
's
litigation
costs
.
