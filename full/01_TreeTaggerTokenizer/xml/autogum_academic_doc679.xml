Introduction

<p>
A
new
round
of
technological
and
industrial
revolution
is
reshaping
the
global
innovation
landscape
,
and
the
competition
for
the
first-class
scientific
and
technological
talents
to
seize
the
advantage
of
scientific
and
technological
innovation
has
already
become
a
key
support
for
increasing
comprehensive
national
strength
.
In
recent
years
,
the
flow
of
scientific
and
technological
talents
’
spatial
migration
has
been
scaling
up
.
For
example
,
talents
have
gravitated
to
developed
regions
with
first-class
research
resources
and
good
career
prospects
for
study
and
employment
.
In
addition
,
emerging
areas
,
with
rapid
economic
development
,
improvement
of
social
conditions
and
a
proactive
talent
strategy
,
have
begun
to
attract
talents
back
.
Scientists
’
clusters
depend
on
the
use
of
rich
human
resources
to
produce
a
scale
effect
that
effectively
promotes
knowledge
innovation
,
technological
innovation
,
and
scientific
and
technological
progress
in
regions
with
talent
agglomeration
.
For
example
,
groups
of
multinational
scientists
have
built
important
technological
innovation
networks
in
Silicon
Valley
,
Hsinchu
,
and
Shanghai
,
which
has
promoted
the
growth
of
technology
centers
in
mainland
China
and
Taiwan
,
China
.
In
the
1980s
and
1990s
,
Taiwan
pioneered
semiconductor
and
personal
computer
manufacturing
centers
worldwide
.
The
key
to
that
was
the
flow
and
spillover
of
knowledge
produced
by
a
batch
of
US
scientists
shuttling
between
Silicon
Valley
and
Taiwan
.
</p>
<p>
As
outstanding
representatives
of
China
’s
top
innovative
talents
and
scientists
,
academicians
of
the
Chinese
Academy
of
Sciences
(
CAS
)
and
Chinese
Academy
of
Engineering
(
CAE
)
embody
China
’s
highest
level
of
science
and
technology
,
so
agglomeration
areas
of
CAS
and
CAE
academicians
are
bound
to
be
dominant
in
the
competition
for
technological
innovation
.
As
one
of
the
main
carriers
of
knowledge
flow
and
communication
,
the
spatial
migration
of
CAS
and
CAE
academicians
at
different
development
stages
accelerates
the
agglomeration
and
diffusion
of
knowledge
,
to
some
degree
,
and
promotes
the
formation
and
development
of
knowledge
and
technology
centers
.
Against
the
backdrop
of
the
acceleration
of
globalization
and
the
implementation
of
China
’s
innovation-driven
development
strategy
,
China
has
stepped
up
efforts
to
make
itself
an
innovative
country
with
strong
innovative
capacity
and
global
competitiveness
.
The
task
of
cultivating
and
introducing
scientists
,
as
well
as
allowing
them
to
realize
their
full
potential
,
is
one
of
China
’s
priorities
.
Thus
,
it
is
of
great
practical
significance
to
reveal
the
spatial
distribution
and
the
characteristics
of
Chinese
scientists
’
space
migration
,
so
as
to
better
attract
and
agglomerate
global
high-end
technological
talents
,
and
promote
the
regional
agglomeration
and
flow
.
</p>
<p>
The
purpose
of
this
paper
is
to
reveal
the
flow
network
of
Chinese
scientists
and
to
analyze
the
driving
mechanisms
behind
their
space
migration
.
The
following
three
questions
will
be
studied
:
(
1
)
What
are
the
characteristics
of
the
spatial
distribution
of
Chinese
scientists
at
different
development
stages
?
(
2
)
What
is
the
structure
of
their
flow
network
?
(
3
)
What
factors
drive
the
flow
of
Chinese
scientists
?
Based
on
data
sourced
from
the
academicians
of
the
Chinese
Academy
of
Sciences
(
CAS
)
and
the
Chinese
Academy
of
Engineering
(
CAE
)
at
different
development
stages
,
this
paper
uses
spatial
statistics
,
social
network
approaches
and
visualization
software
to
study
the
issues
above
.
</p>
<p>
The
three
main
contributions
of
the
study
are
as
follows
.
First
,
the
characteristics
of
the
spatial
distribution
of
Chinese
scientists
at
different
development
stages
at
an
urban
scale
are
systematically
revealed
.
Second
,
topological
structures
and
core-periphery
structures
of
the
flow
network
of
Chinese
scientists
are
depicted
and
the
role
of
cities
as
network
nodes
is
identified
by
curriculum
vitae
analysis
.
Third
,
driving
mechanisms
behind
Chinese
scientists
’
flow
patterns
are
revealed
through
the
application
of
relevant
talent
flow
theories
.
