The

taken

ten-year-old
Hoel
(
sometimes
called
Hansel
)
.
They
belonged
to
the
lower
class
in
German
society
,
and
were
originally
beggars
from
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swabia">
Swabia

.
Pappenheimer
was
a
nickname
,
their
actual
family
name

middle
of
the
night
,
taken
from
their
beds
and
taken
to

,
accused
of

out
of
their

torture
</ref>
so
fierce
they
confessed
to
anything
they
were
accused
of
or
questioned
about
.
They
were
made
responsible
for
every
unsolved
crime
that
had
occurred
in
Bavaria
in
the
later
years
and
confessed
to
hundreds
of
thefts
and
murders
.
They
admitted
sorcery
and
pointed
out
over
four
hundred
accomplices
.

<p>
The
parents
and
the
eldest
sons
were

two
other

The
bodies
of
the
men
were
torn
six
times

</ref>
on
a
pike
,
and
finally
,
they
were
burned

All
this
took
place
in

of
the
youngest
son
,
ten-year-old
Hoel
,
who
was
to
witness
the
execution
of
his
family
;
he

of
the
sheriff
,

his
reactions
.

the
same
year
,
in
December
1600
,
six
more
people
were

In
Münich

.
July
1600

six
persons
were
executed
in
the
following
manner
:
The
vagabond
and
beggar
Paul
Gämperl
was
impaled
,
his
wife
had
her
breasts
cut
off
,
and
both
herself
and
two
of
her
sons
had
those
breasts
smeared
onto
their
mouths
.
In
addition
,
two
other
men
and
associates
were
executed
,
and
all
six
were
pinched
with
glowing
pincers
.
Their
arms
were
broken
on
the
wheel
,
and
they
were
afterwards
burnt
alive
.
</p>
<p>
They
had
confessed
to
being
devoted
to
the
Devil
,
and
with
his
help
,
in
particular
by
making
a
devilish
,
magic
salve
,
to
have
contributed
to
the
deaths
of
at
least
400
children
and
more
than
50
old
people
by
having
applied
that
salve
.
Paul
Gämperl
was
condemned
for
being
directly
responsible
for
44
murders
;
in
total
,
the
six
were
condemned
for
74
murders
.
In
addition
,
they
had
been
charged
with
many
acts
of
robbery
,
theft
and
nightly
burglaries
,
where
they
had
plundered
houses
and
killed
the
people
in
the
houses
.
They
had
also
,
according
to
the
charges
,
put
on
fire
diverse
hamlets
and
marketplaces
,
principally
in
order
to
get
away
with
goods
in
the
ensuing
confusion
.
Also
,
they
had
conjured
up
bad
weather
,
killed
cows
in
the
field
,
robbed
churches
and
sold
to
the
Jews
the
holy
wafers
.
</p>
<p>
The
27
.
November
1600
was
the
next
batch
of
the
gang
executed
.
This
was
a
mother
and
her
two
daughter
,
as
well
as
two
other
men
.
The
last
to
be
executed
was
the
12-year-old
son
of
Paul
Gämperl
,
who
in
the
intervening
time
had
been
baptized
and
given
the
name
Cyprian
.
However
,
that
did
not
help
him
,
he
was
first
strangled
,
and
then
his
corpse
was
burned
.
The
other
5
were
burnt
alive
.
Cyprian
was
condemned
for
having
performed
8
murders
on
his
own
.
The
members
of
the
whole
group
had
,
under
torture
,
admitted
to
having
contributed
to
the
deaths
of
over
400
children
,
having
killed
,
by
means
of
sorcery
,
39
individuals
,
and
admitted
62
murders
besides
.

Some
divergences
,
such
as
Anna
Gämperl
having
died
prior
to
being
burnt
,
rather
than
burning
alive
in
the
Hormayr
account
,
in
the
chronicle
used
by
Hormayr
can
be
seen
relative
to
an
English
account
of
the
trial
already
in
1601
(
translated
from
a
Dutch
copy
of
the
German
original
)
