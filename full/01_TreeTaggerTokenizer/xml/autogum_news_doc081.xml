Three
pirates
were
killed
late
Friday
during
a
presumed
attack
in
error
,
while
other
pirates
successfully
hijacked
the

,
a

vessel
with
an
all-

,
and
a

was
lifted
regarding
the

of

British

couple
whose
yacht
was
seized
more
than
a
year
ago
over
the
weekend
.
</p>
<p>
At
11
p.m.
on
Friday
a
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Kenya">
Kenyan
</ref>
patrol
vessel
was
near
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilifi">
Kilifi
</ref>
in
Kenyan
coastal
waters
&quot;
when
four
suspected
Somali
pirates
on
board
a
speed
boat
climbed
the
vessel
,
mistaking
it
for
a
merchant
vessel
,
&quot;
according
to
Kenyan
Defence
Department
spokesman
Bogita
Ongeri
.
He
said
three
were
shot
dead
but
the
fourth
&quot;
dived
into
the
sea
with
bullet
wounds
during
the
scuffle
,
&quot;
and
is
thought
to
have
died
.
The
speed
boat
with
more
pirates
on
board
fled
,
the
three
bodies
were
taken
to

</p>
<p>
Ongeri
promised
more
details
after
discussions
with
the
vessel
's
captain
adding
,
&quot;
[
t]he
government
will
not
relent
in
its
fight

piracy

Kenya
,
along
with
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Seychelles">
Seychelles

,
performs
international
prosecutions
of
pirates
,
but
convictions
are
rarely
secured
;
26
suspects
were
freed
last
week
by
Kenya
owing
to
lack
of
evidence
or
jurisdiction
.

Andrew
Mwangura
of
the
Seafarers
'
Assistance
Program
said
Saturday
,
&quot;
I
can
confirm
the
pirates
hijacked
<hi rend="italic">
Yuan
Xiang
</hi>
on
Friday
at
midnight
Kenyan
time
in
the
Arabian
Sea
near
India
.
The
vessel
has
29
Chinese
crew
.
&quot;
The
<hi rend="italic">
Yuan
Xiang
</hi>
was
sailing
outside
the
zone
covered
by
a
multinational
task
force
combating
piracy
.
Reports
suggest
its
captors
are
heading
to
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Somalia">
Somalia

.
</p>
<p>
Retired
British
couple
Paul
and
Rachel
Chandler
were
released
after
their
yacht
<hi rend="italic">
Lynn
Rival
</hi>
was
captured
near
the
Seychelles
en-route
to
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Tanzania">
Tanzania
</ref>
388
days
ago
,
in
October
2009
.
An
injunction
prevented
reporting
the
release
until
56-year-old
Rachel
and
60-year-old
Paul
,
from
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Kent">
Kent
</ref>
,
were
out
of
Somalia
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Men
with
guns
came
aboard
,
&quot;
Paul
told
<hi rend="italic">
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV%20News">
ITV
News
</ref>
</hi>
over
the
phone
a
week
after
their
capture
.
&quot;
Then
we
were
forced
to
sail
...
toward
Somalia
.
&quot;
The
seizure
was
witnessed
by
UK
refueling
ship
RFA
<hi rend="italic">
Wave
Knight
</hi>
but
they
were
not
helped
for
fear
their
lives
would
be
endangered
.
&quot;
This
is
not
piracy
and
must
not
be
reported
as
such
,
&quot;
Paul
said
in
custody
.
&quot;
It
is
kidnapping
and
extortion
and
even
torture
.
&quot;
It
is
unclear
if
money
changed
hands
;
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_States_dollar">
US$
</ref>
7
million
was
originally
demanded
but
UK
government
policy
forbids
ransom
payments
.
&quot;
We
're
fine
,
&quot;
said
Paul
.
&quot;
We
're
rather
skinny
and
bony
but
we
're
fine
.

<p>
New
figures
show
790
people
have
been
kidnapped
by
Somali
pirates
this
year
,
on
course
to
beat
last
year
's
record
of
867
.
Of
these
,
435
remain
hostage
.

say
crews
are
repelling
more
attacks
,
and
attackers
have
responded
with
increased
violence
.
&quot;
As
it
gets
harder
for
pirates
to
capture
ships
,
the
Somali
gangs
are
more
likely
to
fire
at
sailors
with
automatic
weapons
in
order
to
force
vessels
to
stop
&quot;
.
Some
tankers
have
had
rocket
propelled
grenades
fired
at
them
.
</p>
<p>
Last
year
saw
217
hijack
attempts
.
This
year
,
to
date
,
140
,
and
40
ships
seized
-
versus
47
for
the
whole
of
2009
.
