The
two
proposed
fully
automatic
segmentation
approaches
were
tested
on
two
case
studies
with
very
different
characteristics
(
e.
g.
,
different
types
of
urban
development
and
average
point
density
value
of
the
ALS
input
data
)
in
order
to
increase
the
robustness
and
completeness
of
the
proposed
investigation
.
</p>
<p>
First
,
an
ALS
data
set
with
reference
data
made
available
via
the
International
Society
for
Photogrammetry
and
Remote
Sensing
(
ISPRS
)
web
site
over
downtown
Toronto
(
Canada
)
was
used
to
evaluate
the
performance
of
the
two
above-described
segmentation
approaches
.
This
test
case
contained
a
mixture
of
58
low
and
high-storey
buildings
;

a
more
detailed
description
of
characteristics
and
technical
specifications
of
this
benchmark
dataset
.

Figure

shows
a
visual
result
of
the
3D
reconstruction
using
the
proposed
segmentation
methods
.
Processing
was
conducted
on
a
consumer
laptop
(
Intel
Core
i7
,
8G
RAM
)
.
The
average
performances
over
the
58
buildings
of
the
two
roof
segmentation
approaches
are
shown
in
Table
1
.
The
region
growing
segmentation
approach
exhibited
slightly
better
performances
but
required
a
greater
computational
time
than
the
clustering-based
approach
.

A
3D
reconstruction
of
one
complex
palace
,
constructed
in
the
1950s
with
a
total
surface
of
3690
m2
,
located
in
one
of
the
main
squares
of
the
historical
center
of
Matera
(
see
<figure>
Figure
6
</figure>
a
)
,
for
which
building
a
celerimetric
survey
made
through
a
total
station
is
available
,
was
carried
out
from
a
LIDAR
point
cloud
(
see
<figure>
Figure
6
</figure>
a
)
.
This
complex
building
was
then
manually
reconstructed
in
3D
,
as
shown
in
<figure>
Figure
6
</figure>
b
,
using
commercial
software
that
implements
Building
Information
Modeling
(
BIM
)
technology
.
This
manually
reconstructed
3D
building
is
considered
the
gold
standard
because
it
is
based
on
detailed
survey
measurements
and
,
therefore
,
it
can
be
compared
with
the
outcomes
of
the
two
proposed
segmentation
approaches
in
order
to
evaluate
their
vertex
geometry
accuracy
.
<figure>
Figure

</figure>
c
,
d
shows
the
reconstruction
results
for
the
data
collected
for
the
building
test
case
in
Matera
.
Processing
was
conducted
on
a
consumer
laptop
(
Intel
Core
i7
,
8G
RAM
)
and
is
presented
as
solid
models
with
simplified
facades
and
faithfully
reflected
roof
structure
considering
that
the
aims
of
these
kinds
of
approaches
are
to
realize
an
interactive
visualization
covering
large
areas
.
The
performance
of
the
two
approaches
,
evaluated
as
described
in
Section
2.5
,
are
shown
in
Table
2
.
The
region
growing
segmentation
approach
exhibited
slightly
better
performances
but
required
a
greater
computational
time
(
two
times
greater
)
than
the
clustering-based
approach
,
similar
to
the
performance
in
the
previously
described
case
study
over
downtown
Toronto
.
Hence
,
the
region
growing
approach
analysing
the
LIDAR
cloud
points
one
by
one
can
be
more
efficient
to
reach
the
best
spatial
detail
possible
but
,
at
the
same
time
,
this
process
is
more
time-consuming
.
However
,
the
potential-based
method
can
also
yield
a
stable
estimate
on
the
number
of
clusters
and
initial
cluster
centers
which
are
needed
for
the
following
fuzzy
k-means
clustering
calculation
for
an
efficient
segmentation
process
,
saving
computational
resources
.
The
better
performances
of
both
proposed
methodologies
on
the
Matera
building
with
respect
to
the
Toronto
case
study
could
be
associated
with
the
different
quality
of
input
ALS
data
adopted
.
This
is
confirmed
by
the
fact
that
the
minimum
value
of
the
RSME
(
using
both
segmentation
methods
)
evaluated
for
each
of
the
Toronto
buildings
is
equal
to
0.76
m
,
slightly
higher
than
the
value
shown
in
Table
2
(
i.
e.
,
0.7
m
)
.
</p>
<p>
In
both
applications
,
each
side
of
a
rooftop
is
connected
to
the
ground
by
a
simple
,
vertical
wall
which
is
obviously
not
always
indicative
of
the
true
architectural
form
.
In
addition
,
the
2.5D
dual
contouring
method
is
a
robust
algorithm
although
it
does
not
respond
to
our
ideal
outline
refinement
.
