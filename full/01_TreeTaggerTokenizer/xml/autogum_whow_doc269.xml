Write
a
Risk
Management
Policy
</head>
<p>
A
risk
management
policy
serves
two
main
purposes
:
to
identify
,
reduce
and
prevent
undesirable
incidents
or
outcomes
and
to
review
past
incidents
and
implement
changes
to
prevent
or
reduce
future
incidents
.
For
example
,
a
doctor
's
office
may
utilize
their
risk
management
policy
in
order
to
continuously
analyze
and
improve
upon
their
policies
and
practices
that
affect
the
rate
of
patients
re-admitted
due
to
hospital-borne
infections
.
Knowing
how
to
write
a
risk
management
policy
is
a
central
part
of
an
organization
or
business
's
strategic
planning
and
growth
.
Follow
these
steps
and

how
to
write
a
risk
management
policy

Creating

tool

Be

All

involved

plan

Front-line
workers
may
have
a
better
sense
of
the
range
of
risks
than
higher-level
managers

However
,
some
organizations
designate

officer
that
is
the

Be

to
utilize
the
writing
process
as
a
collaborative
effort
and
do
not
allow
it
to
be
a
blaming
or
finger-pointing
session
.
Be
sure
to
outline
from
the
start
that
it
is
a
positive
,
preventative
process
and
not
a
punitive
one
stemming
from
how
something

After
identifying
risks
within
the
organization
,
revisit
insurance
coverage
amounts
.
Discuss
with
others
involved
with
the
risk
management
policy
process
and
adjust
coverage
accordingly

if
deemed
necessary

Identifying
risks
and
hazards
shifts
some
responsibility
to
managers
.
After
identifying
risks
,
managers
must
then
be
willing
to
provide
trainings
,
equipment
,
and
oversight
to
equip
staff
with
the
ways
and
means
to
avoid
those
risks
.
