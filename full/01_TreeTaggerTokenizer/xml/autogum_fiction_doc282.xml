It
is
consoling
as
often
as
dismaying
to
find
in
what
seems
a
cataclysmal
tide
of
a
certain
direction
a
strong
drift
to
the
opposite
quarter
.
It
is
so
divinable
,
if
not
so
perceptible
,
that
its
presence
may
usually
be
recognized
as
a
beginning
of
the
turn
in
every
tide
which
is
sure
,
sooner
or
later
,
to
come
.
In
reform
,
it
is
the
menace
of
reaction
;
in
reaction
,
it
is
the
promise
of
reform
;
we
may
take
heart
as
we
must
lose
heart
from
it
.
A
few
years
ago
,
when
a
movement
which
carried
fiction
to
the
highest
place
in
literature
was
apparently
of
such
onward
and
upward
sweep
that
there
could
be
no
return
or
descent
,
there
was
a
counter-current
in
it
which
stayed
it
at
last
,
and
pulled
it
back
to
that
lamentable
level
where
fiction
is
now
sunk
,
and
the
word
&quot;
novel
&quot;
is
again
the
synonym
of
all
that
is
morally
false
and
mentally
despicable
.
Yet
that
this
,
too
,
is
partly
apparent
,
I
think
can
be
shown
from
some
phases
of
actual
fiction
which
happen
to
be
its
very
latest
phases
,
and
which
are
of
a
significance
as
hopeful
as
it
is
interesting
.
Quite
as
surely
as
romanticism
lurked
at
the
heart
of
realism
,
something
that
we
may
call
&quot;
psychologism
&quot;
has
been
present
in
the
romanticism
of
the
last
four
or
five
years
,
and
has
now
begun
to
evolve
itself
in
examples
which
it
is
the
pleasure
as
well
as
the
duty
of
criticism
to
deal
with
.
</p>
<p>
I.
</p>
<p>
No
one
in
his
day
has
done
more
to
popularize
the
romanticism
,
now
decadent
,
than
Mr.
Gilbert
Parker
;
and
he
made
way
for
it
at
its
worst
just
because
he
was
so
much
better
than
it
was
at
its
worst
,
because
he
was
a
poet
of
undeniable
quality
,
and
because
he
could
bring
to
its
intellectual
squalor
the
graces
and
the
powers
which
charm
,
though
they
could
not
avail
to
save
it
from
final
contempt
.
He
saves
himself
in
his
latest
novel
,
because
,
though
still
so
largely
romanticistic
,
its
prevalent
effect
is
psychologistic
,
which
is
the
finer
analogue
of
realistic
,
and
which
gave
realism
whatever
was
vital
in
it
,
as
now
it
gives
romanticism
whatever
will
survive
it
.
In
&quot;
The
Right
of
Way
&quot;
Mr.
Parker
is
not
in
a
world
where
mere
determinism
rules
,
where
there
is
nothing
but
the
happening
of
things
,
and
where
this
one
or
that
one
is
important
or
unimportant
according
as
things
are
happening
to
him
or
not
,
but
has
in
himself
no
claim
upon
the
reader
's
attention
.
Once
more
the
novel
begins
to
rise
to
its
higher
function
,
and
to
teach
that
men
are
somehow
masters
of
their
fate
.
His
Charley
Steele
is
,
indeed
,
as
unpromising
material
for
the
experiment
,
in
certain
ways
,
as
could
well
be
chosen
.
One
of
the
few
memorable
things
that
Bulwer
said
,
who
said
so
many
quotable
things
,
was
that
pure
intellectuality
is
the
devil
,
and
on
his
plane
Charley
Steele
comes
near
being
pure
intellectual
.
He
apprehends
all
things
from
the
mind
,
and
does
the
effects
even
of
goodness
from
the
pride
of
mental
strength
.
Add
to
these
conditions
of
his
personality
that
pathologically
he
is
from
time
to
time
a
drunkard
,
with
always
the
danger
of
remaining
a
drunkard
,
and
you
have
a
figure
of
which
so
much
may
be
despaired
that
it
might
almost
be
called
hopeless
.
I
confess
that
in
the
beginning
this
brilliant
,
pitiless
lawyer
,
this
consciencelessly
powerful
advocate
,
at
once
mocker
and
poseur
,
all
but
failed
to
interest
me
.
A
little
of
him
and
his
monocle
went
such
a
great
way
with
me
that
I
thought
I
had
enough
of
him
by
the
end
of
the
trial
,
where
he
gets
off
a
man
charged
with
murder
,
and
then
cruelly
snubs
the
homicide
in
his
gratitude
;
and
I
do
not
quite
know
how
I
kept
on
to
the
point
where
Steele
in
his
drunkenness
first
dazzles
and
then
insults
the
gang
of
drunken
lumbermen
,
and
begins
his
second
life
in
the
river
where
they
have
thrown
him
,
and
where
his
former
client
finds
him
.
From
that
point
I
could
not
forsake
him
to
the
end
,
though
I
found
myself
more
than
once
in
the
world
where
things
happen
of
themselves
and
do
not
happen
from
the
temperaments
of
its
inhabitants
.
In
a
better
and
wiser
world
,
the
homicide
would
not
perhaps
be
at
hand
so
opportunely
to
save
the
life
of
the
advocate
who
had
saved
his
;
but
one
consents
to
this
,
as
one
consents
to
a
great
deal
besides
in
the
story
,
which
is
imaginably
the
survival
of
a
former
method
.
The
artist
's
affair
is
to
report
the
appearance
,
the
effect
;
and
in
the
real
world
,
the
appearance
,
the
effect
,
is
that
of
law
and
not
of
miracle
.
Nature
employs
the
miracle
so
very
sparingly
that
most
of
us
go
through
life
without
seeing
one
,
and
some
of
us
contract
such
a
prejudice
against
miracles
that
when
they
are
performed
for
us
we
suspect
a
trick
.
When
I
suffered
from
this
suspicion
in
&quot;
The
Right
of
Way
&quot;
I
was
the
more
vexed
because
I
felt
that
I
was
in
the
hands
of
a
connoisseur
of
character
who
had
no
need
of
miracles
.
