Kennedy
was
a

just
under
a
month
ago
.
He
led
the
Liberal
Democrats
from
1999
until
his
resignation
in
2006
.
</p>
<p>
Kennedy
first
became
a
Member
of
Parliament
in
1983
at
age
23
,
becoming
the
youngest
MP
at
the
time
.
He
was
elected
to
represent

Democratic
Party
</ref>

Through
this
he
helped
the
party
eventually
merge
with
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal%20Party%20(UK)">
Liberal
Party
</ref>
to
form
the
Liberal
Democrats
in

the
party
in
1999
,
replacing

.
</p>
<p>
During
his
time
as
party
leader
he
won
praise
from
critics
for
his
opposition
to
the
invasion
of
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Iraq">

,
which
was
being
pushed
through
by

Minister

In
the
2005
general
election
he
saw
his
party
record
their
highest
ever
electoral
result
,
winning
62
seats
.
However
his
success
would
n't
last
,
with
Kennedy
resigning
the
following
year
after
going
public
with
his
alcohol
abuse
problem
.

<p>
Tributes
have
come
from
politicians
across

political
parties

said
&quot;
Charles
Kennedy
played
a
pivotal
role
in
bringing
together
two
parties
—
the
SDP
and
the
Liberals
.
As
leader
he
took
the
Liberal
Democrats
to
the
best
electoral
result
for
a
third
party
in
British
politics
for
nearly
100
years
.

,
the
outgoing
leader
of

,
said
Kennedy
&quot;
would
have
wanted
to
be
remembered
as
a
kind
and
loving
father
,
brother
and
son
first
;
and
an
accomplished
politician
second

said
to
the
House
,
&quot;
Charles
Kennedy
spent
almost
his
entire
adult
life
as
an
MP
.
He
was
assuredly
at
home
in
this
place
,
yet
perhaps
happiest
beyond
it
.
He
was
a
man
of
deep
progressive
principle
,
but
a
man
also
blessed
with
the
popular
touch
.
He
was
a
good
talker
but
an
even
better
listener
.
Above
all
,
and
perhaps
most
strikingly
,
Charles
had
the
rare
ability
to
reach
out
to
millions
of
people
of
all
political
persuasions
and
of
none
across
the
country
who
were
untouched
by
and
in
many
cases
actively
hostile
to
politics
.
In
this
seminal
sense
,
therefore
,
Charles
was
the
boy
next
door
of
British
public
life
—
we
salute
him
.
We
honour
his
memory
and
we
send
today
our
sincere
heartfelt
and
deepest
condolences
to
his
family
and
his
friends
.

So
sorry
to
hear
the
dreadful
news
that
Charles
Kennedy
had
passed

great
ability

such
[

tragedy
he
has
passed
away

RIP
