Find
Other
Galaxies
</head>
<p>
Galaxies
are
vast
collections
of
stars
in
space
.
They
can
be
pretty
awesome
to
look
at
,
especially
if
you
can
see
the
structure
of
the
galaxy
.
Here
's
five
ways
that
you
can
find
a
galaxy
in
outer
space
.
The
first
three
only
work
in
the
northern
hemisphere
,
while
the
fourth
only
works
in
the
southern
hemisphere
.

The
Andromeda
galaxy
</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Find
the
constellation
of
Andromeda
.
You
should
see
three
bright
stars
in
a
line
,
plus
a
bunch
of
dim
stars
.
</item>
<item>
Find
the
star
Mirach
.
It
's
the
middle
star
in
the
line
of
three
bright
stars
.
</item>
<item>
Look
slightly
north
and
to
the
right
of
Mirach
.
A
star
map
will
help
you
pin
down
the
location
.
The
galaxy
should
appear
as
a
fuzzy
patch
.

The
Triangulum
galaxy
</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Find
the
Andromeda
galaxy
using
the
method
above
.
</item>
<item>
Go
from
the
Andromeda
galaxy
to
Mirach
,
then
go
the
same
distance
again
.
the
galaxy
should
look
like
a
dimmer
version
of
the
Andromeda
galaxy
.

<head>
Bode
's
galaxy
(
M81
)
</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Go
to
a
dark
site
.
M81
is
very
faint
-
it
's
the
dimmest
galaxy
that
can
be
seen
with
the
naked
eye
.
</item>
<item>
Find
the
Big
Dipper
.
This
will
point
the
way
to
the
galaxy
.
</item>
<item>
Go
from
Phecda
(
bottom
left
of
the
trapezoid
)
,
through
Dubhe
(
top
right
of
the
trapezoid
,
used
to
find
the
pole
star
)
,
then
go
the
same
distance
again
.
The
galaxy
should
appear
as
a
very
faint
fuzzy
patch
-
if
it
's
dark
enough
,
and
if
you
have
good
eyesight
.
A
star
map
is
very
helpful
.

<head>
Magellanic
clouds
</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Look
south
.
These
galaxies
are
very
bright
-
brighter
than
most
stars
.
You
should
see
two
large
fuzzy
sparkly
patches
.
these
are
the
Large
Magellanic
cloud
(
LMC
)
and
the
Small
Magellanic
cloud
(
SMC
)
.
If
you
want
to
be
more
precise
,
the
SMC
is
in
the
constellations
of
Tucana
and
Hydrus
,
and
the
LMC
is
in
Dorado
and
Mensa
.

Telescope
method
</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Get
a
telescope
and
a
star
map
.
Other
galaxies
are
only
visible
through
a
telescope
,
you
ca
n't
see
them
with
the
naked
eye
.
</item>
<item>
Decide
on
a
galaxy
to
look
at
.
For
starters
,
you
can
try
finding
the
galaxies
already
mentioned
.
You
'll
be
able
to
make
out
details
that
you
ca
n't
see
with
the
naked
eye
.
I
'd
also
recommend
M51
,
the
Whirlpool
galaxy
-
a
favourite
among
photographers
.
</item>
<item>
Use
the
star
map
to
find
the
co-ordinates
of
the
galaxy
.
You
can
also
find
them
on
the
internet
.
</item>
<item>
Point
your
telescope
at
the
galaxy
and
take
a
look
.
If
you
have
a
computerised
mount
,
just
enter
the
co-ordinates
of
the
galaxy
and
it
will
find
it
by
itself
.

Tips
</head>
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Keep
trying
.
Galaxies
are
very
far
away
,
and
this
makes
them
very
dim
and
hard
to
find
.
If
you
ca
n't
find
it
one
night
,
try
again
tomorrow
.

Warnings
</head>
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Never
look
at
the
sun
.
</item>
<item>
If
you
're
hoping
to
see
images
like
the
amazing
photos
that
you
can
find
on
the
internet
,
you
're
in
for
a
shock
.
Unless
you
buy
a
really
powerful
and
expensive
telescope
,
you
wo
n't
see
very
much
in
the
galaxies
that
you
look
at
.
