,
head
of
EU
foreign
policy
,
said
the
bloc
is
&quot;
very
concerned
&quot;
by
the
situation
&quot;
and
very
concerned
for
the
family
of
the
two
pilots
who
are
missing

of
a
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/NATO">

meeting
called
by
Turkey
under
provisions
allowing
members
to
seek
urgent
talks
if
they
perceive
themselves
under
threat
.
Turkey
is
a
NATO
member
,
and
an
EU
membership
candidate
.

The
disputed
incident
saw
a
Turkish
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell%20Douglas%20F-4%20Phantom%20II">
F-4
Phantom
jet
</ref>
destroyed
on
Friday
,
with
Syria
claiming
they
were
unaware
of
the
aircraft
's
origin
and
merely
defending
themselves
.
The
Turks
claim
the
jet
mistakenly
entered
Syrian
airspace
,
but
had
left
again
after
a
warning
and
was
in
international
airspace
when
it
was
attacked
.
</p>
<p>
The
EU
has
today
announced
fresh
sanctions
against
Syria
:
Another
person
and
six
organisations
were
added
to
the
EU
's
sanctions
list
,
which
now
imposes
asset
freezes
on
43
groups
and
over
100
people
;
the
individuals
also
face
travel
bans
.
The
growing
list
is
in
response
to
Syrian
President
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Bashar_al-Assad">

to

.
</p>
<p>
The
UN
puts
deaths
at
the
hands
of
Syrian
government
forces
at
10,000
;
Syria
attributes
2,600
government
and
security
forces
deaths
to
&quot;
terrorists
&quot;
with
foreign
assistance
.
Turkey
and
the
West
are
uncertain
if
removing
al-Assad
would
simply
make
Syria
even
more
fractured
and
volatile
.

the

the
