DS
:
To
miniaturize
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
SP
</hi>
:
Yes
.
And
from
the
beginning
you
can
create
invisible
sensors
that
will
inform
you
about
every
movement
in
armies
all
over
the
world
.
Then
you
can
hand
over
the
soldier
,
a
new
uniform
made
of
nano
which
is
immune
against
cartridges
,
against
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological%20warfare">
biology
</ref>
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical%20warfare">
chemical
warfare
</ref>
.
It
’s
a
strong
material
because
the
nano
material
is
100
times
stronger
than
steel
and
it
weighs
only
1/6
of
it
.
It
can
warm
up
the
soldier
in
cold
weather
;
cool
him
in
the
warm
weather
.
It
enhances
his
strength
3
times
;
he
can
lift
120
kilos
with
one
hand
.
And
then
you
can
go
on
and
say
not
only
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanomedicine">
protect
the
protector
</ref>
but
as
well
to
create
robots
as
in
planes
without
pilots
and
military
units
without
soldiers
.
You
do
n’t
need
a
soldier
;
you
can
run
it
by
proxy
.
Small
weapons
,
small
robots
that
can
penetrate
or
perform
in
conditions
that
a
human
being
cannot
.
He
is
too
large
,
too
inflexible
.

DS
:
That
’s
amazing
.
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
SP
</hi>
:
Then
take
the
nano
in
medicine
.
You
can
produce
the
smallest
instruments
that
you
do
n’t
have
to
invade
the
body
.
You
can
do
it
from
the
outside
control
,
with
such
tiny
little
instruments
.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
Are
you
satisfied
with
the
progress
in
the
nanotechnology
sector
here
in
Israel
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
SP
</hi>
:
Look
,
I
started
it
5
or
6
years
ago
to
explain
to
the
people
the
importance
of
it
,
then
I
was
instrumental
in
collecting
several
hundred
million
dollars
that
was
given
to
the
universities
and
the
research
institutes
.
As
a
result
,
we
have
a
very
good
group
of
nano
experts
,
you
see
,
all
of
the
best
,
and
now
they
are
working
with
me
voluntarily
.
I
have
30
top
scientists
in
Israel
who
have
developed
different
ideas
in
the
domain
.
This
type
of
research
can
be
applied
to
whatever
you
want
:
Alternative
energy
,
because
if
you
want
to
have
solar
energy
,
you
need
very
large
equipment
.
With
nano
you
can
condense
it
.
The
same
is
true
about
desalinization
.
It
can
replace
the
uniform
of
humankind
.
In
the
future
ladies
will
have
a
dress
.
You
can
press
a
button
and
it
will
change
the
color
.
The
nano
has
what
has
been
called
the
lotus
effect
.
Lotus
is
a
flower
that
keeps
cleaning
itself
.
And
so
is
a
nano
so
it
does
n’t
shrink
,
does
n’t
get
dirty
.

The

peace

The
problem
is
how
long
will
it
take
and
how
many
victims
will
it
call
for
.
