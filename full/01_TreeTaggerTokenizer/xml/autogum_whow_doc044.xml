Store
a
Car
for
Winter
</head>
<p>
Whether
you
are
heading
down
south
for
an
extended
winter
vacation
,
headed
off
to
a
semester
at
college
,
or
just
ca
n’t
imagine
using
your
convertible
when
there
is
a
windchill
,
there
are
dozens
of
great
reasons
to
store
your
car
for
the
winter
.
While
there
are
potential
issues
with
storing
your
car
for
an
extended
time
,
there
are
plenty
of
ways
to
prepare
your
car
for
hibernation
.

Wash
and
wax
your
car
.
Giving
your
car
a
thorough
external
detail
before
storing
it
will
help
protect
your
paint
from
salt
and
moisture
.
Be
sure
the
car
is
completely
dry
before
storing
it
or
you
could
trap
moisture
under
the
storage
material
,
potentially
causing
damage
to
your
car
’s
exterior
.

Hand
washing
,
rather
than
a
commercial
wash
,
is
recommended
.
You
also
want
to
polish
any
chrome
on
the
outside
of
your
vehicle
.
</item>
<item>
Do
n't
neglect
the
undercarriage
.
Stop
by
your
local
automotive
shop
for
some
rubberized
undercoating
or
WD-40
;
spraying
either
of
these
on
the
underside
of
your
car
will
provide
lasting
protection
.
</item>
<item>
Be
sure
you
wash
your
car
before
waxing
it
.
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/Wax-Your-Car">
How
you
wax
your
car
</ref>
will
depend
on
whether
you
are
applying
the
wax
by
hand
or
by
electronic
buffer
.

Fill
tires
with
extra
air
.
Before
storing
your
vehicle
,
check
the
pressure
on
the
tires
.
Filling
the
tires
with
a
little
extra
air
will
help
prevent
the
tires
from
going
flat
.

You
can
also
store
your
vehicle
on
jackstands
to
avoid
putting
any
pressure
on
the
tires
.
However
,
many
vehicle
frames
do
not
respond
well
to
this
type
of
storage
,
so
it
’s
best
to
check
with
a
local
mechanic
before
taking
advantage
of
this
option
.
</item>
<item>
You
can
also
put
2x10
inch
blocks
of
wood
beneath
each
tire
to
help
ease
the
pressure
of
parking
on
concrete
.

Select
a
waterproof
cover
.
Selecting
a
quality
cover
for
your
car
is
important
because
dust
and
grime
can
build
up
and
eventually
damage
your
car
's
exterior
.
A
normal
sheet
or
dust
cover
will
do
little
to
maintain
your
vehicle
.
When
deciding
what
cover
to
use
choose
be
sure
it
’s
waterproof
and
made
of
a
breathable
material
.

Be
sure
to
never
use
a
tarp
to
store
your
vehicle
.
It
will
scratch
your
paint
and
trap
moisture
against
your
car
.
</item>
<item>
If
you
are
able
to
store
your
car
in
a
garage
,
the
cover
is
not
as
necessary
.

Fill
the
tank
.
Leaving
your
gas
tank
empty
will
lead
to
unwanted
moisture
buildup
which
can
easily
cause
your
tank
to
rust
or
clog
.
The
more
gas
you
have
in
your
tank
,
the
less
air
space
,
and
the
less
you
have
to
worry
about
.

You
may
also
want
to
purchase
a
fuel
stabilizer
if
you
are
storing
your
car
for
longer
than
three
months
.
</item>

Check
fluids
like
oil
and
antifreeze
.
It
’s
best
to
change
your
oil
and
oil
filter
before
storing
,
giving
your
car
a
fresh
reservoir
to
work
with
.
It
's
also
essential
to
top
off
the
antifreeze
because
it
will
help
your
vehicle
maintain
the
same
level
of
efficiency
and
power
when
you
restart
it
.

Put
boxes
of
baking
soda
under
the
hood
.
Moisture
is
your
car
’s
worst
nightmare
during
storage
season
.
Soak
up
any
extra
moisture
by
putting
2-4
boxes
of
baking
soda
in
various
places
beneath
the
hood
.

Store
your
battery
separately
.
Store
the
battery
in
a
warm
room
as
cold
batteries
tend
to
crack
.
In
order
to
disconnect
your
battery
,
first
identify
the
negative
terminal
which
will
be
marked
by
black
plastic
and
a
minus
sign
.
Use
pliers
or
a
wrench
to
secure
and
then
remove
the
negative
.
Repeat
this
process
for
the
positive
terminal
.
Once
you
've
removed
the
nuts
,
remove
the
bracket
holding
your
battery
in
place
using
your
wrench
or
pliers
.
Now
all
you
have
left
to
do
is
lift
the
battery
out
and
move
it
to
a
warm
,
dry
location
.

Before
removing
the
battery
,
be
sure
your
car
is
off
,
and
your
gloves
and
goggles
are
on
.
You
should
also
be
wary
that
the
positive
and
negative
cables
do
not
touch
.
Also
,
do
not
let
the
positive
nut
touch
any
metal
as
it
could
be
potentially
dangerous
.
</item>
<item>
If
you
choose
to
keep
the
battery
in
the
car
,
you
will
need
to
have
someone
start
it
every
few
weeks
so
that
the
battery
does
not
lose
its
charge
.

Use
seat
covers
and
desiccant
to
avoid
moisture
buildup
.
The
cabin
of
your
car
is
as
prone
to
moisture
damage
as
the
rest
of
your
vehicle
.
Slipping
seat
covers
on
the
seats
and
tossing
a
few
cheap
packets
of
desiccant
on
the
floorboard
can
help
defend
against
potential
damage
.

It
’s
also
important
to
steam
clean
the
interior
far
in
advance
of
storage
,
since
the
steam
will
leave
a
fair
amount
of
moisture
behind
.

Store
dryer
sheets
and
mothballs
in
the
cabin
.
Mice
and
other
small
rodents
love
to
make
homes
out
of
inactive
vehicles
.
Throw
a
couple
dryer
sheets
and
mothballs
soaked
in
peppermint
in
or
on
your
car
to
help
deter
these
unwanted
roommates
.

You
can
also
set
traps
,
but
only
outside
of
the
car
:
a
dead
mouse
decomposing
in
your
car
is
not
going
to
lead
to
an
easy
spring
transition
.
</item>

You
can
also
put
steel
wool
in
the
pipes
to
prevent
critters
from
climbing
in
.

Do
n’t
set
the
parking
break
.
For
many
people
pulling
the
parking
break
is
a
habit
,
but
with
an
extended
period
of
time
there
is
a
possibility
that
your
brake
pads
could
meld
to
your
rotors
.
You
can
purchase
a
tire
stopper
if
you
are
worried
about
the
car
’s
movement
.

Detail
the
car
's
interior
.
Vacuum
your
car
and
remove
all
trash
.
Wrappers
and
food
particles
that
are
left
behind
will
attract
animals
and
lead
to
mold
if
left
unattended
.
