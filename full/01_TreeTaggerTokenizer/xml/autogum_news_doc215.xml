'
s
position
is
unique
,
and
there
is
a
complexity
and
a
difficulty
to
these
talks
&quot;
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.%20Nicholas%20Burns">
Nicholas
Burns
</ref>
told
reporters
at
the
end
of
two
days
of
discussions
with
the
Indian
Foreign
Secretary
,
Shyam
Saran
.
The
visit
by
the
US
Undersecretary
of
State
is
the
latest
in
a
series
of
diplomatic
missions
since
July
of
last
year
,
when
the
two
countries
agreed
to
co-operate
in
civil
nuclear
energy
projects
.
Saran
described
the
talks
as
friendly
and
very
intensive
and
said
&quot;
We
have
shared
with
the
United
States
our
plans
for
a
very
significant
expansion
of
our
civilian
nuclear
energy
capability
over
the
next
few
years
&quot;
.
The
two
also
exchanged
views
on
regional
issues
surrounding
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Iran">
Iran
</ref>
,
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Nepal">

</ref>
,
and

.
</p>
<p>
Saran
and
Burns
head
the
Indo-US
joint
working
group
on
civil
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Nuclear_power">
nuclear
energy
</ref>
cooperation
.
India
is
looking
to
nuclear
energy
as
a
solution
for
its
growing
energy
requirements
.
The
country
is
hoping
that
the
discussions
will
lead
to
the
lifting
of
restrictions
on
nuclear
technology
transfer
imposed
by
the
US
since
India
's
nuclear
tests
in
1998
.
The
US
has
requested
a
number
of
safeguards
in
exchange
.
India
has
been
asked
to
separate
its
military
and
civilian
nuclear
programmes
,
and
allow
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency">
International
Atomic
Energy
Agency
</ref>
(
IAEA
)
to
inspect
its
civilian
reactors
while
continuing
its
moratorium
on
nuclear
testing
.
If
the
deal
goes
through
,
the
US
would
be
making
an
exception
in
the
case
of
India
,
which
is
not
a
signatory
to
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear%20Non-Proliferation%20Treaty">
Nuclear
Non-Proliferation
Treaty
</ref>
(
NPT
)
.
The
two
sides
claimed
that
there
is
enough
good
will
and
trust
to
reach
an
agreement
while
admitting
to
have
encountered
difficulties
that
required
more
work
.

Later
this
year
,
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/George_W._Bush">
President
Bush
</ref>
is
expected
to
bestow
a
state
visit
to
the
country
.
The
trip
which
is
currently
planned
for
the
first
week
of
March
will
only
be
the
fifth
such
visit
by
a
US
President
to
India
.
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton">
Bill

was
the
last
president
to
visit
India
in
March
2000
.
</p>
<p>
The
two
countries
announced
a
significant
breakthrough
in
July
of
last
year
when
the
US
agreed
to
help
India
with
nuclear
fuel
for
its
Tarapur
reactor
.
This
was
a
huge
policy
change
since
India
had
been
denied
use
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dual-use%20technology">
dual-use
technology
</ref>
for
almost
three
decades
while
it
remained
outside
the
NPT
.
The
Bush
administration
defended
the
move
by
describing
India
as
a
responsible
nuclear
power
and
announced
that
it
would
work
with
the
US
Congress
on
passing
the
necessary
legislation
to
achieve
full
nuclear
energy
cooperation
with
India
.
</p>
<p>
The
agreement
has
some
members
of
the
Congress
concerned
with
opposition
from
both
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)">
Democrats
</ref>
and
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)">
Republicans
</ref>
.
Critics
believe
the
deal
could
harm
efforts
to
curb
the
spread
of
nuclear
weapons
and
potentially
jeopardize
the
NPT
.
The
agreement
also
hinges
on
the
details
surrounding
the
separation
of
India
's
military
and
civilian
nuclear
facilities
.
This
may
not
be
very
easy
as
some
of
the
country
's
nuclear
research
facilities
are
thought
to
contribute
to
both
fields
.
US
senator
John
Kerry
has
supported
the
deal
&quot;
in
principle
&quot;
while
saying
that
the
fine
print
of
the
agreement
would
need
to
be
studied
when
Congress
votes
on
the
issue
.
Kerry
is
a
member
of
the
US
Senate
Foreign
Relations
Committee
and
met
with
the
Indian
Prime
Minister
and
other
senior
officials
earlier
this
month
.

The
US
foreign
policy
towards
India
in
the
recent
past
shows
a
transformation
recognizing
it
as
an
emerging
global
power
and
also
an
important
player
in
regional
geo-politics
.
Some
believe
that
this
is
part
of
the
longer
term
US
effort
to
strengthen
relations
with
Asian
countries
to
counter
the
rise
of
China
.
</p>
<p>
Recently
,
Iran
's
nuclear
ambitions
have
been
the
cause
for
displeasure
in
Washington
.
US
alleges
that
it
is
attempting
to
build
nuclear
weapons
while
Iran
maintains
that
it
wants
the
technology
only
for
energy
purposes
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali%20Larijani">
Ali
Larijani
</ref>
,
the
chief
Iranian
negotiator
with
the
IAEA
complained
of
dual
standards
being
set
by
the
US
and
cited
India
as
an
example
.
Iran
is
bound
by
the
NPT
since
it
is
a
signatory
to
the
treaty
.
</p>
<p>
US
Undersecretary
Burns
dismissed
Larijani
's
remarks
calling
them
outrageous
and
saying
that
it
was
not
possible
to
compare
India
and
Iran
in
the
nuclear
sphere
.
&quot;
[
India
]
has
never
been
a
proliferator
,
and
has
been
very
responsible
in
safeguarding
its
nuclear
technology
.
On
the
other
hand
,
you
have
a
government
and
a
regime
in
Iran
,
which
the
IAEA
says
for
18
years
conducted
secret
nuclear
research
without
revealing
it
to
the
IAEA
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
India
which
has
had
a
long-standing
close
relationship
with
Iran
has
supported
the
initiative
taken
by
the
European-3
to
find
a
solution
to
the
issues
related
to
Iranian
nuclear
program
.
Saran
said
that
he
would
not
like
to
see
a
confrontation
developing
in
a
region
that
is
so
close
to
India
and
recommended
developing
an
international
consensus
.
India
which
is
looking
to
secure
its
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/natural%20gas">
natural
gas
</ref>
supplies
has
signed
a
deal
with
Iran
for
a
$
7
billion
gas
pipeline
project
.
This
deal
has
been
strongly
opposed
by
the
United
States
.
Work
is
expected
to
commence
in
2007
and
the
project
will
be
owned
and
operated
by
a
consortium
from
Iran
,
India
and
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Pakistan">
Pakistan
</ref>
as
well
as
some
international
energy
companies
.
