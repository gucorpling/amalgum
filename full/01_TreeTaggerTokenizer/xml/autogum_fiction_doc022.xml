CHAPTER
XXIV
</head>
<p>
TOM
was
a
glittering
hero
once
more
--
the
pet
of
the
old
,
the
envy
of
the
young
.
His
name
even
went
into
immortal
print
,
for
the
village
paper
magnified
him
.
There
were
some
that
believed
he
would
be
President
,
yet
,
if
he
escaped
hanging
.
</p>
<p>
As
usual
,
the
fickle
,
unreasoning
world
took
Muff
Potter
to
its
bosom
and
fondled
him
as
lavishly
as
it
had
abused
him
before
.
But
that
sort
of
conduct
is
to
the
world
's
credit
;
therefore
it
is
not
well
to
find
fault
with
it
.
</p>
<p>
Tom
's
days
were
days
of
splendor
and
exultation
to
him
,
but
his
nights
were
seasons
of
horror
.
Injun
Joe
infested
all
his
dreams
,
and
always
with
doom
in
his
eye
.
Hardly
any
temptation
could
persuade
the
boy
to
stir
abroad
after
nightfall
.
Poor
Huck
was
in
the
same
state
of
wretchedness
and
terror
,
for
Tom
had
told
the
whole
story
to
the
lawyer
the
night
before
the
great
day
of
the
trial
,
and
Huck
was
sore
afraid
that
his
share
in
the
business
might
leak
out
,
yet
,
notwithstanding
Injun
Joe
's
flight
had
saved
him
the
suffering
of
testifying
in
court
.
The
poor
fellow
had
got
the
attorney
to
promise
secrecy
,
but
what
of
that
?
Since
Tom
's
harassed
conscience
had
managed
to
drive
him
to
the
lawyer
's
house
by
night
and
wring
a
dread
tale
from
lips
that
had
been
sealed
with
the
dismalest
and
most
formidable
of
oaths
,
Huck
's
confidence
in
the
human
race
was
wellnigh
obliterated
.
</p>
<p>
Daily
Muff
Potter
's
gratitude
made
Tom
glad
he
had
spoken
;
but
nightly
he
wished
he
had
sealed
up
his
tongue
.
</p>
<p>
Half
the
time
Tom
was
afraid
Injun
Joe
would
never
be
captured
;
the
other
half
he
was
afraid
he
would
be
.
He
felt
sure
he
never
could
draw
a
safe
breath
again
until
that
man
was
dead
and
he
had
seen
the
corpse
.
</p>
<p>
Rewards
had
been
offered
,
the
country
had
been
scoured
,
but
no
Injun
Joe
was
found
.
One
of
those
omniscient
and
aweinspiring
marvels
,
a
detective
,
came
up
from
St.
Louis
,
moused
around
,
shook
his
head
,
looked
wise
,
and
made
that
sort
of
astounding
success
which
members
of
that
craft
usually
achieve
.
That
is
to
say
,
he
“
found
a
clew
.
”
But
you
ca
n't
hang
a
“
clew
”
for
murder
,
and
so
after
that
detective
had
got
through
and
gone
home
,
Tom
felt
just
as
insecure
as
he
was
before
.
</p>
<p>
The
slow
days
drifted
on
,
and
each
left
behind
it
a
slightly
lightened
weight
of
apprehension
.
</p>
<head>
CHAPTER
XXV
</head>
<p>
THERE
comes
a
time
in
every
rightly-constructed
boy
's
life
when
he
has
a
raging
desire
to
go
somewhere
and
dig
for
hidden
treasure
.
This
desire
suddenly
came
upon
Tom
one
day
.
He
sallied
out
to
find
Joe
Harper
,
but
failed
of
success
.
Next
he
sought
Ben
Rogers
;
he
had
gone
fishing
.
Presently
he
stumbled
upon
Huck
Finn
the
Red-Handed
.
Huck
would
answer
.
Tom
took
him
to
a
private
place
and
opened
the
matter
to
him
confidentially
.
Huck
was
willing
.
Huck
was
always
willing
to
take
a
hand
in
any
enterprise
that
offered
entertainment
and
required
no
capital
,
for
he
had
a
troublesome
superabundance
of
that
sort
of
time
which
is
not
money
.
“
Where
'll
we
dig
?
”
said
Huck
.
</p>
<p>
“
Oh
,
most
anywhere
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Why
,
is
it
hid
all
around
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
No
,
indeed
it
ai
n't
.
It
's
hid
in
mighty
particular
places
,
Huck
--
sometimes
on
islands
,
sometimes
in
rotten
chests
under
the
end
of
a
limb
of
an
old
dead
tree
,
just
where
the
shadow
falls
at
midnight
;
but
mostly
under
the
floor
in
ha'nted
houses
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Who
hides
it
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Why
,
robbers
,
of
course
--
who
'd
you
reckon
?
Sunday-school
sup'rintendents
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
do
n't
know
.
If
'
twas
mine
I
would
n't
hide
it
;
I
'd
spend
it
and
have
a
good
time
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
So
would
I.
But
robbers
do
n't
do
that
way
.
They
always
hide
it
and
leave
it
there
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Do
n't
they
come
after
it
any
more
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
No
,
they
think
they
will
,
but
they
generally
forget
the
marks
,
or
else
they
die
.
Anyway
,
it
lays
there
a
long
time
and
gets
rusty
;
and
by
and
by
somebody
finds
an
old
yellow
paper
that
tells
how
to
find
the
marks
--
a
paper
that
's
got
to
be
ciphered
over
about
a
week
because
it
's
mostly
signs
and
hy'roglyphics
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Hyro
--
which
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Hy'roglyphics
--
pictures
and
things
,
you
know
,
that
do
n't
seem
to
mean
anything
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Have
you
got
one
of
them
papers
,
Tom
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
No.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Well
then
,
how
you
going
to
find
the
marks
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
do
n't
want
any
marks
.
They
always
bury
it
under
a
ha'nted
house
or
on
an
island
,
or
under
a
dead
tree
that
's
got
one
limb
sticking
out
.
Well
,
we
've
tried
Jackson
's
Island
a
little
,
and
we
can
try
it
again
some
time
;
and
there
's
the
old
ha'nted
house
up
the
Still-House
branch
,
and
there
's
lots
of
dead-limb
trees
--
dead
loads
of
'
em
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Is
it
under
all
of
them
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
How
you
talk
!
No
!
”
</p>
<p>
“
Then
how
you
going
to
know
which
one
to
go
for
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Go
for
all
of
'
em
!
”
</p>
<p>
“
Why
,
Tom
,
it
'll
take
all
summer
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Well
,
what
of
that
?
Suppose
you
find
a
brass
pot
with
a
hundred
dollars
in
it
,
all
rusty
and
gray
,
or
rotten
chest
full
of
di'monds
.
How
's
that
?
”
</p>
<p>
Huck
's
eyes
glowed
.
</p>
<p>
“
That
's
bully
.
Plenty
bully
enough
for
me
.
Just
you
gimme
the
hundred
dollars
and
I
do
n't
want
no
di'monds
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
All
right
.
But
I
bet
you
I
ai
n't
going
to
throw
off
on
di'monds
.
Some
of
'
em
's
worth
twenty
dollars
apiece
--
there
ai
n't
any
,
hardly
,
but
's
worth
six
bits
or
a
dollar
.
