Biography
</head>
<p>
Sigbrit
Willoms
was
born
into
a
merchant
family
from
Amsterdam
.
One
of
her
two
brothers
,
Dionysius
Villoms
,
is
known
to
have
been
an
apothecary
.
She
is
known
to
have
been
educated
in
counting
,
reading
and
writing
in
the
language
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_German">
Low
German
</ref>
,
and
she
is
known
to
have
been
tutored
in
contemporary
herbal
medicine
.
</p>
<p>
She
belonged
to
one
of
the
Dutch
merchant
families
,
that
at
this
point
in
time
entered
into
competition
with
the
Germans
,
who
had
long
dominated
the
trade
in
the
Nordic
countries
.
At
an
unknown
date
,
she
moved
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergen">
Bergen
</ref>
,
Norway
,
where
she
is
known
to
have
lived
in
1507
,
in
the
company
of
her
brothers
.
</p>
<p>
She
is
known
to
have
had
a
son
,
Reynold
Sigbritss√∏n
,
who
is
otherwise
not
mentioned
.
As
none
of
her
children
are
called
illegitimate
,
Sigbrit
Willoms
must
have
been
married
,
but
her
husband
's
name
is
not
mentioned
anywhere
,
nor
is
it
known
when
he
died
:
he
may
have
been
named
Nicolaas
,
and
was
most
certainly
dead
by
1507
.
It
is
known
that
she
did
not
use
her
husband
's
name
,
as
she
used
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patronymic">
patronymic
</ref>
Willoms
or
Villoms(datter
)
.
</p>
<p>
She
was
the
mother
of
Dyveke
Sigbritsdatter
,
who
met
the
future
Danish
King
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_II_of_Denmark">

II
</ref>
in

,
the
close
confidant
of
Crown
Prince
Christian
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Valkendorf">
Erik
Valkendorf
</ref>
,
met
them
both
at
a
stand
in
the
market
where
they
sold
pastries
.
The
business
of
Sigbrit
Willoms
is
not
more
closely
mentioned
,
but
it
is
noted
that
she
still
had
a
business
company
in
Bergen
in
1519
.
In
1507
,
she
is
known

have
kept
an
inn
in
Bergen
,
and
to
have
sold
pastries
and
vine
on
the
market
and
in
the
harbor
.
Valkendorf
told
the
prince
about
Dyveke
's
beauty
,
and
the
prince
invited
mother
and
daughter
to
a
ball
,
after
which
Dyveke
,
with
the
consent
of
Sigbrit
,
became

</p>
<p>

influence
over

greater
after
the
death
of
her
daughter
in
1517
,
and
she
was
made
his
political
adviser
and
confidant
.

himself
.
</p>

Prince
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_of_Denmark">
Hans
</ref>
as

governess
.
</p>

The

put
her

</ref>
</hi>
royal
treasurer
and
Minister

</hi>
,
at
that
time
normally
an
honorary
title
for
the

of
a
family

</p>
<p>
Being
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourgeoisie">
bourgeoise
</ref>
,

was
known
for

,
she
instigated
a
new
law
about
hygiene
in
the
capital
city
of
Copenhagen
,
where
people
were
told
to
have
their
houses
cleaned
every
week
.
</p>
<p>
She
was
unpopular
with
the
nobility
,
and
the
target
of
public
slander
:
because
of
her
herbal
knowledge
,
her
critics
spread
rumors
that
she
was
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch">
witch
</ref>
,
and
she
was
blamed
for
being
the
person
behind
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_Bloodbath">
Stockholm
Bloodbath
</ref>
in
1520
.

Later
life
and
death

<p>
When
King
Christian
was
driven
out
of
Denmark
in

,
Sigbrit
followed
him
to
the
Netherlands
,
where
Christian
asked
for
aid
from
his
brother-in-law
,
the
emperor
.
The
emperor
made
the
condition
that
Christian
was
to
get
rid
of
Sigbrit
,
which
Christian
agreed
to
.
</p>
<p>
The
date
and
circumstances
of

death
are
unconfirmed
.
In
1532
,
a
woman
was
detained
in

prison
in
the
Netherlands
,
who
is
believed
to
have
been
Sigbrit
.
The
emperor
wished
to
have
