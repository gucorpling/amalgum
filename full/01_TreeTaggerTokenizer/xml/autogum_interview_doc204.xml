Jada
:
</hi>
It
’s
really
rare
you
get
people
saying
that
.

<p>
<hi rend="italic">
<hi rend="bold">
Alex
:
</hi>
</hi>
I
’m
still
high
from
the
session
,
because
of
that
conversation
we
had
and
he
thinks
this
is
going
to
make
him
a
better
person
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
That
you
are
going
to
help
him
.
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">
<hi rend="bold">
Alex
:
</hi>
</hi>
Yeah
,
because
<hi rend="italic">
he
</hi>
feels
that
way
.
I
do
n’t
know
if
this
type
of
thing…it
definitely
would
n’t
help
everybody
out
there
,
but
it
helps
some
people
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
The
people
who
see
you
,
it
does
help
them
.
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">
<hi rend="bold">
Alex
:
</hi>
</hi>
Well
,
yeah
,
you
know
,
for
some
people
it
is
just
a
means
to
an
end
—
it
’s
the
only
way
they
can
get
off
,
or
whatever
.
I
do
n’t
judge
anyone
.
But
I
find
it
really
fascinating
,
all
the
different
types
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
Are
they
typically
embarrassed
when
they
first
start
coming
in
here
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">
<hi rend="bold">
Alex

</hi>
</hi>
Some
are
,
and
some
are
n’t

<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Jada
:
</hi>
Yeah
,
some
are
and
some
are
n’t
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS

Depending
on
their
experience
or
their
comfort
level
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">
<hi rend="bold">
Alex
:
</hi>
</hi>
I
think
it
depends
on
how
people
have
reacted
to
them
in
the
past
,
as
you
can
imagine
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Jada
:
</hi>
Like
the
guy
I
was
seeing
.
He
was
originally
very
nervous
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">
<hi rend="bold">
Alex
:
</hi>
</hi>
Yeah
,
he
was
probably
embarrassed
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Jada
:
</hi>
We
’ve
had
a
few
people
come
in
,
get
nervous
,
and
are
like
,
“
I…I…I
do
n’t
know
what
I
should
say
,
or
what
I
can
tell
you
.

How
do
you
make

feel
comfortable
?

</hi>
Anything
they
have
to
say

<hi rend="bold">
Alex
:
</hi>
</hi>
Yeah
,
sometimes
they
are
like
,
“
Oh
,
this
might
sound
weird
…
”
and
I
’m
like
,
“
Trust
me
,
it
does
n’t
sound
weird
!
”
Not
to
make
them
feel
like
they
are
one
of
a
thousand
.
I
try
to
let
them
know
that
I
appreciate
their
being
honest
with
me
,
and
I
find
it
interesting
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
What
do
you
think
in
your
own
histories
has
made
you
so
non-judgmental
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">
<hi rend="bold">
Alex
:
</hi>
</hi>
Well
,
that
would
be
getting
into
personal
information
I
would
n’t
want
to
talk
about
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Jada
:
</hi>
Yeah
.
You
ca
n’t
be
judgmental
in
this
industry
.
You
have
to
be
open-minded
.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">

do
people

<hi rend="bold">
Jada

</hi>
I
’ve
had
some
like
that
.
There
have
been
a
few
fetishes
that
are
racial
play

or
war
related

</hi>
</hi>
People
come
here
with
things
to
work
out
.
Maybe
they
’ve
been
traumatized

maybe
they
have
some
issue
.
They
come
here
with
things

I
have
n’t
run
into
anyone
,

I
would
n’t
be
surprised

<p>
<hi rend="bold">

veterans

</hi>
</hi>
Yeah

I

seen

</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
So
you
were
saying
you
have
war-related
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Jada
:
</hi>
I
’m
not
sure
how
it
develops
with
an
individual
.
But
usually
the
request
is
a
specific
type
of
role
play
,
like
I
am
the
German
Nazi
and
this
is
the
Jew
and
I
have
to
punish
him
in
some
sense
.
