After
he
was
discharged
from
the
supervision
of
Dr
Arbuthnot
,
he
was
entrusted
to
the
care
of
Mrs.
Titchbourn
,
one
of
the
Queen
's
bedchamber
women
,
with
a
handsome
pension
annexed
to
the
charge
.
Mrs.
Titchbourn
usually
spent
a
few
weeks
every
summer
at
the
house
of
Mr.
James
Fenn
,
a
yeoman
farmer
,
at
Axter
's
End
,
in
the
parish
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northchurch">
Northchurch
</ref>
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertfordshire">

.
Peter
was
left
there
in
the
care
of
Mr.
Fenn
,
who
was
allowed
£35
a
year
for
his
support
and
maintenance
.
After
the
death
of
Mr.
Fenn
,
Peter
was
transferred
to
the
care
of
James
's
brother
,
Thomas
,
at
another
farmhouse
,
called
Broadway
,
where
he
lived
with
the
several
successive
tenants
of
that
farm
,
and
with
the
same
government
pension
,
to
the
time
of
his
death
.
</p>
<p>
In
the
late
summer
of
1751
,
Peter
went
missing
from
Broadway
Farm
and
could
not
be
traced
.
Advertisements
were
placed
in
newspapers
offering
a
reward
for
his
safe
return
.
On
22
October
1751
,
a
fire
broke
out
in
the
parish
of
St
Andrew
's
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwich">
Norwich
</ref>
.
As
the
fire
spread
,
the
local
gaol
became
engulfed
in
smoke
and
flame
.
The
frightened
inmates
were
hastily
released
and
one
aroused
considerable
curiosity
on
account
of
his
remarkable
appearance
,
excessively
hirsute
and
strong
,
and
the
nature
of
the
sounds
he
made
,
which
led
some
to
describe
him
as
an
orangutan
.
Some
days
later
,
he
was
identified
as
Peter
the
Wild
Boy
,
possibly
through
a
description
of
him
in
the
<hi rend="italic">
London
Evening
Post
</hi>
.
He
was
returned
to
Thomas
Fenn
's
farm
,
and
had
a
special
leather
collar
with
his
name
and
address
made
for
him
to
wear
in
future
,
should
he
ever
stray
again
.

Peter
lived
to
an
estimated
70
years
of
age
.
He
was
visited
in
1782
by
the
Scottish
philosopher
and
judge
James
Burnett
and
was
said
to
have
a
healthy
complexion
with
a
full
white
beard
and
apparently
understood
what
was
said
to
him
but
was
himself
only
capable
of
saying
the
words
&quot;
Peter
&quot;
and
&quot;
King
George
&quot;
and
humming
a
few
songs
.

to
be

Various
