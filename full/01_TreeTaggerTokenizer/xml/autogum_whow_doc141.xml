Take
Back
an
Apology
</head>
<p>
There
are
many
times
when
we
feel
compelled
to
apologize
for
a
wrongdoing
and
we
know
it
's
the
right
thing
to
do
.
Sometimes
,
however
,
an
apology
is
given
on
grounds
that
later
turn
out
to
be
untrue
,
inaccurate
,
or
show
that
our
understanding
was
the
more
appropriate
and
by
giving
an
apology
,
we
undermine
our
own
principles
or
sense
of
well-being
with
others
.
Taking
back
an
apology
should
be
done
rarely
,
if
at
all
,
but
sometimes
,
it
can
be
an
essential
way
for
you
to
move
forward
after
an
incident
.

Think
through
why
you
want
to
retract
your
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Apologize">
apology
</ref>
.
It
's
important
that
the
reasons
for
your
retraction
are
honest
,
realistic
,
and
based
on
good
grounds
.
Some
examples
of
why
you
might
feel
the
need
to
take
back
an
apology
include
:

If
you
apologized
for
saying
something
about
a
person
who
claimed
it
was
untrue
but
then
facts
later
reveal
that
what
you
said
was
spot
on
,
you
might
feel
the
need
to
retract
your
apology
and
return
to
your
former
comments
,
publicly
.
</item>
<item>
Perhaps
where
you
apologized
but
the
person
receiving
the
apology
has
continued
to
trash
you
and
drag
you
through
the
mud
despite
you
offering
to
be
conciliatory
.
Of
course
,
this
needs
to
be
weighed
with
you
trying
to
rise
above
their
&quot;
gutter-sniping
&quot;
.

From
a
professional
standpoint
,
you
might
feel
that
without
a

of
your
apology
,
facts

research
,
or
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/See_Things_from_Different_Points_of_View">
viewpoints

that
you
uphold
or
promote
might
be
compromised

You
're
still

your

Consider
how
the
apology
and
a
retraction
will
be
viewed
by
others
.
People
viewing
the
situation
will
often
see
it
for
what
it
is
much
of
the
time
,
and
will
understand
your
role
.
It
is
important
to
give
credit
to
people
for
seeing
the
situation
with
some
level
of
being
on
your
side
if
your
original
apology
turns
out
to
have
been
based
on
the
other
person
's
falsehoods
or
inaccuracies
.

If
you
do
n't
think
that
is
the
case
,
however
,
perhaps
an
explanation
of
your
&quot;
regrets
&quot;
and
&quot;
feelings
&quot;
is
better
than
an
outright
retraction
of
an
apology
.
</item>
<item>
On
the
other
hand
,
if
the
apology
concerns
your
principles
,
something
that
you
stand
for
professionally
,
or
something
that
will
impact
your
future
career
,
then
there
may
be
a
good
reason
to
retract
it
openly
and
with
clarity

Is
a
retraction
of
an
apology
essential
to
set
a
record
straight
,
such
as
about
scientific/economic/research
facts
?
In
this
case
,
you
may
have
no
choice
in

to
ensure
professional
integrity
and
data

Consider
whether
the
energy
expended
on
retracting
your
apology
is
worth
it
.
Sometimes
it
is
better
to
let
bygones
be
bygones
and
to
live
with
such

bump

your
life

especially
where
the
alternative
is
to
stir
the
hornet
's
nest
again
and
throw
you
back
into
a
frenzied
debate
.
It
really
depends
on
whether
or
not
the
principle
or
issues
at
stake
really
matter
to
you
and
how
you
consider
your
standing
in
the
public
sphere
will
appear
if
you
do
or
do
n't
retract
the
apology
.

Find
the
right
words
.
Equally
important
as
to
understanding
the
why
of
taking
back
an
apology
,
and
working
through
the
consequences
,
is
the
how
.
Finding
the
right
words
will
be
easier
if
you
remain
calm
,
level-headed
and
cautious
in
your
approach
.
It
is
n't
possible
to
create
a
one-size-fits-all
apology
retraction
,
as
each
answer
needs
to
fit
who
you
are
,
what
the
situation
is
,
and
who
you
're
taking
back
the
apology
from
,
but
here
are
some
ideas
to
inspire
you

I
realize
that
the
matter
X
was
really
important
to
you
.
Facts
since
have
shown
me
however
,
that
you
were
not
speaking
in
good
faith
about
the
matter
X.
And
since
the
new
facts
have
come
to
light
,
I
no
longer
believe
I
was
wrong
to
say
what
I
said
,
therefore
I
withdraw
my
apology
and
return
to
supporting
what
I
said
before
my
apology
.
&quot;
</item>
<item>
&quot;
I
regret
the
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Avoid_a_Confrontation">
confrontation
</ref>
we
've
had
over
the
past
few
weeks
.
I
apologized
in
good
faith
but
I
no
longer
believe
that
my
apology
was
appropriate
and
I
take
it
back
.
I
wish
you
all
the
very
best
.

I
am
sorry
that
you
feel
so
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Control_Anger">
angry
</ref>
/disappointed
,
etc.
about
matter
X
but
my
apology
was
aimed
at
what
I
said
about
matter
X
,
not
at
you
.
I
still
remain
firm
in
my
conviction
that
matter
X
is
a
dangerous
menace
to
society
and
I
retract
my
apology
over
that
statement
,
although
I
still
defend
your
right
to
speak
your
own
mind
about
it
.
&quot;

<item>
&quot;
I
take
back
my
apology
to
you
about
X
matter
.
I
do
n't
feel
that
you
played
fair
and
I
know
now
that
you
lied
to
me
.
I
am
willing
to
keep
talking
about
it
with
you
but
I
am
not
apologizing
for
my
take
on
it
.

Do
not
rub
salt
into
the
wound
.
The
best
means
for
withdrawing
an
apology
is
to
do
it
,
then
leave
it
.
You
will
most
likely
stir
up
some
sort
of
controversy
whether
it
's
a
love
tiff
,
a
workplace
disagreement
,
or
a
legislative
fisticuffs
.
From
this
point
on
,
you
simply
have
to
be
prepared
to
uphold
your
choice
and
to
get
on
with
your
life
.
Do
not
keep
badgering
,
hounding
,
or
repeating
the
matter
-
it
's
done
with
,
and
you
've
made
your
point
.
