<p>
Makassar
was
the
traditional
capital
of
the
Bugis
kingdom
(
Sultanate
of
Gowa
)
.
The
Bugis
were
known
throughout
the
region
as
proud
,
fierce
warriors
and
pirates
and
highly
skilled
mariners
,
and
before
the
Dutch
defeated
them
,
they
had
a
formidable
empire
and
sphere
of
influence
in
what
the
Europeans
called
the
&quot;
Spice
Islands
&quot;
.
The
Bugis
also
traded
throughout
the
region
,
and
you
can
find
Bugis
people
today
in
many
other
parts
of
Indonesia
and
beyond
.

<p>

cuisine
,
based
as

,
is
highly
prized
throughout
the
region
,
so
make
sure
to
have
some
while

On-demand

services
such

are
ubiquitous
can
be
booked
through
their
respective
smartphone
apps

offer
generally
cheaper
fares
which
are
stated
in

Payments
can
be
made
by
cash

using
stored
value
(
akin

Go-Jek
as

more
widespread
availability
;
those
who
travel
here

find
it

to
keep
using
Grab

The
other
more
expensive
on-demand
ojek
service
is
Lady
Jek
with
female
drivers
.
Unlike
conventional
ojeks
,
which
typically
only
operate
dawn
to
dusk
,
they
are
available
24
hours
and
relatively
safe
for
both
passengers
and
drivers
because
they
are
monitored
by
GPS
.
While
it
seems
cheap
,
those
who
travel
in
groups
of
at
least
three
may
be
better
off
taking
a
taxi
for
convenience
and
unnoticeable
difference
