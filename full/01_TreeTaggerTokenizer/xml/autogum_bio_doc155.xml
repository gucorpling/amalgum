had
visited
Britain
on

prior
to

employed
as

Some
time
prior
to
May
1967
,
and
probably
during
his
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeymoon">
honeymoon
</ref>
,
he
had
been
approached
in
his
home
country
by
two
compatriots
who
were
operating
as
agents
for
the
USSR
.
They
proposed
to
provide
finances
enabling
Dorschel
to
acquire
a
small
hotel
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunoon">
Dunoon
</ref>
,
Scotland
,
by
use
of
which
he
would
be
able
to
obtain
information
from
local
US
service
personnel
regarding
fleet
movements
and
facilities
at
their

.
The
information
would
be
passed
on
by
Dorschel
to
the
agents
.
In
April
,
Dorschel
rented
a
house
at
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter's_Quay">
Hunter
's
Quay
</ref>
.
This
provided
him
with
a
good
view
of
activity
at
the
Polaris
base

Having

describe

as
a

a

little

and
amateurish

the
sentencing

recorded
that

<p>
This
case
,
I
am
satisfied
,
is
by
no
means
as
serious
as
some
which
have
happened
in
recent
years
[

it

this
was

through

reported
that
,
despite
the
seriousness
of
the
charge
,
the
court
hearing
had
been
&quot;
marked
by
some
moments
of
levity
on
the
public

drolleries
from
the
legal
participants
&quot;
.
One
instance
giving
rise
to
this
was
a
statement
regarding
Dorschel
's
naivety
:
he
had
been
asked
to
supply
photographs
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hythe,_Kent">
Hythe
</ref>
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poole">

</ref>
to
his
spymasters
and
had
instead
sent
picture
postcards
.
Fairbairn
noted
that
&quot;
If
this
is
how
foreign
espionage
in
matters
as
important
as
nuclear
submarines
is
conducted
,
we
have
little
to
fear
from
it
