Hey
everyone
,
I
hate
to
be
the
bearer
of
bad
news
right
before
our
(
now
previous
)
launch
date
,
but
we
have
to
delay
the
release
again
for
a
few
days
.
Long
story
short
-
we
were
pretty
late
in
properly
optimizing
Budget
Cuts
,
thinking
we
would
n't
need
as
much
time
as
we
actually
did
.
The
optimizations
we
implemented
in
this
final
stretch
,
while
useful
,
ended
up
not
helping
as
much
as
we
had
hoped
.
We
thought
our
initial
delay
of
two
weeks
would
be
enough
,
but
even
throughout
these
last
few
days
,
working
into
the
night
and
firing
on
all
cylinders
to
get
performance
up
,
we
're
still
not
hitting
an
acceptable
and
consistent
framerate
.
We
were
too
optimistic
,
and
we
're
very
sorry
about
that
:(
We
've
worked
hard
on
this
game
for
such
a
long
time
now
,
we
're
so
very
excited
to
finally
get
it
into
your
hands
!
However
,
we
'd
hate
to
have
all
it
diminished
by
a
laggy
experience
,
especially
the
ones
we
could
fix
with
just
a
little
bit
more
time
.
I
hope
this
is
all
understandable
.
We
're
just
as
disappointed
about
delays
and
framerate
issues
as
you
are
.
So
,
when
will
the
game
release
?
The
honest
answer
is
that
we
do
n't
know
,
but
it
's
going
to
be
as
soon
as
the
game
is
as
performant
and
stable
as
it
should
be
.
I
'd
like
to
say
we
're
releasing
soon
,
but
that
meant
2.5
years
<ref target="https://youtu.be/gbp7xX9QPOc?t=44">
last
time
we
used
that
term
</ref>
,
so
I
'm
going
to
say
&quot;
in
5
minutes
&quot;
which
should
mean
approximately
1-2
weeks
.
Will
it
take
longer
?
Maybe
,
maybe
not
.
It
's
very
hard
to
predict
when
the
issues
we
're
facing
have
many
unknown
variables
and
moving
parts
,
which
is
why
we
're
not
ready
with
a
specific
release
date
.
Maybe
we
'll
time
it
perfectly
with
E3
,
to
make
sure
our
game
will
be
drowned
out
by
all
of
the
other
announcements
!
Now
,
in
case
you
're
curious
about
what
exactly
is
going
on
internally
,
here
are
the
most
critical
issues
we
're
facing
!
<hi rend="bold">
Occlusion
Culling
Unity
's
Occlusion
system
has
been
particularly
bad
in
our
case
.
It
's
pretty
flaky
and
unreliable
,
and
given
how
our
levels
are
set
up
,
it
should
work
much
better
than
it
actually
is
.
The
problem
that
occurs
when
occlusion
is
broken
,
is
that
the
game
will
render
objects
that
are
in
rooms
much
further
away
,
that
you
ca
n't
even
see
.
While
the
GPU
does
n't
have
any
issues
working
through
these
draw
calls
in
general
,
the
CPU
main
thread
ca
n't
keep
up
with
setting
them
all
up
.
We
are
talking
to
Unity
about
this
,
as
well
as
working
on
an
internal
workaround
in
parallel
,
so
we
're
on
track
to
solving
this
one
.
</hi>
Audio
performance
We
've
been
using
the
Steam
Audio
middleware
in
order
to
make
all
of
our
audio
much
more
believable
,
but
we
have
been
seeing
pretty
heavy
CPU
performance
spikes
whenever
we
play
sounds
in
some
situations
,
which
,
along
with
the
occlusion
performance
issues
,
<hi rend="bold">
also
</hi>
happens
on
the
main
thread
.
In
some
places
,
the
spikes
were
so
severe
that
SteamVR
kicked
you
out
to
the
compositor
for
a
few
frames
.
In
cooperating
with
Valve
in
solving
this
,
it
turns
out
that
the
biggest
issue
lies
in
how
Unity
is
interfacing
with
audio
plugins
,
as
we
experienced
the
same
issue
when
trying
out
the
Oculus
spatializer
.
We
're
in
talks
with
both
Valve
and
Unity
,
and
it
's
actually
looking
pretty
promising
,
as
we
've
been
able
to
identify
exactly
where
and
why
it
happens
!
As
for
the
benefits
of
this
type
of
audio
,
the
difference
is
pretty
stark
.
You
can
think
of
it
as
the
difference
of
hearing
where
and
in
what
type
of
room
a
sound
is
playing
from
,
even
with
your
eyes
closed
,
as
opposed
to
just
hearing
a
flat
2D
sound
.
I
'm
sure
/u/wrenchse
is
now
upset
that
I
totally
misrepresented
exactly
how
nice
having
spatialized
audio
is
,
but
he
can
elaborate
if
you
're
curious
to
hear
more
details
!
<hi rend="bold">
Rare
progression-blocking
bugs
We
have
a
few
progression
blocking
bugs
that
can
sometimes
happen
throughout
the
game
.
They
've
been
on
our
radar
for
a
while
,
but
with
our
laser-focus
on
getting
performance
fixed
,
we
have
n't
had
time
to
fix
all
of
these
yet
.
</hi>
A
weird
screen
glitch
we
get
when
framerate
drops
on
our
Oculus
Native
build
This
is
more
of
a
secondary
problem
of
the
framerate
issues
,
but
for
some
reason
we
have
a
screen
glitch
when
the
framerate
drops
below
90
fps
,
where
the
lower
portion
of
the
view
is
covered
by
what
looks
like
a
clamped/stretched
version
of
the
screen
buffer
,
that
gets
progressively
worse
the
lower
your
framerate
is
.
This
seems
to
happen
only
when
running
on
Oculus
Native
.
We
're
talking
to
Oculus
to
solve
these
things
!
This
could
simply
be
an
oversight
on
our
end
,
with
how
we
implemented
the
Oculus
SDK
.
*
Some
users
seem
to
have
framerate
issues
unique
to
Oculus
Native
This
one
has
been
hard
to
pin
down
,
because
we
're
not
having
those
issues
ourselves
.
It
seems
like
one
reason
could
be
if
people
are
running
SteamVR
at
the
same
time
as
Oculus
Home
and
Budget
Cuts
,
but
we
have
to
look
into
this
further
.
That
is
all
for
now
!
We
have
been
looking
forward
to
this
release
with
so
much
excitement
,
and
it
feels
really
bad
to
subject
you
to
another
wait
,
especially
this
close
to
our
previous
launch
date
.
However
,
we
believe
you
all
deserve
a
performant
game
,
that
will
let
you
experience
it
the
way
it
was
meant
to
be
played
,
even
if
that
means
you
'll
get
it
slightly
later
.
On
behalf
of
the
Budget
Cuts
team
-
we
're
truly
sorry
,
and
hope
you
're
all
okay
with
waiting
just
a
little
bit
more

serioulsly
do
n't

<p>
please
just
take
care
also
about
the
performance
on
