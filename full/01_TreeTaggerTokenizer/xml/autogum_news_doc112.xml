has

will
remain
as

,
while

is
set
to
be
sworn
in
as
prime
minister
on
February
11
.
</p>
<p>
Despite
the
agreement
,
Tsvangirai
and
other
MDC
members
expressed
disappointment
over
the
terms
of
the
unity
government
.
&quot;
We
are
not
saying
that
this
is
a
solution
to
the
Zimbabwe
crisis
,
&quot;
Tsvangirai
told
reporters
.
&quot;
Instead
,
our
participation
signifies
that
we
have
chosen
to
continue
the
struggle
for
a
democratic
Zimbabwe
in
a
new
arena
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Among
the
MDC
's
concerns
is
the
home
affairs
ministry
,
which
oversees
the
police
and
security
forces
.
Under
the
power
sharing
agreement
,
Mugabe
and
Tsvangirai
will
share
control
of
this
ministry
,
and
the
MDC
says
Mugabe
could
use
that
power
to
quell
dissent
as
he
had
in
the
past
.
</p>
<p>
Tsvangirai
signed
the
agreement
to
take
part
in
a
unity
government
at
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern%20African%20Development%20Community">

Opposition
leaders
had
been
pressing
Mugabe
to
relinquish
control
of
the
home
affairs
ministry
and
release
imprisoned
political
activists
as
part
of
the
power
sharing
deal
.
But
Tsvangirai
's
party
said
they
were
pressured
into
accepting
the
deal
by
the
SADC
,
who
refused
to
condemn
Mugabe
.

We

in

the

said
Odinga

should
stand
up

tell

Mugabe
enough

It
is
time

him

Meanwhile
,
Western

such
as

remained
skeptical

If
and
when
there
is

the

<p>
Mugabe
claimed
victory
in
a
runoff
election
in
June
2008
which
was
widely
seen
by
the
international
community
as
flawed
.
Earlier
in
March
,
Tsvangirai
had
garnered
more
votes
than
Mugabe
in
the
general
election
,
but
the
electoral
commission
said
the
opposition
candidate
did
not
receive
a
required
majority
of
the
votes
.
Tsvangirai
then
dropped
out
of
the
June
runoff
,
claiming
his
supporters
had
been
attacked
and
intimidated
by
state
officials
.
</p>
<p>
Regional
heads
of
government
have
been
trying
to

negotiate
a
coalition
government
</ref>
since
the
election
.
Neither
side
had
been
able
to
come
to
an
agreement
over
the
distribution
of
cabinet
posts
.
Tsvangirai
sought
a
constitutional
amendment
to
recreate
the
post
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime%20Minister%20of%20Zimbabwe">
Prime
Minister
</ref>
,
whilst
Mugabe
had
wished
to

In
the
past
year
,
Zimbabwe
's
economy
has
gone
into
freefall
,
with
inflation
so
high
as
to
be
effectively
unmeasurable
,
and
an
outbreak
of
cholera
that
has
resulted
in
over
60,000
cases
reported
and
over
3,100
killed
.
6.9
million
people
,
more
than
half
the

is
in
