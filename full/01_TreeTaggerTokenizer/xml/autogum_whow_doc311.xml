a
Spoon
</head>
<p>
Although
proper
spoon
use
varies
from
culture
to
culture
,
you
can
learn
a
universal
way
to
hold
a
spoon
to
allow
for
the
widest
field
of
motion
.
The
trick
is
to
rest
the
spoon
on
your
bottom
three
fingers
and
allow
your
wrist
to
do
most
of
the
work
.

Eat
slowly
and
gently
.
Foods
that
you
eat
with
a
spoon
are
frequently
liquid
based
.
It
is
easy
to
make
slurping
noises
when
eating
with
a
spoon
.
To
minimize
noise
when
eating
,
eat
very
slowly
.
Make
sure
to
open
your
mouth
wide
enough
to
get
food
in
without
having
to
resort
to
slurping
.

Keep
your
grip
firm
.
Make
sure
to
grip
firmly
on
your
spoon
when
you
eat

to
drop
your
spoon
,
which
can
cause
a
mess
and
loud
noises
.
Keep
your
grip
firm
enough
that
the
spoon
does
not
wobble
in
your
hands
while
