The
Isle
of
Man
prides
itself
on
the
quality
and
variety
of
its
locally
produced
food
and
drink
–
from
freshly
caught
seafood
,
to
succulent
meat
and
specially
brewed
beers
and
spirits
.
</p>
<p>
A
visit
to
the
island
really
is
the
perfect
opportunity
to
see
what
the
local
producers
,
farmers
and
fishermen
do
best
.
</p>
<p>
If
you
’re
a
fan
of
seafood
try
traditional
Manx
Kippers
which
are
herring
fillets
that
have
been
smoked
over
hot
oak
chips
,
or
Manx
Queen
Scallops
-
Queenies
as
they
are
more
commonly
known
-
which
are
sustainably
sourced
from
Manx
waters
.
</p>
<p>
If
you
prefer
meat
you
’ll
find
a
large
selection
to
choose
from
including
the
rich
and
tasty
Loaghtan
Lamb
-
which
comes
from
an
unusual
horned
sheep
which
is
believed
to
have
been
brought
to
the
island
by
the
Vikings
.
</p>
<p>
And
for
those
visitors
with
a
sweet
tooth
,
make
sure
you
do
n’t
miss
out
on
creamy
Manx
ice
cream
,
handmade
confectionary
and
traditional
cakes
including
the
Manx
Bonnag
.
One
favourite
,
of
tourists
and
residents
alike
,
is
Davison
's
Ice
Cream
on
Douglas
Promenade
.
</p>
<p>
You
’ll
be
able
to
sample
this
produce
at
the
regular
farmers
’
markets
,
supermarkets
and
a
variety
of
cafes
,
pubs
and
restaurants
around
the
island
.
</p>
<p>
Food

more
expensive
than

to
pay
upwards
of
£30
per
head
for

meal
in
a
restaurant
