But
they
see
it
as
voluntary
service
.
It
’s
a
voluntary
army
.

</hi>
I
wish
that
it
really
were
.
I
think
nobody
who
volunteered
for
it
was
volunteering
for
the
tours
of
duty
—
even
forget
the
danger
they
are
facing
—
but
the
extended
time
,
it
’s
off
the
charts
.
Chuck
Hagel
today
gave
us
the
exact
details
,
so
do
n’t
quote
me
on
this
because
he
’s
an
expert
and
I
’m
not
,
but
the
order
of
magnitude
used
to
be
7
months
,
but
now
it
’s
15
months
,
or
18
months
,
or
21
months
,
and
then
it
’s
being
doubled
and
you
are
not
able
to
have
leave
in
between
.
So
,
they
volunteered
for
one
type
of
duty
in
terms
of
the
amount
of
time
,
but
they
are
getting
something
entirely
different
from
that
.
Number
two
is
query
how
realistic
the
choice
is
for
the
people
who
are
going
into
it
if
they
do
n’t
have
many
other
options
—
or
any
other
options
—
to
get
an
education
,
to
get
a
job
,
to
get
the
skills
and
the
training
—

Senator
Brownback
told
me
</ref>
he
is
against
conscription
,
and
it
’s
interesting
that
the
people
who
are
most
for
the
war
are
the
people
who
are
most
for
a
voluntary
army
.

Maybe
they
believe
that
those
would
be
the
people
who
are
most
highly-motivated
.
I
mean
in
theory
,
you
would
see
that
advantage

Rangel
’s
bent
is
that
if
people
were
actually
fighting
in
the
wars
,
or
forced
to
fight
,
that
it
would
bring
public
opinion
against
the
war
.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">
NS
:
</hi>
I
think
in
terms
of
Constitutional
Law
terms
,
but
remember
that
famous
old
case
by
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John%20Marshall">
John
Marshall
</ref>
,
<hi rend="italic">
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCulloch%20v.%20Maryland">
McCulloch
v.
Maryland
</ref>
</hi>
,
where
the
state
of
Maryland
was
not
allowed
to
tax
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank%20of%20the%20United%20States">
Bank
of
the
United
States
</ref>
,
and
he
set
out
a
principle
that
is
a
pervasive
equal
protection
principle
,
that
those
who
are
going
to
bear
the
burden
should
have
an
opportunity
to
participate
in
the
decision-making
.
This
is
the
flip
side
of
it
;
you
may
not
impose
the
burden
unless
you
are
sharing
in
the
responsibility
.
There
’s
an
accountability
,
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocity">
reciprocity
</ref>
that
State
A
may
not
impose
a
tax
on
State
B
is
the
same
thing
as
saying
,
people
who
are
not
fighting
the
war
may
not
send
off
those
who
are
.

DS

Do
you
think
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement%20to%20impeach%20George%20W.%20Bush">
George
Bush
should
be
impeached
</ref>
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
NS
:
</hi>
I
think
there
is
a
case
for
him
to
be
impeached
,
but
I
do
n’t
think
it
would
be
a
good
idea
.
The
reason
I
say
there
is
a
case
because
partly
under
the
Constitution
it
’s
high
crimes
and
misdemeanors
,
which
are
not
defined
and
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment%20of%20Bill%20Clinton">
latest
precedent
we
have
is
having
a
blow
job
</ref>
in
the
Oval
Office
and
lying
about
it
is
considered
to
be
a
high
crime
and
misdemeanor
.
Well
,
Bush
,
has
clearly
lied
to
Congress
,
the
American
People
,
to
the
media
about
much
more
serious
infractions
and
violations
of
the
Constitution
.
He
’s
had
a
view
that
as
Commander-in-Chief
he
can
do
whatever
he
wants
,
that
he
’s
above
the
law
,
that
he
does
n’t
have
to
abide
by
the
laws
that
are
duly
passed
by
Congress
.
In
one
breath
he
is
signing
them
,
and
in
another
breath
he
is
saying
he
does
n’t
have
to
follow
them
.
So
,
I
think
if
what
Clinton
did
can
be
considered
a
high
crime
and
misdemeanor
then
what
Bush
did
could
be
.
