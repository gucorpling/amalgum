Introduction

<p>
Acrylamide
,
a
thermal
processing
contaminant
with
a
low
molecular
weight
,
which
is
soluble
in
water
,
is
formed
when
carbohydrate-rich
foods
are
subjected
to
temperatures
above
120
°C
in
low-moisture
conditions
,
such
as
frying
,
roasting
or
baking
.
Several
studies
consider
Maillard
reactions
to
be
the
main
pathway
for
acrylamide
,
5
hydroxymethylfurfural
,
methylglyoxal
–
lysine
dimers
,
Nε
–
carboxymethyl
–
lysine
and
pyrraline
formation
in
processed
foods
,
particularly
reactions
between
the
carbonyl
group
of
reducing
sugars
and
amino
acids
.
Initial
reports
showed
relatively
high
concentrations
of
acrylamide
in
high-carbohydrate
foodstuffs
,
such
as
crispy
bread
,
breakfast
cereals
,
pastries
,
coffee
,
French
fries
and
crisps
.
In
general
,
potato
products
present
higher
acrylamide
contents
(
250
–
4000
µg
kg−1
)
compared
to
other
food
products
,
because
of
the
higher
concentration
of
asparagine
in
potato
tubers
.

<p>
Acrylamide
has
been
classified
by
the
Agency
for
Research
on
Cancer
as
“
probably
carcinogenic
to
humans
”
(
Group
2A
)
and
,
in
the
latest
report
from
the
European
Food
Safety
Authority
Expert
Panel
on
Contaminants
in
the
Food
Chain
(
CONTAM
,
2015
)
,
the
margins
of
exposure
for
acrylamide
lead
to
concerns
regarding
their
neoplastic
effects
,
based
on
animal
evidence
.
Therefore
,
the
European
Commission
recently
established
“
indicative
”
levels
for
the
presence
of
acrylamide
in
food
,
suggesting
a
limit
of
750
µg
kg−1
for
crisps
.
Previously
,
the
European
Union
and
FDA
had
encouraged
food
industries
to
reduce
the
presence
of
this
contaminant
.
</p>
<p>
In
response
to
this
,
the
food
industry
has
been
forced
to
apply
different
strategies
to
reduce
acrylamide
formation
,
applying
processing
modifications
according
to
recommendations
published
by
the
European
Food
and
Drink
Federation
in
the
document
“
Acrylamide
Toolbox
”
,
which
includes
the
following
variables
:
temperature
and
time
during
frying
,
blanching
treatment
,
and
thickness
of
potato
slices
.
However
,
the
main
challenge
for
the
food
industries
is
in
producing
potato
chips
with
low
acrylamide
levels
without
affecting
their
sensory
properties
.
</p>
<p>
Although
it
is
important
to
evaluate
the
effect
of
pre-treatments
on
the
frying
process
on
acrylamide
mitigation
,
it
is
also
necessary
to
determine
their
influence
on
its
bioavailability
.
Potato
chips
are
an
important
part
of
the
snack
food
market
in
many
countries
,
and
few
studies
have
been
published
about
the
bioavailability
of
acrylamide
after
crisps
have
been
through
the
digestion
process
.
Acrylamide
intake
in
humans
occurs
mainly
via
food
ingestion
,
where
the
total
amount
of
this
compound
does
not
necessarily
reflect
the
available
amount
to
the
body
.
There
are
chemical
changes
in
the
food
when
it
enters
the
digestive
tract
,
because
of
pH
variations
,
and
the
action
of
several
enzymes
in
every
stage
of
the
digestion
process
.
In
this
sense
,
bioaccessibility
is
used
to
evaluate
the
amount
of
a
chemical
compound
available
for
absorption
after
it
is
released
from
the
food
matrix
into
the
gastrointestinal
tract
.
Several
methodologies
can
be
used
to
assess
the
bioaccessibility
of
contaminants
or
nutrients
:
1
)
in
vitro
,
2
)
ex
vivo
,
3
)
in
situ
and
4
)
in
vivo
models
.
Among
the
techniques
mentioned
before
,
in
vitro
models
are
more
commonly
used
than
in
vivo
models
,
because
of
their
simplicity
,
lower
cost
,
lack
of
ethical
issues
and
good
reproducibility
under
controlled
conditions
.
</p>
<p>
The
present
work
evaluated
some
acrylamide
mitigation
strategies
,
employing
a
fractional
factorial
design
experiment
,
and
their
influence
on
textural
properties
and
bioaccesibility
,
by
an
in
vitro
simulated
digestion
assay
.
