Challenges
</head>
<p>
As
can
be
seen
from
this
review
,
over
the
last
20
years
,
considerable
progress
has
been
made
in
the
research
on
the
applicability
and
improvement
of
SIT/IS
for
the
control
of
lepidopteran
pests
,
including
the
successful
implementation
of
SIT
programs
against
several
major
agricultural
pests
.
However
,
there
are
still
some
challenges
to
further
improve
the
applicability
of
SIT/IS
.
</p>
<p>
Current
programs
using
SIT/IS
against
lepidopteran
pests
rely
on
bisexual
releases
,
but
there
are
reasons
to
believe
that
male-only
releases
would
bring
significant
economic
benefits
by
decreasing
operational
costs
and
increasing
the
efficiency
of
the
sterile
males
.
This
has
been
well
demonstrated
in
the
SIT
programs
against
the
Mediterranean
fruit
fly
(
medfly
)
,
<hi rend="italic">
Ceratitis
capitata
</hi>
(
Wiedemann
)
,
using
a
genetic
sexing
strain
that
allowed
the
mass
production
and
release
of
males
only
.
On
the
contrary
,
the
results
of
field-cage
experiments
with
several
lepidopteran
pests
,
such
as
the
cactus
moth
,
suggest
that
sterile
females
might
have
a
positive
impact
on
population
suppression
,
thus
casting
doubts
on
the
need
for
genetic
sexing
strains
.
However
,
experience
with
the
Mediterranean
fruit
fly
shows
that
a
clear
conclusion
cannot
be
reached
without
large-scale
field
tests
that
would
compare
the
efficiency
of
male-only
versus
bisexual
releases
for
the
control
of
lepidopteran
pests
.
</p>
<p>
In
Lepidoptera
,
a
pure
genetic
sexing
system
has
been
developed
in
only
two
species
:
the
silkworm
<hi rend="italic">
B.
mori
</hi>
and
the
flour
moth
<hi rend="italic">
E.
kuehniella
</hi>
.
This
sexing
system
is
based
on
the
construction
of
a
balanced
lethal
strain
generating
transheterozygous
males
for
two
sex-linked
recessive
lethal
mutations
.
When
the
males
are
mated
to
wild-type
females
,
the
F1
generation
consists
almost
exclusively
of
male
progeny
.
However
,
this
system
is
impractical
for
SIT/IS
programs
.
It
requires
(
i
)
the
mass
rearing
of
two
colonies
,
(
ii
)
the
manual
separation
of
sexes
in
both
colonies
before
crosses
producing
male-only
progeny
,
and
(
iii
)
the
regular
checking
of
the
genetic
structure
of
the
balanced
lethal
strain
to
prevent
its
breakdown
.
</p>
<p>
New
opportunities
for
genetic
sexing
emerged
along
with
advances
in
genetic
technologies
,
especially
in
transgenesis
and
gene
editing
.
In
Lepidoptera
,
the
first
germline
transformations
were
performed
in
the
pink
bollworm
and
in
the
silkworm
using
a
<hi rend="italic">
piggyBac
</hi>
transposable
element
.
Based
on
this
success
,
it
has
been
proposed
to
construct
genetic
sexing
strains
using
a
transgenic
approach
so
that
the
females
carry
a
transgene
with
a
dominant
conditional
lethal
mutation
in
their
W
chromosome
that
would
be
expressed
in
embryogenesis
.
Such
strains
,
if
their
eggs
are
kept
at
restrictive
conditions
,
would
produce
non-transgenic
male-only
progeny
that
could
be
irradiated
and
released
(
<figure>
Figure

a
,
b
)
.
The
development
of
such
strains
was
initiated
in
the
codling
moth
,
but
this
work
was
later
discontinued
due
to
the
low
efficiency
of
transgenesis
in
this
species
.
That
this
approach
is
feasible
has
recently
been
demonstrated
in
the
silkworm
by
the
successful
insertion
of
a
transgene
carrying
the
EGFP
(
enhanced
green
fluorescent
protein
)
reporter
into
the
W
chromosome
.
Furthermore
,
new
transgenic
strains
providing
a
conditional
sex-specific
lethality
were
constructed
in
the
silkworm
and
in
two
pest
species
:
the
diamondback
moth
and
the
pink
bollworm
.
In
these
strains
,
conditional
female
lethality
is
controlled
by
the
tetracycline-repressible
transactivator
(
tTAV
)
protein
,
which
is
expressed
only
in
females
due
to
the
female-specific
spliced
region
of
the
pink
bollworm
<hi rend="italic">
doublesex
</hi>
gene
,
<hi rend="italic">
Pgdsx
</hi>
.
Methods
of
gene
editing
appear
to
be
even
more
promising
for
the
development
of
genetic
sexing
strains
than
transgenesis
,
because
they
allow
targeted
mutagenesis
.
Although
these
methods
have
not
yet
been
used
for
genetic
sexing
in
Lepidoptera
,
particularly
the
CRISPR/Cas9
(
clustered
regularly
interspaced
short
palindromic
repeats/CRISPR-associated
protein
9
)
technique
has
already
been
successfully
established
in
several
species
and
used
to
study
gene
functions
.
</p>
<p>
A
detailed
knowledge
of
the
sex-determining
pathway
could
greatly
facilitate
the
development
of
genetic
sexing
strains
that
are
suitable
for
the
mass
rearing
of
lepidopteran
pests
.
However
,
little
is
known
about
the
mechanism
of
sex
determination
in
Lepidoptera
except
for
the
silkworm
<hi rend="italic">
B.
mori
</hi>
.
In
this
model
species
,
a
homologue
of
the
<hi rend="italic">
Drosophila
doublesex
</hi>
(
<hi rend="italic">
dsx
</hi>
)
gene
,
<hi rend="italic">
Bmdsx
</hi>
,
was
found
to
be
sex-specifically
spliced
and
confirmed
to
control
sexual
differentiation
,
as
does
the
<hi rend="italic">
Drosophila
dsx
</hi>
gene
.
This
bottom
gene
of
the
sex-determining
cascade
in
<hi rend="italic">
Drosophila
</hi>
seems
to
be
the
only
conserved
gene
of
this
cascade
in
Lepidoptera
.
In
the
silkworm
,
sex
determination
depends
on
the
presence
or
absence
of
the
W
chromosome
,
which
carries
a
dominant
female-determining
factor
(
<hi rend="italic">
Fem
</hi>
)
that
promotes
femaleness
,
irrespective
of
the
number
of
Z
chromosomes
present
in
the
genome
.
Recently
,
a
surprising
discovery
has
been
made
that
<hi rend="italic">
Fem
</hi>
is
not
a
protein-coding
gene
,
as
originally
assumed
,
but
rather
a
W-encoded
small
RNA
named
<hi rend="italic">
Fem
</hi>
piRNA
.
The
<hi rend="italic">
Fem
</hi>
piRNA
downregulates
the
expression
of
a
Z-linked
gene
,
<hi rend="italic">
Masculinizer
</hi>
(
<hi rend="italic">
Masc
</hi>
)
,
which
promotes
male
development
through
male-specific
splicing
of
the
<hi rend="italic">
Bmdsx
</hi>
gene
in
the
absence
of
the
W
chromosome
.
