Senator
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John%20Kerry">
John
Kerry
</ref>
criticized
the
near
silence
of
the
U.S.
mass
media
regarding
the
so-called
&quot;
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downing%20Street%20memo">
Downing
Street
Memo
</ref>
&quot;
.
The
Downing
Street
Memo
is
a
leaked
secret
British
document
that
details
the
minutes
of
a
2002
meeting
between
top-level
British
and
American
government
officials
.
The
memo
states
that
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George%20W.%20Bush">
George
W.
Bush
</ref>
&quot;
was
determined
&quot;
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq">
attack
Iraq
</ref>
long
before
going
to
Congress
with
the
matter
,
and
that
&quot;
the
intelligence
and
facts
were
being
fixed
around
the
policy
.
&quot;
The
accuracy
of
the
memo
is
not
being
disputed
by
either
government
.
The
memo
caused
an
uproar
in
Great
Britain
and
made
a
significant
impact
in
the
British
national
elections
,
but
has
gotten
little
attention
in
American
news
.
Kerry
said
of
the
memo
:
</p>
<p>
&quot;
When
I
go
back
[
to
Washington
]
on
Monday
,
I
am
going
to
raise
the
issue
.
I
think
it
's
a
stunning
,
unbelievably
simple
and
understandable
statement
of
the
truth
and
a
profoundly
important
document
that
raises
stunning
issues
here
at
home
.
And
it
's
amazing
to
me
the
way
it
escaped
major
media
discussion
.
It
's
not
being
missed
on
the
Internet
,
I
can
tell
you
that
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
He
questioned
Americans
'
understanding
of
the
war
and
the
idea
that
criticism
equals
disloyalty
,
saying
,
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Do
you
think
that
Americans
if
they
really
understood
it
would
feel
that
way
knowing
that
on
Election
Day
,
77
percent
of
Americans
who
voted
for
Bush
believed
that
weapons
of
mass
destruction
had
been
found
and
77
percent
believe
Saddam
did
9/11
?
Is
there
a
way
for
this
to
break
through
,
ever
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Representative
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John%20Conyers">
John
Conyers
</ref>
has
written
to
the
President
regarding
the
memo
:
</p>
<p>
&quot;
...
a
debate
has
raged
in
the
United
States
over
the
last
year
and
one
half
about
whether
the
obviously
flawed
intelligence
that
falsely
stated
that
Iraq
possessed
weapons
of
mass
destruction
was
a
mere
'
failure
'
or
the
result
of
intentional
manipulation
to
reach
foreordained
conclusions
supporting
the
case
for
war
.
The
memo
appears
to
close
the
case
on
that
issue
stating
that
in
the
United
States
the
intelligence
and
facts
were
being
'
fixed
'
around
the
decision
to
go
to
war
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
There
is
a
growing
movement
on
the
internet
and
in
Congress
for
a
&quot;
Resolution
of
Inquiry
&quot;
into
issues
surrounding
the
planning
and
execution
of
the
Iraq
war
,
especially
in
regard
to
the
Administration
's
handling
of
intelligence
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John%20Dean">
John
Dean
</ref>
,
a
key
Watergate
figure
,
wrote
in
a
June
2003
column
for
findlaw.com
,
that
,
&quot;
To
put
it
bluntly
,
if
Bush
has
taken
Congress
and
the
nation
into
war
based
on
bogus
information
,
he
is
cooked
...
Manipulation
or
deliberate
misuse
of
national
security
intelligence
data
,
if
proven
,
could
be
a
'
high
crime
'
under
the
Constitution
's
impeachment
clause
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
However
,
in
practical
terms
impeachment
in
the
U.S.
Senate
requires
a
2/3
majority
for
conviction
,
which
is
unlikely
given
that
55
out
of
100
Senators
are
Republican
.
</p>
<p>
When
asked
about
the
Downing
Street
Memo
on
May
23
,
White
House
spokesman
Scott
McClellan
said
:
</p>
<p>
&quot;
If
anyone
wants
to
know
how
the
intelligence
was
used
by
the
administration
,
all
they
have
to
do
is
go
back
and
look
at
all
the
public
comments
over
the
course
of
the
lead-up
to
the
war
in
Iraq
,
and
that
's
all
very
public
information
.
Everybody
who
was
there
could
see
how
we
used
that
intelligence
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
And
in
terms
of
the
intelligence
,
it
was
wrong
,
and
we
are
taking
steps
to
correct
that
and
make
sure
that
in
the
future
we
have
the
best
possible
intelligence
,
because
it
's
critical
in
this
post-September
11th
age
,
that
the
executive
branch
has
the
best
intelligence
possible
.
