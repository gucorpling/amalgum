What
is
your
opinion
on
the
war
in

Donald
K.
Allen
</hi>
:
I
believe
it
is
coming
to
a
resolution
with
both
the
Iraqi
government
seeking
a
timetable
and
both
Iraqi
and
US
military
forces
finding
success
in
quelling
hostility
.
I
cannot
change
what
is
in
the
past
,
but
I
can
shape
the
future
.
I
would
seek
total
drawdown
in
Iraq
within
two
years
.

your

<hi rend="bold">
Donald

:
The
real
focus
of
our
&quot;
war
on
terror
&quot;
should
be
where
al
Qaeda
is
,
and
that
is
primarily
in
eastern
Afghanistan
.
The
war
against
bin
Laden
and
his
group
will
continue
,
as
will
the
war
against
the
Taliban
.
It
will
not
be
an
easy
task
,
as
we
have
already
seen
.
More
troops
will
be
needed
and
more
international
cooperation
to
wipe
out
this
societal
cancer
.

What
is
your
opinion
on
the
creation

a
North
American

?

</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Donald
K.
Allen
</hi>
:
I
am
totally
against
the
formation
of
a
North
American
Union
.
This
is
a
goal
of
the
Council
on
Foreign
Relations
,
which
you
could
call
America
's
&quot;
shadow
government
.
&quot;
Both
Obama
and
McCain
are
members
of
the
CFR
,
as
are
many
of
President
Bush
's
administrative
staff
.
Who
needs
foreign
affairs
experience
when
the
CFR
is
going
to
tell
you
what
to
do
?
I
will
investigate
all
work
to
date
on
this
effort
to
create
the
NAU
,
including
the
NAFTA
superhighway
and
Rudi
Giuliani
's
law
firm
's
involvement
in
it
.
There
is
a
lot
of
&quot;
quiet
&quot;
work
that
has
already
been
done
on
the
NAU
project
without
the
American
public
's
knowledge
.
This
will
make
the
Teapot
Dome
scandal
look
like
kids
'
play
.

Is
there
anything

you

say
to

<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Donald
K.
Allen
</hi>
:
If
you
think
the
safe
thing
to
do
Nov.
4
is
vote
for
the
Republican
or
Democratic
candidate
of
your
&quot;
choice
,
&quot;
then
you
are
sadly
mistaken
.
Both
will
continue
to
lead
this
country
down
the
road
to
a
North
American
Union
and
the
New
World
(
socialist
)
Order
.
The
only
way
&quot;
we
the
people
&quot;
can
shake
up
Washington
and
bring
about
revolutionary
change
in
our
government
is
through
the
election
of
a
true
independent
President
-
our
first
since
George
Washington
!
Following
is
a
list
of
my
intentions
.
</p>
<p>
As
President
I
Will
:
</p>
<p>
1
.
Complete
a
secure
border
fence
on
our
southern
border
.
</p>
<p>
2
.
Sign
The
Fair
Tax
Bill
to
rejuvenate
economy
.
</p>
<p>
3
.
Establish
“
loser
pays
”
litigation
reform
and
work
tirelessly
for
real
tort
reform
.
</p>
<p>
4
.
Transition
our
monetary
system
to
a
specie-backed
currency
and
close
the
Federal
Reserve
System
.
</p>
<p>
5
.
Seek
to
overturn
Roe
vs.
Wade
and
return
the
decision
to
the
States
.
</p>
<p>
6
.
Work
to
establish
term
limits
for
Congress
.
