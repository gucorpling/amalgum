Introduction
</head>
<p>
Triticale
is
an
increasingly
popular
cereal
species
which
acreage
continues
to
grow
steadily
in
Poland
.
Triticale
ranks
second
after
wheat
in
terms
of
cropped
area
,
and
this
highly
versatile
crop
has
a
wide
range
of
end
use
possibilities
.
The
area
sown
with
triticale
in
Poland
constitutes
about
34
%
of
the
area
of
this
species
in
the
world
.
European
agriculture
has
also
appreciated
this
species
.
In
the
last
decade
,
the
area
sown
with
triticale
increased
by
30
%
.
This
undoubtedly
confirms
the
growing
position
of
this
species
.
</p>
<p>
The
energy
consumption
in
agriculture
has
been
increasing
due
to
the
decreasing
arable
land
,
the
growing
population
,
the
growing
machine
number
,
and
the
pursuit
of
higher
living
standards
.
The
Integrated
Farming
System
,
the
key
to
which
is
an
attempt
at
reconciliation
of
seemingly
contradictory
economic
(
assumption
of
high
farming
effectiveness
)
,
environmental
,
and
social
goals
,
represents
one
of
the
concepts
of
sustainable
agriculture
development
.
Sustainable
development
results
from
assuming
the
principle
of
integrated
order
seen
as
consistent
and
simultaneous
perception
of
the
economic
,
social
,
and
natural
order
.
Agriculture
is
the
sector
of
the
economy
in
which
the
most
favorable
conditions
for
implementation
of
the
principles
of
sustainable
development
exist
because
,
on
the
one
hand
,
resources
of
the
natural
environment
are
used
there
,
and
on
the
other
,
farmers
,
through
their
activities
,
shape
that
environment
.
In
modern
farming
systems
,
profitability
is
closely
associated
with
a
reduction
in
agricultural
inputs
.
One
of
the
methods
for
evaluating
agricultural
production
relies
on
the
concept
of
energy
consumption
.
According
to
Pawlak
,
growing
prices
of
energy
contribute
to
the
effective
use
of
agricultural
inputs
.
There
is
a
growing
need
for
new
solutions
that
would
improve
energy
efficiency
in
agricultural
production
,
increase
the
competitive
advantage
of
economies
,
and
contribute
to
environmental
protection
.
The
changes
in
energy
efficiency
should
be
regularly
monitored
.
Previous
research
showed
that
the
assessment
of
energy
consumption
and
its
efficiency
has
an
influence
on
improving
the
efficiency
of
energy
use
when
receiving
similar
crop
productivity
.
According
to
OECD
(
The
Organisation
for
Economic
Co-operation
and
Development
)
,
improving
energy
efficiency
in
agriculture
will
reduce
GHG
(
greenhouse
gases
)
emissions
nitrous
,
especially
Oxide
(
N2O
)
and
methane
(
CH4
)
.
</p>
<p>
In
agriculture
,
energy
efficiency
depends
on
the
type
and
production
intensity
,
mechanization
,
and
the
applied
production
technology
.
Agricultural
inputs
and
expenditures
can
be
minimized
by
selecting
the
most
appropriate
means
of
production
and
optimizing
agricultural
technologies
.
</p>
<p>
Depending
on
the
purpose
of
the
analysis
,
the
energy
efficiency
of
plant
production
is
determined
using
various
methods
.
No
standard
methods
for
calculating
the
energy
balance
have
been
defined
yet
.
Methods
found
in
the
literature
often
differ
significantly
,
especially
in
terms
of
energy
equivalents
.
Energy
equivalents
are
not
static
values
and
must
be
adapted
to
local
conditions.
.
It
is
necessary
to
undertake
systemic
research
on
the
harmonization
of
contractual
conversion
factors
for
energy
units
of
individual
agricultural
raw
materials
intended
for
caloric
food
products
or
for
biofuels
(
RES
)
with
a
specific
heat
value
.
The
conversion
of
agricultural
products
into
conventional
cereal
units
should
also
be
updated
.
</p>
<p>
Currently
,
the
search
for
alternative
energy
sources
has
become
an
urgent
need
.
Fuels
from
plant
sources
are
used
in
huge
amounts
.
Biofuels
are
considered
safe
for
the
environment
,
improve
energy
security
,
and
do
not
negatively
affect
the
food
market
.
The
need
to
acquire
energy
from
other
alternative
sources
arises
from
the
fact
that
fossil
fuels
are
limited
in
amount
.
First
generation
biofuels
(
biodiesel
,
bioethanol
)
and
gas
fuels
are
still
the
basic
sources
of
renewable
energy
.
They
are
either
obtained
from
food
and
fodder
raw
materials
by
fermentation
or
transesterification
processes
.
One
of
the
most
important
biofuels
used
in
transport
is
bioethanol
,
which
is
recognized
as
environmentally
safe
,
renewable
fuel
.
</p>
<p>
A
very
important
factor
shaping
the
demand
for
agricultural
products
is
growing
purchases
from
entities
operating
outside
the
agri-food
sector
.
Among
them
,
fuel
and
energy
concerns
that
use
agricultural
products
in
the
biofuel
production
process
are
of
particular
importance
.
It
is
assumed
that
competition
in
the
use
of
agricultural
raw
materials
for
biofuels
negatively
affects
food
prices
and
therefore
contributes
to
the
deepening
of
world
hunger
.
In
recent
years
,
there
have
also
been
analyses
attributing
biofuels
a
role
smaller
than
before
in
the
negative
influence
on
agricultural
market
prices
.
The
use
of
a
part
of
soil
resources
for
biomass
production
limits
the
potential
of
food
production
,
which
may
result
in
an
increase
in
its
price
.
Agriculture
is
expected
to
continue
to
increase
productivity
to
meet
the
food
needs
of
the
growing
world
population
.
</p>
<p>
In
recent
years
,
the
production
of
bioethanol
grew
dynamically
,
exceeding
8.2
billion
liters
in
the
EU
(
2016
)
,
while
global
production
reached
119.7
billion
liters
.
About
6.1
%
of
cereal
production
in
the
world
(
wheat
,
fodder
grains
)
and
5.0
%
of
harvest
in
the
EU
was
used
for
this
purpose
.
In
2005
,
cereal
grains
were
used
much
less
in
the
production
of
bioethanol
,
2.7
%
in
the
world
,
and
1.0
%
in
the
EU
.
