How
did
you
get
into
comics
?

My
first
job
,
I
moved
to
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/San_Diego,_California">
San
Diego
</ref>
because
that
is
where
the
comic
book
con
is
.
After
college
,
I
moved
to
San
Diego
,
at
it
was
much
smaller
,
but
I
did
n't
know
how
to
get
into
comics
because
it
was
the
pre
internet
or
internet
was
just
coming
in
to
being
and
it
was
like
1990
.
So
I
got
a
job
at
the
newspaper
,
and
I
would
do
geek
stories
.
Whenever
like
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spawn%20(comics)">
Spawn
</ref>
had
a
TV
show
,
or
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judge%20Dredd">
Judge
Dredd
</ref>
had
a
movie
or
the
Comic
Con
rolled
in
town
,
I
would
write
an
article
about
it
.
And
eventually
I
attracted
attention
of
the
local
comic
book
company
which
was
Jim
Lee
's
WildStorm
productions
.
They
hired
me
as
an
assistant
editor
and
then
I
worked
my
way
up
to
editor
,
and
then
DC
bought
us
.
And
suddenly
I
was
a
DC
editor
.
So
I
had
done
that
for
about
five
years
and
then
I
had
always
wanted
to
write
,
I
figured
I
knew
how
so
I
went
freelance
and
then
I
started
writing
in
about
2001
.
And
I
have
been
writing
ever
since
.

Why
did
you
choose
freelancing
and
not
stick
to
one
company
?

<hi rend="bold">

Because
I
do
n't
want
to
work
for
a
boss
.
I
do
n't
want
to
wear
pants
.
I
do
n't
want
people
to
tell
me
what
to
do
.
Like
if
I
do
n't
want
a
job
,
I
can
just
[
shows
middle
finger
]
you
know
,
I
can
just
walk
away
.
But
,
it
's
hard
because
if
you
do
n't
have
work
,
you
do
n't
get
paid
.
So
you
are
always
hustling
.
But
there
is
a
freedom
of
being
your
own
boss
.

If
you
had
an
option
,
like
,
if
there
was
no
one
to
command
you
,
would
you
still
continue
freelancing
?

I
,
no
.
I
actually
,
a
few
years
ago
,
I
got
a
company
job
and
after
being
freelancer
,
like
no
I
do
n't
wanna
go
into
an
office
,
I
do
n't
wanna
do
hours
,
like
you
get
being
used
to
be
your
own
boss
,
I
could
never
go
back
to
a
real
job
.

Oh
!
You
know
,
I
ca
n't
â€”
that
's
been
so
long
ago
I
do
n't
even
keep
track
that
anymore
.
I
mean
I
had
some
old
dumb
things
that
I
do
n't
even
pay
attention
to
anymore
because
I
look
back
at
them
and
they
are
so
amateurish
,
you
know
I
do
n't
have
a
certain
character
I
have
created
at
an
age
that
I
remember
.
