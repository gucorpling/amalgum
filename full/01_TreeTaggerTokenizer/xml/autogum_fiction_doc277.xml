<p>
A
novelist
is
not
usually
asked
,
like
a
historian
,
for
his
‘
Quellen
’
.
As
I
have
,
however
,
judging
from
certain
experiences
in
the
past
,
some
reason
to
anticipate
such
a
demand
,
I
wish
to
acknowledge
my
indebtedness
to
Mr
Thomson
’s
admirable
history
of
travel
‘
Through
Masai
Land
’
for
much
information
as
to
the
habits
and
customs
of
the
tribes
inhabiting
that
portion
of
the
East
Coast
,
and
the
country
where
they
live
;
also
to
my
brother
,
John
G.
Haggard
,
RN
,
HBM
’s
consul
at
Madagascar
,
and
formerly
consul
at
Lamu
,
for
many
details
furnished
by
him
of
the
mode
of
life
and
war
of
those
engaging
people
the
Masai
;
also
to
my
sister-in-law
,
Mrs
John
Haggard
,
who
kindly
put
the
lines
of
p.
183
into
rhyme
for
me
;
also
to
an
extract
in
a
review
from
some
book
of
travel
of
which
I
cannot
recollect
the
name
,
to
which
I
owe
the
idea
of
the
great
crabs
in
the
valley
of
the
subterranean
river
.
{
Endnote

}
But
if
I
remember
right
,
the
crabs
in
the
book
when
irritated
projected
their
eyes
quite
out
of
their
heads
.
I
regret
that
I
was
not
able
to
‘
plagiarize
’
this
effect
,
but
I
felt
that
,
although
crabs
may
,
and
doubtless
do
,
behave
thus
in
real
life
,
in
romance
they
‘
will
not
do
so
.
’
</p>
<p>
There
is
an
underground
river
in
‘
Peter
Wilkins
’
,
but
at
the
time
of
writing
the
foregoing
pages
I
had
not
read
that
quaint
but
entertaining
work
.
</p>
<p>
It
has
been
pointed
out
to
me
that
there
exists
a
similarity
between
the
scene
of
Umslopogaas
frightening
Alphonse
with
his
axe
and
a
scene
in
Far
from
the
Madding
Crowd
.
I
regret
this
coincidence
,
and
believe
that
the
talented
author
of
that
work
will
not
be
inclined
to
accuse
me
of
literary
immorality
on
its
account
.
</p>
<p>
Finally
,
I
may
say
that
Mr
Quatermain
’s
little
Frenchman
appears
to
belong
to
the
same
class
of
beings
as
those
English
ladies
whose
long
yellow
teeth
and
feet
of
enormous
size
excite
our
hearty
amusement
in
the
pages
of
the
illustrated
Gallic
press
.

No

this

a

I

As
I
think
I
have
already
said
,
one
of
Umslopogaas
’s
Zulu
names
was
the
‘
Woodpecker
’
.
I
could
never
make
out
why
he
was
called
so
until
I
saw
him
in
action
with
Inkosi-kaas
,
when
I
at
once
recognized
the
resemblance

By
a
sad
coincidence
,
since
the
above
was
written
by
Mr
Quatermain
,
the
Masai
have
,
in
April
1886
,
massacred
a
missionary
and
his
wife
--
Mr
and
Mrs
Houghton
--
on
this
very
Tana
River
,
and
at
the
spot
described
.
These
are
,
I
believe
,
the
first
white
people
who
are
known
to
have
fallen
victims
to
this
cruel
tribe
.

Mr
Quatermain
does
not
seem
to
have
been
aware
that
it
is
common
for
animal-worshipping
people
to
annually
sacrifice
the
beasts
they
adore

There
is
another
theory
which
might
account
for
the
origin
of
the
Zu-Vendi
which
does
not
seem
to
have
struck
my
friend
Mr
Quatermain
and
his
companions
,
and
that
is
,
that
they
are
descendants
of
the
Phoenicians
.
The
cradle
of
the
Phoenician
race
is
supposed
to
have
been
on
the
western
shore
of
the
Persian
Gulf
.
Thence
,
as
there
is
good
evidence
to
show
,
they
emigrated
in
two
streams
,
one
of
which
took
possession
of
the
shores
of
Palestine
,
while
the
other
is
supposed
by
savants
to
have
immigrated
down
the
coast
of
Eastern
Africa
where
,
near
Mozambique
,
signs
and
remains
of
their
occupation
are
not
wanting
.
Indeed
,
it
would
have
been
very
extraordinary
if
they
did
not
,
when
leaving
the
Persian
Gulf
,
make
straight
for
the
East
Coast
,
seeing
that
the
north-east
monsoon
blows
for
six
months
in
the
year
dead
in
that
direction
,
while
for
the
other
six
months
it
blows
back
again
.
And
,
by
the
way
of
illustrating
the
probability
,
I
may
add
that
to
this
day
a
very
extensive
trade
is
carried
on
between
the
Persian
Gulf
and
Lamu
and
other
East
African
ports
as
far
south
as
Madagascar
,
which
is
of
course
the
ancient
Ebony
Isle
of
the
‘
Arabian
Nights
’
.
