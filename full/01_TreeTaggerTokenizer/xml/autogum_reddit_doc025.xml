Knowing
when
you
're
ready
for
an
exam
?
</head>
<sp who="#seemsunlikelybutok">

Hi
all
...
I
'm
wondering
when
you
'
know
'
you
're
ready
to
do
one
of
the
Goethe
exams
.
I
've
been
considering
booking
my
A1
in
the
UK
for
a
while
but
it
involves
going
to
a
city
I
do
n't
live
anywhere
near
and
never
seems
to
be
at
convenient
dates
etc.
.
however
I
'm
in
Germany
cycling
for
3
weeks
in
July
and
I
've
found
a
place
in
Düsseldorf
that
does
the
exam
right
when
I
'd
be
passing
through
!
Perfect
right
?
But
I
'm
the
queen
of
self
doubt
...
I
'll
overthink
until
the
time
passes
with
such
things
then
give
up
.
I
'm
thinking
booking
an
exam
will
'
push
'
me
and
put
some
gentle
pressure
on
me
to
focus
my
studying
and
to
work
to
certain
goals
or
standards
.
I
've
been
casually
learning
for
a
while
...
my
vocabulary
is
great
,
way
above
A1
,
most
of
the
A1
grammar
I
can
wrap
my
head
around
just
fine
...
I
'd
mostly
need
to
practice
the
writing
part
and
also
work
more
on
my
horrendously
thick
Uk
accent
when
speaking
.
I
'm
tempted
to
go
for
it
-
i
've
got
lots
of
time
to
study
beforehand
(
my
job
involves
hours
of
'
on
call
'
hours
in
which
I
can
study
,
as
well
as
free
time
)
plus
a
10
day
bike
ride
to
Düsseldorf
from
London
will
give
me
ample
time
to
listen
to
podcasts/lessons/music
with
lots
of
downtime
each
evening
after
setting
up
camp
to
read/write
etc.
I
think
it
might
be
a
good
thing
but
i
'm
wondering
if
it
's
too
much
of
a
push
...
If
anyone
has
ideas/anecdotes
about
when
you
chose
to
take
an
exam
and
what
level
you
thought
you
were
,
how
challenging
it
was
etc
would
be
most
welcome
...
thanks
in
advance

Try
one
of
their
mock
tests
.
When
you
get
more
than
70
%
,
you
're
probably
ready
,
except
maybe
for
the
parts
you
ca
n't
really
test
without
feedback
like
conversations
or
writing
a
text
.
</p>
<p>
You
could
post
your
text
here
to
get
feedback
.
</p>
<p>
The
speaking
part
is
very
basic
:
<ref target="http: bfu.goethe.de a1_sd1 sprechen.php">
http
:
bfu
.
goethe
.
de
a1_sd1
sprechen
.
php
</ref>
.
First
you
have
to
introduce
yourself
according
to
the
key
words
(
Ich
heiße
...
Ich
komme
aus
...
)
,
then
you
have
to
ask
for
or
give
informations
based
on
key
words
(
e.
g.
Frühstück
-&gt;
Isst
du
Frühstück
?
-&gt;
Ja
.
)
and
then
say
something
or
react
to
someone
based
on
pictures
(
e.
g.
CD
-&gt;
Wo
ist
die
CD
?
-&gt;
Zu
Hause
.
)
</p>
<p>
When
people
are
able
to
understand
you
,
because
they
<hi rend="bold">
really
</hi>
want
to
understand
you
,
you
're
fine
.
So
making
lots
and
lots
of
insignificant
mistakes
or
having
a
really
strong
accent
might
not
be
a
big
problem
.
