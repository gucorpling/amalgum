Make
sure
you
have
software
to
plot
your
risk
graph
.
When
trading
straight
calls
or
puts
or
vertical
spreads
(
all
legs
on
the
same
month
)
,
it
is
relatively
easy
to
work
out
the
max
risk
,
max
profit
and
break
even
point
to
draw
risk
graph
.
However
,
calendar
is
a
horizontal
spread
that
makes
up
of
two
different
option
months
.
That
makes
it
almost
impossible
to
manually
and
accurately
plot
your
risk
graph
.
So
,
you
need
software
to
do
this
.
Utilize
your
free
broker
tools
or
sign
up
for
a
paid
program
.
It
does
far
more
than
just
plotting
risk
graph
such
as
modeling
the
implied
volatility
of
the
stock
.
This
analyzes
if
you
should
trade
this
stock
or
not
.
20
%
of
the
last
year
low
in
IV
is
the
best
.
<figure rend="Ensure Success With Options Calendar Spread Step 1.jpg">

Your
break
even
points
range
is
at
least
10
%
of
stock
price
.
This
spread
trades
on
stocks
that
move
between
an
obvious
support
&amp;
resistance
.
It
is
recommended
that
you
structure
your
risk
graph
so
that
your
2
break
even
points
cover
the
range
of
stock
’s
movement
.
The
best
distance
between
these
two
points
is
10
%
of
stock
price
.
For
example
,
if
stock
prices
at
$
30
,
your
upside
point
should
be
$
31.5
and
downside
point
is
$
28.5
.
The
wider
,
the
merrier
.
It
will
increase
your
chance
of
winning
.
Also
,
when
trading
calendar
you
would
want
your
stock
to
move
less
.
Statistics
say
that
stocks
under
$
50
move
a
lot
less
than
those
above
$
50
.

Max
Profit
to
Max
Risk
ratio
is
at
least
100
%
.
Max
Profit
in
this
spread
is
the
pointy
head
in
the
risk
graph
and
your
max
risk
is
what
you
invest
in
the
trade
.
This
is
a
very
low
risk
trade
so
u
would
want
at
least
100
%
potential
profit
to
make
your
time
and
commission
worth
it
.
120
%
or
more
in
potential
profit
is
the
best
.

Probability
of
Winning
is
at
least
60
%
.
Different
traders
will
have
different
number
to
identify
their
worth-the-time
trades
.
This
author
's
probability
for
calendar
is
60
%
to
make
it
worth
trading
.
The
higher
is
the
better
.
80
%
is
the
best
.

Avoid
trading
through
earnings
date
.
Earning
potentially
causes
the
stock
to
jump
in
either
direction
and
out
of
your
trading
range
.
If
you
do
n’t
really
care
or
think
this
is
a
minor
problem
,
do
a
research
on
the
stock
and
see
if
it
has
historical
record
of
jumping
on
earning
.

Avoid
trading
through
a
dividends
date
.
This
author
traded
once
thru
dividend
date
.
The
risk
graph
completely
crushed
and
collapsed
.
The
author
lost
a
bit
more
than
50
%
of
the
trade
before
he/she
was
taken
out
by
the
pre-plan
exit
order
.

Pre-set
your
exits
at
the
two
break
even
points
.
Pre-planning
your
exits
,
as
you
know
,
is
the
most
important
part
of
your
trading
.
For
calendar
spreads
,
you
have
4
exit
targets
:
100
%
profit
,
50
%
loss
,
upside
break
even
and
downside
break
even
.
You
can
do
this
easily
by
setting
up
an
OCO
order
that
contains
4
orders
that
aim
at
those
4
targets
above
.
100
%
profit
and
50
%
use
limit
order
.
The
other
two
utilize
market
order
.

Trade
with
Puts
.
Generally
,
you
should
trade
put
calendar
.
This
is
because
most
of
the
time
it
is
cheaper
than
calls
.
Also
,
in
case
of
an
exercise
,
a
call
option
will
force
you
to
short
stock
.
This
can
be
harmful
if
the
stock
pay
dividends
on
the
day
you
get
exercise
,
you
will
have
to
pay
dividend
to
the
owner
of
the
share
you
short
.

Trade
Back-To-Back
Spreads
.
Back-To-Back
means
selling
a
nearest
month
option
and
buying
the
month
right
after
that
.
When
trading
this
spread
,
you
would
expect
the
stock
not
to
move
.
And
if
it
does
,
you
would
hurt
so
much
.
The
way
to
do
this
is
make
it
gamma
neutral
or
as
close
to
zero
as
possible
.

Larry
Williams
says
not
to
invest
more
than
30
%
of
your
portfolio
in
options
so
that
you
will
always
have
cash
.
If
you
have
$
10,000
and
you
invest
30
%
and
lose
it
,
you
will
have
$
7,000
.
If
you
then
have
$
7,000
do
n't
invest
more
than
30
%
which
is
$
2,100
.
If
you
lose
the
$
2,100
,
and
you
have
$
4,900
,
do
n't
invest
more
than
30
%
which
is
$
1,470
.
I
had
a
friend
that
lost
6
trades
in
a
row
and
lost
all
his
money
because
he
did
not
follow
this
rule
