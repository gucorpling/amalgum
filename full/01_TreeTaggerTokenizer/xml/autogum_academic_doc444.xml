Although
phylogenetic
variation
explains
most
of
the
highly
contrasted
Si
concentrations
in
terrestrial
plants
,
the
environmental
factors
are
key
for
understanding
intra-specific
variation
.
In
soils
,
Si
is
available
for
micro-organisms
and
plants
as
uncharged
monomeric
monosilicic
acid
,
H4SiO4
,
at
common
soil
pH
values
.
Its
concentration
in
soil
solution
generally
ranges
from
0.1
to
0.6
mM
.
Nevertheless
,
variations
of
two
orders
of
magnitude
have
been
reported
in
literature
(
from
1
to
more
than
100
mg
of
Si
per
kg
of
soil
in
CaCl2-extractable
solution
)
.
Such
differences
are
mainly
governed
by
soil
mineralogy
.
Indeed
,
the
concentration
of
plant-available
Si
decreases
with
increasing
soil
weathering
degree
and
decreasing
pH
,
given
soil
desilicification
.
Nevertheless
,
it
has
been
recently
highlighted
that
alkaline
pH
lead
to
a
decrease
of
plant-available
Si
given
increasing
adsorption
of
Si
on
soil
mineral
surfaces
.
Soil
pH
is
thence
a
key
driver
of
Si
plant-availability
.
Besides
,
the
magnitude
of
Si
biocycling
in
soil-plant
systems
and
the
resulting
amount
of
phytoliths
returned
on
topsoil
also
play
a
key
role
in
the
replenishment
of
Si
in
soil
solution
.
An
integrated
understanding
of
Si
mobility
in
soil-plant
systems
is
therefore
essential
for
optimizing
Si
benefits
in
terms
of
plant
protection
.
</p>
<p>
Climate
also
plays
a
key
role
in
Si
accumulation
by
plants
,
mainly
through
soil
water
availability
and
plant
evapotranspiration
.
Ryalls
et
al.
showed
that
plant
Si
concentration
increases
in
roots
and
shoots
under
elevated
rainfall
,
and
thence
soil
moisture
,
in
<hi rend="italic">
Microlaena
stipoides

Robert
Brown
.
Quigley
&amp;
Anderson
made
the
same
observation
in
<hi rend="italic">
Themeda
triandra
</hi>
Forsskål
.
Jenkins
et
al.
showed
that
the
number
of
silicified
cells
per
phytoliths
increased
with
irrigation
.
Si
uptake
is
thence
largely
dependent
on
soil
moisture
.
Besides
soil
water
availability
,
the
rate
of
plant
evapotranspiration
—
driven
by
net
irradiance
,
air
density
,
air
heat
capacity
,
vapor
pressure
deficit
and
latent
heat
of
vaporization
among
others-also
controls
plant
Si
uptake
and
concentrations
.
As
a
result
,
Henriet
et
al.
showed
that
Si
concentration
in
different
shoot
organs
of
banana
plants
was
directly
related
to
its
transpiration
rate
.
Cornélis
et
al.
attributed
the
higher
Si
uptake
by
Douglas
fir
leaves
compared
to
Black
pine
leaves
to
a
higher
transpiration
rate
and
Euliss
et
al.
showed
that
the
leaf
Si
concentration
of
different
grasses
and
wetland
species
was
directly
linked
to
its
transpiration
rate
.
Field
studies
showed
that
Si
uptake
increases
under
drought
stress
as
a
defense
mechanism
.
Fulweiler
et
al.
observed
that
anthropogenic
changes
(
elevated
atmospheric
CO2
concentrations
)
may
increase
biological
Si
pumping
in
forest
.
Climatic
variable
(
air
temperature
,
CO2
concentrations
)
and
pedoclimatic
variable
(
soil
water
content
)
are
therefore
two
key
properties
that
must
be
integrated
for
better
understanding
of
Si
accumulation
in
plants
.
</p>
<p>
Understanding
the
drivers
of
Si
accumulation
as
a
natural
plant
defense
is
key
because
seven
of
the
top
10
most
widespread
crops
in
the
world
are
Si-accumulating
Poaceae
species
,
especially
in
the
face
of
expected
climate
changes
and
the
lack
of
resilience
of
conventional
agriculture
.
Sugarcane
crops
are
concentrated
in
India
,
Brazil
,
China
and
the
Caribbean
Islands
under
tropical/subtropical
climate
where
highly
weathered
soils
lead
to
low
Si
plant-availability
.
In
contrast
,
wheat
and
barley
crops
are
concentrated
in
the
United
States
,
Europe
,
Canada
and
on
drier
areas
of
China
and
India
(
compared
to
sugarcane
)
,
at
more
temperate
climate
.
In
this
environment
,
soils
are
less
desilicated
,
leading
to
higher
Si
plant-availability
.
The
climate
variables
in
tropical
and
temperate
agro-ecosystems
will
also
strongly
affect
Si
accumulation
in
plants
through
very
contrasting
air
temperature
and
soil
water
content
.
The
natural
ability
of
plants
to
accumulate
Si
is
therefore
highly
variable
at
the
global
scale
,
and
far
from
being
understood
.
