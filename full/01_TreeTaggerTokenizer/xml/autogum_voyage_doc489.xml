Known
as
&quot;
The
Mile-High
City
&quot;
,
Denver
sits
at
an
altitude
of
5,280
feet
(
1,600
m
)
above
sea
level
and
lies
where
the
Great
Plains
give
way
to
the
Rocky
Mountains
.
Denver
is
a
large
city
and
one
of
the
fastest
growing
in
the
United
States
.
</p>
<head>
Understand
</head>
<p>
Denver
is
a
bustling
city
of
more
than
650,000
people
supporting
a
fast-growing
metropolitan
area
of
nearly
3
million
people
.
The
city
embraces
its
cowboy
and
mining
past
but
also
looks
toward
the
future
with
a
vibrant
arts
and
performing
arts
scene
,
dozens
of
great
outdoor
festivals
,
and
distinct
neighborhoods
each
offering
a
unique
experience
.
You
'll
find
everything
a
cosmopolitan
city
has
to
offer
including
a
spectacular
view
of
and
easy
access
to
the
beautiful
Rocky
Mountains
,
which
are
only
12
miles
(
19
km
)
west
of
town
.
</p>
<p>
Denver
does
have
its
growing
pains
.
Urban
sprawl
is
becoming
a
problem
,
with
the
metropolitan
area
sometimes
growing
faster
than
the
infrastructure
can
really
handle
,
especially
with
public
transportation
.
Denver
is
generally
a
driving
city
,
and
some
problems
with
pollution
and
traffic
are
a
part
of
everyday
life
.
Large
mass
transportation
and
freeway
expansion
projects
have
been
completed
,
including
the
popular
light
rail
system
.
By
American
standards
,
Denver
is
betting
big
on
public
transportation
.
</p>
<head>
Climate
</head>
<p>
Denver
residents
enjoy
a
mild
climate
and
the
third
most
sunshine
of
any
US
state
,
with
four
pronounced
seasons
.
</p>
<p>
Heavy
snowfalls
can
occur
between
October
and
March
,
often
alternating
with
days
of
high
temperatures
and
sunshine
.
About
once
a
year
,
a
snowfall
of
over
a
few
feet
occurs
.
Winter
is
also
when
the
Denver
area
gets
pounded
by
a
phenomenon
known
as
the
&quot;
Chinook
&quot;
.
That
's
when
air
flows
over
the
mountains
to
the
west
and
sinks
on
the
leeward
(
eastern
)
slopes
of
the
foothills
and
warms
up
.
This
raises
air
temperatures
dramatically
,
which
can
last
for
several
days
.
If
you
're
planning
to
visit
Denver
during
the
winter
,
be
prepared
with
full
winter
gear
just
in
case
,
but
also
pack
a
light
sweater
and
T-shirt
;
the
weather
is
usually
very
sunny
and
mild
.
</p>
<p>
Spring
in
Denver
is
pleasant
,
though
generally
rather
brief
.
Trees
begin
budding
by
late
March
and
are
in
full
leaf
by
mid
April
to
mid
May
.
March
,
on
average
,
is
Denver
's
snowiest
month
.
</p>
<p>
By
June
,
Denver
enters
its
summer
season
.
Temperatures
typically
rise
in
earnest
at
this
time
,
with
most
heat
waves
beginning
in
mid-June
and
continuing
through
July
,
usually
Denver
's
hottest
month
with
temperatures
in
the
high
80s
to
mid-90s
(
°F
)
.
By
late
July
,
the
southwest
monsoon
kicks
in
.
In
August
,
short
spells
of
thunderstorms
occur
about
three
to
four
days
per
week
.
By
late
August
,
temperatures
begin
to
drop
with
a
noticeable
difference
between
day
time
and
night
time
temperatures
.
As
the
days
get
shorter
through
September
and
October
,
daytime
temperatures
drop
to
the
high
50s
to
mid-60s
.
Slather
on
that
sunscreen
all
summer
long
;
the
rays
are
strong
and
the
air
is
dry
,
with
temperatures
often
reaching
the
upper
90s
in
July
and
August
.
</p>
<p>
Autumn
is
a
peaceful
time
to
visit
,
with
mild
temperatures
,
little
severe
weather
and
lots
of
that
famous
clear
blue
sky
.
You
'll
get
to
see
the
trees
display
their
fall
colors
,
which
usually
peak
around
mid-September
in
the
mountains
and
October
in
the
city
.
October
usually
brings
the
first
snowfall
of
the
season
to
Denver
,
although
it
's
very
light
.
By
November
,
it
's
clear
that
winter
is
on
its
way
,
with
plenty
of
clouds
,
some
snow
and
much
cooler
temperatures
.

Denver

(

Commonly

the
airport
is
about
18
miles
(
29
km
)
northeast
of
Downtown
Denver
and
is
one
of
the
busiest
airports
in
the

and
is
a
popular
destination
with
other
major
domestic
carriers
.
Many
connecting
flights
are
made
in

,
and
this
airport
is
more
pleasant
than
most
to

with
plenty

On
warm
days
,
the
density
altitude
may
make
takeoffs
difficult
;
Centennial
and
Rocky
Mountain
Airports
thus
have
relatively
long

,
to
accommodate
volumes
of
private
jet
traffic
.
Flight
visibility
in
the
Denver

is
often
in
