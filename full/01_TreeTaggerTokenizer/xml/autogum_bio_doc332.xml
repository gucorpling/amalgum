<p>
Ferguson
appears

in
the
pay

Holland
,
probably
as
a
gentleman
volunteer
,
some
time
during
the
reign
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_II_of_England">
Charles

.
His
first
commission
,
that

quartermaster
in
Colonel
Macdonald
's
battalion
of
the
brigade
,
was
dated

.
He
became
ensign
in
the
battalion
in
September
1678
,
and
lieutenant
in
February
1682
.
His
battalion
was
one
of
those
brought
over
to
England
in
1685
at
the
time
of
Monmouth
's
rebellion
.
He
became
captain
in

and
in
1688
landed

His

,
then
known
as

to
have
been
taken

left
him
a

and
in
March
1690
he
was
despatched
by
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Mackay_(general)">
General
Mackay
</ref>
,
who
described
him
as
‘
a
resolute
,
well-affected
officer
,
’
in
whose
discretion
and
diligence
he
had
full
reliance
,
at
the
head
of
six
hundred
men
,
to
reduce
the
western
isles
,
a
service
he
accomplished
satisfactorily
with
the
aid
of
the
Glasgow
authorities
and
the
co-operation
of
Captain
Pottinger
of
the
Dartmouth
frigate
(
Ferguson
,
pp.15
–
16
)
.
</p>
<p>
In
1692
he
was
back
in
the
Low
Countries
,
and
was
present
with
his
regiment
(
Lauder
's
)
at
the
battle
of
Steenkirk
.
A
few
days
after
,
on
1
August
1692
,
he
was
appointed
lieutenant-colonel
of
Monro
's
(
late
Angus

On
25
August
1693
he
had
been
appointed
to
the
colonelcy
,
which
he
held
up

Owing
to
the

but
in
December
1700
it
was
finally
transferred
to
the
British
service
,
and
was
brought
to
Scotland
.
Ferguson
had
meanwhile
married
and
been
left
a
widower
,
and
had
acquired
the
estates
of
Balmakelly
and
Kirtonhill
,
on
the
Kincardineshire
bank
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_North_Esk">

Ferguson
went
with
his
regiment
to
the
Netherlands
under
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Churchill,_1st_Duke_of_Marlborough">
Marlborough
</ref>
in
1702
.
In
1703
he
was
in
command
at

rank

In
the
campaign
of
1704
he
commanded
a
brigade
which
led
the
attack
on
the
heights
of
Schellenberg
,
and
at
Blenheim
shared
with
Row
's
brigade
the
protracted
fighting
round
the
strongest
part
of

enemy
's
position

<p>
About
Christmas
the
same
year
Ferguson
married
his
second
wife
.
</p>
<p>
In
the
campaign
of
the
year
following
he
had
a
brigade
at
the
forcing
of
the
enemy
's
lines
in
Brabant
,
and
afterwards
commanded
,
with
the
rank
of
major-general
,
at
'
s-Hertogenbosch
,
where
he
died
very
suddenly
—
the
family
tradition
says
by
poison
—
on
22
Oct.
1705
.
An
old
manuscript
states
that
‘
he
served
in
four
reigns
,
still
maintaining
the
character
of
a
brave
,
valiant
,
and
prudent
officer
,
until
,
his
fame
raising
envy
in
the
breast
of
the
then
commanding
officer
,
he
was
cut
off
by
very
sinister
means
’
(
ib
.
p.46
)
.
Contemporary
writers
are
discreetly
silent
on
this
ugly
story
,
but
all
agree
in
regretting
his
loss
as
a
brave
and
experienced
officer
.
He
was
buried
in
