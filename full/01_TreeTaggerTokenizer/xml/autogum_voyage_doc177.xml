<p>
While
Pennsylvania
Dutch
Country
consists
of
a
lot
of
rural
areas
and
is
noted
for
its
high
Amish
population
,
it
is
home
to
over
1.5
million
people
and
maintains
one
of
the
highest
rates
of
population
growth
in
the
Northeast
United
States
due
to
lower
cost
of
living
but
close
proximity
to
major
metropolitan
areas
.
It
is
truly
a
diverse
region
with
rolling
hills
,
orchards
and
farms
but
also
growing
,
vibrant
yet
historic
cities
.
</p>
<p>
The
Pennsylvania
Dutch
(
Amish
)
Community
dates
back
to
the
16th
century
Reformation
in
Europe
,
specifically
the
Anabaptist
movement
.
There
are
three
families
of
Anabaptist-related
groups
in
PA
Dutch
Country
:
the
Amish
,
Mennonites
and
Brethren
.
The
three
groups
share
many
basic
values
and
beliefs
,
with
primary
differences
in
dress
,
language
,
some
forms
of
worship
,
and
the
extent
to
which
they
will
use
modern
advancements
.

<p>
Much
of
the
&quot;
Plain
&quot;
population
(
consisting
of
groups
like
the
Amish
and
Old
Order
Mennonites
)
is
bilingual
,
speaking
both
English
and
a
dialect
of
German
called
&quot;
Pennsylvania
Dutch
.
&quot;
A
much
smaller
portion
of
the
non-Plain
population
of
Pennsylvania
Dutch
descent
is
also
bilingual
.
Among
the
Plain
,
some
smaller
children
speak
only
this
dialect
until
starting
school
.
The
name
&quot;
Pennsylvania
Dutch
&quot;
is
actually
a
mispronunciation
of
&quot;
Deitsch
,
&quot;
or
German
in
the
regional
dialect
.
Church
services
are
held
in
&quot;
high
German
,
&quot;
as
opposed
to
the
dialect
.

By
plane
</head>
<p>
There
are
several
regional
airports
in
south
central
Pennsylvania
but
the
largest
and
most
used
is
<ref target="http://www.flyhia.com/">
Harrisburg
International
Airport
</ref>
(
MDT
)
located
in
Middletown
,
just
minutes
from
Harrisburg
and
PA
Route
283
.
Harrisburg
International
Airport
has
over
a
dozen
non-stop
flights
to
cities
in
the
U.S.
and
Toronto
in
Canada
.
</p>
<head>
By
car
</head>
<p>
The
easiest
way
to
get
around
the
region
is
by
car
.
There
is
an
extensive
network
of
roads
and
the
area
is
criss-crossed
by
several
major
interstates
(
81
,
76
,
83
)
and
U.S.
routes
(
11
,
15
,
22
,
30
)
.

<head>
By
train
</head>
<p>
Amtrak
's
high-speed
<ref target="http://www.catchthekeystone.com/">
Keystone
line
</ref>
travels
through
Lancaster
and
Dauphin
county
with
stops
in
Lancaster
,
Mount
Joy
,
Elizabethtown
,
Middletown
,
and
<ref target="Harrisburg">
Harrisburg
</ref>
is
useful
if
traveling
between
Lancaster
and
Harrisburg
but
does
not
link
up
the
rest
of
the
places
in
PA
Dutch
Country
