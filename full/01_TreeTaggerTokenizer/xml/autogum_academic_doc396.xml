Case
Study
Details
</head>
<p>
This
case
study
focuses
on
one
of
the
UK
’s
largest
water
utility
companies
(
UC
)
.
Project
numbers
and
their
variation
in
size
,
technical
work
content
,
and
value
indicate
the
challenging
complexity
of
the
water
programme
.
The
projects
vary
in
technical
work
content
since
different
types
of
capital
infrastructure
are
dealt
with
,
e.
g.
,
pumping
stations
,
reservoirs
,
and
pipeline
renewal
.
Project
values
range
from
less
than
£2
million
to
£15
million
.
In
addition
,
complexity
stems
from
the
involvement
of
a
sizeable
network
of
organisations
,
such
as
major
contractors
,
subcontractors
,
suppliers
,
consultants
,
and
regulatory
institutions
.
Because
the
water
programme
typically
engages
with
multiple
stakeholders
and
is
a
long-term
endeavour
,
effective
interorganisational
relationships
between
the
water
company
and
its
major
first
tier
contractors
are
important
for
programme
performance
.
</p>
<p>
In
delivering
its
capital
programme
,
UC
chose
to
adopt
a
partnering
approach
with
its
main
contractors
.
The
collaborative
network
studied
here
comprises
the
utility
company
(
UC
)
and
its
main
eight
contractors
(
CTs
)
,
with
the
UC
adopting
a
programme
management
approach
to
working
with
its
CTs
.
UC
management
looks
to
design
contracts
to
encourage
competition
between
partners
and
to
stimulate
innovation
.
They
change
organisational
structures
frequently
,
particularly
for
each
AMP
cycle
,
as
the
regulator
rewards
companies
for
introducing
managerial
innovation
as
a
source
of
“
efficiency
saving
”
.
</p>
<p>
UC
managers
believe
the
company
’s
success
relies
heavily
on
partnership
with
its
tier
1
contractors
.
A
CT
is
typically
formed
by
a
partnership
between
a
design
company
and
a
civil
construction
company
,
an
arrangement
with
what
could
be
termed
tier
2
suppliers
.
In
successive
cycles
of
asset
management
programmes
,
UC
has
employed
a
different
mix
of
tier
1
contractors
.
These
changes
stem
from
Ofwat
encouraging
a
“
shake
up
”
in
each
AMP
.
</p>
<p>
Two
major
changes
were
instituted
at
the
start
of
the
studied
programme
:
(
1
)
key
personnel
from
all
nine
organisations
were
co-located
in
a
newly
acquired
multistorey
office
block
to
form
a
newly
created
Asset
Delivery
Unit
(
ADU
)
and
(
2
)
project
work
was
organised
into
five
streams
containing
projects
of
a
similar
technical
nature
,
under
two
higher
level
“
production
units
”
.
The
project
grouping
determines
the
work
allocation
to
stream
members
and
establishes
key
relationships
between
employees
.
Each
stream
has
a
UC
manager
who
was
also
in
charge
of
lower-level
work
allocations
by
batch
and
project
.
Contractors
operate
in
different
numbers
of
streams
,
ranging
from
one
to
four
streams
(
see
<figure>
Figure
1
</figure>
)
;
however
,
individuals
are
often
restricted
to
working
on
one
stream
or
sometimes
two
.
Some
contractors
have
prior
relationships
with
the
UC
from
previous
AMPs
.
Collaboration
between
contractors
is
expected
across
both
production
units
and
all
five
streams
as
part
of
the
performance
criteria
established
as
a
response
to
incentives
from
the
regulatory
body
.
Production
Unit
1
comprises
streams
2
,
3
,
and
5
,
while
Production
Unit
2
is
made
up
of
streams
1
and
4
.
A
stream
level
analysis
,
amongst
others
,
was
applied
in
the
research
to
investigate
the
connections
among
the
nine
organisations
(
UC
and
the
eight
CTs
)
.
</p>
<p>
In
<figure>
Figure
1
</figure>
,
each
contractor
is
anonymised
by
using
a
capital
letter
(
A
–
H
)
,
while
each
stream
is
represented
using
a
number
(
1
–
5
)
.
The
combination
of
eight
contractors
with
five
streams
of
work
adds
complexity
to
the
analysis
of
relationships
.
For
instance
,
contractor
G
is
assigned
to
streams
1
,
2
,
4
,
and
5
while
contractors
A
,
B
,
C
,
D
,
and
F
work
for
only
one
stream
.
Each
stream
is
independent
from
each
other
but
related
in
the
programme
.
Furthermore
,
prior
association
with
UC
varies
to
a
large
degree
.
Contractors
B
and
D
are
new
to
working
with
UC
on
a
programme
for
this
cycle
,
whereas
contractors
G
and
E
had
collaborative
relationships
with
UC
for
15
years
through
three
programme
cycles
of
association
.
