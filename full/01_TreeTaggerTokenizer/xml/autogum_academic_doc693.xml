<p>
Although
the
concept
of
productization
has
not
been
deeply
investigated
in
the
PSS
scientific
literature
,
which
is
more
focused
on
the
opposite
phenomenon
of
servitization
,
this
transformation
in
the
service
sector
has
several
recent
examples
in
utilities
companies
.
The
analysis
conducted
revealed
a
variety
of
PSS
offerings
,
which
can
combine
both
the
strategies
identified
(
service
standardization
and
addition
of
a
tangible
product
)
at
different
levels
.
This
combination
can
result
in
different
shades
of
productization
,
that
we
clustered
in
three
different
PSS
integration
levels
.
A
summary
is
shown
in
Table
3
.
</p>
<p>
The
first
is
represented
by
pure
standardized
services
.
Considering
the
examples
presented
in
Section
4
,
the
proposal
of
insurance
or
maintenance
services
for
the
home
electric
and
heating
systems
fall
into
this
category
,
as
well
as
the
standard
packages
offered
to
customers
in
the
mobile
communication
sector
,
the
inclusion
of
media
contents
in
such
contracts
,
or
the
PAYT
service
in
the
waste
collection
sector
.
</p>
<p>
The
second
level
is
represented
by
an
integrated
PSS
,
providing
both
a
standardized
service
and
a
product
component
.
Some
examples
are
the
installation
of
photovoltaic
systems
,
efficient
boilers
and
air
conditioners
,
and
water
purifiers
,
all
of
which
come
with
an
integrated
service
of
maintenance
included
in
the
contract
.
Similarly
,
the
remote
control
devices
and
smart
thermostats
,
that
allow
a
smart
control
of
the
heating
and
electric
systems
,
as
well
as
comfort
and
security
sensors
,
are
usually
sold
with
a
service
package
including
installation
and
maintenance
.
In
the
communication
sector
,
the
inclusion
of
smartphones
,
laptops
and
tablets
,
or
modem
,
web
cubes
and
TV
boxes
,
are
typical
examples
of
product
and
service
integration
,
since
they
include
access
to
the
communication
service
and
,
more
often
,
to
specific
media
contents
.
The
sensors
for
bin
filling
in
the
waste
collection
sector
are
another
example
of
integrated
PSSs
,
since
their
installation
is
necessary
to
implement
a
dynamic
collection
service
.
Finally
,
the
integration
of
electric
cars
and
charging
stations
with
the
electric
service
is
also
included
in
this
category
.
</p>
<p>
On
the
third
level
,
we
find
PSSs
that
are
prominently
product-based
.
Typical
examples
are
the
sale
of
kits
with
energy-saving
led
bulbs
,
smart
home
kits
,
air
purifiers
and
domestic
composters
.
These
products
are
not
usually
provided
with
a
strong
service
component
,
but
aim
at
widening
the
offer
for
the
customer
.
</p>
<p>
Another
interesting
discussion
point
is
represented
by
the
possible
impacts
of
productization
in
the
utilities
sector
on
the
three
main
dimensions
of
sustainability
.
While
the
impacts
on
sustainability
of
PSSs
in
general
,
dematerialization
,
and
servitization
have
been
often
analyzed
in
literature
,
discussing
benefits
and
criticalities
,
a
similar
analysis
on
productization
is
still
missing
.
The
main
objective
of
productization
is
identified
in
the
possibility
to
improve
the
value
offered
to
customers
,
but
other
possible
environmental
,
social
,
and
economic
outcomes
are
not
clear
yet
.
For
this
reason
,
we
propose
a
first
analysis
of
the
main
impacts
that
the
strategies
presented
for
the
utilities
sector
can
have
on
sustainability
,
summarized
in

Social
Sustainability
</head>
<p>
Considering
a
social
sustainability
point
of
view
,
the
adoption
of
productization
in
the
public
service
can
enable
the
use
of
more
“
innovative
”
products
and
updated
technologies
for
people
who
did
not
have
access
to
them
before
,
due
to
their
high
purchase
costs
.
In
fact
,
most
PSSs
including
a
physical
product
often
offer
the
possibility
to
choose
flexible
payment
plans
that
facilitate
the
access
to
customers
.
Typical
examples
are
boilers
,
air
conditioners
,
photovoltaic
systems
,
but
also
smaller
devices
such
as
smartphones
and
tablets
.
The
proposal
of
new
business
models
based
on
leasing
plans
or
the
possibility
for
the
user
to
pay
in
instalments
,
including
the
cost
of
the
product
in
the
monthly
fees
paid
for
the
service
,
can
extend
the
market
to
users
with
lower
income
.
This
can
foster
the
diffusion
of
more
reliable
,
safe
,
and
energy-efficient
technologies
,
improving
the
health
and
safety
dimension
in
domestic
environments
.
This
can
also
be
improved
by
PSSs
based
on
sensors
for
comfort
and
security
,
aimed
at
improving
the
domestic
quality
of
life
.
</p>
<p>
Another
social
impact
related
to
the
more
diversified
offer
of
the
company
is
the
enhancement
of
its
brand
value
,
that
can
improve
significantly
thanks
to
the
increase
of
the
service
level
provided
.
