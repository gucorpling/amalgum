Do
you
think
you
will
be
able
to
cover
future
expenses
such
as
radio
and
television
ads
?
</hi>

<p>
Following
the
raid
on
the
Pirate
Bay
,
and
our
tripling
of
the
member
roster
,
we
do
n't
need
advertising
.
We
've
been
mentioned
almost
every
news
hour
across
all
channels
on
national
television
in
the
last
week
.
</p>
<p>
Also
,
the
established
parties
have
now
started
to
turn
,
following
our
success
.
Parties
representing
almost
half
of
the
elected
parliament
are
now
describing
today
's
copyright
situation
as
not
working
.
They
still
do
n't
understand
why
,
though
,
they
are
just
echoing
what
we
say
without
understanding
what
the
words
mean
.
We
'll
get
around
to
teaching
them
—
them
and
the
voters
alike
.
</p>
<p>
This
might
be
hard
for
people
not
following
the
Swedish
media
to
grasp
,
but
we
have
made
a
<hi rend="italic">
big
</hi>
splash
.
Today
,
our
Minister
of
Justice
was
quoted
as
saying
that
he
's
open
to
changes
to
copyright
laws
that
would
make
file-sharing
legal
,
with
the
headline
&quot;
Bodström
(
his
name
)
flip-flops
about
file
sharing
.
&quot;
Immediately
underneath
were
the
Pirate
Party
's
comments
to
his
suggestions
.
Let
's
take
that
again
:
when
a
minister
makes
a
statement
about
file
sharing
,
media
calls
us
for
comments
,
and
publishes
them
next
to
that
statement
.
That
's
how
big
we
have
become
since
the
raid
on
the
Pirate
Bay
.
</p>
<p>
The
Minister
of
Justice
later
denied
having
made
that
statement
to
the
press
that
reported
it
.
</p>
<p>
We
will
never
be
able
to
pay
for
television
ads
,
the
way
I
see
it
.
Unless
a
very
wealthy
donor
comes
on
stage
.
(
If
any
such
person
is
reading
this
,
we
have
planned
how
to
spend
up
to
$
375,000
in
a
cost-efficient
way
up
until
the
elections
,
on
the
chance
that
donations
appear
.
That
spending
does
still
not
include
any
TV
ads
.
)
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Are
you
aware
of
similar
initiatives
in
other
countries
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
Some
are
trying
,
but
none
have
achieved
the
necessary
momentum
and
critical
mass
that
we
have
.
We
expect
that
momentum
to
happen
once
we
get
into
Swedish
Parliament
and
show
that
it
can
be
done
.

The
name
&quot;
Pirate
Party
&quot;
seems
to
identify
the
party
with
what
is
currently
defined
as
a
crime
:
piracy
of
software
,
movies
,
music
,
and
so
on
.
Will
a
name
like
&quot;
Pirate
Party
&quot;
not
antagonize
voters
,
given
that
the
label
is
so
negatively
used
?
How
about
potential
allies
abroad
who
argue
for
a
more
balanced
copyright
regime
,
such
as
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation">

or

?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
Oh
,
it
<hi rend="italic">
is
</hi>
a
crime
.
That
's
the
heart
of
the
problem
!
The
very
problem
is
that
something
that
20
%
of
the
voters
are
doing
is
illegal
by
punishment
of
jail
time
.
That
's
what
we
want
to
change
.
Where
the
established
parties
are
saying
that
the
voters
are
broken
,
we
are
saying
it
's
the
law
that
is
broken
.
