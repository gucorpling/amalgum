Discover
More
About
Who
You
Are
and
Be
Confident
</head>
<p>
In
the
World
that
we
live
in
today
,
it
is
hard
for
people
to
find
and
be
okay
with
themselves
.
This
can
be
especially
hard
if
you
are
a
teenager
or
if
you
are
more
sensitive
than
most
people
.
The
things
that
you
were
told
as
a
child
and
the
beliefs
that
you
have
placed
upon
yourself
because
of
this
might
have
a
dramatic
effect
on
the
reason
why
finding
yourself
seems
so
difficult
.

Steps
</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Recognize
the
negative
messages
you
've
been
told
.
Or
the
beliefs
you
have
about
yourself
and
when
you
tell
yourself
these
messages
the
most
.
Is
it
around
others
?
When
you
're
alone
?
Going
out
?
Speaking
in
front
of
people
?
When
you
feel
insecure
about
the
way
you
look
?
Etc.
This
is
important
to
know
because
once
you
know
where
your
irrational
beliefs
are
coming
from
it
will
be
easier
for
you
to
tackle
them
and
get
on
track
to
finding
yourself
and
build
confidence
.

Build
Up
Your
Confidence
.
Once
you
have
recognized
the
messages
you
've
been
believing
or
telling
yourself
,
its
then
that
you
can
change
them
.
You
can
start
by
analyzing
them
.
It
's
okay
if
you
ca
n't
get
to
the
root
of
it
right
away
.
It
takes
time
.
Do
n't
give
up
!
Spend
some
time
,
read
stories
of
others
with
the
same
struggles
as
you
,
listen
to
songs
a
lot
of
times
songs
will
analyze
struggles
and
might
even
offer
advice
,
Try
to
get
a
therapist/counselor
but
pay
attention
to
whether
they
understand
you
or
not
.

Be
Kind
To
Yourself
.
If
you
catch
yourself
saying
&quot;
I
'm
so
stupid
&quot;
or
&quot;
I
'm
a
failure
&quot;
all
the
time
.
Recognize
it
and
start
changing
it
.
You
do
n't
have
to
go
from
saying
I
'm
so
stupid
to
I
'm
so
smart
.
Stay
neutral
at
first
then
when
you
're
ready
,
go
for
the
positive
.
Try
saying
positive
statements
to
yourself
,
like
,
&quot;
I
am
a
positive
force
in
the
world
!

Try
Not
To
Spend
a
lot
of
Time
Alone
or
Silent
.
For
some
people
their
negative
thoughts
come
out
mostly
when
they
're
alone
.
So
try
to
talk
to
people
,
like
your
mom
,
friends
,
brother
,
sister
,
cousins
,
grandma
,
grandpa
.
Just
to
get
your
mind
not
thinking
of
negative
things
.
Try
doing
hobbies
,
taking
your
dog
for
a
walk
,
joining
a
club
,
do
sports
.

Get
The
Thoughts
That
Everyone
is
Judging
You
Out
of
Your
Mind
.
This
sometimes
affects
a
persons
confidence
and
drags
them
away
from
themselves
.
Know
that
judgments
are
quick
predictions
and
are
usually
wrong
.

Create
a
List
of
Who
You
Are
.
This
might
take
you
a
while
and
that
's
perfectly
fine
.
Include
what
you
like
,
the
hobbies
you
like
,
music
,
your
personality
traits
,
what
you
're
proud
of
,
anything
related
to
you
.
Maybe
creating
a
collage
would
be
more
fun
than
a
list
!

Know
That
People

a
Unique
Positive
Person

you
're
a
little
meaner
than
some
people
,
they
might
find
that
funny
.
If
you
think
you
're
nicer
,
people
will
definitely
notice
this
.
You
might
even
inspire
others
to
be
nice
!

To
stand
up
for
yourself
,
you
do

right
way
this
can
affect
your
