The

targeted

these

tearing
apart

thrown
from

Lonoaea
was
one

thirteen

injured

The
local
Hawaiian
newspapers
reported

He
returned
to
his
home
in
Wailuku
to
recover
but
was
ultimately
the
only
legislator
not
to
recover
from
his
injuries

With

took
time
to
reach

.
<hi rend="italic">
The
Hawaiian
Gazette

prematurely
reported

's
death
on
March

Lonoaea
actually
died
from
his
injuries
on

,
at
his
home
on
Wailuku

but
news
confirming
his

did
not
reach

were
taken
