responded
to

by
agreeing

,
in
which
20,000

First

children
were
removed
from
their
parents
'
households
and
placed
with
non-indigenous
foster
or
adoptive
parents
.
The
plaintiffs
claimed
that
this
caused
them
mental
and
emotional
problems
,
in
addition
to
the
loss
of
their
ancestral
culture
.

Relations
Minister

announced
the
agreement
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
have
great
hope
that
because
we
've
reached
this
plateau
,
this
will
never
,
ever
happen
in
Canada
again
,
&quot;
Marcia
Brown
Martel
,
now
Chief
of
the
Beaverhouse
First
Nation
,
said
of
the
decision
.
Martel
was
removed
from
her
home
as
many
as
ten
times
before
1972
.
She
and
her
sister
were
among
the
original
plaintiffs
.
From
the
1960s
to
1980s
,
some
of
the
children
were
sent
out
of
the
country
to
the

or

.
Some
of
the
plaintiffs
say
they
were
abused
by
their
foster
families
and
others
do
not
.
A
separate
settlement
has
been
offered
to
the
150,000
children
who
were
instead
sent
to
institutions
,
such
as
boarding
schools
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
There
is
also
no
dispute
about
the
fact
that
great
harm
was
done

Supreme
Court
Justice
Edward
P.
Belobaba
in
a
preliminary
decision
in
February
.
&quot;
The
'
scooped
'
children
lost
contact
with
their
families
.
They
lost
their
aboriginal
language
,
culture
and
identity
.
Neither
the
children
nor
their
foster
or
adoptive
parents
were
given
information
about
the
children
's
aboriginal
heritage
or
about
the
various
educational
and
other
benefits
that
they
were
entitled
to
receive
.
The
removed
children
vanished
'
with
scarcely
a
trace
.

&quot;
He
did
concede
that
the
founders
of
the
program
meant
well
,
but
major
sources
agree
it
was
subject
to
considerable
culture
clash
,
with
social
workers
removing
children
from
situations
that
were
later
found
not
to
be
abusive
or
neglectful
.

<p>
According
to
a
lawyer
for
some
of
the
plaintiffs
,
Jeffrey
Wilson
,
this
is
the
first
time
anyone
has
argued
that
the
loss
of
a
cultural
identity
in
a
lawsuit
in
a
<ref target="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/western%20world">
Western
</ref>
country
:
&quot;
No
First
Nations
case
yet
to
this
day
has
asked
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
loss
of
identity
is
an
actionable
wrong
.
Aboriginal
title
to
property
has
been
litigated
,
aboriginal
title
to
identity
has
not
,

told

.
</p>
<p>
The
First
Nations
people
make
up
approximately
four
percent
of
Canada
's
population
,
at
about
1.4
million
people
,
and
they
suffer
disproportionately
from
poverty
,
violence
,
addiction
and
crime
.
</p>
<p>
Canada
is
not
the
only
country
where
native
children
were
taken
away
from
their
families
.
From
1910
to
1970
,
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Australia">
Australian
</ref>
government
collected
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboriginal%20Australians">
Aboriginal
</ref>
children
,
who
came
to
be
called
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolen%20Generations">
Stolen
Generations
</ref>
,
and
relocated
them
to
schools
and
other
institutions
far
from
their
communities
.
In
1978
,
the
United
States
passed
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian%20Child%20Welfare%20Act">

to

was
the
first
of
Canada
's
provinces
to
apologize
for
the

program
,
in

.
The
federal
government
has
also
announced
plans
to
make
a
public
apology
.
