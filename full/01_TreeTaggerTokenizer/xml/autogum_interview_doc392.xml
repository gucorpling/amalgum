No

at

Sharin
,
did
you
ever
have
a
moment
where
you
confronted
your
own
death
?

Sharin

</hi>
When
I
was
nine
years
old
I
was
definitely
close
,
but
I
was
n't
aware
of
how
dangerous
it
was
.
When
I
think
of
it
now
I
'm
like
,
&quot;
Wow
!
That
could
have
been
it
.

I
get
much
more
affected
not
so
much
by
war
itself
but
when
I
hear
about
civilians
involved
in
war
.
But
I
was
much
more
affected
by
stuff
that
happens
in
Chechnya
,
for
instance
.
I
used
to
read
a
lot
about
that
,
and
that
is
a
forgotten
war
that
really
people
do
n't
give
a
shit
about
.

The
extreme
within
the
religion
here
in
the
U.S.
,
that
can
be
a
little
terrifying
,
I
think
.
But
religion
can
also
add
a
lot
of
purpose
to
people
,
and
when
they
have
purpose
they
can
be
more
balanced
and
open-minded
.

What
was
it
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Sharin
:
</hi>
I
was
living
in
the
countryside
and
there
was
a
well
with
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine">
urine
</ref>
from
the
cows
,
and
it
was
open
,
and
I
fell
into
it
.
My
neighbor
caught
my
hand
,
so
I
was
hanging
in
the
well
with
my
feet
in
the
urine
.
And
then
afterwards
,
my
parents
were
freaked
out
.
It
was
really
lucky
that
my
neighbor
was
right
there
and
he
caught
me
,
because
I
would
have
died
immediately
.
You
fall
into
that
urine
in
a
well
,
that
's
it
!
