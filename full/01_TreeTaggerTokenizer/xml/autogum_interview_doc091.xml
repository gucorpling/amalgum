And
I
,
you
know
,
am
concerned
about
that
because
I
love
my
five
daughters
and
I
want
them
to
grow
up
with
opportunity
.
I
want
them
to
grow
up
in
economic
freedom
and
to
be
able
to
compete
and
do
things
and
love
and
live
and
enjoy
life
and
not
have
a
country
on
the
brink
of
collapse
â€”
of
economic
collapse
.
So
I
'm
very
outspoken
on
issues
like
that
and
on
national
security
issues
and
also
on
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme%20Court">
Supreme
Court
</ref>
nomination
issues
,
and
that
sort
of
thing
.
And
because
of
that
,
that
's
led
to
speculation
.
</p>
<p>
When
the
speculation
took
place
regarding
Senator
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard%20Lugar">
Lugar
</ref>
and
also
Congressman
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan%20Burton">
Burton
</ref>
,
we
did
have
brief
discussions
with
my
family
,
with
my
daughters
,
around
our
kitchen
table
.
Some
of
my
daughters
have
been
character
actors
,
or
youth
interpreters
I
should
say
,
at
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conner%20Prairie">
Conner
Prairie
</ref>
,
a
live
museum
here
in
central
Indiana
,
others
have
served
as
members
of
the
Indianapolis
Children
's
Choir
.
They
're
all
very
involved
in
the
home
school
community
and
their
friends
are
here
.
So
I
told
them
that
if
I
ran
and
got
elected
to
federal
office
,
they
would
either
have
to
move
out
to
Washington
D.C.
,
or
they
would
n't
get
to
see
their
dad
three
nights
,
at
least
three
nights
out
of
the
week
.
And
once
I
gave
them
that
information
,
they
were
unanimous
in
their
opposition
to
me
running
for
Congress
or
the
United
States
Senate
.
Until
I
get
to
a
point
where
my
family
balance
can
be
taken
into
consideration
,
I
do
n't
anticipate
seeking
higher
office
.
But
I
'm
always
humble
and
grateful
that
people
consider
my
record
and
my
views
worthy
of
consideration
for
such
purpose
.

Just
briefly
,
senator
.
Your
passage
of
the
local
government
initiative
that
would
allow
governments
to
merge
was
very
successful
in
your
district
,
but
not
successful
elsewhere
around
Indiana
.
What
was
it
about
your
district
that
made
it
unique
in
that
it
decided
to
merge
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">

</hi>
:
Well
the
reform
that
came
from
House
Bill
1362
,
which
at
the
time
was
the
most
dramatic
reform
in
Title
36
,
in
probably
25
years
or
more
.
It
allowed
for
the
creation
of
a
government
of
the
people
,
by
the
people
,
for
the
people
subject
to
the
imagination
.
Whatever
the
mind
could
come
up
with
,
you
could
do
up
to
the
county
boundary
.
And
so
in
the
case
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle%20Township,%20Boone%20County,%20Indiana">
Eagle
</ref>
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union%20Township,%20Boone%20County,%20Indiana">
Union
Townships
</ref>
deciding
to
dissolve
themselves
and
then
enter
into
a
pact
with
the
town
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionsville,%20Indiana">
Zionsville
</ref>
and
create
the
new
town
of
Zionsville
,
it
took
vision
.
It
took
selfless
service
because
you
had
two
township
trustees
that
had
to
agree
to
dissolve
their
reason
for
being
.
Not
many
elected
officials
will
do
something
like
that
.
It
was
a
very
courageous
move
by
the
trustee
of
Eagle
and
the
trustee
of
Union
Townships
to
do
that
.
I
think
part
of
the
problem
that
we
've
had
in
other
parts
of
the
state
,
including
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Evansville,_Indiana">
Evansville
</ref>
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort%20Wayne,%20Indiana">
Fort
Wayne
</ref>
,
is
that
the
process
and
the
law
has
not
been
adequately
marketed
and
explained
to
the
public
and
to
elected
officials
.
But
right
now
in
Indiana
Code
,
you
could
reform
local
government
up
to
the
county
boundary
in
just
about
any
way
imaginable
to
the
mind
.
The
only
thing
that
really
is
the
constraint
is
the
imagination
.
