Measure
Dog
Height
</head>
<p>
Measuring
a
dog
's
height
can
be
important
when
assessing
how
much
it
has
grown
over
time
,
or
when
showing
it
in
dog
shows
.
The
height
measurement
on
a
dog
is
done
from
the
ground
to
its
withers
.
The
withers
is
the
highest
point
of
a
dog
's
shoulder
blades
.
Measuring
from
the
withers
to
the
ground
is
standard
for
all
dogs
,
and
allows
you
to
get
an
accurate
measurement
every
time
.

Stand
your
dog
against
a
wall
.
When
you
are
measuring
the
height
of
your
dog
,
you
will
need
it
to
be
standing
so
you
can
get
an
accurate
measurement
.
You
should
also
put
the
dog
against
a
wall
or
door
frame
.
This
will
give
you
a
fixed
point
next
to
the
dog
that
you
will
use
during
measurement
.

Make
sure
that
your
dog
is
standing
up
straight
.
Try
to
keep
the
dog
â€™s
stance
as
square
as
possible
,
with
all
on
the
floor
and
spaced
out
evenly
.
Its
legs
should
be
perpendicular
to
the
floor
and
its
feet
should
be
shoulder
width
apart
.

Feel
for
the
dog
's
withers
.
The
withers
on
a
dog
is
the
highest
point
of
its
shoulder
blades
.
It
is
located
behind
the
base
of
the
dog
's
neck
.
Feel
around
this
area
on
your
dog
and
locate
the
top
bony
point
of
the
shoulder
.

It
is
easier
to
locate
the
withers
on
a
dog
with
a
short
coat
.
You
may
even
be
able
to
identify
the
withers
just
by
looking
at
the
dog
's
body
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Place
a
level
across
your
dog
's
withers
.
Using
a
long
level
,
such
as
a
carpenter
's
level
,
place
the
length
of
it
on
the
dog
's
withers
with
the
end
touching
the
wall
.
Make
sure
the
level
is
indeed
level
,
then
mark
the
point
where
the
bottom
of
it
is
touching
the
wall
.
This
has
transferred
the
dog
's
height
measurement
onto
the
wall
.

If
you
do
n't
care
about
making
a
little
mark
on
your
wall
,
you
can
use
a
pencil
and
make
an
actual
mark
on
the
wall
.
However
,
if
you
do
n't
want
to
mark
up
your
wall
,
you
can
simply
hold
your
finger
at
the
spot
on
the
wall
or
place
a
piece
of
removable
tape
in
that
spot
.
</item>
<item>
You
can
also
make
the
measurement
against
your
refrigerator
and
use
a
magnet
to
mark
your
spot
.

Measure
from
the
ground
to
your
level
mark
.
Allow
the
dog
to
move
away
from
the
wall
.
Once
the
area
is
clear
,
you
can
easily
measure
from
the
ground
to
the
mark
that
you
made
.
This
is
the
height
of
your
dog
from
its
withers
to
the
ground
.

Keep
the
dog
still
.
In
order
to
get
an
accurate
measurement
,
you
need
to
have
your
dog
move
as
little
as
possible
.
With
highly
trained
dogs
,
such
as
show
dogs
,
this
is
usually
easy
to
accomplish
.
With
more
active
dogs
,
this
can
be
quite
a
feat
.

If
your
dog
will
not
stay
still
on
its
own
,
get
someone
to
help
you
.
They
may
be
able
to
hold
your
dog
still
or
distract
it
long
enough
for
you
to
get
an
accurate
measurement
.

Use
a
height
measurement
tool
.
There
are
measuring
sticks
available
from
veterinary
suppliers
that
have
an
adjustable
arm
that
sticks
out
to
the
side
.
These
are
useful
for
measuring
dogs
because
they
allow
the
bottom
of
the
stick
to
sit
on
the
ground
at
the
same
time
as
the
arm
is
adjusted
to
rest
at
the
withers
of
the
dog
.

When
using
this
type
of
measuring
stick
,
you
do
need
to
remember
to
keep
it
level
.
Luckily
,
many
of
the
height
measuring
tools
that
are
sold
contain
a
level
embedded
in
them
.

Use
a
wicket
when
measuring
dogs
for
show
.
Show
dogs
need
to
be
measured
to
make
sure
they
fit
within
the
parameters
set
for
their
breed
.
To
measure
dogs
quickly
and
effectively
,
dog
show
officials
use
a
wicket
,
which
is
a
u-shaped
measuring
stick
.
They
place
the
rounded
end
over
the
dog
at
the
top
of
its
shoulder
blades
and
make
sure
that
the
feet
of
the
wicket
can
touch
the
ground
.
If
they
can
,
the
dog
is
not
taller
than
the
allowed
height
.

The
height
of
the
wicket
can
be
adjusted
depending
on
the
height
parameters
of
the
breed
the
official
is
measuring
.
