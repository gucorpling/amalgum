Is
it
healthy
for
us
to
be
ringing
these
alarm
bells
every
time
one
nuance
in
the
argument
gets
addressed
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">

There
’s
a
difference
between
predicting
something
is
going
to
happen
that
might
be
an
inaccurate
prediction
and
making
factual
misstatements
about
what
has
already
happened
and
what
the
law
is
.
There
’s
a
real
difference
.
So
I
think
the
analogy
would
only
be
apt
if
somebody
said
,
“
The
Supreme
Court
already
<hi rend="italic">
has
</hi>
overturned
<hi rend="italic">
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe%20vs.%20Wade">
Roe
vs.
Wade
</ref>
</hi>
and
brought
back
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-alley%20abortion">
back-alley
abortions
</ref>
.
”
That
would
be
the
counterpart
to
saying
,
“
The
Supreme
Court
<hi rend="italic">
has
</hi>
removed
religion
from
the
public
schools
and
the
public
sphere
.
”
I
have
not
heard
any
pro-choice
—
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
But
let
’s
say
the
Christians
give
you
that
,
and
they
say
,
“
This
is
just
the
first
step
and
what
they
ultimately
want
is
not
to
have
the
word
God
said
<hi rend="italic">
anywhere
</hi>
in
the
public
square
.
”
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
NS
:
</hi>
But
that
’s
also
counter-factual
because
if
they
looked
at
the
ACLU
’s
policy
statements
and
they
looked
at
our
briefs
,
and
they
looked
at
our
legislative
testimony
,
they
would
see
that
we
are
<hi rend="italic">
constantly
</hi>
defending
the
rights
of
people
to
say
God
in
the
public
square
.
Every
day
we
have
cases
where
we
are
defending
street
preachers
and
people
trying
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptism">
baptize
</ref>
in
the
rivers
…
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
Whereas
in
the
abortion
argument
it
is
a
stated
goal
to
bring
about
the
end
of
<hi rend="italic">
Roe
v.
Wade
</hi>
.
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
NS
:
</hi>
Yes
.
Yes
.
But
it
’s
interesting
—
I
think
as
a
responsible
advocate
you
<hi rend="italic">
do
</hi>
have
to
read
between
the
lines
,
not
only
what
the
Supreme
Court
says
it
is
doing
,
but
what
it
actually
does
,
and
here
you
not
only
have
to
rely
upon
those
who
agree
with
the
result
,
but
those
who
disagree
with
the
result
.
In
the
so-called
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonzales%20v.%20Carhart">
Partial-Birth
Abortion
Ban
Case
</ref>
,
no
less
an
anti-abortion
proponent
than
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonin%20Scalia">
Justice
Scalia
</ref>
joined
by
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence%20Thomas">
Justice
Thomas
</ref>
,
in
his
separate
opinion
,
chided
the
majority
for
not
coming
out
and
explicitly
saying
that
they
had
overturned
not
<hi rend="italic">
Roe
vs.
Wade
</hi>
,
but
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenberg%20v.%20Carhart">
prior
partial-birth
abortion
ban
case
</ref>
.
Remember
there
had
been
one
six
years
before
from
Nebraska
,
and
that
’s
why
every
lower
court
to
consider
this
said
that
based
upon
that
precedent
this
law
is
indistinguishable
,
and
that
’s
why
we
are
striking
down
this
federal
law
.
The
result
here
got
a
majority
,
but
there
were
two
separate
opinions
,
one
that
was
written
by
Kennedy
and
joined
by
the
new
justices
;
and
Scalia
and
Thomas
supported
the
result
.
But
they
had
a
separate
opinion
that
said
,
“
You
are
not
being
honest
,
you
have
effectively
overturned
that
earlier
case
,
why
do
n’t
you
come
out
and
say
so
?
”
And
the
campaign
finance
reform
case
,
same
thing
.
They
said
they
were
not
overturning
their
earlier
decision
that
upheld
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCain-Feingold">
McCain-Feingold
</ref>
,
and
Scalia
had
a
very
quotable
line
where
he
was
making
the
point
he
made
with
many
earlier
decisions
,
that
he
supported
the
result
,
but
<hi rend="italic">
he
</hi>
was
saying
that
they
are
not
being
honest
about
how
far-reaching
the
result
is
.
This
one
was
quoted
a
lot
in
the
press
;
he
said
,
“
It
is
faux
judicial
restraint
,
which
is
really
judicial
obfuscation
.
”
So
as
a
responsible
analyst
and
advocate
,
you
have
to
look
behind
the
lines
.
Many
are
what
we
now
know
as
landmark
decisions
,
but
they
did
n’t
tell
us
they
were
landmark
decisions
,
right
?
The
old
Commerce
Clause
cases
.
But
when
the
Supreme
Court
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National%20Labor%20Relations%20Board%20v.%20Jones%20&amp;%20Laughlin%20Steel%20Corporation">
overturned
the
narrow
view
of
the
Commerce
Clause
in
1937
</ref>
,
it
did
n’t
say
it
was
making
new
law
.
It
paid
lip
service
to
the
same
old
tests
.
But
lo-and-behold
,
it
came
out
differently
.
