Introduction
</head>
<p>
A
very
interesting
problem
in
non-equilibrium
thermodynamics
and
in
the
theory
of
thermodynamics
in
general
,
is
to
determine
the
efficiency
with
which
energy
is
exchanged
.
In
fact
,
in
many
biological
systems
,
the
transfer
of
energy
is
of
decisive
importance
.
It
is
well
known
that
all
intracellular
processes
can
be
studied
as
chemical
reactions
of
some
kind
,
and
that
many
of
the
biochemical
reactions
in
living
organisms
have
been
seen
to
be
catalyzed
by
enzymes
;
there
are
some
good
examples
where
the
energetic
properties
studied
are
really
relevant
.
</p>
<p>
Considering
the
classical
ideas
of
thermodynamics
when
one
wants
to
analyze
biological
systems
,
it
is
typical
to
take
the
free
energy
of
the
biological
system
and
convert
it
into
work
.
For
instance
,
to
carry
out
a
transport
process
or
a
chemical
reaction
,
it
is
usual
for
this
type
of
study
to
focus
on
analyzing
the
energetic
properties
of
such
systems
.
Note
,
however
,
that
the
subject
is
hard
to
study
from
the
classical
perspective
of
thermodynamics
,
since
the
temperature
in
many
biological
systems
is
homogeneous
)
.
</p>
<p>
An
additional
step
to
analyze
the
energetic
properties
of
a
simple
energy
converter
was
given
by
Curzon
and
Ahlborn
in
1975
,
who
proposed
a
model
which
operates
between
two
heat
sources
with
high
and
low
temperatures
,
and
,
respectively
.
They
found
an
expression
for
the
efficiency
at
maximum
power
output
given
by
,
a
result
that
in
principle
is
independent
of
the
model
parameters
and
only
depends
on
the
temperatures
of
the
heat
reservoirs
;
analogously
this
is
what
happens
with
the
efficiency
for
a
reversible
Carnot
cycle
.
</p>
<p>
Considering
the
Curzon
and
Alhbor
article
,
many
authors
began
to
introduce
different
objective
functions
,
among
others
,
such
as
the
ecological
function
,
the
omega
function
,
the
efficient
power
function
,
etc.
All
of
them
trying
to
obtain
efficiency
and
power
values
mainly
for
real
power
plants
,
but
also
heat
pumps
and
refrigerators
.
</p>
<p>
Moreover
,
it
was
reported
that
thermal
engines
show
some
universality
regarding
the
behavior
of
the
efficiency
when
it
works
at
the
maximum
power
regime
,
although
the
analyzed
models
are
different
in
nature
and
scale
.
Recently
,
some
thermal
engines
with
kinetic
and
mesoscopic
descriptions
were
published
as
examples
of
devices
which
convert
non-thermal
energy
(
mainly
chemical
energy
)
into
useful
work
.
The
importance
of
these
models
is
that
the
energy
production
processes
seen
in
the
molecular
biological
level
obey
similar
principles
as
those
observed
in
the
classical
thermal
engines
.
</p>
<p>
On
the
other
hand
,
Kedem
et
al.
published
in
1965
the
first
step
of
a
non-equilibrium
theory
towards
a
description
of
linear
converters
of
energy
(
which
would
be
called
Linear
Irreversible
Thermodynamics
,
LIT
)
.
Since
then
,
many
authors
have
agreed
in
considering
this
theory
as
a
basis
for
the
analysis
of
non-equilibrium
systems
,
(
particularly
,
in
biological
systems
remarkably
close
to
the
equilibrium
)
.
One
of
the
relevant
questions
tackled
by
Kedem
et
al.
at
that
time
was
to
answer
which
was
the
maximal
efficiency
of
the
oxidative
phosphorylation
in
an
isolated
mitochondrion
.
Kandem
et
al.
obtained
some
qualitative
predictions
confirmed
by
experimental
data
.
</p>
<p>
For
biological
process
,
for
instance
,
several
authors
have
studied
different
optimal
regimes
like
Prigogine
with
his
minimum
entropy
production
theorem
.
Odun
and
Pinkerton
who
analyzed
the
maximum
power
output
regime
for
various
biological
systems
,
Stucki
who
introduced
some
optimal
criteria
to
study
the
optimum
oxidative
phosphorylation
regime
,
among
others
who
have
studied
many
biological
energy
conversion
processes
by
means
of
the
LIT
where
some
optimum
performance
regimes
have
been
analyzed
.
</p>
<p>
In
this
context
,
we
have
decided
to
study
the
thermodynamical
properties
of
an
energetic
converting
biological
process
,
using
for
this
purpose
a
simple
model
for
an
enzymatic
reaction
that
couples
one
exothermic
and
one
endothermic
reaction
in
the
same
fashion
described
by
Diaz-Hernandez
et
al.
,
but
now
using
the
Linear
Irreversible
Thermodynamics
(
LIT
)
for
three
different
operating
regimes
,
;
namely
,
Maximum
Power
Output
(
MPO
)
,
Maximum
Ecological
Function
(
MEF
)
and
Maximum
Efficient
Power
Function
(
MEPF
)
,
respectively
.
