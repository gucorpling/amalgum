Taal
Volcano
is
part
of
a
chain
of
volcanoes
that
have
existed
since
prehistoric
times
,
resulting
from
the
subduction
of
the
Eurasian
Plate

Pacific
Plate
.

one

History
</head>
<p>
Taal
Volcano
is
an
active
volcano
,
with
its
earliest
recorded
eruption
in
1572
.
The
lake
and
the
volcano
were
first
named
as
<hi rend="italic">
Bonbon
</hi>
(
or
<hi rend="italic">
Bombón
</hi>
)
,
which
also
gave
the
historical
names
of
the
present-day
town
of
<ref target="Taal">
Taal
</ref>
and
the
province
of
<ref target="Batangas">
Batangas
</ref>
.
</p>
<p>
Taal
Volcano
's
most
destructive
eruptions
occurred
in
1755
and
1910
.
The
very
destructive
1755
eruption
destroyed
the
original
downtown
of
<ref target="Taal">
Taal
</ref>
,
now
part
of
the
little
town
of
San
Nicolas
,
as
well
as
the
original
town
center
of
present-day
<ref target="Lipa">
Lipa
</ref>
,
now
part
of
the
town
of
Mataasnakahoy
,
and
is
well
recorded
in
an
account
by
a
Spanish
priest
.
Ash
and
mud
from
the
1755
eruption
were
also
carried
by
storms
into
the
village
of
Caysasay
(
present-day
Taal
)
and
as
far
as
Balayan
.

The
volcano
proper
forms
the
<hi rend="bold">
Volcano
Island
</hi>
,
composed
of
seven
volcanic
cones
and
the
caldera
lake
.
Taal
Lake
also
forms
the
volcano
,
making
the
system
complex
.
Volcanic
activity
can
be
noticed
through
changes
in
Taal
Lake
;
some
fish
kill
incidents
on
the
lake
are
blamed
on
volcanic
activity
,
though
overcrowded
fish
pens
(
<hi rend="italic">
baklad
</hi>
)
are
often
the
cause
.
</p>
<p>
From
Tagaytay
,
Taal
Volcano
,
alongside
Taal
Lake
,
dominate
the
landscape
,
with
the
dormant
cone
Binintiang
Malaki
being
the
most
prominent
.
The
volcano
is
covered
by
vegetation
up
to
the
tree
line
at
the
crater
lake
.
On
the
base
are
some
villages
relying
on
fishing
in
Taal
Lake
and
agriculture
in
the
fertile
soil
of
Volcano
Island
.

Taal
Lake
is
home
to
the
<hi rend="italic">
tawilis
</hi>
(
<hi rend="italic">
Sardinella
tawilis
</hi>
)
,
a
species
of
sardine
endemic
to
the
lake
.
It
is
often
served
as
a
local
dish
in
the
surrounding
area
,
but
overfishing
is
threatening
the
<hi rend="italic">
tawilis
</hi>
population
,
so
it
was
designated
an
endangered
species
in
2019
by
the
International
Union
for
the
Conservation
of
Nature
(
IUCN
)
,
and
a
closed
season
is
implemented
to
allow
the
fish
to
increase
in
number
.

<p>
Taal
Volcano
is
one
of
the
most
accessible
in
Luzon
island
,
and
many
tourists
,
local
and
foreign
,
go
here
,
usually
in
package
tours
from
Tagaytay
.
Peak
season
traffic
can
be
high
,
and
tours
can
get
fully
booked
.
It
is
possible
to
just
see
the
volcano
and
the
lake
without
getting
further
into
Volcano
Island
,
or
have
a
do-it-yourself
tour
,
avoiding
completely
Tagaytay
where
the
package
tour
providers
are
based
and
getting
directly
into
the
boats
in
Talisay
or
Laurel
.
</p>
<p>
The
nearest
airport
is
in
<ref target="Ninoy%20Aquino%20International%20Airport">
Manila
</ref>
,
and
the
closest
seaport
is
in
<ref target="Batangas%20%28city%29%23By%20boat">
Batangas
City
</ref>
.
From
either
way
,
there
is
public
transportation
into
the
jump-off
points
.
</p>
<head>
By
car
</head>
<p>
Most
visitors
will
come
to
Tagaytay
by
car
,
and
there
,
they
will
purchase
the
tour
packages
to
Taal
,
but
it
's
possible
to
get
into
the
towns
directly
without
dealing
with
the
tour
operators
.
</p>
<p>
Talisay
can
be
reached
directly
via
<hi rend="bold">
Talisay-Tanauan
Road
</hi>
,
which
can
be
accessed
from
STAR
Tollway
at
Tanauan
.
From
Tagaytay
,
<hi rend="bold">
Talisay-Tagaytay
Road
</hi>
runs
through
jungle
at
the
mountain
slopes
down
to
the
lakeside
,
where
it
joins
Talisay-Tanauan
and
Talisay-Laurel
roads
.
Talisay-Tagaytay
and
Talisay-Tanauan
roads
are
both
numbered
as
Route
421
,
but
the
route
number
signs
do
n't
say
where
you
should
turn
to
Talisay
town
proper
,
so
from
Tagaytay
,
watch
for
signs
that
point
to
Tanauan
.
