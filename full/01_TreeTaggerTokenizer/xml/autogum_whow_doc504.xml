of
us

and

on
top
of
your
ball
game
allows
you
to
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Make_People_Feel_Good">
feel
at

health

<item>
Do
n't
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Stop_Procrastinating">
procrastinate
</ref>
or
put
things
on
hold
.
Once
you
start
delaying
things
is
when
your
life
starts
getting
backed
up
.
You
'll
then
have
way
too
much
to
do
all
at
once
and
it
may
not
all
be
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Finish_Your_Homework">
finished
on
time
</ref>
either
.
Then
you
'll
just
start
to
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Reduce_Stress">
stress
yourself
out
</ref>
because
then
you
'll
start
to
feel
like
you
're
slowing
down
while
life
is
only
moving
forward
,
leaving
you
for
dust
.
Everything
will
just
start
to
overwhelm
you
to
a
point
to
where
you
almost
ca
n't
even
take
it
anymore
.

Begin
early
by
breaking
tasks
into
small
pieces
.
If
you
need
to
read
a
400-page
book
for
class
,
it
can
feel
overwhelming
,
and
you
may
want
to
stop
.
Force
yourself
to
start
.
Promise
yourself
that
you
'll
read
one
chapter
every
day
.
When
the
task
becomes
less
monumental
,
it
is
easier
to
begin
.

Give
yourself
a
schedule
.
Procrastination
is
easier
when
you
have
a
large
chunk
of
time
and
are
n't
sure
how
to
spend
it
.
Break
your
time
into
pieces
,
so
you
are
never
overwhelmed
by
the
amount
of
work
you
have
to
do
.
If
you
successfully
follow
the
schedule
,
give
yourself
a
reward
—
a
favorite
activity
,
calling
a
loved
one
,
a
special
meal
,
or
whatever
motivates
you
.

Do
not
overwhelm
yourself
.
It
's
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Be_Nice">
nice
</ref>
to
be
well
rounded
and
to
do
some
extra
curricular
activities
or
socialize
after
work
but
only
do
what
you
know
you
can
handle
.
Do
not
pack
work
on
top
of
work
onto
yourself
,
just
because
it
&quot;
looks
nice
&quot;
.
Sure
,
with
success
comes
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Be_a_Hard_Worker">
hard
work
</ref>
but
it
is
never
okay
when
you
're
hurting
yourself
.
Find
a
balance
.

Give
yourself
time
to
work
on
hobbies
,
be
with
friends
,
or
do
therapeutic
activities
.

Remember
that
performance
should
never
come
at
the
expense
of
physical
or
emotional
health
.
Perfection
is
not
a
realistic
goal
.

Make
goals
for

</ref>
.
It
is
always
good
to
keep
making
goals
for
yourselves
because
it
gives
yourself
something
new
to
work
towards
and
keeps
yourself
going
in
life
.
With
new
goals
comes
new
decisions
and
actions
being
taken
which
will
be
a
stepping
stone
to
the
next
step
in
life
.
Just
make
sure
you
think
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Use_Your_Time_Wisely">
wisely
</ref>
before
you
decide
on
doing
anything
and
know
that
it
is
what
's
best
for
yourself
.
Sometimes
our
goals
change
,
and
that
's
okay
.
We
all
change
.
Everyday
matter
of
fact
.
You
just
have
to
adjust
and
adapt
.

Get
outdoors
every
day
.
Sunlight
and
exercise
are
known
to
boost
mood
.
Sometimes
,
when
you
feel
overwhelmed
,
your
body
needs
a
quick
break
.
Taking
a
five-
or
ten-minute
walk
will
refresh
you
,
improving
your
mood
and
ability
to
focus
.

<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Stand_Up_for_Something_You_Believe_In">
Know
what
you
stand
for
</ref>
.
You
should
always
keep
your
morals
and
beliefs
close
to
you
.
Even
if
some
people
disagree
or
think
you
're
weird
for
them
,
stand
by
them
!
They
're
what
YOU
believe
in
,
do
n't
let
anyone
make
you
feel
bad
for
any
of
it
.
That
's
one
way
to
go
wrong
.
Let
your
morals
and
beliefs
be
known
.
If
you
feel
like
something
around
you
is
morally
wrong
,
say
something
.
Do
n't
be
ashamed
.
Your
morals
and
beliefs
are
a
part
of
you
,
it
's
like
being
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Not_Feel_Ashamed_when_You_Make_a_Small_Mistake">
ashamed
</ref>
of
yourself
.
That
's
never

Accept
your
identity
—
do
n't
fight
it
.
There
are
some
things
we
cannot
change
about
ourselves
:
race
,
past
,
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Accept_Yourself_As_Bisexual">
sexual
orientation
</ref>
,
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Live_With_Disabilities">
disability
</ref>
,
et
cetera
.
Do
n't
feel
the
need
to
assimilate
or
hide
who
you
are
.
Your
identity
is
fundamentally
okay
.

Believe
in
yourself

</ref>
The
last
,
yet
most
important
part
,
believing
in
yourself
.
As
long
as
you
believe
in
yourself
that
will
be
your
drive
to
keep
going
regardless
of
the
standards
.
You
'll
know
you
have
the
power
to
keep
going
without
the
need
of
encouragement
from
others
.
Believing
in
yourself
is
one
of
the
most
powerful
things
you
could
do
for
yourself
.
It
brings
on
determination
,
optimism
,
and
other
characteristics
that
will
only
help
lead
you
to
success
.
So
