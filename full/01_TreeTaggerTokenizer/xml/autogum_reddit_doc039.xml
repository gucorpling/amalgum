Okay
look
here
is
the
big
difference
between
p2w
and
pay
to
progress
using
Vindictus
as
an
example
,
a
game
that
had
and
honestly
still
probably
has
the
best
action
gameplay
on
the
market
.
Note
to
take
:
Vindictus
is
dead
due
to
its
p2w
nature
.
P2W
means
you
spend
money
and
you
win
,
its
in
the
name
lul
,
it
basically
suggests
that
you
can
get
an
advantage
that
a
free
to
play
player
could
not
.
This
is
evident
in
Vindictus
-
RNG
upgrades
from
+8
and
further
with
max
being
+15
,
item
gets
destroyed
on
failure
,
but
hey
,
you
can
buy
an
item
shop
rune
to
avoid
destruction
for
only
9.99$
!
Also
,
make
sure
you
're
the
first
one
to
get
that
+15
item
that
gives
much
,
much
greater
stats
than
let
's
say
a
+12
weapon
,
because
if
you
are
the
one
doing
the
most
boss
damage
,
you
get
extra
drop
!
Well
ai
n't
that
handy
.
Do
n't
forget
to
also
buy
item
shop
only
costumes
which
give
extra
stats
to
your
character
while
you
're
at
it
!
</p>
<p>
Now
compare
it
to
Blade
and
Soul
.
Sure
,
you
can
spend
a
million
Euro
on
trove
if
you
're
Bill
Gates
and
basically
get
full
gear
in
no
time
,
but
the
key
point
to
it
is
-
if
you
choose
not
to
,
you
are
not
going
to
be
ahead
of
someone
who
farmed
it
with
time
,
and
are
not
going
to
benefit
from
it
in
any
way
,
except
for
feeling
good
about
yourself
and
I
guess
6v6
,
which
well
I
agree
is
an
argument
towards
BNS
being
P2W
,
but
c'mon
now
people
,
there
is
so
much
more
to
do
in
the
game
than
6v6
,
which
quite
honestly
does
n't
give
that
good
of
rewards
if
you
compare
it
to
the
time
spend
in
it
,
which
you
could
use
to
farm
Naksun
or
SSP
for
those
precious
moonstones
.
</p>
<p>
Basically
what
I
am
trying
to
say
,
quit
complaining
so
much
about
the
game
being
P2W
when
clearly
only
1
small
end-game
aspect
of
it
is
P2W
.
You
do
not
get
anything
extra
for
being
the
best
in
your
party
,
you
cannot
get
any
sort
of
stat
boost
that
a
free
to
play
player
could
not
get
by
grind
and
if
we
really
get
into
it
,
people
who
spend
these
giant
amounts
of
money
are
the
ones
enabling
us
to
play
the
game
for
free
,
instead
of
paying
subscription
money
like
in
the
Korean
servers
.
</p>
<p>
Thats
just
a
bit
of
a
rant
from
me
I
guess
,
Im
no
whale
and
my
mediocre
equipment
vouches
for
that
,
but
Im
just
tired
of
these
BNS
is
P2W
posts
when
I
honestly
do
n't
see
any
game
in
the
market
at
the
moment
which
comes
as
close
to
being
equalized
between
free
to
play
players
and
P2W
players
.
