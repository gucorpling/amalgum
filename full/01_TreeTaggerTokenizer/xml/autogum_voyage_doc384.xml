adopted

.
Its
economy
,
one

is
dominated
by
diamond
mining

History
</head>
<p>
Botswana
was
never
colonized
by
Europeans
.
Instead
,
the
Three
Chiefs
went
to
the
Queen
of
England
to
ask
for
protection
from
Boers
to
the
south
and
Ndebele
tribes
from
the
north-east
.
The
Boers
were
(
to
them
)
the
white
people
that
had
invaded
and
were
taking
over
South
Africa
.
The
Queen
obliged
.
In
1964
the
Three
Chiefs
went
back
to
England
and
told
the
Queen
that
they
did
not
need
the
protection
any
more
.
The
Queen
did
away
with
the
protection
,
and
the
Chiefs
went
back
to
Botswana
.
Botswana
discovered
diamonds
in
1965
.
They
produce
65
%
of
the
world
diamonds
today
.
In
1969
DeBeers
created
a
partnership
with
the
Botswana
government
to
create
the
company
Debswana
.
</p>
<head>

<p>
Botswana
has
been
a
stable
representative
democracy
since
independence
and
has
been
largely
devoid
of
the
racial
and
ethnic
conflict
some
of
its
neighbours
have
suffered
from
—
perhaps
due
in
part
to
the
relative
dominance
of
its
majority
Tswana
ethnic
group
.
Since
the
turn
of
the
century
,
thousands
of
Zimbabweans
have
sought
sanctuary
and
economic
betterment
.
</p>
<p>
One
of
the
poorest
countries
at
independence
,
Botswana
transformed
itself
into
one
of
the
fastest-growing
economies
in
the
world
with
a
GDP
(
purchasing
power
parity
)
per
capita
of
about
USD14,000
<hi rend="italic">
per
annum
</hi>
.
In
contrast
to
the
sad
situation
of
its
eastern
neighbour
,
Zimbabwe
,
kleptocracy
has
been
absent
and
Botswana
now
also
has
the
second
highest
Human
Development
Index
of
all
continental
Sub-Saharan
African
countries
.
