Make
a
Jack
in
the
Box
</head>
<p>
A
Jack
in
the
Box
is
a
fun
toy
that
's
been
around
for
hundreds
of
years
.
While
it
may
seem
complex
,
a
Jack
in
the
Box
actually
works
with
very
simple
mechanics
.
Making
your
own
can
be
a
fun
arts
and
crafts
activity
.
With
some
cardboard
,
glue
,
magnets
,
a
spring
,
and
a
few
other
parts
,
you
can
make
your
very
own
Jack
in
the
Box
.

Constructing
the
Box
</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Find
a
sturdy
piece
of
cardboard
.
You
'll
need
a
thick
and
sturdy
piece
of
cardboard
for
the
box
to
support
itself
.
The
kind
from
a
large
packing
box
should
work
well
.

You
'll
be
cutting
out
6
squares
that
are
each
6
&quot;
x
6
&quot;
(
15
cm
x
15
cm
)
,
so
your
piece
of
cardboard
will
need
to
be
at
least
18
&quot;
x
12
&quot;
(
45
cm
x
30
)
.
If
you
ca
n't
find
a
piece
that
big
,
then
several
pieces
will
work
fine
too
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Draw
six
6
&quot;
X
6
&quot;
(
15
cm
x
15
cm
)
boxes
on
the
piece
of
cardboard
.
These
six
squares
will
form
the
walls
,
floor
,
and
lid
of
your
Jack
in
the
Box
.
Use
a
ruler
to
measure
and
make
sure
your
lines
are
straight
.

<item>
Make
sure
you
use
a
dark
pen
or
marker
.
Otherwise
,
you
may
not
be
able
to
see
your
lines
when
you
cut
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Cut
out
each
box
.
Use
a
pair
of
sharp
scissors
or
a
box
cutter
.
Carefully
cut
along
the
lines
you
drew
so
the
cardboard
squares
are
the
right
size
.
If
you
're
using
a
box
cutter
,
make
sure
the
cardboard
is
placed
on
a
solid
surface
.

<item>
Wear
gloves
during
this
step
to
prevent
paper
cuts
or
any
injuries
for
the
scissors
or
box
cutter
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Glue
4
of
the
squares
together
,
making
a
cube
with
no
top
or
bottom
.
Hot
glue
is
the
best
choice
for
this
step
.
White
glue
wo
n't
be
strong
enough
to
keep
the
box
together
.
This
forms
the
outside
structure
of
the
box
.
<figure rend="Make a Jack in the Box Step 4.360p.mp4">

<list type="unordered">
<item>
Glue
the
edges
of
the
cardboard
together
to
form
the
cube
.
If
the
glue
does
n't
seem
to
be
making
a
strong
seal
,
you
can
use
strips
of
tape
to
secure
the
cube
while
the
glue
hardens
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Glue
another
square
to
the
bottom
of
the
cube
.
Line
up
the
square
perfectly
with
the
rest
of
the
cube
or
your
box
will
be
uneven
.
This
will
form
the
floor
of
the
box
.
<figure rend="Make a Jack in the Box Step 5.360p.mp4">
</figure>
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Lay
the
square
down
flat
and
put
glue
around
the
edge
.
Then
slowly
lower
the
box
onto
the
square
,
making
sure
the
glue
makes
contact
with
all
edges
of
the
box
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Make
a
hinge
with
the
final
square
.
Do
n't
glue
the
final
square
to
the
box
,
or
your
Jack
in
the
Box
wo
n't
open
.
Instead
,
rest
the
square
on
top
of
the
box
,
making
sure
to
line
up
all
the
sides
.
Then
,
use
a
strip
of
tape
to
fasten
one
side
of
the
square
to
the
box
.
This
will
form
a
simple
hinge
that
allows
your
box
to
open
.

Clear
tape
is
the
best
choice
here
.
Colored
tape
might
throw
off
your
designs
when
you
decorate
your
box
later
on
.

Find
2
small
magnets
.
There
are
lots
of
ways
you
could
make
the
seal
for
your
box
,
but
a
simple
method
uses
magnets
.
Start
by
finding
2
magnets
.
These
should
be
square
or
circle
and
small
,
not
more
than
long
.

Craft
or
hardware
stores
usually
have
small
magnets
that
are
meant
to
hold
boxes
or
cabinets
closed
.
Looking
for
these
should
give
you
a
good
start
.
</item>
<item>
Remember
to
find
out
which
sides
of
the
magnets
attract
each
other
.
Those
are
the
two
sides
you
'll
line
up
when
making
your
seal
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Glue
one
magnet
to
the
bottom
of
the
box
's
lid
.
This
should
be
on
the
opposite
side
where
you
placed
the
tape
.
On
the
edge
of
the
lid
and
in
the
center
,
glue
the
first
magnet
.
<figure rend="Make a Jack in the Box Step 8.360p.mp4">
</figure>
</item>
<item>
Glue
another
magnet
directly
under
the
first
magnet
.
The
next
magnet
should
be
placed
on
the
inside
wall
of
the
box
so
the
two
magnets
touch
each
other
when
the
lid
is
closed
.
In
this
position
,
they
will
attract
each
other
and
keep
the
box
sealed
.
<figure rend="Make a Jack in the Box Step 9.360p.mp4">
</figure>
<list type="unordered">
<item>
To
find
the
right
position
for
the
second
magnet
,
start
by
closing
the
box
slowly
.
This
way
you
'll
be
able
to
see
where
the
magnet
will
rest
when
the
box
is
sealed
.
The
best
place
for
the
second
magnet
is
right
under
that
point
,
so
the
two
magnets
touch
when
the
lid
is
closed
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Test
out
your
seal
.
See
if
your
seal
is
holding
after
you
glue
both
magnets
.
Pull
up
slightly
to
see
how
tight
the
seal
is
.
Flip
the
box
upside
down
and
see
if
it
holds
.

Glue
a
compression
spring
to
the
bottom
of
the
box
.
Draw
a
circle
in
the
middle
of
the
box
's
floor
to
see
where
you
'll
place
the
spring
.
Then
put
glue
on
the
bottom
of
the
spring
and
place
it
over
the
circle
you
drew
.
Hold
the
spring
down
for
a
few
seconds
to
make
sure
the
glue
seals
.

Compression
springs
come
in
lots
of
sizes
.
For
this
project
,
you
'll
want
one
that
's
slightly
taller
than
the
box
,
or
about
.
Your
local
craft
store
should
have
plenty
of
options
.
</item>
<item>
Test
the
seal
by
making
sure
the
box
stays
closed
when
the
spring
is
in
place
.
If
the
box
does
n't
stay
closed
,
your
spring
is
too
big
or
your
seal
is
too
loose
.

Put
a

sock
puppet
</ref>
on
the
spring
.
Your
Jack
in
the
Box
needs
a
character
to
pop
out
!
A
sock
puppet
is
perfect
because
it
can
fit
snugly
over
the
spring
.

You
could
also
draw
and
cut
out
a
simple
face
from
a
piece
of
paper
and
glue
it
to
the
top
of
the
spring
for
a
simpler
design

!
Put
it
on
a
table

the

do
