to
program
.

editor
Johnny
Wilson
described
Scorpia
as
&quot;
one
of
the
most
refreshing
people
you
could
ever
meet
&quot;
and
praised
her
encyclopedic
knowledge
of
games
'
puzzles
.
He
cited
one
example
where
the
two
clashed
,
the
role-playing
game
<hi rend="italic">
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darklands_(video_game)">

</hi>
.
Scorpia
wrote
a
negative
review
that
criticized
the
game
's
bugs
,
and
Wilson
attached
an
editorial
sidebar
that
gave
a
more
positive
view
.
Wilson
later
acknowledged
this
was
a
bad
idea
,
saying
that
Scorpia
's
fans
correctly
criticized
him
for
undercutting
her
review
and
overlooking
the
game
's
flaws
.
Because
the
magazine
required
a
reviewer
to
finish
the
game
before
publishing
the
review
,
Wilson
said
Scorpia
favored
linearity
,
resulting
in
unwarranted
criticism
of
some
open-ended
works
;
<hi rend="italic">
CGW

thus
sometimes
did
not
assign
her
such
games

She
said
it
was
intimated
to
her
that
the
magazine
wanted
to
go
in
a
different
direction
.
She
neither
looked
for
further
work
in

journalism
nor
received
any
offers
;
she
attributed
her
reputation
for
tough
reviews
as

the
latter

Scorpia
started

She
said
she
was
already
known
as
Scorpia
because
of
her
work
in

and
found
it

more

her

She
values
her
