These
are
secular
organizations
and
they
are
definitely
related
to
Scientology
in
that
the
entity
that
manages
them
are
all
members
of
Scientology
's
Sea
Organization
.
When
I
was
the
Watchdog
Committee
member
for
the
ABLE
sector
,
one
of
my
statistics
was
&quot;
Reserves
&quot;
which
was
made
up
of
the
money
collected
from
the
tithes
of
each
of
these
entities
.
David
Miscavige
appointed
me
to
the
WDC
ABLE
position
and
then
issued
a
series
of
directions
on
what
actions
to
be
taken
with
the
sector
over
the
year
that
I
held
that
job
.

After
being
told
by
David
Miscavige
that
your
husband
at
the
time
,
Jim
Mortland
,
was
being
removed
or
&quot;
offloaded
&quot;
from
Scientology
's
Sea
Organization
,
you
were
called
into
the
office
of
the
Internal
Executive
where
you
were
pressured
into
making
a
decision
to
stay
in
the
Sea
Org
and
separate
from
your
husband
.
You
write
in
the
book
,
that
your
&quot;
brainwashed
response
&quot;
was
to
answer
,
&quot;
I
'm
staying
&quot;
.
Why
did
you
characterize
this
as
a
brainwashed
response
.
How
and
why
did
you
come
to
believe
you
had
been
a
victim
of

AS
</hi>
:
Per
this
Wikipedia
definition
,
&quot;
Mind
control
(
also
known
as
brainwashing
,
coercive
persuasion
,
mind
abuse
,
thought
control
,
or
thought
reform
)
refers
to
a
process
in
which
a
group
or
individual
'
systematically
uses
unethically
manipulative
methods
to
persuade
others
to
conform
to
the
wishes
of
the
manipulator(s)
,
often
to
the
detriment
of
the
person
being
manipulated
'
.
&quot;
In
my
right
mind
,
I
would
not
have
walked
away
from
my
husband
of
17
years
.
In
my
right
mind
,
I
would
not
have
&quot;
turned
a
blind
eye
&quot;
when
I
witnessed
a
dozen
accounts
of
assault
&amp;
battery
being
committed
on
my
comrades
by
David
Miscavige
.
And
I
would
never
have
given
in
to
the
physical
labor
and
other
&quot;
ethics
&quot;
actions
taken
on
myself
and
others
for
trumped
up
offenses
.
But
I
now
understand
that
I
was
under
the
influence
of
mind
control
.
This
is
not
a
light
matter
.
People
can
laugh
that
concept
off
so
readily
,
but
it
's
a
very
REAL
thing
.
When
one
considers
what
is
at
stake
(
or
is
thought
to
be
at
stake
)
if
one
were
to
step
out
of
line
or
violate
the
rules
in
any
way
,
you
try
to
remain
quiet
and
compliant
.
In
Scientology
,
if
you
get
yourself
in
enough
trouble
(
from
some
executive
's
point
of
view
)
,
you
can
be
banned
from
ever
being
allowed
to
receive
the
upper
level
services
in
Scientology
–
and
thus
enslave
yourself
as
a
spiritual
being
for
eternity
.
Another
more
minor
factor
,
but
still
major
enough
to
keep
you
in
line
is
the
threat
that
any
of
your
family
or
friends
in
Scientology
would
have
to
disconnect
from
you
if
you
were
no
longer
in
good
standing
.
So
to
say
you
want
to
leave
,
to
go
against
the
head
of
the
organization
,
to
report
to
outside
authorities
what
's
going
on
inside
is
considered
more
of
a
crime
than
being
quiet
and
compliant
as
a
&quot;
good
Scientologist
&quot;
.
This
is
what
I
consider
has
people
brainwashed
.
It
's
a
way
to
control
their
rational
thinking
.
It
's
&quot;
the
end
justifies
the
means
&quot;
.
When
I
realized
that
I
had
been
rationalizing
away
utter
insanities
that
I
both
witnessed
and
experienced
in
the
organization
and
that
I
needed
to
simply
look
at
what
was
factually
in
front
of
me
,
I
started
making
my
plans
to
leave
.
The
details
of
this
revelation
and
how
I
finally
got
out
is
all
detailed
in
my
book
.
