devices

evolved
quickly
during
the
21st
century
.
Today
it
is
easier
and
more
affordable
than
ever
to
take
a

of
your
travels

There
are
however
still
concerns

Overall
if
you

to
<hi rend="bold">

the

of
a
place
you
are

a

is

it

Half
a
century
ago
,
it
was
possible
to
make
amateur
films
on
Super
8
reels
which
lasted
a
couple
of
minutes
.
The
cost
per
minute
was
high
,
the
film
had
to
be
developed
before
it
could
be
shown
on
a
projector
and
there
was
often
no
sound
at
all
.
By
the
1980s
,
camcorders
emerged
on
the
market
and
video
recording
became
more
convenient
.
Video
and
sound
was
recorded
on
a
tape
;
just
connect
the
camera
to
a
TV
and
push
play
to
enjoy
your
recordings
.
</p>
<p>
In
the
21st
century
digital
video
became
the
norm
and
prices
for
the
devices
dropped
quickly
,
and
phones
,
tablets
and
other
devices
also
got
video
recording
capability
.
Digital
video
clips
can
easily
be
moved
to
other
devices
,
freeing
space
on
memory
cards
for
new
recordings
,
so
the
battery
level
is
pretty
much
the
only
thing
present
day
video
enthusiasts
have
to
keep
an
eye
on
.
In
addition
,
compared
to
analog
recordings
,
it
's
much
easier
and
affordable
to
edit
digital
videos
.
Even
an
amateur
traveller
can
now
make
a
professional-looking
travel
documentary
.

Also

as

These
cameras
capture
all
angles

This

However
this
type
of
camera
is
inferior
for

as
it

actually

as

they

When
recording
video
,
keep
the
camera
steady
and
move
the
camera
slowly
,
otherwise
it
may
be
impossible
to
watch
what
you
've
recorded
afterwards
.
</p>
<p>
Remember
that
a
minute
is
a
very
long
time
when
watching
video
.
Plan
well
before
shooting
unless
you
are
going
to
do
extensive
editing
–
which
is
quite
arduous
.
Also
,
if
you
will
not
be
able
to
<hi rend="bold">
recharge
your
battery
</hi>
before
leaving
the
area
(
say
,
you
're
on
a
day
trip
to
a
national
park
)
you
should
be
careful
with
how
much
you
use
your
camera
.
It
's
extremely
frustrating
if
you
ca
n't
record
that
stunning
sunset
over
a
canyon
that
you
may
not
return
to
anytime
soon
just
because
of
an
empty
battery
.
Bring
a
(
charged
)
spare
if
you
have
one
;
best
to
recharge
all
batteries
immediately
before
use
,
as
some
hold
their
charge
poorly
if
left
on
the
shelf
for
months
.

<p>
If
you
are
away
from
a
steady
source
of
electricity
for
a
longer
time
,
solar
chargers
and
&quot;
power
packs
&quot;
with
a
lot
of
pre-charged
ampere-hours
<hi rend="italic">
might
</hi>
be
an
option
but
<hi rend="italic">
will
</hi>
weigh
you
down
.
If
you
know
you
will
be
filming
for
extended
periods
without
being
able
to
recharge
,
you
should
buy
a
camera
operating
on
AA
batteries
,
as
opposed
to
cameras
with
a
battery
for
that
camera
type
only
.
Single-use
versions
of
such
batteries
are
available
all
over
the
world
,
and
rechargeable
AA
batteries
are
also
widely
available
and
comparatively
cheap
.
Also
,
keep
in
mind
that
if
a
custom-made/integrated
battery
breaks
,
it
may
mean
a
major
hassle
finding
a
new
one
(
in
particular
if
the
camera
is
of
an
old/obscure
type
)
and
unless
you
find
one
,
your
camera
will
be
useless
.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Storage
media
</hi>
is
n't
such
a
problem
as
it
used
to
be
when
video
cameras
were
analog
;
for
instance
a
small
16
GB
SD-memory
card
can
usually
hold
one
or
two
hours
of
high
quality
video
(
naturally
,
this
varies
a
lot
from
camera
to
camera
)
and
much
more
if
you
're
recording
in
inferior
quality
.
It
's
also
easy
to
remove
videos
you
do
n't
need
to
free
up
space
.
However
,
the
fact
that
memory
cards
are
so
small
also
means
they
are
easy
to
lose
if
you
're
careless
.
If
you
've
filled
a
memory
card
and
need
to
replace
it
to
continue
recording
,
pack
it
away
at
some
secure
place
and/or
make
a
backup
copy
of
the
video
files
if
you
can
.
