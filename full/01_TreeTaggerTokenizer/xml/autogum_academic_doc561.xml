<p>
Water
source
conservation
is
one
of
the
most
important
vegetation
functions
in
the
terrestrial
ecosystem
.
As
an
interface
for
atmospheric
rainfall
in
the
vegetation
ecosystem
,
vegetation
canopy
influences
the
redistribution
of
rainwater
as
well
as
the
damping
and
retention
of
the
water
that
reaches
the
soil
,
affecting
runoff
dynamics
through
interception
.
However
,
previous
studies
on
canopy
rainfall
interception
have
mainly
focused
on
individual
plants
or
groups
of
plants
through
in
situ
observation
and
are
limited
by
spatiotemporal
estimation
in
larger
areas
.
In
this
study
,
we
applied
a
canopy
rainfall
interception
model
coupled
with
MODIS_LAI
remote
sensing
data
to
understand
the
spatial
and
temporal
variation
patterns
of
canopy
rainfall
interception
at
the
basin
scale
in
Guangdong
Province
,
China
.
</p>
<p>
From
this
study
,
we
found
that
the
CRIR
at
the
basin
scale
in
Guangdong
ranged
from
0.33
%
and
11.67
%
,
which
is
similar
to
results
in
other
studies
in
China
that
ranged
from
0
%
and
12
%
.
However
,
this
range
is
lower
than
that
in
forest
ecosystems
.
This
is
mainly
because
our
study
estimated
the
mean
value
of
the
CRIR
for
all
vegetation
ecosystems
in
the
basin
,
which
resulted
in
a
lower
estimated
value
when
compared
with
that
of
a
forest
ecosystem
.
It
is
worth
noting
that
the
rainfall
interception
model
applied
in
our
study
only
considered
the
parameters
of
the
LAI
and
rainfall
,
while
rainfall
interception
was
also
closely
related
to
many
other
factors
such
as
atmospheric
drivers
of
evaporation
(
e.
g.
,
wind
speed
,
vapor
pressure
deficit
,
etc.
)
,
canopy
characteristics
,
rainfall
intensity
,
and
rainfall
duration
.
In
future
research
,
introducing
more
meteorological
factors
into
the
interception
model
is
necessary
to
estimate
canopy
rainfall
interception
more
accurately
.
</p>
<p>
It
is
important
to
note
that
,
according
to
the
analysis
using
the
equations
of
cumulative
interception
(
Equations
(
1
)
and
(
2
)
)
and
CRIR
(
Equation
(
3
)
)
,
the
spatiotemporal
variation
of
the
LAI
and
rainfall
will
have
a
similar
influence
on
the
annual
and
regional
variation
of
vegetation
canopy
rainfall
interception
at
the
basin
scale
of
Guangdong
.
We
also
found
that
the
CRIR
showed
a
significant
spatial
difference
pattern
that
was
high
in
the
mountain
areas
of
the
eastern
and
western
flanks
,
but
low
in
the
central
mountainous
region
and
coastal
areas
.
This
spatial
pattern
was
closely
related
to
the
LAI
of
vegetation
,
which
mainly
presents
a
spatial
pattern
extending
from
the
Pearl
River
Delta
to
the
periphery
,
and
has
little
correlation
with
the
spatial
pattern
characteristics
of
rainfall
that
gradually
decrease
from
south
to
north
.
Guangdong
has
many
heavy
rainfall
events
,
and
the
leaves
tend
to
reach
their
maximum
saturation
of
rainfall
interception
,
resulting
in
vegetation
canopy
rainfall
interception
depending
mainly
on
the
LAI
,
but
not
being
restricted
by
the
amount
of
rainfall
.
In
addition
,
atmospheric
rainfall
is
the
main
factor
influencing
the
temporal
variation
of
rainfall
interception
in
the
study
area
.
Results
showed
that
the
annual
mean
CRIR
in
Guangdong
continued
to
decrease
from
2004
to
2012
,
but
increased
slightly
in
2016
.
However
,
as
time
progressed
,
the
difference
in
CRIRs
between
the
basins
decreased
.
This
is
because
,
as
the
annual
mean
LAI
and
annual
rainfall
increase
,
the
spatial
heterogeneity
of
LAI
also
increases
(
<figure>
Figure
4
</figure>
)
,
while
the
spatial
heterogeneity
of
rainfall
decreases
(
<figure>
Figure
2
</figure>
)
.
Combining
the
effects
of
the
saturation
of
canopy
rainfall
interception
and
rainfall
,
the
spatial
homogeneity
of
annual
rainfall
magnifies
the
effects
on
the
spatial
pattern
of
CRIRs
,
while
the
spatial
heterogeneity
of
annual
mean
LAI
further
diminishes
the
effects
on
spatial
patterns
of
CRIR
.
This
has
led
to
decreases
in
both
the
CRIR
and
its
spatial
variability
over
time
.

<p>
Importantly
,
broad-leaved
forests
are
the
main
contributor
to
canopy
rainfall
interception
in
Guangdong
.
By
analyzing
the
CRIRs
of
the
basin-pairs
in
the
four
climatic
zones
with
a
similar
forest
coverage
,
we
found
that
there
was
no
significant
difference
in
the
canopy
rainfall
interception
among
the
four
climatic
zones
,
while
there
was
a
significant
correlation
between
forest
coverage
and
the
canopy
rainfall
interception
within
the
basin
.
This
means
that
canopy
rainfall
interception
is
far
more
affected
by
vegetation
coverage
than
the
background
climate
.
In
addition
,
the
proportion
of
broad-leaved
forest
to
the
whole
area
of
forest
in
the
basin
plays
a
critical
role
in
the
CRIR
in
Guangdong
,
which
is
similar
to
other
results
from
previous
research
.
However
,
many
studies
conducted
in
various
forests
have
reached
the
opposite
conclusion
,
demonstrating
that
the
canopy
interception
capacity
in
coniferous
forests
was
higher
than
that
in
broad-leaved
forests
.
Researchers
have
found
that
the
leaf
surface
area
contributes
to
differences
in
the
interception
capacities
between
broad-leaved
forests
,
coniferous
forests
,
and
coniferous
and
broad-leaved
mixed
forests
,
and
the
total
annual
interception
was
greater
for
the
species
with
a
denser
canopy
(
e.
g.
,
broad-leaved
forest
)
.
However
,
since
the
canopy
interception
capacity
is
also
determined
by
other
meteorological
and
canopy
parameters
,
further
research
is
needed
on
these
other
factors
.
