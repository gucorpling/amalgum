&quot;
You
are
coming
now
,
Miss
Morris
,
&quot;
exclaimed
Carlton
from
the
front
of
the
carriage
in
which
they
were
moving
along
the
sunny
road
to
Athens
,
&quot;
into
a
land
where
one
restores
his
lost
illusions
.
Anybody
who
wishes
to
get
back
his
belief
in
beautiful
things
should
come
here
to
do
it
,
just
as
he
would
go
to
a
German
sanitarium
to
build
up
his
nerves
or
his
appetite
.
You
have
only
to
drink
in
the
atmosphere
and
you
are
cured
.
I
know
no
better
antidote
than
Athens
for
a
siege
of
cable-cars
and
muddy
asphalt
pavements
and
a
course
of
Robert
Elsmeres
and
the
Heavenly
Twins
.
Wait
until
you
see
the
statues
of
the
young
athletes
in
the
Museum
,
&quot;
he
cried
,
enthusiastically
,
&quot;
and
get
a
glimpse
of
the
blue
sky
back
of
Mount
Hymettus
,
and
the
moonlight
some
evening
on
the
Acropolis
,
and
you
'll
be
convinced
that
nothing
counts
for
much
in
this
world
but
health
and
straight
limbs
,
and
tall
marble
pillars
,
and
eyes
trained
to
see
only
what
is
beautiful
.
Give
people
a
love
for
beauty
and
a
respect
for
health
,
Miss
Morris
,
and
the
result
is
going
to
be
,
what
they
once
had
here
,
the
best
art
and
the
greatest
writers
and
satirists
and
poets
.
The
same
audience
that
applauded
Euripides
and
Sophocles
in
the
open
theatre
used
to
cross
the
road
the
same
day
to
applaud
the
athletes
who
ran
naked
in
the
Olympian
games
,
and
gave
them
as
great
honor
.
I
came
here
once
on
a
walking
tour
with
a
chap
who
was
n't
making
as
much
of
himself
as
he
should
have
done
,
and
he
went
away
a
changed
man
,
and
became
a
personage
in
the
world
,
and
you
would
never
guess
what
it
was
that
did
it
.
He
saw
a
statue
of
one
of
the
Greek
gods
in
the
Museum
which
showed
certain
muscles
that
he
could
n't
find
in
his
own
body
,
and
he
told
me
he
was
going
to
train
down
until
they
did
show
;
and
he
stopped
drinking
and
loafing
to
do
it
,
and
took
to
exercising
and
working
;
and
by
the
time
the
muscles
showed
out
clear
and
strong
he
was
so
keen
over
life
that
he
wanted
to
make
the
most
of
it
,
and
,
as
I
said
,
he
has
done
it
.
That
's
what
a
respect
for
his
own
body
did
for
him
.
&quot;

<p>
The
carriage
stopped
at
the
hotel
on
one
side
of
the
public
square
of
Athens
,
with
the
palace
and
its
gardens
blocking
one
end
,
and
yellow
houses
with
red
roofs
,
and
gay
awnings
over
the
cafes
,
surrounding
it
.
It
was
a
bright
sunny
day
,
and
the
city
was
clean
and
cool
and
pretty
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Breakfast
?
&quot;
exclaimed
Miss
Morris
,
in
answer
to
Carlton
's
inquiry
;
&quot;
yes
,
I
suppose
so
,
but
I
wo
n't
feel
safe
until
I
have
my
feet
on
that
rock
.
&quot;
She
was
standing
on
the
steps
of
the
hotel
,
looking
up
with
expectant
,
eager
eyes
at
the
great
Acropolis
above
the
city
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
It
has
been
there
for
a
long
time
now
,
&quot;
suggested
Carlton
,
&quot;
and
I
think
you
can
risk
its
being
there
for
a
half-hour
longer
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Well
,
&quot;
she
said
,
reluctantly
,
&quot;
but
I
do
n't
wish
to
lose
this
chance
.
There
might
be
an
earthquake
,
for
instance
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
We
are
likely
to
see
THEM
this
morning
,
&quot;
said
Carlton
,
as
he
left
the
hotel
with
the
ladies
and
drove
towards
the
Acropolis
.
&quot;
Nolan
has
been
interviewing
the
English
maid
,
and
she
tells
him
they
spend
the
greater
part
of
their
time
up
there
on
the
rock
.
They
are
living
very
simply
here
,
as
they
did
in
Paris
;
that
is
,
for
the
present
.
On
Wednesday
the
King
gives
a
dinner
and
a
reception
in
their
honor
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
When
does
your
dinner
come
off
?
&quot;
asked
Miss
Morris
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Never
,
&quot;
said
Carlton
,
grimly
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
One
of
the
reasons
why
I
like
to
come
back
to
Athens
so
much
,
&quot;
said
Mrs.
Downs
,
&quot;
is
because
there
are
so
few
other
tourists
here
to
spoil
the
local
color
for
you
,
and
there
are
almost
as
few
guides
as
tourists
,
so
that
you
can
wander
around
undisturbed
and
discover
things
for
yourself
.
They
do
n't
label
every
fallen
column
,
and
place
fences
around
the
temples
.
They
seem
to
put
you
on
your
good
behavior
.
Then
I
always
like
to
go
to
a
place
where
you
are
as
much
of
a
curiosity
to
the
people
as
they
are
to
you
.
It
seems
to
excuse
your
staring
about
you
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
A
curiosity
!
&quot;
exclaimed
Carlton
;
&quot;
I
should
say
so
!
The
last
time
I
was
here
I
tried
to
wear
a
pair
of
knickerbockers
around
the
city
,
and
the
people
stared
so
that
I
had
to
go
back
to
the
hotel
and
change
them
.
I
should
n't
have
minded
it
so
much
in
any
other
country
,
but
I
thought
men
who
wore
Jaeger
underclothing
and
women
's
petticoats
for
a
national
costume
might
have
excused
so
slight
an
eccentricity
as
knickerbockers
.
THEY
had
no
right
to
throw
the
first
stone
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
rock
upon
which
the
temples
of
the
Acropolis
are
built
is
more
of
a
hill
than
a
rock
.
It
is
much
steeper
upon
one
side
than
the
other
,
with
a
sheer
fall
a
hundred
yards
broad
;
on
the
opposite
side
there
are
the
rooms
of
the
Hospital
of
Aesculapius
and
the
theatres
of
Dionysus
and
Herodes
Atticus
.
The
top
of
the
rock
holds
the
Parthenon
and
the
other
smaller
temples
,
or
what
yet
remains
of
them
,
and
its
surface
is
littered
with
broken
marble
and
stones
and
pieces
of
rock
.
The
top
is
so
closely
built
over
that
the
few
tourists
who
visit
it
can
imagine
themselves
its
sole
occupants
for
a
half-hour
at
a
time
.
When
Carlton
and
his
friends
arrived
,
the
place
appeared
quite
deserted
.
They
left
the
carriage
at
the
base
of
the
rock
,
and
climbed
up
to
the
entrance
on
foot
.
