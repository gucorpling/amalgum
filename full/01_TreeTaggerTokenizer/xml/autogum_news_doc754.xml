The
remains
of
the
plane
,
which
were
concentrated
in
a
600
metres
by
200
metres
(
1,968
feet
by
656
feet
)
area
,
appear
to
be
relatively
intact
which
leads
investigators
to
believe
that
the
plane
hit
the
water
intact
and
did
not
explode
mid-air
.
Around
50
bodies
of
the
228
passengers
and
crew
on
board
and
parts
of
the
plane
were
found
shortly
after
the
crash
in
2009
.
</p>
<p>
According
to
Jean-Paul
Troadec
,
the
head
of
France
's
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Enquiry_and_Analysis_for_Civil_Aviation_Safety">
Bureau
of
Enquiry
and
Analysis
for
Civil
Aviation
Safety
</ref>
(
BEA
)
,
the
accident
investigation
body
for
aircraft
overseeing
the
operation
and
investigation
,
the
wreckage
and
bodies
will
be
bought
to
surface
and
then
sent
to
France
for
investigation
.
The
salvage
operation
,
which
will
cost
around
5
million
euros
(
$
7.1
million
)
according
to
estimates
,
will
be
financed
by
the
French
government
.
Three
salvage
companies
who
are
bidding
to
recover
the
wreck
have
until
afternoon
on
Thursday
to
submit
proposals
.
The
operation
should
take
between
three
weeks
to
a
month
.
</p>
<p>
On
raising
the
remains
of
the
plane
Troadec
said
:
&quot;
We
want
to
know
what
happened
in
this
accident
,
most
particularly
so
it
never
happens
again
.
&quot;
Some
family
members
agreed
saying
such
as
Michael
Gaignard
,
whose
sister
was
on
board
the
plane
said
,
&quot;
We
want
to
know
what
happened
in
that
plane
.
&quot;
An
attorney
for
several
families
said
some
had
yet
to
come
to
terms
with
loss
of
loved
ones
,
saying
&quot;
There
's
been
no
burial
,
no
goodbye
...
just
lots
and
lots
of
suffering
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Soulas
of
Entraide
et
Solidarité
AF447
disagreed
.
&quot;
There
's
a
very
traumatic
side
to
this
and
it
causes
problems
of
identification
.
We
do
n't
know
what
state
they
are
in
.
&quot;
He
added
,
&quot;
And
it
risks
causing
a
dispute
between
families
who
want
to
leave
the
bodies
at
the
bottom
of
the
Atlantic
and
those
who
want
them
brought
to
the
surface
.

However
,
despite
the
discovery
of

wreckage
,
the
plane
's
two
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flight%20recorders">

,
the

and
the

(

have
yet
to
be
found
at
the
crash
site
.
</p>
<p>
Alain
Bouillard
,
who
is
in
charge
of
BEA
's
recovery
effort
said
,
&quot;
It
's
still
a
jigsaw
puzzle
.
We
do
not
know
where
the
recorders
might
be
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
There
are
concerns
that
the
two-year
length
the
recorders
have
been
submerged
in
seawater
along
with
enormous
pressure
located
at
the
depth
of
the
wreck
,
that
the
data
on
the
recorders
might
be
unreadable
.
Bouillard
said
it
is
possible
the
recorders
were
damaged
,
but
had
&quot;
great
confidence
&quot;
in
their
robustness
.
</p>
<p>
Without
the
recovery
of
the
recorders
,
investigators
may
be
unable
to
determine
the
cause
of
the
crash
.
The
leading
theory
at
the
moment
is
that
the
crew
received
incorrect
air
speed
readings
from
the
aircraft
's
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pitot%20tubes">
pitot
tubes
</ref>
,
devices
which
measure
how
fast
the
aircraft
is
travelling
.
Experts
say
the
tubes
may
have
become
iced
over
,
causing
the
crash
.
