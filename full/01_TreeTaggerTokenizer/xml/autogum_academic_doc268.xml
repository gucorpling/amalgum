Bloom
’s
Taxonomy
for
Construction
Hazard
Education
</head>
<p>
Bloom
’s
cognitive
taxonomy
was
an
attempt
to
improve
educational
objectives
regarding
assessment
and
testing
of
teaching
materials
.
It
provided
an
organizational
structure
including
six
categories
,
namely
knowledge
,
comprehension
,
application
,
analysis
,
synthesis
and
evaluation
,
which
are
arranged
from
the
simplest
to
the
most
complex
.
Subsequently
,
many
theorists
have
developed
improvements
in
the
domains
of
human
learning
such
as
effective
domain
and
psychomotor
domain
.
In
2001
,
Anderson
and
Krathwohl
proposed
a
revised
Bloom
’s
taxonomy
which
improved
from
uni-dimension
to
two-dimension
.
In
the
knowledge
dimension
,
the
authors
classified
four
types
:
factual
,
conceptual
,
procedural
,
and
metacognitive
knowledge
.
In
the
cognitive
process
dimension
,
six
levels
were
changed
into
verb
format
:
1-remembering
,
2-understanding
,
3-applying
,
4-analyzing
,
5-evaluating
,
and
6-creating
.
With
the
combination
of
two
dimensions
,
educators
could
change
from
passive
views
of
learning
towards
active
engagement
in
meaningful
learning
.
Bloom
’s
taxonomy
and
its
revised
version
became
the
standard
for
designing
educational
curricula
.
For
example
,
Thambyah
et
al.
recommended
twenty
four
learning
outcomes
based
on
the
revised
Bloom
’s
taxonomy
for
the
final
year
project
of
undergraduate
engineering
.
In
addition
,
it
provided
for
teachers
a
common
language
to
compare
and
discuss
between
two
different
subject
areas
,
understand
how
these
subjects
overlap
,
and
deliver
the
conceptual
and
practical
knowledge
concurrently
.
Thus
,
Bloom
’s
taxonomy
could
widely
influence
the
educational
systems
as
a
whole
,
through
teacher
preparing
programs
,
assessment
programs
,
and
educational
research
.
A
survey
of
the
education
literature
also
revealed
that
several
studies
attempted
to
apply
and
implement
the
taxonomy
in
many
domains
of
education
including
computing
,
medical
and
nursing
,
music
,
and
engineering
.
</p>
<p>
In
the
construction
hazard
domain
,
there
is
a
potential
to
apply
Bloom
’s
taxonomy
for
educational
enhancement
.
The
recent
assessment
methods
reveal
a
gap
in
evaluating
the
implementation
level
of
safety
knowledge
and
skills
in
practice
.
To
overcome
these
gaps
,
appropriate
approaches
and
solutions
based
on
cognitive
and
awareness
processes
should
be
proposed
to
achieve
the
learning
outcomes
and
maximize
the
collective
amount
of
knowledge
for
each
objective
.
Using
Bloom
’s
taxonomy
,
Kaskutas
et
al.
identified
the
gap
between
fall
prevention
training
and
the
favorite
learning
methods
of
apprentices
,
and
then
designed
new
curricula
.
Endroyoa
et
al.
built
an
occupational
safety
and
health
model
to
achieve
learning
outcomes
according
to
Bloom
’s
taxonomy
.
Pedro
et
al.
proposed
a
context-based
assessment
system
to
improve
visualization
in
teaching
safety
knowledge
.
Moreover
,
there
is
a
growing
tendency
to
apply
modern
technologies
to
construction
hazard
education
.
Building
anatomy
modelling
and
social
virtual
reality
integrated
into
construction
safety
system
are
some
examples
.
Although
most
studies
have
their
own
evaluation
system
,
the
application
of
Bloom
’s
taxonomy
could
be
beneficial
in
helping
educational
programs
better
meet
their
learning
objectives
.

Virtual
Reality
in
Construction
Hazard
Investigation
</head>
<p>
Virtual
Reality
(
VR
)
has
been
applied
widely
in
the
context
of
hazard
education
and
training
in
recent
years
.
Several
VR
applications
have
been
developed
for
hazard
identification
for
targeted
users
such
as
designers
,
site
workers
,
construction
students
,
safety
managers
,
among
others
.
For
example
,
these
research
efforts
include
Design-for-Safety-Process
(
DFSP
)
systems
,
Cave
Automatic
Virtual
Environments
(
CAVEs
)
,
System
for
Augmented
Virtuality
Environments
(
SAVEs
)
,
Visualized
Safety
Management
System
(
VSMS
)
,
Multiuser
Virtual
Safety
Training
System
(
MVSTS
)
,
among
others
.
Le
et
al.
developed
a
learning
framework
based
on
an
online
social
VR
system
,
which
includes
role-playing
,
dialogic
learning
,
and
social
interaction
for
construction
safety
and
health
education
.
Following
this
,
researches
have
proved
the
advantages
of
VR
in
providing
interactive
and
experiential
learning
environments
,
which
are
very
important
to
motivate
and
engage
learners
in
obtaining
hazard
knowledge
and
skills
.
In
an
effort
to
develop
VR
systems
that
can
provide
close-to-reality
visibility
,
recent
studies
have
adopted
the
360VP
technology
,
which
captures
360
panorama
images
of
real
construction
sites
.
The
360VP
enhances
the
real-world
learning
environment
by
presenting
the
dynamic
nature
of
construction
sites
in
reality
to
improve
the
hazard
investigation
knowledge
skills
of
construction
students
and
professionals
.
Furthermore
,
360VP
has
demonstrated
improvements
in
not
only
hazard
education
and
training
,
but
also
energy-efficiency
.
Since
VR
or
360VP
have
their
own
limitations
,
researches
have
tried
to
integrate
some
VR
technologies
in
order
to
enhance
the
advantages
of
these
VR
technologies
so
that
hazard
education
and
training
can
be
improved
.
