â€”
U.S.
Vice
President
Dick
Cheney
</p>
<p>
Abbas
condemned
rocket
attacks
against
Israel
from
the
Hamas-controlled
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza%20Strip">
Gaza
Strip
</ref>
,
but
also
told
Israel
to
ease
their
restrictions
on
Palestinians
.
He
also
noted
that
Israel
needs
to
stop
building
settlements
within
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West%20Bank">
West
Bank
</ref>
.
Abbas
noted
that
,
&quot;
Peace
and
stability
will
not
be
achieved
through
a
settlement
expansion
,
or
the
setting
up
of
checkpoints
around
towns
and
villages
,
and
the
military
escalation
against
Gaza
,
nor
the
incursions
,
continuous
incursions
into
West
Bank
villages
and
towns
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Cheney
met
earlier
in
the
day
with
Shimon
Peres
,
the
Israeli
president
.
Both
men
spoke
of
Iran
,
with
Peres
noting
upfront
that
Iran
and
their
leader
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad">
Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad
</ref>
wants
to
&quot;
build
their
two
satellites
--
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah">
Hezbollah
</ref>
in
Lebanon
,
and
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas">
Hamas
</ref>
in
Gaza
...
Nobody
can
console
us
and
say
that
the
declarations
of
Ahmadinejad
are
less
serious
than
they
are
;
we
have
to
take
it
seriously
,
out
of
experience
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Cheney
noted
that
the
Bush
administration
is
pledged
to
the
peace
process
and
also
referenced
Iran
but
not
directly
,
&quot;
We
're
obviously
dedicated
to
doing
all
we
can
as
an
administration
to
try
to
move
the
peace
process
forward
,
and
also
obviously
actively
involved
in
dealing
with
the
threats
that
we
see
emerging
in
the
region
--
not
only
threats
to
Israel
,
but
threats
to
the
United
States
,
as
well
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Cheney
met
with
Prime
Minister
Olmert
on
Saturday
and
told
Olmert
that
,
&quot;
The
United
States
will
never
pressure
Israel
to
take
steps
that
threaten
its
security
.
&quot;
He
also
told
Olmert
that
the
United
States
backs
Israel
's
right
to
defend
itself
from
Hamas
rocket
attacks
but
that
America
was
also
working
for
a
peace
deal
between
Israel
and
the
moderate
Fatah-controlled
Palestinian
government
in
the
West
Bank
.
</p>
<p>
Abbas
lost
control
of
the
Gaza
Strip
to
the
rival
Hamas
party
last
year
.
Abbas
,
who
is
the
leader
of
the
more
moderate
Fatah
party
currently
runs
the
Palestinian
government
located
in
the
West
Bank
,
the
other
Palestinian
territory
.
