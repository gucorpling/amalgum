The
Cavite
Conspiracy
</head>
<p>
Shortly
before
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katipunan">
Katipunan
</ref>
was
uncovered
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilio_Aguinaldo">
Emilio
Aguinaldo
</ref>
was
planning
to
attack
the
Spanish
arsenal
at
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_San_Felipe_(Cavite)">
Fort
San
Felipe
</ref>
and
he
enlisted
other
Katipuneros
to
recruit
enough
men
so
they
could
overrun
the
Spanish
garrison
.
Their
meetings
were
held
at
the
house
of
Cabuco
.
</p>
<p>
Aguinaldo
and
the
other
Katipuneros
agreed
that
they
would
arm
the
inmates
of
the
provincial
jail
who
were
made
to
work
at
the
garrison
.
The
task
of
recruiting
the
inmates
was
given
to
Lapidario
,
who
was
also
the
warden
of
the
provincial
jail
.
Aguado
was
to
supply
Lapidario
with
money
to
buy
arms
.
</p>
<p>
According
to
their
plan
,
the
uprising
would
be
signalled
by
fireworks
from
the
warehouse
of
Inocencio
.
Other
leaders
of
the
uprising
were
Luciano
,
Conchu
,
Pérez
,
Pablo
José
,
Marcos
José
,
and
Juan
Castañeda
.
The
revolt
was
to
start
on
September
1
.
</p>
<p>
On
August
26
,
Aguinaldo
received
a
letter
from
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrés_Bonifacio">
Andrés
Bonifacio
</ref>
who
reported
that
a
Katipunan
assembly
in
Balintawak
on
August
24
decided
to
start
the
revolution
on
August
30
,
to
be
signalled
by
a
blackout
at
the
Luneta
,
then
known
as
Bagumbayan
.
On
the
appointed
day
,
Bonifacio
and
his
men
attacked
the
Spanish
powder
magazine
in
San
Juan
.
Later
that
same
day
,
the
Spanish
authorities
declared
martial
law
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila">

and

</p>
<p>
Aguinaldo
learned
of
the
declaration
of
martial
law
in
a
meeting
with
Spanish
Governor
Fernando
Pargas
on
the
morning
of
August
31
,
1896
.
He
then
went
to
Cabezas
'
haberdashery
and
ask
him
to
inform
to
Lapidario
that
they
had
alternative
but
to
rise
in
arms
.
Cabezas
was
the
one
who
enlisted
Lapidario
for
the
planned
uprising
.
</p>
<p>
But
Cabezas
was
not
in
favor
of
starting
the
revolt
on
August
31
,
1896
so
they
discussed
the
uprising
further
.
They
decided
to
postpone
the
attack
to
September
3
.
However
,
the
Spanish
learned
of
the
plan
from
a
dressmaker
named
Victoriana
Sayat
and
they
immediately
arrested
Lapidario
,
de
Ocampo
and
Aguado
.
The
three
were
held
incommunicado
in
the
boat
<hi rend="italic">
Ulloa
</hi>
and
interrogated
.
They
are
presumed
to
have
been
tortured
.

revealed
the

of

and
the
thirteen
suspects
were
rounded
up
on
September

along
with
dozens
of
other
Cavite
leaders
,
including
the
musician
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julián_Felipe">
Julián
Felipe
</ref>
,
who
would
compose
the
Philippine
national
anthem
the
following
year
.
Felipe
was
incarcerated
for
nine
months
at
Fort
San
Felipe
.
Also
subsequently
released
were
Pablo
and
Marcos
José
,
and
Juan
Castañeda
of
Imus
,
who
are
also
believed
to
have
been
involved
in
the
uprising
.
</p>
<p>
While
awaiting
trial
,
guilt-stricken
de
Ocampo
tried
to
commit
suicide
by
slashing
his
stomach
with
a
piece
of
broken
glass
.
However
,
he
was
included
in
the
indictment
for
treason
before
a
military
court
which
found
them
guilty
on
September
11
after
a
four-hour
trial
.
</p>
<p>
At
12:45p
.
m.
the
following
day
,
the
thirteen
patriots
were
brought
out
of
their
cells
and
taken
to
the
Plaza
de
Armas
,
outside
Fort
San
Felipe
,
and
executed
by
musketry
.
Their
bodies
were
later
buried
in
a
common
grave
at
the
Catholic
cemetery
at
the
village
of
Caridad
.
</p>
<p>
Later
,
the

Victorino
Luciano
,
Francisco
Osorio
,
Luis
Aguado
,
Hugo
Pérez
,
José
Lallana

Conchu
,
Máximo
Gregorio
,
Alfonso
de
Ocampo
,
Eugenio
Cabezas
,
Feliciano
Cabuco
,

.
</p>
<p>
In
1906
,
a
monument
to
the
Thirteen
Martyrs
was
erected
at
the
San
Roque
district
of
Cavite
City
,
at
the
head
of
then
San
Roque
causeway
.
Their
families
reinterred
the
remains
of
their
loved
ones
at
the
foot
of
the
monument
.
The
monument
is
located
at
the
intersection
of

the
capital
of
Cavite
was
transferred
to
a
newly
created
city
situated
near
the
center
of
the
province
,
and
it
was
named
<hi rend="italic">
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trece_Mártires">
