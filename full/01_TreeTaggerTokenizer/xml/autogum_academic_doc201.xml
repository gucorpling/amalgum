Introduction
</head>
<p>
The
world
energy
demand
increased
in
the
two
past
decades
and
even
predictions
implying
the
growing
trends
for
the
next
decades
.
Still
,
fossil
fuels
play
a
critical
role
in
the
energy
supply
chain
due
to
economic
feasibility
.
Refer
to
International
Energy
Agency
’s
(
IEA
)
2016
report
,
fossil
fuels
in
the
form
of
liquid
fuels
,
natural
gas
,
and
coal
contain
more
than
80
%
of
the
world
energy
consumption
.
Easiness
of
utilization
,
higher
performance
,
compared
to
traditional
energy
sources
,
ease
of
mobility
via
land
or
sea
,
and
affordable
extraction
cost
introduced
oil
and
natural
gas
(
NG
)
as
strategic
commodities
.
However
,
emergent
ecological
concerns
and
rethinking
of
a
more
peaceful
future
(
sustainable
development
goals
)
attracted
attention
toward
climate
change
challenges
(
such
as
greenhouse
gases
emissions
and
global
warming
)
.
The
two
non-aligned
objectives
,
on
one
hand
,
development
and
increasing
needs
for
energy
supply
and
on
the
other
hand
global
environmental
concerns
,
attracted
researchers
to
study
energy
systems
and
develop
different
plausible
future
perspectives
.
</p>
<p>
World
’s
economic
growth
still
strongly
correlated
with
the
energy
and
,
as
a
result
,
the
energy
price
influence
potential
future
trends
.
The
1970
’s
energy
crisis
represented
how
energy
shocks
can
cause
chaotic
behavior
of
economic
systems
especially
in
the
case
of
developed
countries
which
mostly
play
in
energy
markets
as
importers
.
Although
new
paradigms
emerged
to
address
the
modern
world
energy
challenges
,
such
as
evaluating
and
improving
the
energy
security
level
,
but
policymakers
are
facing
deep
uncertainties
in
this
area
.
Energy
markets
are
known
as
complex
systems
,
which
consist
of
numerous
players
with
conflict
of
interests
and
changing
rules
.
</p>
<p>
Despite
successful
efforts
,
the
main
problem
is
still
existing
,
which
is
defined
as
“
discovering
reliable
future
trends
and
probable
alternative
futures
in
the
field
of
energy
systems
and
uncover
the
most
influencing
driving
forces
to
aid
energy
management
process
”
.
To
project
a
reliable
future
,
it
is
crucial
to
investigating
almost
all
informative
input
features
which
represent
historical
behavior
of
the
targeted
complex
system
and
extrapolate
future
trends
.
Studying
different
input
features
means
to
peruse
different
aspects
,
while
on
the
other
hand
,
it
means
more
efforts
in
term
of
cost
,
time
,
and
complicated
estimator
.
A
traditional
approach
to
address
a
complex
problem
is
to
simplify
and
decompose
it
to
its
main
constituent
elements
.
Feature
selection
methods
are
aimed
to
adjust
the
unnecessary
complexity
revealed
to
refer
to
the
existence
of
multiple
input
features
.
A
feature
selection
method
determines
the
best
subset
of
the
initial
features
set
as
a
representative
of
the
solution
space
(
for
more
information
about
feature
selection
approaches
and
methods
see
:
)
.
Selected
features
interpreted
as
key
driving
forces
which
will
help
to
extrapolate
future
trends
.
Moreover
,
pre-processing
might
also
be
performed
in
order
to
speed
up
computation
.
Finally
,
an
estimator
is
needed
to
predict
future
behaviors
of
the
targeted
variable
.
Despite
there
are
many
classical
methods
but
artificial
intelligence-based
methods
are
extensively
used
during
the
last
couple
of
decades
that
attempt
to
uncover
weak
signals
and
pattern
more
reliable
and
accurate
.
As
Kourou
et
al.
noted
these
methods
can
discover
and
identify
patterns
and
relationships
between
them
,
from
complex
datasets
,
while
they
are
able
to
effectively
predict
future
outcomes
.
Technologies
as
Data
Mining
,
Natural
Language
Processing
,
and
Machine
Learning
can
provide
novel
alternatives
to
explore
and
exploit
potential
retrieved
knowledge
from
historical
records
,
and
help
to
decrease
prediction
errors
effectively
.
</p>
<p>
This
paper
is
aimed
to
develop
an
intelligent
learning-based
prediction
model
which
is
equipped
with
data
mining
(
DM
)
techniques
to
purify
and
the
setup
input
vector
.
The
DM
step
is
used
to
select
and
organize
the
best
input
features
that
represent
patterns
of
future
global
NG
demand
trends
.
Although
many
previous
studies
successfully
addressed
NG
global
demand
prediction
problem
,
we
attempt
to
uncover
the
most
effective
driving
forces
as
input
features
and
analyzing
how
they
will
affect
the
objective
function
(
NG
global
demand
prediction
)
.
For
example
,
the
proposed
model
studies
time
relation
between
input
variables
and
the
target
variable
.
So
a
less-dimension
input
set
is
available
to
policymakers
to
simplify
and
experience
reliable
decision-making
process
.
</p>
<p>
As
it
is
impressed
by
a
series
of
variables
and
oscillating
time
series
,
the
NG
forecasting
problem
is
a
very
challenging
.
These
days
,
massive
efforts
have
been
investigated
artificial
intelligence
(
AI
)
models
or
integration
of
several
models
(
hybrid
models
)
for
prediction
problems
to
increase
the
accuracy
and
the
model
reliability
.
