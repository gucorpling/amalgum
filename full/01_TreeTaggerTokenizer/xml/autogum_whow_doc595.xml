Investigate
the
Perception
Aggregate
</head>
<p>
Perception
is
actually
a
very
subtle
one
to
watch
,
because
you
can
get
an
idea
of
it
intellectually
,
but
only
until
you
see
it
will
you
see
what
's
going
on
.
While
this
does
require
a
strong
background
in
mindfulness
or
awareness
of
the
sequence
of
rapid
mental
events
,
complete
beginners
can
do
this
with
the
focus
just
on
perception
.
Here
's
what
to
look
for
.

Investigate
the
Feeling
Aggregate
</ref>
or
other
similar
works
on
the
subject
.
Feeling
and
perceptions
are
very
closely
linked
.

Select
a
comfortable
meditation
posture
.
You
can
do
this
in
day
to
day
circumstances
,
but
this
one
is
harder
to
see
as
its
usually
buried
under
all
the
other
feelings
and
senses
.
<figure rend="Investigate the Perception Aggregate Step 2 Version 2.jpg">

</item>
<item>
Examine
whatever
feelings
arise
.
Try
to
see
the
process
of
&quot;
recognition
&quot;
or
&quot;
awareness
&quot;
or
any
words
that
mean
knowing
that
a
feeling
has
happened
.
<figure rend="Investigate the Perception Aggregate Step 3 Version 2.jpg">

</item>
<item>
Study
the
recognition
of
those
feelings
-
how
,
where
,
when
and
why
.
The
aim
of
the
game
is
to
see
the
micro-processes
in
action
.

Think
about
this
.
Feeling
requires
contact
of
the
body
(
nerve
endings
etc
)
and
the
sense
object
(
such
as
tension
,
body
chemicals
,
sound
,
sight
,
taste
etc
)
,
if
there
is
no
perception
of
the
contact
or
feeling
,
the
mind
does
n't
recognize
either
and
feeling
just
does
n't
register
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Look
for
the
distinction
or
separation
as
well
as
the
link
connection
between
feelings
and
what
happens
afterwards
in
the
mind
.
That
distinction
&amp;
link
is
perception
.

<item>
Consider
the
accuracy
of
it
,
is
it
100
%
accurate
and
perceives
everything
?
<figure rend="Investigate the Perception Aggregate Step 6 Version 2.jpg">

</item>
<item>
Understand
the
order
that
it
arises
:
<figure rend="Investigate the Perception Aggregate Step 7 Version 2.jpg">
</figure>
<list type="unordered">
<item>
first
materiality
-
the
body
,
physical
objects
and
their
characteristics
,
</item>
<item>
then
feeling
,
</item>
<item>
then
perception
,
</item>
<item>
then
mental
fabrications
,
activities
,
constructions
,
formations
,
responses
or
any
word
that
works
for
you
.
</item>
<item>
After
that
comes
the
conscious
states
or
any
words
that
describes
the
mental
states
that
support
and
dominate
the
others
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Try
to
see
it
happen
in
action
.
Trying
to
understand
does
not
make
understanding
happen
,
although
exploring
the
ideas
can
start
the
process
.
<figure rend="Investigate the Perception Aggregate Step 8 Version 2.jpg">

<item>
Try
to
consider
why
there
is
only
5
of
these
aggregates
and
explore
things
that
happen
.
You
might
find
everything
slots
into
these
5
.

Consider
these
3
similes
.
They
are
more
for
the
serious
investigator
of
this
subject
,
but
make
sense
when
you
test
them
.

Materiality
is
like
the
sick
room
and
the
patient
,
feeling
is
the
affliction
of
the
sickness
,
perception
is
the
provoking
of
the
illness
(
because
it
makes
you
want
it
to
go
away
)
,
formations
is
the
wanting
of
it
to
go
away
and
the
consciousness
is
like
an
incurable
illness
because
it
is
n't
ever
free
of
feeling
.
</item>
<item>
Materiality
is
the
prison
,
feeling
is
the
punishment
,
perception
is
the
crime
,
mental
formations
are
the
punisher
and
the
consciousness
the
punished
.
</item>
<item>
Materiality
is
like
a
lump
of
atomic
foam
,
feeling
like
a
bubble
on
the
water
(
because
it
does
n't
last
)
,
perception
is
a
mirage
because
it
makes
illusions
(
perception
of
the
&quot;
me
,
mine
&quot;
etc
)
,
mental
formations
like
a
banana
or
plantain
trunk
,
because
while
it
grows
it
does
n't
have
a
core
of
solid
heartwood
.
Consciousness
is
like
a
stage
illusion
.
It
is
n't
ever
how
it
seems
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Finally
consider
the
&quot;
un-manageability
&quot;
or
the
&quot;
auto-pilot
&quot;
nature
of
perception
.
It
s
not
something
we
can
turn
on
or
off
.
When
someone
who
studies
perceptions
with
the
angle
of
testing
ownership
,
self
or
entity
,
they
can
make
a
breakthrough
this
way
as
they
'll
see
the
starting
blocks
of
new
thoughts
,
feelings
and
mental
processes
and
that
they
are
empty
of
any
entity
.
Then
illusions
are
broken
and
there
are
no
mysteries
left
.

Tips
</head>
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Take
it
a
step
at
a
time
.
It
gets
easier
when
you
know
what
you
are
looking
for
as
well
as
what
you
are
seeing
.
</item>
<item>
This
really
does
take
time
.
Perception
is
n't
easy
to
see
because
its
in
between
contact
,
feeling
and
the
response
to
feeling
.
You
have
to
break
things
down
first
to
see
it
.
</item>
<item>
Perception
is
9/10th
's
of
the
law
.
That
is
,
&quot;
The
Law
&quot;
within
each
of
us
which
is
the
basis
of
our
understanding
of
all
things
external
to
ourselves
.
We
form
ad
follow
this
individually
based
on
our
perception
of
the
world
,
the
people
in
it
and
factions
involved
from
early
childhood
.
What
most
fail
to
do
to
this
day
,
is
to
'
Walk
a
mile
in
someone
else
's
moccasins
'
,
which
is
to
see
from
someone
else
's
perspective
.
This
lends
insight
,
compassion
,
understanding
,
and
discernment
in
place
of
judgementalism
,
prejudice
and
intolerance
of
our
fellow
man
.
Furthermore
,
egotism
and
self-centeredness
,
which
are
foundational
to
mental
instability
and
civil
unrest
,
are
too
easily
fostered
when
we
to
limit
our
perception
and
fail
to
take
others
'
into
consideration
.
