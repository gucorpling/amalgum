Get
Rid
of
Weevils
(
Flour
Bugs
)
</head>
<p>
If
you
've
opened
your
flour
and
found
it
crawling
with
small
pests
,
you
probably
have
weevils
.
Weevils
are
actually
small
,
reddish-brown
beetles
that
may
be
able
to
fly
.
Since
weevils
can
lay
a
few
eggs
a
day
for
months
,
you
might
be
dealing
with
flour
weevils
for
a
while
.
Completely
clean
your
pantry
and
store
your
flour
in
hard
,
airtight
containers
.
It
may
take
some
time
before
you
've
removed
all
of
the
weevil
eggs
,
but
improving
your
pantry
storage
will
stop
weevils
in
their
tracks
.

Find
the
source
of
the
weevils
.
Although
pantry
pests
can
fly
,
they
usually
like
to
stay
near
their
food
source
.
If
you
've
noticed
small
reddish
brown
beetles
,
weevils
,
in
your
flour
,
they
may
also
be
in
other
foods
in
your
pantry
.
You
should
also
check
for
weevils
near
your
pet
's
food
dishes
since
this
may
be
their
source
of
food
.

Although
you
wo
n't
be
able
to
see
the
eggs
in
pantry
items
,
you
will
be
able
to
see
adult
weevils
.
Check
your
flour
and
pantry
products
for
them
and
if
you
find
weevils
,
throw
away
the
food
.
If
you
do
n't

weevils
,
you
can

and
use
the
flour

You
should

eat
any
food
that
could
contain
live
weevils
.
If
you
've
accidentally
baked
with
flour
containing
weevils

you

weevils

Vacuum
and
wash

Remove
the
food
from

shelves
and
use
a
vacuum
attachment
to
suck
up
any
loose
bits
of
food
or
flour

Take
a
wash
cloth
dipped
in
soapy
water
and
wash
all
of
the
shelves
and
anywhere
that
there
may
be
spilled
food
.
If
you
've
found
weevils
in
other
rooms
of
your
house
,
vacuum
them
up
.

Immediately
empty

the

You
wo
n't
need
to
use
commercial
insecticides

Wipe
your

shelves

Once
you
've
thoroughly
cleaned
your
pantry
shelves
,
wipe
them
with
a
liquid
that
weevils
dislike
.
You
can
wipe
a
mixture
of
half
water
and
half
white
vinegar
or
use
eucalyptus
oil
.
Just
dilute
the
eucalyptus
oil
with
a
little
water
and

You

also
try
neem

Place
all
of
your
foods
in
airtight
,
hard
containers
.
Since
weevils
can
eat
through
cardboard
boxes
or
bags
,
you
'll
need
to
store
your
pantry
foods
in
hard
plastic
containers
or
jars
that
are
air-tight
.
If
you
've
bought
bakery
mixes
(
like
cake
or
muffin
mixes
)
,
check
these
for
weevils
and
transfer
them
to
containers
.
You
can
color
code
or
label
your
containers
to
make
them
easy
to
use
.

Buy
smaller
amounts
of
flour
.
If
you
do
n't
use
very
much
flour
,
consider
buying
small
amounts
at
a
time
.
If
you
leave
flour
sitting
around
for
a
long
period
of
time
,
weevils
may
be
encouraged
to
lay
their
eggs
in
it
.
The
faster
you
use
your
flour
,
the
fresher
it
is
,
and
the
fewer
the
chances
for
infestation
.

<item>
Freeze
the
flour
.
As
soon
as
you
bring
flour
home
,
seal
it
inside
a
freezer
bag
and
put
it
in
the
freezer
for
at
least
1
week
.
This
will
kill
any
eggs
or
weevils
that
are
already
in
the
flour
.
You
can
then
take
the
flour
out
and
store
it
in
your
pantry
in
an
airtight
,
hard
container
or
just
keep
it
in
the
freezer
until
you
need
it
.

Place
a
fresh
bay
leaf
in
the
flour
.
Get
out
fresh
bay
leaves
and
put
one
in
each
container
or
bag
of
stored
flour
.
Some
people
believe
bay
leaves
can
prevent
weevil
infestations
.
You
'll
need
to
replace
the
bay
leaves
every
few
months
or
when
you
can
no
longer
smell
them
.

Use
pheromone
traps
.
You
can
buy
small
packages
of
weevil
traps
that
use
pheromones
to
attract
the
weevils
and
pantry
moths
.
The
traps
have
a
sticky
space
that
trap
the
pantry
pests
.
Place
a
few
of
these
around
your
pantry
and
change
them
once
they
're
full
.

If
you
are
overwhelmed
by
a
huge
infestation
of
weevils
(
for
example
,
thousands
are
crawling
all
over
your
floors
and
walls
)
,
you
may

Check
your
pantry
for
weevils
on
a
regular
basis
.
You
should
check
your
pantry
every
month
or
two
for
weevils
.
This
is
especially
important
because
adult
weevils
can
live
at
least
a
year
.
Remember
to
thoroughly
clean
out
hard-to-reach
parts
of
your
pantry
where
weevils
might
start
thriving
.

Take
it

If
you
've
just
purchased
the
flour
that

in
,
consider
sealing
the
bag
in

If

remove
it
before

the
cupboards
since
weevils
can
hide
underneath
