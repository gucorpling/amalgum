<p>
I
am
15
years
old
.
I
do
nt
believe
I
am
a
psychopath
or
a
sociopath
.
I
can
feel
a
little
guilt
sometimes
.
The
thing
is
that
I
feel
pleasure
or
sexually
aroused
the
way
a
psychopath
would
when
I
see
physical
suffering
in
an
animal
or
another
human
being
.
However
,
when
bullying
or
harassing
someone
mentally
by
making
them
feel
bad
,
I
do
not
feel
the
effect
as
much
as
from
others
'
physical
pain
.
A
couple
of
years
ago
I
had
a
buddy
that
moved
to
my
area
.
I
would
physically
and
mentally
abuse
him
.
I
would
&quot;
play
practice
fighting
&quot;
with
him
and
would
make
him
feel
bad
saying
that
he
would
be
a
loner
if
he
pissed
me
off
.
I
would
tie
knives
to
sticks
and
we
would
play
games
woth
them
where
we
dofge
the
knife
.
Once
I
threw
it
and
it
skimmed
his
right
side
,
cutting
him
.
It
felt
good
to
watch
him
on
the
ground
.
When
i
was
in
elementary
school
I
remember
stepping
on
a
baby
bird
,
watching
it
rip
open
and
crunch
under
my
foot
,
draining
its
blood
.
It
also
felt
good
.
I
am
very
careless
.
At
school
I
get
homework
and
9
out
of
10
times
I
will
finish
it
late
or
last
minute
.
I
've
noticed
that
this
is
because
I
do
nt
have
the
motivation
that
other
people
do
,
or
the
focus
.
I
rarely
ever
get
stressed
out
.
Whenever
there
is
a
big
prohect
due
in
a
couple
days
I
feel
no
stress
whatsoever
.
Even
when
it
comes
to
the
last
day
.
If
I
'm
lucky
I
will
start
my
work
at
10
or
11pm
on
the
last
day
and
finish
it
at
4am
on
the
day
it
is
due
.
Other
times
I
finish
the
work
days
or
weeks
after
its
due
,
or
sometimes
I
never
even
do
it
at
all
.
I
want
to
get
my
act
together
so
I
do
nt
fail
my
grade
because
I
want
to
get
a
job
and
earn
some
money
this
year
to
save
up
for
some
things
.
I
do
n't
want
to
be
homeless
when
I
am
older
.
I
have
held
back
my
urge
for
seeking
pleasure
from
others
'
pain
in
the
recent
years
.
I
have
shot
a
dog
with
bb
guns
.
I
have
started
to
firmly
elieve
in
karma
,
and
that
what
goes
,
around
comes
around
.
This
is
why
I
no
longer
beat
others
up
and
steal
their
phones
and
money
.
I
am
considered
&quot;
extreme
&quot;
by
others
because
I
climb
roofs
of
schools
and
jump
off
high
places
to
feel
something
good
like
some
adrenaline
.
I
smoke
weed
sometimes
.
I
can
feel
soft
sometimes
when
someone
snaps
or
gets
angry
at
me
.
My
temper
is
low
and
I
do
nt
get
mad
at
others
often
like
I
see
other
people
being
angry
.
I
used
to
be
awkward
in
the
crowd
with
others
but
I
learned
how
to
fit
in
and
act
casually
like
other
people
.
I
use
breathing
techniques
to
keep
calm
and
my
blood
pressure
down
.
I
do
nt
know
what
I
am
or
if
I
have
a
disorder
or
disorders
of
some
sorts
.
Please
remember
that
I
try
to
keep
myself
in
line
.
I
hope
you
guys
do
nt
&quot;
hate
&quot;
on
this
much
.
Just
drop
the
info
if
you
know
something
about
what
is
with
me
.

Disclaimer
:
I
’m
not
a
psychologist
or
a
doctor
.
I
am
currently
working
on
my
Master
’s
in
Forensic
Psych
and
can
only
tell
you
what
I
think
based
on
what
I
know
of
mental
disorders
and
what
I
know
based
on
what
you
have
stated
.
</p>
<p>
To
me
,
it
does
seem
as
if
you
may
have
some
psychopathic
tendencies
,
namely
lack
of
strong
emotion
,
impulsive
and
thrill-seeking
behavior
,
and
a
history
of
behavior
that
is
harmful
to
others
.
However
,
the
fact
that
you
are
addressing
it
now
is
a
good
thing
.
</p>
<p>
The
general
consensus
on
the
difference
between
psychopaths
and
sociopaths
is
that
there
psychopaths
are
born
and
sociopaths
are
made
.
There
is
strong
evidence
for
genetic
involvement
in
the
development
of
psychopathy
,
and
strong
evidence
for
trauma
and
violence
in
the
environment
when
it
comes
to
sociopathic
behavior
.
Sociopaths
also
are
more
likely
to
experience
emotions
such
as
remorse
,
although
that
is
not
true
for
everyone
.
Therefore
,
my
first
thought
is
how
you
have
grown
up
and
whether
there
are
factors
that
may
have
contributed
to
a
more
sociopathic
or
antisocial
disposition
,
such
as
growing
up
surrounded
by
crime
or
violence
.
You
are
still
very
young
and
are
obviously
aware
of
how
you
have
developed
thus
far
,
which
will
be
a
great
asset
to
you
in
the
long
run
.
Have
you
always
felt
this
way
,
or
is
it
something
that
has
recently
developed
?
Do
you
ever
have
explosive
,
violent
,
or
destructive
behaviors
?
Have
you
ever
been
diagnosed
with
conduct
disorder
or
oppositional
defiant
disorder
?
(
And
btw
you
do
n’t
have
to
answer
any
of
these
questions
if
you
do
n’t
want
to
—
just
throwing
out
things
to
think
about
)
</p>
<p>
There
are
also
sexual
preferences
known
as
paraphilias
,
which
are
commonly
known
as
fetishes
or
deviant
sexual
preferences
.
These
include
sexual
sadism
,
pedophilia
,
necrophilia
,
cross-dressing
,
foot
fetishes
,
and
many
more
.
It
is
n’t
really
known
why
some
people
develop
paraphilias
,
but
as
long
as
no
one
is
actively
getting
hurt
,
assaulted
,
or
killed
,
or
as
long
as
no
crime
is
being
committed
(
like
breaking
into
a
morgue
to
have
sex
with
a
corpse
or
actually
molesting
a
child
downloading
child
porn
)
,
paraphilias
are
not
necessarily
harmful
.
Based
on
your
description
of
arousal
when
others
are
in
pain
,
it
sounds
like
you
may
be
a
sexual
sadist
.
In
this
case
,
there
are
safe
and
consensual
ways
to
express
this
desire
.
BDSM
(
Bondage
,
Discipline
,
Sadism
,
and
Masochism
)
is
a
fairly
common
practice
for
many
people
,
and
the
BDSM
community
very
much
encourages
safe
and
consensual
practices
.
</p>
<p>
I
say
,
continue
to
examine
yourself
and
why
you
feel
the
way
you
feel
.
If
you
feel
therapy
would
be
helpful
,
and
if
it
’s
an
option
for
you
,
look
into
it
,
if
only
for
the
purpose
of
better
self-understanding
.
Like
I
said
,
you
’re
young
,
and
there
is
a
lot
of
mental
and
biological
development
you
have
yet
to
go
through
.
Good
luck
and
I
hope
you
are
able
to
find
peace
with
yourself
.
