At

a

of
joint
understanding
by

Commenting
on
the
statement
,
President
Bush
said
that
:
&quot;
Today
,
Palestinians
and
Israelis
each
understand
that
helping
the
other
to
realize
their
aspirations
is
key
to
realizing
their
own
aspirations
—
and
both
require
an
independent
,
democratic
,
viable
Palestinian
state
.
Such
a
state
will
provide
Palestinians
with
the
chance
to
lead
lives
of
freedom
and
purpose
and
dignity
.
Such
a
state
will
help
provide
the
Israelis
with
something
they
have
been
seeking
for
generations
:
to
live
in
peace
with
their
neighbors
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Regarding
the
immediate
future
,
the
joint
statement
said
:
&quot;
President
Abbas
and
Prime
Minister
Olmert
will
continue
to
meet
on
a
bi-weekly
basis
to
follow
up
the
negotiations
in
order
to
offer
all
necessary
assistance
for
their
advancement
.
&quot;
It
also
set
a
target
for
an
agreement
:
&quot;
We
agree
to
engage
in
vigorous
,
ongoing
and
continuous
negotiations
,
and
shall
make
every
effort
to
conclude
an
agreement
before
the
end
of
2008
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Analysts
,
however
,
are
skeptical
that
the
two
leaders
,
who
are
both
politically
weakened
at
home
,
will
be
able
to
reach
an
agreement
by
the
deadline
.
There
are
also
doubts
about
how
hard
Bush
will
push
them
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
am
not
persuaded
yet
that
they
have
grasped
the
seriousness
and
the
amount
of
work
that
is
required
to
do
what
they
say
they
want
to
do
—
to
reach
an
agreement
on
the
core
issues
by
the
end
of
the
Bush
administration
,

Aaron
David
Miller
of
the

It
's

Neither
has
the
support
at
home
or
the
control
of
his
government
to
do
something
extremely
serious
,
&quot;

Jon
Alterman

analyst

</p>
<p>
&quot;
There
is
,
I
think
,
considerable
doubt
remaining
about
whether
the
administration
is
prepared
to
take
on
the
heavy
lifting
...
to
make
this
work
,
&quot;
said
Bruce
Riedel
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brookings%20Institution">

Institution

.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
This
was
an
investment
of
presidential
prestige
that
we
had
n't
seen
before
,
&quot;
said
Daniel
Levy
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New%20America%20Foundation">

.
Levy
saw
reason
for
&quot;
very
,
very
guarded
optimism
&quot;
and
praised
the
commitments
made
by
Abbas
and
Olmert
.

<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Iran">
Iran

was
notably
absent
from
the
list
of
conference
participants
.
&quot;
The
Arabs
have
come
here
not
because
they
love
the
Jews
or
even
the
Palestinians
,
&quot;
an
advisor
to
the
Palestinian
team
told
<hi rend="italic">
The
New
York
Times
</hi>
on
condition
of
anonymity
.
&quot;
They
came
because
they
need
a
strategic
alliance
with
the
United
States
against
Iran
.

<p>
Secretary
of
State
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Condoleezza_Rice">

felt
the
conference
was
a
success
.
&quot;
It
's
going
to
be
hard
,
but
you
had
support
in
that
room
[
in
Annapolis
]
that
you
had
not
had
from

in

<p>
Meanwhile
,
in
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West%20Bank">
West
Bank

,
hundreds
protested
the
Annapolis
Conference
in
conjunction
with
a
funeral
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebron">
Hebron
</ref>
.
They
clashed
with
security
forces
who
fired
shots
into
the
air
to
disperse
the
crowd
.
At
least
24
people
have
been
reported
injured
.

<p>
Also
,
today
,
Israeli
aircraft
targeted
a
