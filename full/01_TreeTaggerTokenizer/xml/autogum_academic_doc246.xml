This
section
presents
the
normalization
results
of
the
proposed
algorithm
and
then
compares
them
with
the
results
of
a
conventional
algorithm
.
First
,
our
proposed
normalization
process
is
performed
step-by-step
for
the
experimental
images
,
in
which
the
radiometric
resolution
is
compressed
to
8-bits
,
and
the
spectral
indices
of
the
blue
,
green
,
red
,
and
NIR
bands
are
selected
as
ExG
,
COM
,
ExGR
,
and
ExG
,
respectively
.
Subsequently
,
the
results
of
our
proposed
method
are
compared
with
the
conventional
methods
(
MS
,
NC
,
histogram
matching
,
and
random
forest
(
RF
)
)
to
evaluate
them
visually
and
quantitatively
,
and
<figure>

,

Figure

</figure>
and

Figure

</figure>
show
the
results
for
each
experimental
image
.
</p>
<p>
From
the
overall
visual
inspection
,
the
normalization
of
the
proposed
method
is
shown
to
be
better
than
that
of
the
conventional
methods
.
MS
and
NC
,
which
are
regression-based
methods
,
assume
that
the
relationship
between
the
subject
and
reference
images
is
linear
.
However
,
as
shown
in
the
results
,
neither
the
phenological
properties
nor
the
radiometric
properties
are
normalized
.
In
other
words
,
it
can
be
confirmed
that
it
is
not
appropriate
to
assume
a
linear
relationship
in
the
case
of
high-resolution
images
,
in
which
vegetation
changes
exist
.
In
the
case
of
histogram
matching
,
it
is
a
representative
nonlinear
normalization
method
,
which
is
based
on
global
statistical
information
.
Overall
,
the
radiometric
properties
are
normalized
,
while
the
normalization
for
the
phenological
properties
is
not
performed
at
all
.
That
is
,
when
only
statistical
information
is
used
,
it
is
possible
to
normalize
the
radiometric
properties
,
but
there
is
a
limit
to
phenological
normalization
.
RF
is
a
nonlinear
method
that
is
performed
through
RF
regression
,
which
uses
neighbor
information-based
features
,
such
as
the
mean
,
variance
,
and
gray-level
co-occurrence
matrix
as
the
training
input
values
.
The
results
of
this
method
show
that
the
radiometric
and
phenological
normalizations
are
performed
,
but
spectral
distortion
is
present
.
Furthermore
,
blurriness
occurs
in
the
results
due
to
the
neighbor
information-based
features
,
which
results
in
some
loss
of
detail
,
especially
on
linear
objects
.
On
the
other
hand
,
our
proposed
method
shows
that
the
radiometric
and
phenological
normalizations
are
properly
performed
,
and
there
is
no
spectral
distortion
or
blurriness
in
the
results
.
</p>
<p>
To
verify
the
radiometric
and
phenological
normalization
results
in
detail
,
some
regions
are
selected
and
enlarged
,
with
red
rectangles
representing
the
built-up
areas
and
green
rectangles
representing
the
vegetation
areas
.
<figure>
Figure
9
</figure>
shows
built-up
areas
,
which
represent
the
radiometric
properties
,
consist
of
roads
and
the
roofs
of
buildings
,
and
the
enlarged
areas
for
each
normalization
result
.
For
roads
,
the
proposed
method
normalizes
the
radiometric
properties
in
such
a
way
that
the
image
is
the
closest
in
consistency
with
the
reference
image
,
while
,
in
the
case
of
roofs
,
the
results
vary
for
the
site
.
For
site
2
,
showing
a
relatively
large
roof
,
the
radiometric
properties
normalized
through
the
proposed
method
show
the
most
similarity
with
those
of
the
reference
image
,
whereas
for
site
3
,
showing
several
small
roofs
,
the
proposed
method
displays
some
turbidity
when
compared
to
other
methods
.
In
other
words
,
roofs
are
affected
by
their
objective
size
,
which
is
judged
according
to
its
geometric
distortion
.
Large-sized
objects
can
be
trained
properly
,
even
in
the
presence
of
geometric
distortion
,
while
small-sized
objects
acquire
the
characteristic
of
other
surrounding
objects
,
which
adversely
affects
training
.
For
vegetation
areas
,
phenological
properties
,
such
as
forests
,
grass
,
and
crops
,
are
included
,
and
<figure>
Figure
10
</figure>
shows
the
corresponding
enlarged
areas
.
In
the
case
of
forests
,
it
is
confirmed
that
the
areas
without
vegetation
due
to
the
phenological
properties
in
the
subject
image
are
normalized
to
the
same
phenological
properties
as
the
reference
image
at
all
sites
.
For
grass
and
crops
,
the
performance
of
normalization
is
somewhat
less
than
that
for
forests
due
to
the
heterogenous
characteristics
,
but
it
contains
the
characteristics
of
the
reference
image
as
a
whole
.
</p>
<p>
Although
visual
inspection
is
a
straightforward
and
direct
manner
of
comparison
,
it
is
highly
subjective
;
thus
,
quantitative
evaluations
of
each
method
are
further
performed
based
on
NRMSE
.
The
NRMSE
is
defined
as
in
Equations
(
12
)
and
(
13
)
:
(

)
(

)
where
is
RCSSs
in
the
normalized
image
of
band
;
is
the
RCSSs
in
the
reference
image
of
band
;
is
the
total
number
of
RCSSs
;
and
,
is
the
mean
of
RCSSs
in
the
reference
image
of
band
<hi rend="italic">

.
Table

shows
the
NRMSE
for
the
results
of
the
proposed
method
and
the
conventional
methods
.
