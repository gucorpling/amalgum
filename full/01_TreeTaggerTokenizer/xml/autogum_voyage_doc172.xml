<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Swedish
</hi>
(
<hi rend="italic">
svenska
</hi>
)
is
a
North
Germanic
language
,
closely
related
to
<ref target="Norwegian%20phrasebook">
Norwegian
</ref>
and
<ref target="Danish%20phrasebook">
Danish
</ref>
(
and
through
them
,
related
to
<ref target="Icelandic%20phrasebook">
Icelandic
</ref>
and
<ref target="Faroese%20phrasebook">
Faroese
</ref>
)
and
strongly
influenced
by
<ref target="Low%20German%20phrasebook">
Low
German
</ref>
.
Spoken
by
over
9
million
people
,
Swedish
is
the
national
language
of
<ref target="Sweden">
Sweden
</ref>
and
the
official
language
of
the
<ref target="%C3%85land">
Åland
</ref>
Islands
.
It
is
also
an
official
language
of
<ref target="Finland">
Finland
</ref>
(
along
with
<ref target="Finnish%20phrasebook">
Finnish
</ref>
)
,
though
only
the
mother
tongue
for
about
6
percent
of
Finns
,
mostly
concentrated
in
some
coastal
areas
.
</p>
<p>
Like
for
instance
British
and
American
English
,
there
are
differences
between
Swedish
spoken
in
Sweden
(
<hi rend="italic">
rikssvenska
</hi>
)
and
Swedish
spoken
in
Finland
(
<hi rend="italic">
finlandssvenska
</hi>
)
,
in
pronunciation
,
grammar
and
vocabulary
,
partly
due
to
influence
from
<ref target="Finnish">
Finnish
</ref>
in
the
latter
,
but
also
due
to
it
retaining
some
archaic
features
.
</p>
<p>
Finland-Swedish
is
less
tonal
,
slightly
more
phonetic
and
like
in
Finnish
the
'
r
'
is
always
trilled
.
There
are
dialectal
differences
inside
Finland
and
Sweden
too
,
most
notably
the
Swedish
spoken
in
<ref target="Scania">
Scania
</ref>
reminds
of
Danish
to
some
extent
,
but
Swedish
speakers
with
different
dialects
seldom
have
difficulties
understanding
each
other
.
Some
archaic
dialects
of
rural
<ref target="Ostrobothnia">
Ostrobothnia
</ref>
are
incomprehensible
,
but
the
speakers
will
switch
to
normal
Swedish
when
talking
to
non-locals
.
</p>
<p>
As
Swedish
is
a
Germanic
language
,
speakers
of
other
Germanic
languages
like
<ref target="German%20phrasebook">
German
</ref>
,
<ref target="Dutch%20phrasebook">
Dutch
</ref>
or
even
English
will
be
able
to
recognise
many
cognates
.
</p>
<p>
While
practically
everyone
in
Sweden
under
the
age
of
70
can
speak
some
English
,
most
younger
people
fluently
,
trying
out
some
words
of
Swedish
is
always
appreciated
.
The
same
is
true
about
the
Swedish
speaking
in
Finland
–
but
you
should
probably
stick
to
English
or
<ref target="Finnish%20phrasebook">
Finnish
</ref>
with
people
whose
first
language
is
Finnish
.
</p>
<head>
Vowels
</head>
<p>
Swedish
is
notorious
for
its
extra
vowel
sounds
,
giving
Swedish
nine
(
!
)
different
vowels
.
Most
are
pronounced
differently
than
English
,
and
some
do
n't
even
have
a
true
English
equivalent
;
some
may
be
close
,
but
sound
like
a
combination
of
two
vowel
sounds
.
This
can
be
very
confusing
,
but
you
probably
wo
n't
hear
enough
Swedish
to
know
the
difference
,
as
they
can
be
very
slight
.
If
you
do
n't
get
it
exactly
,
you
may
still
be
understood
.
All
vowels
can
be
pronounced
short
or
long
which
means
that
Swedish
has
17
different
vowel
sounds
(
short
e
and
short
ä
is
the
same
)
.
</p>
<p>
Please
note
:
in
Swedish
'
Y
'
is
a
vowel
and
not
a
consonant
.
Å
,
Ä
and
Ö
are
letters
in
their
own
right
,
in
the
end
of
the
alphabet
past
Z.

This

one

Easiest
way
is
to
round

<p>
The
pronunciation
of
u
and
y
varies
quite
a
lot
between
regions
;
all
native
speakers
make
a
clear
distinction
,
although
the
u
of
somebody
may
be
close
to
y
of
somebody
else

<head>
Consonants
</head>
<p>
Consonants
are
closer
to
English
,
but
some
combinations
can
be
downright
tricky
,
i.e.
'
sj
'
in
&quot;
sjutton
.
&quot;
Some
pronunciations
depend
on
the
vowel
following
it
,
and
so
the
vowels
are
divided
into
&quot;
soft
&quot;
and
&quot;
hard
&quot;
vowels
.
A
,
o
,
u
,
and
å
are
the
hard
vowels
,
and
e
,
i
,
y
,
ä
,
and
ö
are
the
soft
vowels
.
There
are
also
some
combinations
of
letters
treated
as
a
group
for
the
purpose
of
pronunciation
(
e.
g.
ch
,
ng
,
sch
,
sj
,
tj
)
.
