My
dog
has
never
had
his
teeth
cleaned
and
today
was
the
first
time
the
vet
has
suggested
I
do
so
.
Before
taking
him
back
to
give
him
vaccines
,
she
asked
if
I
wanted
to
have
the
&quot;
Pre-op
&quot;
blood
screening
done
too
.
I
asked
her
what
that
was
for
and
she
mentioned
that
I
would
need
to
do
that
in
order
for
them
to
anesthetize
him
before
his
teeth
cleaning
.
Being
that
he
is
extremely
well
behaved
,
docile
,
and
has
never
shown
aggression
,
I
feel
like
that
is
not
necessary
.
Is
this
the
norm
when
getting
your
dog
's
teeth
cleaned
?
It
seems
a
little
overkill
for
such
a
small
dog
,
would
n't
it
be
better
to
avoid
anesthetizing
an
animal
if
it
is
n't
necessary
?
All
explanations/advice
are
welcome
and
appreciated

Also
a
dog
will
not
hold
still
for
x
rays
,
if
you
vet
does
not
offer
X
rays
of
the
roots
under
the
gum
line
I
suggest
having
the
dental
done
somewhere
that
does
.
Doing
the
blood
work
would
be
great
if
you
can
afford
it
.
It
gives
you
a
baseline
for
when
hes
older
and
lets
the
Dr
know
if
hes
a
good
candidate
for
anesthesia
.
A
dental
cleaning
at
7
years
old
on
a
dog
with
no
history
of
tooth
brushing
or
preciously
dental
care
is
necessary
.
ESPECIALLY
with
small
breeds
.
I
would
not
be
shocked
to
find
your
dog
needs
to
have
some
teeth
pulled
which
ca
n't
be
done
awake
.
Also
with
out
X
rays
they
ca
n't
100
%
tell
if
the
tooth
needs
to
be
pulled
or
that
they
got
100
%
of
the
root
and
did
not
leave
any
behind
.
The
fact
that
you
mentioned
over
kill
for
such
a
small
dog
is
kinda
comical
to
me
because
small
dogs
have
the
worse
mouth
dental
disease
of
all
and
its
needed
more
than
in
large
breeds
.
You
def
want
to
have
this
dental
done
before
he
gets
to
be
9
10
years
old
and
be
more
concerned
about
an
anesthesia
risk
.
With
that
being
said
we
still
routinely
put
animals
upwards
of
10
years
old
under
anesthesia
.
