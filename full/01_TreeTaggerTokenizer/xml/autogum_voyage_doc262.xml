<p>
Laos
is
the
only
landlocked
country
in
Southeasia
Asia
and
the
most
sparsely
populated
.
Unlike
most
countries
an
Asia
,
the
country
has
not
undergone
a
major
industrialisation
and
modernisation
period
;
as
result
,
lifestyle
remains
mostly
rural
and
true
large
cities
are
absent
.
An
adjective
often
applied
to
Laos
is
&quot;
forgotten
&quot;
,
but
contrary
to
what
advertised
by
travel
agencies
,
it
is
hard
to
say
this
applies
to
tourism
as
well
:
Laos
gets
a
number
of
international
visitors
only
20
%
lesser
than
the
<ref target="Philippines">
Philippines
</ref>
,
which
has
a
population
15
times
bigger
than
Laos
.
</p>
<p>
Therefore
,
travellers
lured
by
the
prospect
of
visiting
an
untouched
&quot;
Shangri-la
&quot;
are
likely
to
be
disappointed
;
in
fact
,
cities
like
<ref target="Luang%20Prabang">
Luang
Prabang
</ref>
,
<ref target="Nong%20Khiaw">
Nong
Khiaw
</ref>
and
<ref target="Vang%20Vieng">
Vang
Vieng
</ref>
are
heavily
tourist-oriented
.
On
the
other
hand
,
Laos
can
be
extremely
rewarding
for
those
who
are
instead
drawn
by
the
laid-back
lifestyle
and
the
opportunity
to
knock
back
a
few
cold
Beerlao
while
watching
the
sunsets
on
the
Mekong
.
Perhaps
one
of
the
biggest
attractions
of
Laos
is
the
famous
&quot;
Lao
PDR
&quot;
-
<hi rend="italic">
Lao-Please
Do
n't
Rush
</hi>
.
</p>
<head>
History
</head>
<p>
Laos
is
squeezed
between
vastly
larger
neighbours
.
First
created
as
an
entity
in
1353
,
when
warlord
Fa
Ngum
declared
himself
the
king
of
<hi rend="bold">
Lane
Xang
</hi>
(
&quot;
Million
Elephants
&quot;
)
,
the
kingdom
was
initially
a
<ref target="Cambodia">
Khmer
</ref>
vassal
state
.
After
a
succession
dispute
,
the
kingdom
split
in
three
in
1694
and
was
eventually
devoured
piece
by
piece
by
the
Siamese
,
the
last
fragments
agreeing
to
Siamese
protection
in
1885
.
</p>
<p>
The
area
east
of
the
Mekong
,
however
,
was
soon
wrenched
back
from
Siam
by
the
French
,
who
wanted
a
buffer
state
to
protect
Vietnam
,
and
set
up
Laos
as
a
unified
territory
in
1907
.
Briefly
occupied
by
Japan
in
1945
,
a
three-decade-long
conflict
was
triggered
when
France
wanted
to
retake
its
colony
.
Granted
full
independence
in
1953
,
the
war
continued
between
a
bewildering
variety
of
factions
,
with
the
Communist
and
North
Vietnam-allied
<hi rend="bold">
Pathet
Lao
</hi>
struggling
to
overthrow
the
French-leaning
monarchy
.
During
the
Vietnam
War
(
1964-1973
)
,
this
alliance
led
the
United
States
to
dump
1.9
million
tonnes
of
bombs
on
Laos
,
mostly
in
the
northeast
stronghold
of
the
Pathet
Lao
:
as
a
comparison
2.2
million
tonnes
were
dropped
on
Europe
by
all
sides
during
World
War
II
.
</p>
<p>
In
1975
,
after
the
fall
of
Saigon
,
the
Communist
Pathet
Lao
took
control
of
Vientiane
and
ended
a
six-century-old
monarchy
.
Initial
closer
ties
to
Vietnam
and
socialization
were
replaced
with
a
gradual
return
to
private
enterprise
,
an
easing
of
foreign
investment
laws
and
admission
into
ASEAN
in
1997
.
</p>
<p>
Despite
being
just
one
hour
by
air
from
the
hustle
and
bustle
of
<ref target="Bangkok">
Bangkok
</ref>
,
life
in
Laos
has
continued
in
much
the
same
way
it
has
for
hundreds
of
years
,
although
things
are
now
slowly
beginning
to
change
.
In
the
mid-1990s
the
government
reversed
its
stance
on
tourism
,
and
then
declared
1998
&quot;
Visit
Laos
Year
&quot;
.
Since
then
,
tourists
in
Laos
have
been
rising
every
year
.
</p>
<p>
In
2017
,
Laos
and
<ref target="China">
China
</ref>
started
the
construction
of
a
high
speed
rail
linking
<ref target="Kunming">
Kunming
</ref>
to
<ref target="Vientiane">
Vientiane
</ref>
.
When
(
and
if
)
complete
,
the
rail
connection
is
expected
to
have
a
dramatical
impact
on
the
country
;
Kunming
itself
has
a
population
8
times
bigger
than
Vientiane
,
and
in
fact
,
comparable
to
the
entire
population
of
Laos
,
while
only
the
province
of
<ref target="Yunnan">
Yunnan
</ref>
has
a
population
about
7
times
bigger
than
the
population
of
Laos
.
It
is
likely
that
the
face
of
tourism
in
the
country
will
drastically
change
,
and
the
word
&quot;
forgotten
&quot;
used
to
describe
Laos
will
become
a
forgotten
memory
itself
</p>
<head>
Culture
</head>
<p>
Despite
its
small
population
,
Laos
has
49
ethnic
groups
,
or
tribes
,
from
which
Lao
,
Khmou
and
Hmong
constitute
approximately
three-quarters
of
the
population
.
Most
tribes
are
small
,
with
some
having
just
a
few
hundred
members
.
The
ethnic
groups
are
divided
into
four
linguistic
branches
:
Lao-Tai
language
represented
by
8
tribes
,
Mone-Khmer
language
with
32
tribes
,
Hmoung-Loumien
language
with
2
tribes
,
and
Tibeto-Chinese
language
represented
by
7
tribes
.
</p>
<p>
Laos
is
officially
Buddhist
,
and
the
national
symbol
,
the
gilded
stupa
of
<ref target="Vientiane%23See">
Pha
That
Luang
</ref>
,
has
replaced
the
hammer
and
sickle
even
on
the
state
seal
.
Still
,
there
is
a
good
deal
of
animism
mixed
in
,
particularly
in
the
<hi rend="bold">
baci
</hi>
(
also
<hi rend="italic">
baasi
</hi>
)
ceremony
conducted
to
bind
the
32
guardian
spirits
to
the
participant
's
body
before
a
long
journey
,
after
serious
illness
,
the
birth
of
a
baby
,
or
other
significant
events
.
</p>
<p>
Lao
custom
dictates
that
women
must
wear
the
distinctive
<hi rend="italic">
phaa
sin
</hi>
,
a
long
sarong
available
in
many
regional
patterns
;
however
,
many
ethnic
minorities
have
their
own
clothing
styles
.
The
conical
Vietnamese-style
hat
is
also
a
common
sight
.
These
days
men
dress
Western-style
and
only
don
the
<hi rend="italic">
phaa
biang
</hi>
sash
on
ceremonial
occasions
.
Nowadays
women
often
wear
Western-style
clothing
,
though
the
&quot;
phaa
sin
&quot;
is
still
the
mandatory
attire
in
government
offices
,
not
only
for
those
who
work
there
but
also
for
Lao
women
who
are
visiting
.
