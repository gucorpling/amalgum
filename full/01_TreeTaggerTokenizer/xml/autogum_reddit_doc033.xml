Help
convert
my
wife
to
K-Pop
</head>
<sp who="#SirBuckeye">
<p>
I
love
K-Pop
.
My
kids
love
K-Pop
.
But
my
wife
is
less
than
enthused
so
far
.
I
'll
have
her
trapped
in
a
car
for
ten
hours
this
weekend
,
so
I
thought
I
would
create
a
playlist
to
try
and
convert
her
to
the
light
.
I
need
your
help
to
put
it
together
because
my
knowledge
is
lacking
,
especially
when
it
comes
to
boy
groups
.

maybe

I
think
this
is
a
good
start
,
but
I
'm
really
not
familiar
with
most
boy
groups
and
I
think
she
would
like
them
more
than
the
girl
groups
that
I
stan
.
Please
suggest
specific
songs
,
not
just
general
artists
.
It
's
okay
if
the
songs
are
n't
title
tracks
or
big
hits
.
Link
to
the
MV
or
Lyric
video
on
YouTube
if
you
can
.
Thanks
in
advance
for
your
help
!
