Q
:
</hi>
Which
council
decision
(
since
the
2003
election
)
do
you
feel
the
city/your
ward
should
be
most
proud
of
,
and
which
was
least
desirable
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
A
:
</hi>
A
high
point
was
when
Council
supported
my
Civic
Youth
Strategy
.
They
approved
not
only
a
strategy
which
demands
meaningful
employment
and
empowerment
of
Youth
,
but
also
a
process
to
allow
Youth
themselves
to
determine
the
membership
of
our
Toronto
Youth
Panel
.
This
panel
will
report
to
council
as
well
as
have
council
's
initiatives
reported
to
them
for
direct
input
.
</p>
<p>
A
low
point
was
when
Council
turned
down
my
motion
to
start
an
office
of
Civic
Engagement
attached
to
the
City
Manager
's
office
.
This
is
absolutely
crucial
to
a
more
engaged
,
united
and
more
equitable
City
.
Informal
and
upstart
community
groups
need
help
,
advice
,
access
to
resources
,
and
networks
â€”
things
we
have
to
offer
,
but
are
n't
equipped
to
share
.
I
will
be
bringing
the
concept
back
to
a
new
term
of
Council
.

here
to
ensure
that
ignorant
,
incompetence
,
corruption
are
not
tolerated
in
government
and
ensure
political
power
is
balanced
by
informed
decision
making
-
not
simply
fiscal
myopia
.
