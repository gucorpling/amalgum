Why
have
you
chosen
to
involve
yourself
in
the
political
process
?
Why
did
you
choose
to
run
in
this
constituency
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
I
originally
become
involved
in
politics
when
members
of
the
community
suggested
I
stand
for
election
as
a
local
school
trustee
.
As
a
parent
,
I
was
naturally
interested
in
school
board
issues
.
This
later
led
to
my
involvement
as
an
elected
municipal
councillor
for
Clarington
.
One
of
my
responsibilities
on
Council
was
as
Chair
of
the
local
budget
process
.
I
was
first
elected
to
the
Ontario
Legislature
in
1995
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
What
prior
political
experience
do
you
have
?
What
skills
and
insight
can
you
bring
to
office
,
from
other
non-political
positions
you
may
have
held
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
I
have
experience
at
both
the
local
and
provincial
level
.
In
addition
,
my
30
years
with
General
Motors
has
given
me
a
strong
background
in
the
business
sector
,
especially
within
the
auto
industry
and
related
manufacturing
enterprises
that
are
so
important
to
Durham
Riding
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Which
of
your
competitors
do
you
expect
to
pose
the
biggest
challenge
to
your
candidacy
?
Why
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
In
my
most
recent
campaigns
,
the
Liberal
Party
candidate
has
placed
second
and
the
New
Democratic
Party
candidate
third
.
However
,
when
I
first
ran
for
office
in
1995
,
the
incumbent
MPP
was
a
New
Democrat
.
I
try
to
learn
from
previous
campaigns
,
but
take
nothing
for
granted
and
try
to
treat
each
campaign
like
it
’s
a
new
beginning
–
a
new
opportunity
to
win
the
support
of
local
citizens
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
What
makes
you
the
most
desirable
of
all
candidates
running
in
the
riding
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
I
have
direct
experience
in
the
Ontario
Legislature
for
three
terms
,
and
have
a
solid
background
in
ensuring
constituents
get
the
help
they
need
when
dealing
with
provincial
issues
.
Given
the
fact
that
I
have
over
25
years
of
elected
experience
,
I
also
have
the
advantage
of
many
contacts
within
community
organizations
and
local
government
.
In
other
words
,
I
understand
the
community
and
work
hard
to
ensure
Durham
Riding
has
the
best
possible
representation
at
Queen
’s
Park
.

What
do
you
feel
are
the
three
most
important
issues
to
voters
in
your
riding
?
Are
these
the
same
top
three
issues
that
are
most
important
to
you
?
What
would
you
do
to
address
these
issues
?
