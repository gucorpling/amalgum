Initial

were
made
in

indicated
support
for
same-sex
marriage
in
Illinois

Eight
Catholic
Democrats
signed
a
letter
to
the
Cardinal
and
the
Catholic
Campaign

expressing
their
concern
that
the
Cardinal
is
playing
politics
over
the
same-sex
marriage
issue
at
the
expense
of
immigrants

John
Fritchey
is
quoted
in
the
<hi rend="italic">
Chicago
Sun-Times
</hi>
as
saying
of
the
letter
,
&quot;
You
often
run
into
conflicts
when
politics
and
religion
intersect
.
[
...
]
The
letter
simply
reflects
our
position
that
a
fundamental
tenet
of
Catholicism
is
compassion
.
I
do
n't
think
anybody
would
suggest
that
compassion
is
something
that
should
be
used
as
a
hammer
to
accomplish
other
philosophical
goals
.
[
...
]
I
've
known
Cardinal
George
for
a
long
time
.
[
...
]
I
believe
he
wants
to
do
the
right
thing
and
I
'd
like
to
believe
that
punishing
innocent
people
in
need
perhaps
is
n't
the
best
way
to
enforce
his
particular
beliefs
with
respect
to
marriage
equality
.
&quot;

<p>
Cardinal
George
is
quoted
by
<hi rend="italic">
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WFLD">
Fox
32
Chicago
</ref>
</hi>
responding
to
the
letter
:
&quot;
It
is
intellectually
and
morally
dishonest
to
use
the
witness
of
the
church
's
concern
for
the
poor
as
an
excuse
to
attack
the
church
's
teaching
on
the
nature
of
marriage
.
[
...
]
Jesus
is
merciful
,
but
he
is
not
stupid
.
He
knows
the
difference
between
right
and
wrong
.
Manipulating
both
immigrants
and
the
church
for
political
advantage
is
wrong
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
threats
take
place
against
a
backdrop
of
political
debate
in
the
state
over
legalizing
same-sex
marriage
,
with
the
possibility
of
the
Illinois
House
and
Senate
addressing
the
issue
during
their
fall
session
.
Twenty-five
couples
are
currently
suing
the
state
of
Illinois
in
order
to
gain
access
to
marriage
equality
and
over
200
Illinois
clergy
have
signed
an
amicus
brief
to
support
the
couples
.
