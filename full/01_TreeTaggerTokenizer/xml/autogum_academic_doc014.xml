Tailoring
Immunotherapy
in
Real-Life
Clinical
Practice
</head>
<p>
After
the
histology-agnostic
approval
of
pembrolizumab
in
mismatch
repair
(
MMR)-deficient
tumors
,
the
predictive
molecular
pathology
scenario
in
cancer
immunotherapy
changed
radically
.
For
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
medicine
,
a
drug
(
in
this
case
,
an
immune-checkpoint
inhibitor
)
was
approved
based
on
a
specific
molecular
feature
of
the
neoplasm
,
irrespective
of
its
anatomical
site
of
origin
.
A
multitude
of
different
tools
has
been
proposed
to
inform
immunotherapy
,
including
morphology
,
immunohistochemistry
(
IHC
)
,
polymerase
chain
reaction
(
PCR)-based
techniques
and
next-generation
technology
assays
,
such
as
next-generation
sequencing
(
NGS
)
or
multiplex
barcode
technology
(
e.
g.
,
NanoString
)
.
However
,
not
all
the
available
tools
are
validated
for
patients
’
selection
in
clinical
practice
,
as
shown
in
<figure>
Figure

.
</p>
<p>
Among
new
biomarkers
to
select
patients
for
immunotherapy
,
the
tumor
mutational
burden
(
TMB
)
has
been
shown
a
strong
correlation
with
the
response
to
some
compounds
.
TMB
is
defined
by
the
total
number
of
somatic
nonsynonymous
mutations
per
coding
area
of
the
tumor
DNA
.
It
has
been
hypothesized
that
tumors
with
a
higher
TMB
are
more
likely
to
express
neoantigens
and
to
induce
a
more
robust
immune
response
in
the
presence
of
immune
checkpoint
inhibitors
.
Regrettably
,
the
TMB
analysis
is
considered
expensive
,
time-consuming
,
and
deceptive
if
the
analyses
are
carried
out
with
an
unsuitable
NGS
panel
.
Another
important
facet
in
TMB
analysis
is
represented
by
the
lack
of
widely
adopted
guidelines
and
recommendations
for
its
assessment
and
reporting
.
Initially
,
TMB
was
determined
using
wide
approaches
(
e.
g.
,
whole
exome
sequencing
)
,
but
more
focused
gene
panels
are
currently
being
explored
.
In
addition
,
there
are
several
indications
that
TMB
is
not
a
universal
biomarker
,
as
its
value
varies
not
only
across
tumor
types
but
also
across
different
genomic
regions
and
during
the
time
.
This
notion
highlights
the
need
for
disease-specific
TMB
panels
and
thresholds
.
</p>
<p>
Likewise
,
the
analysis
of
the
MMR
status
is
troubled
by
the
vastity
of
the
existing
diagnostic
methods
in
the
substantial
absence
of
companion
diagnostic
(
CD
)
tests
.
In
general
,
MMR
IHC
is
mirrored
by
microsatellite
instability
(
MSI
)
in
endometrial
and
colorectal
cancers
.
However
,
not
all
MMR-deficient
tumors
show
MSI
(
e.
g.
,
breast
cancers
)
,
questioning
the
interchangeability
of
these
analyses
as
pan-cancer
predictive
tests
.
Hence
,
MMR/MSI
assays
have
been
originally
developed
by
geneticists
to
identify
Lynch
syndrome
families
and
not
for
choosing
the
optimal
drug
to
treat
acquired
tumors
.
Given
the
wide
heterogeneity
in
the
repertoire
of
molecular
alterations
in
immune-related
genes
across
different
tumor
types
(
<figure>
Figure
2
</figure>
)
,
novel
,
efficient
,
reproducible
,
and
reliable
techniques
coupled
with
tumor-specific
methods
and
guidelines
are
needed
.
</p>
<p>
Another
important
issue
related
to
the
patient
’s
selection
for
immunotherapy
is
represented
by
the
PD-L1
analysis
by
IHC
.
In
this
respect
,
important
harmonization
efforts
have
been
made
to
standardize
both
the
preanalytical
and
interpretative
phases
of
PD-L1
testing
,
at
least
in
non-small
cell
lung
cancer
(
NSCLC
)
.
The
reproducibility
of
PD-L1
testing
in
real-life
clinical
practice
evaluated
both
for
“
closed
”
and
“
open
”
platforms
,
showed
overlapping
results
,
particularly
when
the
22C3
antibody
clone
was
used
.
On
the
other
hand
,
there
are
several
clues
to
advise
that
the
same
interpretation
guidelines
should
not
be
translated
across
different
tumor
types
.
For
example
,
the
tumor
proportion
score
(
TPS
)
works
perfectly
for
lung
cancer
but
not
for
head
and
neck
cancer
,
where
the
combined
positive
score
(
CPS
)
is
more
reliable
.
These
two
scoring
systems
are
rather
different
,
given
that
the
former
considers
only
the
percentage
of
PD-L1-positive
neoplastic
cells
,
while
the
latter
combines
all
PD-L1-positive
cells
(
i.
e.
,
tumor
cells
,
lymphocytes
,
and
macrophages
)
into
the
following
formula
.
</p>
<p>
Although
the
CPS
can
theoretically
exceed
the
value
of
100
,
the
maximum
score
is
defined
as
100
.
Fascinating
perspectives
are
being
provided
by
experimental
models
addressing
the
plasticity
of
the
cellular
inflammatory
response
of
the
host
.
There
are
several
lines
of
evidence
to
suggest
that
the
myeloid-derived
cell
function
is
a
finely
tuned
mechanism
to
control
tumor
growth
.
Specifically
,
both
in
local
and
hematopoietic
niches
,
its
crosstalk
with
the
tumor
cells
as
well
as
with
exogenous
stimuli
,
is
based
on
the
microbiota
repertoire
.
