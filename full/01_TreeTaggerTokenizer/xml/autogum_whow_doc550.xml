Work
with
Animals
</head>
<p>
If
you
have
a
job
,
lifestyle
or
role
that
requires
you
to
work
with
animals
,
you
'll
soon
learn
that
you
need
to
be
gentle
,
careful
and
ready
to
be
immersed
in
how
animals
view
the
world
.
This
can
be
hard
work
at
times
,
but
can
also
be
very
rewarding
when
you
finally
find
out
how
to
train
and
work
with
animals
.
It
can
be
a
lifetime
of
learning
but
the
journey
has
to
begin
somewhere
.

Steps
</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Know
that
not
all
animals
will
like
you
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Not
every
animal
likes
to
be
pet
,
cuddled
,
held
,
or
gotten
too
close
to
.
Some
are
less
sociable
than
others
,
and
like
to
be
left
alone
more
than
played
with
.

Sometimes
it
's
best
just
to
get
it
another
companion
of
its
own
kind
as
its
company-
some
humans
do
n't
like
animals
,
and
some
animals
do
n't
like
humans
.

Learn
as
much
as
you
can
about
the
behaviour
in
animals
.
If
you
're
around
a
specific
animal
a
lot
do
extra
research
on
it
to
improve
you
're
performance
with
it
.
Being
able
to
read
the
animal
's
body
signals
will
enable
you
to
know
when
it
's
safe
to
stay
near
,
and
when
it
's
safer
to
go
away
and
let
the
animal
recover
from
its
encounter
with
you
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Use
the
Internet
to
research
animal
behaviour
.
</item>
<item>
Use
books
and
movies
from
your
local
library
.
</item>
<item>
Watch
nature
shows
and
documentaries
.
</item>
<item>
Spend
time
with
animals
,
observing
their
reactions
,
and
behavior
.
</item>
<item>
Talk
to
someone
that
has
plenty
of
experience
working
with
animals
,
like
veterinarians
or
animal
patrolmen
;
they
might
be
able
to
open
up
your
eyes
on
how
animals
see
the
world
and
help
you
translate
what
animals
do
into
what
they
feel
.

<item>
Approach
animals
with
care
.
The
main
thing
to
be
aware
of
,
is
that
when
you
go
up
to
the
animal
,
always
take
it
easy
and
avoid
scaring
it
.
This
includes
walking
or
approaching
the
animal
slowly
and
possibly
crouching
down
to
near
the
animal
's
level
,
if
this
is
relevant
or
appropriate
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
If
the
animal
reacts
by
moving
away
,
it
may
be
scared
or
getting
ready
to
attack
if
you
go
any
further
.
Very
slowly
back
away
and
give
it
time
to
recover
.

Allow
animals
to
get
a
good
sense
of
you
and
your
intentions
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Once
you
are
near
the
animal
,
hold
your
hand
out
to
allow
it
to
get
your
sent
.
This
applies
for
most
animals
that
are
able
to
pick
up
scents
;
from
dogs
and
cats
to
tigers
and
wolves
.
</item>
<item>
Talk
to
them
in
a
soft
light
toned
voice
to
pose
as
an
ally
;
a
loud
voice
will
pose
as
a
threat
to
them
.
</item>
<item>
It
is
also
important
that
you
are
feeling
secure
and
confident
around
the
animal
,
as
many
animals
can
sense
fear
or
uncertainty
and
will
assume
that
you
are
either
inferior
or
prey
as
a
result
of
this
.
