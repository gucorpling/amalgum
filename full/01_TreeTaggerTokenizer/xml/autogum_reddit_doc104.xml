Honestly
,
academics
and
alumni
are
really
not
going
to
be
much
different
at
WashU
vs.
Notre
Dame
.
They
're
pretty
on
par
in
both
of
those
areas
.
I
think
the
two
main
differentiators
you
need
to
consider
are
going
to
be
1
.
South
Bend
vs.
St.
Louis
and
2
.
the
general
vibe
culture
of
the
respective
student
bodies
.
</p>
<p>
If
you
've
seen
my
comments
in
other
threads
,
I
generally
am
pretty
upfront
about
the
fact
that
I
really
dislike
living
in
St.
Louis
.
That
being
said
...
I
think
I
would
hate
South
Bend
much
more
.
I
do
n't
know
if
you
've
had
the
chance
to
visit
,
or
if
you
would
even
have
time
to
do
that
at
this
point
,
but
keep
in
mind
that
South
Bend
is
a
verrry
tiny
(
and
relatively
dangerous
)
city
with
not
much
at
all
going
on
apart
from
Notre
Dame
.
That
will
restrict
your
options
in
terms
of
social
life
general
off
-campus
activities
quite
a
bit
.
Location
is
absolutely
an
important
factor
you
should
keep
in
mind
.
I
unfortunately
really
undervalued
how
much
location
can
impact
college
experience
-
-
it
really
makes
a
massive
difference
in
how
at
home
you
'll
feel
,
and
your
sense
of
contentment
comfort
on
campus
.
But
of
course
it
's
very
dependent
on
your
personal
preferences
.
Notre
Dame
will
have
crazier
frat
parties
and
tailgates
to
compensate
for
what
I
assume
is
very
short
supply
of
bars
and
clubs
.
Maybe
that
's
something
you
'd
enjoy
.
(
washu
on
the
other
hand
has
relatively
tame
frat
parties
,
and
I
have
never
once
seen
anybody
tailgating
here
ha
)
</p>
<p>
Notre
Dame
has
a
very
distinct
student
culture
that
is
definitely
not
for
everyone
.
It
's
pretty
religious
and
conservative
.
I
think
if
you
are
not
either
of
those
things
,
you
might
feel
a
little
out
of
place
.
I
do
know
a
couple
people
from
my
hometown
who
specifically
sought
ND
out
because
they
really
valued
having
Catholicism
incorporated
into
so
many
aspects
of
campus
life
and
the
opportunity
to
meet
people
from
similar
backgrounds
.
WashU
is
very
much
the
opposite
-
-
the
dominant
religion
on
campus
is
Judaism
,
but
people
tend
live
more
secular
lifestyles
;
religion
is
n't
something
that
enters
the
conversation
outside
of
actual
Jewish
events
,
in
my
experience
.
The
student
body
attitude
is
decidedly
more
liberal
left
-leaning
,
like
most
of
the
other
T20
schools
.
</p>
<p>
I
think
ND
is
more
suited
to
kind
of
a
unique
niche
of
student
who
prefers
the
conservative
environment
and
the
lifestyle
of
a
quieter
,
more
isolated
town
.
If
you
're
really
into
sports
and
want
that
to
be
a
part
of
your
college
experience
,
ND
definitely
has
the
edge
there
.
JI
'd
recommend
you
spend
time
thinking
about
where
you
think
you
'd
be
the
happiest
without
worrying
too
much
about
whatever
minor
differences
there
are
between
the
engineering
schools
.
