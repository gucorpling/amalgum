Measures
of
Family
Firm
</head>
<p>
A
family
firm
refers
to
an
enterprise
in
which
the
family
can
exert
a
substantial
influence
by
virtue
of
the
ownership
structure
and/or
seats
on
the
managerial/supervisory
board
.
Following
prior
research
,
we
defined
a
founding
family
’s
influence
,
<hi rend="italic">
FAM
</hi>
,
taking
a
value
of
one
if
family
members
,
by
blood
or
marriage
,
are
chief
executive
officers
,
directors
,
or
block
holders
;
otherwise
,
<hi rend="italic">
FAM
</hi>
took
a
value
of
zero
.
In
addition
,
the
continuous
variable
,
<hi rend="italic">
FAMOWN
</hi>
,
is
defined
as
the
fractional
equity
ownership
of
the
family
.

Measures
of
Political
Connections
</head>
<p>
To
capture
the
political
influence
of
government
officials
,
we
followed
Faccio
et
al.
and
Fan
et
al.
and
defined
political
connections
as
an
indicator
variable
,
PC
,
which
takes
the
value
of
one
if
a
firm
’s
largest
shareholders
,
senior
officers
,
or
board
members
currently
satisfy
any
one
of
the
criteria
of
political
connection
as
follows
:
(
1
)
a
former
official
in
central
or
local
government
;
(
2
)
a
current
or
former
congressperson
or
elected
representative
;
or
(
3
)
a
current
or
former
party
representative
,
such
as
party
chief
,
party
secretary
,
or
party
committee
member
.

Methodology
of
Testing
Model
</head>
<p>
Based
on
Khan
and
Watts
’
,
our
measure
of
conservative
financial
reporting
was
firm-year-specific
asymmetric
timeliness
score
.
First
,
we
established
Basu
’s
asymmetric
timeliness
measure
,
which
regresses
earnings
on
return
and
allows
the
return
coefficient
to
vary
with
the
sign
of
the
return
.
(

)
where
,
for
firm
<hi rend="italic">
i
</hi>
and
period
<hi rend="italic">
t
</hi>
:
<hi rend="italic">
NI
</hi>
is
the
net
income
before
extraordinary
items
are
deflated
by
the
market
value
of
the
equity
at
the
beginning
of
the
period
;
<hi rend="italic">
RET
</hi>
is
the
buy-and-hold
return
over
the
fiscal
year
;
and
<hi rend="italic">
NEG
</hi>
is
an
indicator
variable
coded
to
one
when
<hi rend="italic">
RET
</hi>
is
negative
,
and
zero
otherwise
.
In
Equation
(
1
)
,
<hi rend="italic">
β
</hi>
1
captures
the
timeliness
of
earnings
with
respect
to
positive
returns
,
and
<hi rend="italic">
β
</hi>
1
+
<hi rend="italic">
β
</hi>
3
capture
the
timeliness
of
earnings
with
respect
to
negative
returns
.
If
<hi rend="italic">
β
</hi>
1
+
<hi rend="italic">
β
</hi>
3
&gt;
<hi rend="italic">
β
</hi>
1
(
or
<hi rend="italic">
β
</hi>

&gt;
0
)
,
it
will
be
conservative
reported
earnings
;
that
is
,
a
positive
and
significant
<hi rend="italic">
β
</hi>
3
represents
earnings
that
reflect
bad
news
more
quickly
than
good
news
and
,
hence
,
is
the
measure
of
conservatism
(
i.
e.
,
the
asymmetric
timeliness
coefficient
)
.
</p>
<p>
Second
,
we
developed
an
estimation
of
the
timeliness
of
good
news
(
<hi rend="italic">
G_Score
</hi>
)
and
the
incremental
timeliness
of
bad
news
(
<hi rend="italic">
C_Score
</hi>
)
as
linear
functions
of
size
,
market-to-book
value
,
and
financial
leverage
.
(

)
(

)
where
,
for
firm
<hi rend="italic">
i
</hi>
and
period
<hi rend="italic">
t
</hi>
:
<hi rend="italic">
MVE
</hi>
is
the
natural
logarithm
for
the
market
value
of
the
equity
;
<hi rend="italic">
MTB
</hi>
is
the
market
value
of
the
equity
divided
by
the
book
value
of
the
equity
;
<hi rend="italic">
LEV
</hi>
is
the
total
liabilities
divided
by
total
assets
;
and
the
empirical
estimators
of
<hi rend="italic">
μ

–
<hi rend="italic">
μ
</hi>
4
and
<hi rend="italic">
λ
</hi>
1
<hi rend="italic">
–
λ
</hi>
4
,
are
constant
across
all
firms
,
but
vary
over
time
.
After
estimating
<hi rend="italic">
β1
</hi>
and
<hi rend="italic">
β3
</hi>
in
Equations
(
2
)
and
(
3
)
,
we
placed
them
into
Equation
(
1
)
to
yield
Equation
(
4
)
as
follows
:
(

)
</p>
<p>
Following
Khan
and
Watts
,
we
included
an
additional
term
in
the
last
parenthesis
of
Equation
(
4
)
to
control
for
the
firm
’s
characteristics
separately
(
the
main
effect
)
.
We
first
estimated
Equation
(
4
)
in
annual
cross-sections
to
obtain
the
coefficient
estimates
for
<hi rend="italic">
λ
</hi>
1
<hi rend="italic">
–
λ
</hi>
4
,
which
we
then
applied
to
Equation
(
3
)
to
calculate
the
<hi rend="italic">
C_Score
</hi>
:
a
higher
<hi rend="italic">
C_Score
</hi>
represents
a
higher
degree
of
conservatism
.
</p>
<p>
To
test
the
hypothesis
,
we
applied
the
firm-specific
timeliness
measure
of
conservatism
in
the
following
regression
:
(

where
,
for
firm
<hi rend="italic">
i
</hi>
and
period
<hi rend="italic">

<hi rend="italic">
C_Score

</hi>
is
the
political
connections
indicator
;
and
<hi rend="italic">
CONTROLS
</hi>
is
a
vector
of
control
variables
.
This
vector
includes
:
<hi rend="italic">

;
<hi rend="italic">

,
the
