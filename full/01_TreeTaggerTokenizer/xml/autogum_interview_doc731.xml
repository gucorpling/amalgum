from
1945
to
1955
;
and
the
Cold
War
in
the
second
half
of
the
20th
century
all
undermined
a
wonderful
and
rich
heritage
of
our
country
that
thrived
from
1900
thru
1925
and
beyond
.
There
were
1200
officeholders
in
America
who
were
registered
and
public
candidates
as
Socialists
in
America
around
1920
.
Close
to
one
million
Americans
voted
for
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene%20Debs">
Eugene
Debs
</ref>
in
1912
and
1920
,
gaining
9
%
and
11
%
of
the
popular
vote
.
Remember
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teddy%20Roosevelt">
Teddy
Roosevelt
</ref>
ran
in
1912
as
a
third
party
candidate
and
garnered
the
second
highest
vote
totals
(
20
%
)
and
still
Gene
Debs
also
gained
around
11
%
.
Can
you
imagine
if
Teddy
Roosevelt
had
not
been
a
candidate
in
that
election
!
Secondly
,
the
Socialists
were
against

,
plus
there
was
a
split
in
the
party
with
over
half
going
to
Communism
,
thus
both
suffering
the
consequences
of
Woodrow
Wilson
's

and

accusing

being

President
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow%20Wilson">

and
his
administration
so
much
that
America
entered
what
became
known
as
the
&quot;
Red
Scare
&quot;
period
.
In
1919
,
U.S.
Attorney
General
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander%20Mitchell%20Palmer">
Alexander
Mitchell
Palmer
</ref>
,
at
the
order
of
President
Wilson
,
arrested
over
10,000
suspected
communists
and
anarchists
.
These
people
were
charged
with
&quot;
advocating
force
,
violence
and
unlawful
means
to
overthrow
the
Government
.
&quot;
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.%20Edgar%20Hoover">
J.
Edgar
Hoover
</ref>
was
part
of
the
effort
at
that
time
.
Large
number
of
these
&quot;
suspects
&quot;
were
held
without
trial
for
a
long
time
,
and
some
were
expelled
to
Russia
.
The
Socialist
party
took
a
terrible
hit
and
its
membership
suffered
a
severe
drop
due
to
the
governmental
intimidation
and
false
claims
against
it
.
</p>
<p>
One
of
my
jobs
is
to
re-educate
America
about
this
rich
and
radical
heritage
,
and
how
its
vision
is
positive
and
beneficial
to
the
country
.
My
other
function
will
be
to
point
out
how
capitalism
is
failing
America
and
that
it
is
acceptable
to
think
in
terms
of
radical
change
and
alternative
economic
systems
that
will
preserve
and
insure
our
country
's
survival
and
bring
more
fairness
and
justice
to
more
Americans
and
to
the
world
.
