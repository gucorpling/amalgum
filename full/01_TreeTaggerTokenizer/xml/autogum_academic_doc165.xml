Introduction
</head>
<p>
Phosphorus
(
P
)
and
potassium
(
K
)
are
the
most
significant
macronutrients
in
the
soil
ecosystem
after
nitrogen
(
N
)
,
which
involves
various
processes
,
i.
e.
,
energy
formation
,
nucleic
acid
synthesis
,
photosynthesis
,
glycolysis
,
respiration
,
enzymes
activation
and
redox
reactions
.
Nutrient
management
is
important
for
sustainable
crop
production
.
P-
and
K-efficient
cultivars
are
important
options
in
an
agro-ecosystem
.
Uptake
efficiencies
of
nutrients
such
as
P
and
K
are
related
to
the
abilities
of
plants
to
produce
high
yields
in
low-nutrient
conditions
.
Deficiency
in
P
is
mainly
attributed
to
its
immobilization
in
soil
.
Low
K
content
is
highly
dependent
on
soil
composition
,
especially
on
its
fixation
to
clay
particles
,
leading
to
deficiency
in
plant
uptake
.
Immobilized
P
can
be
re-mobilized
,
and
non-exchangeable
K
can
also
become
available
in
soil
solution
under
biochemical
processes
.
However
,
they
could
be
strongly
dependent
on
soil
chemistry
Exploitation
of
legumes
is
an
essential
approach
for
sustainable
agriculture
as
it
can
increase
nutrient
cycling
and
promote
soil
fertility
This
approach
can
also
potentially
improve
P
and
K
availability
in
the
soil
,
which
is
beneficial
for
plant
uptake
and
soil
microorganisms
.
Root
growth
and
root
morphological
mechanisms
of
leguminous
plants
are
the
principal
factors
that
usually
require
greater
P
and
K
levels
in
the
soil
,
which
is
also
related
to
plant
P
and
K
uptake
.
Several
green
manure
crops
such
as
white
lupin
(
<hi rend="italic">
Lupines
albas
</hi>
L.
)
,
chickpea
(
<hi rend="italic">
Cicer
arietinum
</hi>
L.
)
,
field
pea
(
<hi rend="italic">
Pisum
sativum
</hi>
L
)
,
and
faba
bean
(
<hi rend="italic">
Vicia
faba
</hi>
)
,
are
able
to
mobilize
soil
P
through
a
variety
of
root
mechanisms
.

<p>
Recent
studies
have
shown
that
legumes
can
regulate
soil
enzymatic
activities
more
than
mineral
fertilizers
.
According
to
other
researchers
,
legumes
such
as
chickpeas
and
cowpeas
increase
phosphatase
enzyme
activities
more
than
non-legumes
.
Soil
enzymes
play
important
roles
in
catalyzing
reactions
and
are
associated
,
directly
or
indirectly
,
with
nutrient
availability
and
organic
matter
decomposition
.
The
specific
activity
of
an
enzyme
is
not
considered
useful
in
the
complete
nutrient
cycle
of
soil
because
it
has
a
particular
substrate
.
Some
hydrolytic
enzymes
(
e.
g.
,
Î²-glucosidase
,
N-acetyl-glucosaminidase
,
Leucine-aminopeptidase
,
and
phosphatase
)
,
which
are
related
to
C
,
N
,
and
P
cycles
,
are
more
responsible
for
the
soil
properties
(
pH
and
soil
organic
matter
)
than
other
variables
.
Such
enzymes
could
be
valuable
as
early
indicators
of
biological
soil
modification
.

<p>
Leguminous
plants
,
especially
broad
bean
(
<hi rend="italic">
V.
faba
</hi>
)
,
Chinese
milk
vetch
(
<hi rend="italic">
Astragalus
sinicus
</hi>
L.
)
,
clover
(
<hi rend="italic">
Trifolium
repens
</hi>
L.
)
,
and
hairy
vetch
(
<hi rend="italic">
V.
villosa
</hi>
L.
)
,
have
been
used
in
crop
rotation
systems
worldwide
.
Although
,
P
and
K
uptake
efficiencies
have
been
reported
to
be
different
in
various
legumes
crops
,
and
the
relative
knowledge
and
profound
information
about
leguminous
green
manures
in
South
China
are
still
unclear
.
Moreover
,
less
information
exists
in
the
literature
about
the
changes
in
enzymatic
activities
in
response
to
cultivation
of
different
legume
species
in
the
field
.
Green
manuring
has
become
a
popular
practice
in
South
China
to
improve
soil
fertility
and
rice
yields
at
present
.
The
most
popular
winter
green
manure
is
milk
vetch
,
which
has
traditionally
been
used
for
several
thousands
of
years
,
and
most
attention
has
focused
on
N
utilization
.
</p>
<p>
The
main
objectives
of
this
study
were
to
(
1
)
evaluate
P
and
K
uptake
capabilities
in
various
winter
leguminous
green
manure
species
in
South
China
and
(

)
investigate
their
ability
to
affect
soil
enzyme
activity
by
interacting
with
soil
properties
.
