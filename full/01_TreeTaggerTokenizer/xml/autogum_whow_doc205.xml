Talk
with
your
child
's
teacher
.
Many
schools
have
a
great
way
of
allowing
parent
connection
with
the
teacher
.
The
teacher
may
send
e-mails
regarding
your
child
's
troubles
with
homework
.
Then
you
can
try
to
find
a
time
to
meet
up
with
their
teacher
to
address
the
issue
.
You
can
also
arrange
with
your
child
's
teacher
a
tutoring
schedule
or
having
an
aide
come
to
the
house
to
tutor
your
child
.
