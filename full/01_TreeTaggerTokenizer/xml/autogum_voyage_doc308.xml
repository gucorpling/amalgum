<p>
You
can
get
to
Iringa
by
bus
from
Dar
,
Dodoma
,
and
Mbeya
.
There
are
many
bus
companies
but
some
are
dangerous
.
The
best
are
Sumry
,
Sutco
,
and
Hood
.
</p>
<p>
The
road
from
Dar
is
being
upgraded
into
a
very
decent
road
so
once
the
roadworks
have
gone
the
ride
will
be
very
good
.
The
journey
passes
through
beautiful
scenery
and
a
national
park
.

Get

<p>
Iringa
is
a
great
stop-over
point
on
the
way
down
through
the
Southern
Highlands
or
if
you
are
off
to
visit
<ref target="Malawi">
Malawi
</ref>
and
<ref target="Zambia">
Zambia
</ref>
.
If
you
are
going
back
the
other
way
towards
<ref target="Dar%20es-Salaam">
Dar
es-Salaam
</ref>
it
is
definitely
a
much
nicer
place
to
stop
than
<ref target="Morogoro">
Morogoro
</ref>
.
It
would
be
all
too
easy
to
just
see
Iringa
as
a
blur
as
you
hurtle
past
in
a
Sutco
coach
sipping
your
complimentary
soda
,
but
is
definitely
worth
breaking
your
journey
for
a
day
or
so
to
take
in
the
sights
,
sounds
,
and
smells
of
this
bustling
little
town
.
It
is
also
the
gateway
to
the
jewel
in
the
crown
of
Tanzania
's
game
parks
:
Ruaha
.

You
will
also

bothering
you
outside
of
Hasty
Tasty
–
They
are
selling
cards
,
carved
wood
items
,
and
musical
instruments
.
One
of
them
has
a
nasty
habit
of
playing
his
terrible
violin-type
device
.
Shouting
<hi rend="italic">
Inatosha

(
<hi rend="italic">
that
's

</hi>
)
stops
him
for
a
few
minutes
and
eases
the
headache
but
it
does
make
sitting

a

annoying

The
workshop
employs
deaf
people
who

paper
products
(
cards
,
albums
,
etc.
)
,
beaded
bits
and
bobs
(

their
cool
mud
kiln
)
,
cushions
,
vitenge
patchwork
blankets
,
lamps
and
lamp
shades
,
and
more
recently
have
employed
disabled
folks
who
are
weaving
rugs
,
hammocks
,
and
various
other
interesting
textiles
.
Their
projects
include
micro
solar
panels
for
lighting
,
radios
and
charging
phones
,
very
useful
if
you
are
camping
,
and
a
physiotherapy
unit
for
disabled
children
.
You
can
help
the
physiotherapy
unit
by
having
a
fantastic
hour
long
massage
for
Tsh
25,000
from
their
bubbly
physio
Beatrice
and
you
can
lie
there
and
relax
in
your
pampering
knowing
the
money
you
are
paying
is
going
to
allow
more
disabled
children
to
get
treated
for
free
!
Along
with
the
obvious
benefits
of
providing
employment
to
people
that
Tanzanian
society
has
rejected
,
the
products
are
excellent
and
make
great
presents
!
Haruna
,
a
hilarious
character
,
will
be
happy
to
give
you
a
guided
tour
,
and
they
have
a
café
selling
proper
coffee
and
homemade
cakes
,
ice
cream
and
sorbets
if
that
tickles
your
fancy
;
Their
panini
bacon
and
avocado
sandwiches
and
the
carrot
cake
draw
expat
volunteers
from
all
over
the
south
of
Tanzania
who
also
stock
up
on
their
reading
materials
at
the
book
exchange
in
the
cafe
.
Also
they
are
the
center
for
a
great
project
to
bring
safe
drinking
water
to
rural
villages
using
the
sun
,
(
SODIS

so
drop
off
any
empty
1½-liter
drinking
water
bottles
you
may
have
and
they
can
make
use
of
them
.

There
are
dozens
of
shops
selling
vitenge
and
kanga
.
The
best
are
located
around
the
Dala
Dala
stand
near
the
market
and
down
“
Indian
”
street
.
Expect
to
pay
TSh
2,500
for
kanga
and
TSh
4,000
for
vitenge
.
Real
Wax
vitenge
comes
in
at
about
TSh
10,000
if
you
are
a
purist
.
Always
demand
a
punguza
for
multiple
purchases
though
they
are
tough
negotiators
but
do
n't
worry
too
much
about
going
as
low
as
you
can
as
these
guys
are
the
middle
men
not
the
producers
whatever
they
may
claim
!

<p>
The
duka
opposite
the
Posta
selling
batiques
,
carvings
,
paintings
and
painted
tins
have
now
all
been
moved
on
(
they
were
illegally
there
in
the
first
place
)
.
You
can
now
find
them
scattered
about
town
.
</p>
<p>
In
the
corner
of
the
main
market
you
’ll
find
the
basket
market
-
several
stalls
selling
straw
mats
,
baskets
,
kitchen
bits
and
pieces
.
The
hand
woven
baskets
are
a
signature
of
Iringa
and
well
worth
getting
for
keeping
your
mchele
and
maharage
in
.
You
will
pay
Tsh
10,000
for
four
medium
sized
baskets
–
an
absolute
bargain
for
the
Iringa
style
they
will
bring
to
your
bare
,
soulless
volunteer
accommodation
.
</p>
<p>
For
postcards
try
the
post
office
for
the
usual
Tanzanian
variety
,
or
try
Neema
Crafts
.
They
have
their
own
postcards
,
cheaper
than
the
post
office
and
much
more
local
.
They
sell
stamps
there
as
well
and
have
a
post
box
outside
.
</p>
<p>
For
food
retail
therapy
,
take
a
walk
to
Premji
’s
and/or
Raju
’s
on
“
Indian
”
street
,
two
mini-supermarkets
heavily
stocked
with
wazungu
luxuries
;
wine
,
Marmite
,
Coco
Pops
,
olives
,
etc.
Not
what
you
would
describe
as
cheap
but
when
you
are
desperately
in
need
of
a
yeast
extract
based
hit
,
beggars
ca
n’t
be
choosers
.
(
also
Neema
Crafts
does
take
away
giant
chocolate
chip
cookies
and
fudge
,
which
are
great
when
you
need
a
lift
)
.

<p>
The
Consollata
Fathers
and
Sisters
live
on
two
sites
up
in
the
Gangilonga
suburb
.
The
fathers
sell
their
own
cheese
(
well
,
that
of
their
cows
...
)
including
mozzarella
(
amazing
)
,
the
sisters
sell
excellent
homemade
pasta
,
great
pasta
sauce
and
various
pork
products
which
are
from
pigs
they
have
raised
themselves
.
