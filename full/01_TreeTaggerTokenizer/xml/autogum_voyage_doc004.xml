Plympton
is
a
small
suburb
.
It
is
so
small
that
many
people
fear
blinking
as
they
are
driving
down
route
58
because
they
might
miss
the
town
.
Deborah
Sampson
,
a
woman
who
dressed
as
a
man
and
fought
in
the
Revolutionary
War
,
was
born
in
Plympton
,
but
the
only
other
exciting
news
to
come
from
the
town
is
the
addition
of
their
first
traffic
light
in
2008
.
Overall
,
Plympton
is
a
great
place
to
raise
a
family
because
of
their
schooling
(
Silver
Lake
School
District
)
and
the
small
population
.
