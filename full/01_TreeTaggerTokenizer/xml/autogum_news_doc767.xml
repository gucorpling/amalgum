At
the
start
of
a
week-long
series
of
strips
,
a
dog
character
named
&quot;
Ralph
&quot;
finds
out
that
part
of
chemist
and
food
storage
technician

'
s
remains
was
buried
in
a
Pringles
can
,
upon
his
last
wishes
.
Baur
's
best
known
innovation
,
among
multiple
,
was
the
patented
can
and
packing
method
for
the
Pringles
potato
chip
.
The
character
theorizes
what
other
remains
might
be
interred
in
their
food
packaging
.
Eventually
,
the
dog
states
that
&quot;
when
they
say
there
's
a
little
bit
of
Juan
Valdez
in
every
can
,
maybe
they
're
not
kidding
.

This
play
on
an
old
advertising
slogan
refers
to
fictional
character

Juan
Valdez

,
created
by
the
Federación
Nacional
.

<p>
In
a
statement
Peters
says
:
</p>
I
had
no
more
thought
to
insult
Colombia
and
Juan
Valdez
than
I
did
Pringles
,
Betty
Crocker
,
Col.
Sanders
,
Dr.
Pepper
and
Bartles
&amp;
Jaymes
.
The
cartoon
is
meant
to
be
read
along
with
the
rest
of
the
week
as
a
series
of
which
the
theme
is
based
on
the
fact
that
the
inventor
of
the
Pringles
can
had
his
ashes
buried
in
one
.
<p>
I
thought
this
was
a
humorous
subject
and
all
of
my
Mother
Goose
&amp;
Grimm
cartoons
are
meant
to
make
people
laugh
.
I
truly
intended
no
insult
.

In
a
counter-suit
,
Britt
presented
an
affidavit
from
a
Costa
Rican
man
named
&quot;
Juan
Valdez
&quot;
,
acknowledging
that
he
drinks
Costa
Rican
coffee
,
and
that
the
name
is
too
generic
to
be
exclusive
.
A
variety
of
legal
challenges
and
charges
from
both
sides
were
eventually
dropped
.
The
phrase
was
actually
first
used
in
a
1999
speech
by
Jaime
