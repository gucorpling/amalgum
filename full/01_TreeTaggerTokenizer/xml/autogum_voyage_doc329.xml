The

a
good
option

it

,
the
latter
costing

for
the
entrance
ticket
is
now
a
steep
¥

for

(
foreign

are
also
asked
a
passport
copy
)
.
</p>
<p>
The

is
¥50/90
one-way/return
.
</p>

Get
around
</head>
<p>
Three
stages
:
the
entrance
gate
just
outside
of
Riwa
,
where
you
buy
the
tickets
and
get
on
the
mandatory
bus
to
Yading
village
(
亚丁村）after
around
50
minutes
and
then
in
another
10
minutes
to
the
base
at
Longtongba
(
龙同坝
)
.
From
the
base
at
Longtongba
it
’s
a
short
scenic
walk
before
you
reach
the
Chonggu
(
沖古
)
temple
and
meadow
,
as
well
as
the
service
centre
from
where
you
can
catch
a
minibus
that
serves
about
10
stops
before
turning
at
Luorong
(
洛绒
)
pasture
and
service
centre
.
</p>
<p>
From
late
November
(
until
late
March
?
)
the
bus
schedule
is
reduced
with
the
first
one
at
08:30
and
the
last
bus
back
around
17:20
,
thus
likely
you
will
need
to
go
at
least
one-way
with
the
minibus
,
if
you
wanted
to
hike
to
the
two
popular
lakes
in
one
day
.

Hiking
and
camping
in
this
beautiful
surroundings
is
possible
year-round
,
but
not
recommended
from
December
to
April
due
to
snow
fall
and
generally
more
dull
coloration
.
</p>
<p>
The
popular
option
is
hiking
up
to
Five-color
Lake
and
Milk
Lake
,
the
10-km
return
route
is
well
marked
and
mostly
steps
leading
up
about
400-m
gain
.
To
the
local
Tibetans
,
these
lakes
are
holy
and
dipping
in
or
even
walking
on
the
frozen
parts
is
frowned
upon
.
</p>
<p>
Another
route
inside
the
park
is
a
short
but
less
crowded
visit
to
Pearl
Lake
in
combination
with
Chonggu
Grasslands
on
the
way
back
(
less
than
3
km
)
.
</p>
<p>
If
you
know
what
you
are
doing
,
the
hike
beyond
these
lakes
can
be
done
with
proper
camping
equipment
and
food
.
Leave
no
trace
is
best
practice
here
as
well
,
although
the
mass
tourism
unfortunately
seems
to
lack
the
understanding
that
it
applies
to
its
customers
.
</p>
<head>
Buy
</head>
<p>
There
is
an
ATM
at
the
park
entrance
as
well
as
left
luggage
service
for
a
fee
.
Food
supplies
can
be
found
in
Riwa
and
in
limited
selection
also
in
Yading
village
.
</p>
<head>
Lodging
</head>
<p>
Plenty
of
options
are
available
in
both
Riwa
and
also
Yading
village
.
The
former
boasts
a
number
of
hotels
and
also
a
youth
hostel
,
the
latter
has
many
options
that
can
easily
be
found
walking
from
park
bus
stop
number
2
.

Camping
</head>
<p>
Despite
being
legal
there
is
not
much
official
information
on
camping
in
the
designated
campgrounds
,
which
are
a
day
’s
hike
away
from
the
base
at
Longtongba
龙同坝。
</p>
<head>
Backcountry
</head>
<p>
Depending
on
the
willingness
of
local
herdsman
to
accept
guests
or
allow
camping
without
official
designation
.
</p>
<head>
Stay
safe
</head>
<p>
Be
aware
of
AMS
<ref target="altitude%20sickness">
altitude
sickness
</ref>
,
as
the
park
is
all
above
4,000
m.
The
hike
on
the
flat
boardwalks
should
be
no
problem
of
you
are
accustomed
to
the
altitude
above
3,000
m
,
but
hiking
uphill
still
should
be
taken
on
carefully
,
as
exercise
in
the
high
altitude
puts
extra
stress
on
your
system
.
