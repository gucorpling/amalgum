Today
we
tabled
new
legislation
to
legalise
,
strictly
regulate
,
and
restrict
access
to
cannabis
.
Our
goal
:
keep
it
out
of
the
hands
of
youth
,
and
profits
out
of
the
hands
of
criminals
.

‍Ajd
nous
avons
déposé
un
nouveau
projet
de
loi
pour
légaliser
le
cannabis
,
le
réglementer
de
manière
stricte
et
en
restreindre
l'accès
.
Notre
objectif
:
garder
le
cannabis
hors
de
la
portée
des
jeunes
,
&amp;
les
profits
hors
des
mains
des
criminels
.
The
Canadian
government
,
via
their
official
website
,
explained
cannabis
is
available
illegally
,
and
their
measures
to
stop
it
did
not
work
.
Criminal
organisations
are
making
money
selling
cannabis
.
Under-aged
people
can
obtain
the
drug
easily
;
they
said
,
&quot;
it
is
easier
for
our
kids
to
buy
cannabis
than
cigarettes
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
bill
allows
provinces
and
territories
to
set
the
age
limit
above
eighteen
.
In
order
to
prevent
criminal
gangs
from
making
a
profit
,
selling
the
drug
needs
a
license
permitting
its
sale
.
Adults
can
purchase
the
drug
online
from
a
licensed
producer
if
a
retail
shop
is
not
available
in
the
province
.
</p>
<p>
Adults
can
carry
up
to
30
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gram">
g
</ref>
(
slightly
over
an
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ounce">
ounce
</ref>
)
of
cannabis
and
grow
at
most
four
cannabis
plants
at
home
,
for
personal
use
.
The
plants
should
be
no
taller
than
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/metre">
metre
</ref>
,
the
bill
proposed
.
Selling
cannabis
to
minors
would
be
a
specific
criminal
offence
.
</p>
<p>
The
legislation
requires
parliamentary
approval
and
royal
assent
.
If
passed
,
the
bill
would
be
under
effect
by
July
2018
,
the
government
said
.
Health
and
safety
experts
and
law
enforcement
were
consulted
before
proposing
the
legislation
.
Except
for
medical
purposes
,
possession
of
the
drug
remains
illegal
until
the
bill
is
passed
.
Regardless
of
the
status
of
the
bill
,
import
and
export
of
the
drug
would
be
illegal
.
</p>
<p>
Previously
when
the
government
increased
the
taxes
on
cigarettes
to
discourage
citizens
from
smoking
,
a
black
market
for
cigarettes
developed
.
</p>
<p>
Along
with
legalising
cannabis
,
the
bill
would
also
permit
the
police
officials
to
use
tools
like
oral
fluid
drug
screeners
to
detect
if
drivers
are
under
the
influence
of
the
drug
.
Zero
tolerance
against
drivers
under
influence
of
drugs
is
proposed
.
The
government
would
also
implement
a
public
awareness
campaign
on
the
perils
of
driving
under
the
influence
of
drugs
.
</p>
<p>
The
government
still
working
on
the
restrictions
.
Lawmaker
and
former
police
chief
Bill
Blair
said
,
&quot;
We
do
accept
that
more
important
work
remains
to
be
done
.
&quot;
If
the
bill
is
passed
,
Canada
would
be
the
second
country
to
legalise
cannabis
completely
.
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Uruguay">
Uruguay
</ref>
is
the
first
.
Some
countries
,
such
as
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Germany">
Germany
</ref>
,
allow
medical
use
of
cannabis
,
but
recreational
use
is
prohibited
.
