Tsunami
</head>
<p>
A
<hi rend="bold">
tsunami
</hi>
is
a
giant
wave
hitting
the
coast
.
It
is
usually
caused
by
an
<ref target="earthquake%20safety">
earthquake
</ref>
or
underwater
landslide
(
also
often
caused
by
an
earthquake
)
.
At
sea
the
wave
is
hardly
noticeable
,
but
when
it
is
slowed
down
by
a
shallow
area
,
such
as
near
the
coastline
,
it
becomes
steeper
and
can
rise
to
a
height
of
tens
of
meters
,
with
an
enormous
destructive
force
.

Understand
</head>
<p>
If
the
epicenter
of
an
earthquake
is
under
the
ocean
or
a
large
lake
,
the
earthquake
will
move
huge
amounts
of
water
.
Even
a
small
earthquake
can
also
cause
an
underwater
landslide
,
with
similar
effects
.
The
tsunami
risk
depends
on
in
what
direction
the
water
is
moved
.
In
the
worst
case
,
such
as
when
the
edge
of
a
tectonic
moves
up-
or
downwards
along
the
plate
boundary
,
the
water
will
move
more
or
less
in
a
coordinated
direction
,
causing
a
huge
wave
.
</p>
<p>
Tsunamis
can
strike
the
coast
minutes
or
hours
after
an
earthquake
,
depending
on
how
far
away
from
the
coast
the
epicenter
was
.
Tsunamis
may
travel
as
fast
as
a
commercial
jet
and
are
often
invisible
before
it
is
too
late
,
as
they
grow
in
height
only
as
they
hit
the
shallower
waters
near
the
coast
.
Moreover
,
tsunamis
can
travel
very
far
–
for
instance
the
2004
Indian
Ocean
tsunami
was
caused
by
an
earthquake
north
of
<ref target="Sumatra">
Sumatra
</ref>
but
also
wreaked
havoc
on
the
<ref target="East%20Africa">
east
coast
of
Africa
</ref>
several
hours
later
.
</p>
<p>
There
has
long
been
a
tsunami
warning
center
for
the
Pacific
Ocean
and
after
the
2004
tsunami
one
was
installed
for
the
Indian
Ocean
as
well
.
Although
they
are
not
perfect
and
false
alarms
do
occur
,
their
warnings
should
be
heeded
,
as
the
worst
that
can
happen
in
case
of
a
false
alarm
is
a
ruined
day
,
while
a
tsunami
can
easily
kill
you
and
your
company
.

<p>
Should
you
find
yourself
in
the
unlikely
situation
of
a
tsunami
where
there
is
no
warning
infrastructure
,
there
are
usually
what
are
referred
to
as
&quot;
natural
warning
signs
&quot;
–
nature
itself
telling
you
that
a
tsunami
is
coming
.
If
an
earthquake
occurs
right
on
the
coast
you
may
only
have
a
matter
of
minutes
to
escape
,
<hi rend="bold">
so
do
n't
hesitate
to
evacuate
</hi>
.

<p>
During
a
tsunami
warning
,
follow
the
escape
routes
and
pay
close
attention
to
what
the
authorities
are
saying
as
they
are
usually
(
especially
in
countries
with
a
Pacific
coast
line
)
well
aware
of
the
nature
of
a
tsunami
and
have
refined
their
emergency
plans
with
earlier
tsunamis
.
The
most
important
thing
during
a
tsunami
is
obviously
to
<hi rend="bold">
get
to
high
ground
</hi>
.
However
,
trees
and
even
the
roofs
of
houses
are
a
sub-par
alternative
to
mountains
as
the
enormous
force
of
the
tsunami
may
simply
destroy
the
tree
or
even
the
house
you
are
seeking
shelter
in
(
or
on
the
top
of
)
.
</p>
<p>
Under
no
circumstances
should
you
count
on
your
swimming
ability
against
such
a
powerful
current
!
If
the
absolute
worst
happens
and
you
are
swept
away
by
the
water
,
try
to
hold
onto
a
floating
piece
of
debris
and
await
rescue
.

Do
not
go
to
the
coast
to
sight-see
or
watch
for
a
tsunami
</hi>
!
During
the
tsunami
of
March
2011
triggered
by
the
Tōhoku
earthquake
,
a
25-year-old
man
was
swept
into
the
Pacific
Ocean
near
the
Klamath
River
in
Northern
California
.
The
man
and
some
friends
had
travelled
to
the
shoreline
to
take
photos
of
the
incoming
waves
-
his
friends
survived
,
but
the
man
's
body
was
never
found
.

After
a
tsunami
</head>
<p>
Be
aware
that
there
may
be
more
than
one
tsunami
wave
and
they
can
occur
up
to
24
hours
after
the
initial
wave
,
so
remain
evacuated
until
you
are
told
by
officials
that
it
is
safe
to
return
.
</p>
<p>
When
returning
to
buildings
,
be
aware
that
floodwaters
may
have
caused
serious
damage
to
infrastructure
.
Floodwater
may
also
be
contaminated
with
sewage
.
</p>
<p>
Avoid
sightseeing
and
only
travel
if
necessary
.
If
you
have
made
travel
arrangements
with
an
airline
or
otherwise
,
it
is
best
to
contact
them
for
advice
.
