Mike
Pence

dropped
his
former
opposition
to
needle
exchange
programs
and
on
Tuesday
signed
legislation
passed
by
lawmakers
on
April
29
—
the
last
day
of
the
state
's
legislative
session
—
that
would
allow
local
health
departments
,
municipalities
,
counties
,
or
nonprofit
organizations
to
implement
needle
exchange
programs
.
The
debate
about
the
controversial
programs
came
on
the
heels
of
an
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/HIV">
HIV
</ref>
outbreak
in
Southern
Indiana
.

<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott%20County,%20Indiana">
Scott
County
</ref>
,
Indiana
,
was
the
epicenter
of
the
outbreak
.
The
number
of
new
HIV
positive
cases
in
Scott
County
in
this
outbreak
rose
past
140
.
Governor
Pence
declared
the
outbreak
a
public
health
emergency
on
March
26
,
and
at
the
same
time
approved
a
30-day
needle
exchange
program
.
Pence
since
offered
a
30-day
extension
as
the
number
of
HIV
positive
cases
continued
to
rise
.
</p>
<p>
Needle
exchange
programs
provide
clean
needles
in
exchange
for
dirty
needles
.
The
sharing
of
dirty
needles
has
been
linked
to
the
outbreak
.
Experts
like
Chris
Beyrer
,
president
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International%20AIDS%20Society">
International
AIDS
Society
</ref>
,
support
needle
exchange
programs
.
Beyrer
told
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis%20Star">
Indianapolis
Star
</ref>
,
however
,
that
temporary
measures
,
like
the
one
Pence
implemented
on
March
26
,
do
n't
solve
the
long-term
problem
.
The
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization">
World
Health
Organization
</ref>
and
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention">
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
</ref>
also
recommend
needle
exchange
programs
.
But
experts
say
long-term
needle
exchange
programs
are
needed
.

<p>
The
HIV
epidemic
in
Southern
Indiana
has
been
linked
to
a
drug
problem
in
Scott
County
.
HIV
and
Hepatitis
C
are
blood-borne
viruses
that
spread
by
way
of
bodily
fluids
and
bloodstream
injections
,
especially
when
more
than
one
person
is
using
the
same
needle
.

<p>
Legislators
on
the
committee

for
Senate
Bill
461

,
told
Wikinews
on
April
27
that
he
was
involved
in
conversations
pertaining
to
needle
exchange
programs
.
&quot;
I
am
inclined
to
follow
the
recommendations
of
the
Centers
for
Disease
Control
in
implementing
needle
exchanges
,
&quot;
Washburne
said
in
an
interview
with
Wikinews
.
&quot;
My
vote
against
Senate
Bill
461
was
not
due
to
the
needle
exchanges
,
but
other
issues
involved
in
the
bill
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
House
members
passed
the
bill
80
–
19
,
senators
38
–
11
.
</p>
<p>
After
legislators
passed
the
bill
,
Pence
told
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WISH-TV">
WISH-TV
</ref>
:
&quot;
From
my
perspective
,
the
focus
needs
to
be
on
health
emergencies
.
I
have
throughout
my
career
not
supported
needle
exchanges
as
anti-drug
policies
.
But
with
regard
to
addressing
an
epidemic
,
which
is
what
we
’ve
seen
in
Scott
County
,
which
is
unprecedented
in
any
rural
part
of
the
country
.
I
was
prepared
to
support
that
through
executive
action
.

<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Kentucky">

,
about
35
miles
south
of
Austin
,
was
the
first
Kentucky
municipal
government
to
approve
a
needle
exchange
program
.
The
Louisvile
Metro
Council
voted
22
–
0
to
approve
the
program
on
April
23
.
That
approval
requires
reconsulting
the
council
before
actually
implementing
such
a
program
.
About
195
cities
in
the

adopted
similar
programs

,
the

such

would
make

block

<p>
&quot;
Needle

programs
ought
to
be
used

&quot;
Shaffner
said
.
&quot;
They
have
been
proven
to
work
and
do
not
cause
an
increase
in
drug
use
