<p>
As
mentioned
in
the
previous
paragraph
actuation
of
the
thermal
microactuator
is
caused
due
to
the
electrical
current
,
which
is
converted
to
the
heat
according
to
the
Joule-Lentz
law
:
(

)
where
is
internal
heat
generated
,
is
electrical
resistivity
and
is
the
time
.
</p>
<p>
The
thermal
strain
occurring
in
the
longitudinal
arms
causes
structural
deflection
.
Usually
such
an
actuator
is
affected
by
the
voltage
of
the
magnitude
of
a
few
volts
,
which
causes
an
increase
of
temperature
,
even
above
1200
K.
Nevertheless
,
the
linear
behavior
of
the
microactuator
with
respect
to
electric
,
thermal
and
mechanical
effects
is
preserved
.
Such
a
phenomenon
is
described
by
the
partial
differential
equation
of
electrostatics
,
Equation
(
2
)
;
heat
conduction
,
Equation
(
3
)
;
and
thermoelasticity
,
Equation
(

)
.

where

electric
potential

the
temperature
,
represents
the
displacement
values
,
is
charge
flux

,
is
electric
constant
,
is
thermal
conductivity
,
is
internal
heat
source
,
is
the
linear
expansion
coefficient
,
and
and
are
the
Lamé
constants
,
which
can
be
expressed
as
follows
:
(

)
where
,
and
are
Poisson
’s
ratio
,
Young
’s
modulus
and
the
shear
modulus
,
respectively
.
</p>
<p>
The
structure
considered
here
is
an
electro-thermo-elastic
body
of
the
domain
,
with
the
boundary
area
(
<figure>
Figure

</figure>
)
.
Partial
differential
Equations
(
2
)
–
(
4
)
have
to
be
supplemented
by
boundary
conditions
.
<item>
For
electrostatics
:
</item>
</p>
<p>
(
6
)
where
and
denote
known
electric
potential
and
electric
charge
flux
density
on
the
appropriate
parts
of
the
boundary
and
;
<item>
For
the
heat
conduction
problem
,
boundary
conditions
are
as
follows
:
</item>
</p>
<p>
(
7
)
where
and
are
known
temperature
and
heat
flux
on
the
parts
and
of
the
boundary
.
The
third
type
of
thermal
boundary
condition
(
Robin
condition
)
is
convection
condition
,
for
which
is
an
ambient
temperature
,
whereas
is
a
heat
convection
coefficient
.
<item>
For
the
elasticity
problem
boundary
condition
can
be
defined
as
:
</item>
</p>
<p>
(
8
)
where
and
are
known
displacement
and
mechanical
loads
on
the
parts
and
.
</p>
<p>
Separate
parts
of
the
boundaries
where
electrical
,
thermal
and
mechanical
boundary
conditions
are
specified
define
the
boundary
of
the
body
.
When
no
electrical
,
thermal
or
mechanical
boundary
conditions
are
specified
on
the
particular
parts
of
the
boundary
,
it
corresponds
to
the
charge
flux
density
free
,
heat
flux
free
or
traction-free
conditions
respectively
.
The
relationships
between
separate
parts
of
the
boundary
can
be
written
as
:

</p>
<p>
The
finite
element
method
(
FEM
)
has
been
used
for
solving
the
electro-thermo-mechanical
problem
.
The
partial
differential
equation
after
discretization
and
after
taking
into
account
boundary
conditions
,
can
be
written
as
a
set
of
algebraic
equations
and
given
in
the
following
matrix
form
:
(
10
)
(
11
)
(
12
)
</p>
<p>
The
global
electrical
conductivity
matrix
,
global
thermal
conductivity
matrix
and
global
stiffness
matrix
are
assembled
over
element
matrices
.
,
,
,
,
and
are
the
nodal
vector
of
voltage
,
electric
current
,
temperatures
,
heat
fluxes
,
displacements
and
applied
forces
,
respectively
.
The
problem
is
weakly
coupled
,
so
electrical
,
thermal
and
mechanical
analyses
can
be
solved
separately
.
Coupling
is
carried
out
by
transferring
loads
between
the
analyses
considered
and
by
using
staggered
procedures
.
After
solving
Equation
(
10
)
,
the
nodal
vector
of
heat
generation
due
to
the
current
flow
is
calculated
,
whereas
after
solving
Equation
(
11
)
,
the
nodal
vector
of
forces
due
to
the
thermal
strain
vector
is
calculated
.
</p>
<p>
For
the
buckling
analysis
,
the
finite
element
formulation
takes
the
form
:
(
13
)
</p>
<p>
Linear
buckling
analysis
is
assumed
.
Equation
(
13
)
describes
the
eigenvalue
problem
,
which
is
solved
by
the
Lanczos
method
.
Matrix
is
a
function
of
the
load
increment
;
is
the
eigenvalue
,
whereas
eigenvector
allows
for
the
calculation
of
post-buckling
deformation
mode
.
</p>
<p>
As
mentioned
in
the
first
paragraph
,
one
of
the
criteria
formulated
depends
on
the
contact
force
.
Because
the
movement
of
the
central
shaft
is
almost
perfectly
vertical
,
friction
between
the
end
of
the
central
shaft
and
the
reaction
plane
can
be
neglected
.
The
contact
problem
is
modelled
as
rigid
,
deformable
and
frictionless
.
The
thermal
actuator
is
modelled
as
a
deformable
body
,
whereas
the
rigid
surface
is
placed
with
the
arbitrarily
chosen
initial
gap
between
the
tip
of
the
central
shaft
and
the
rigid
surface
.
For
the
contact
between
a
deformable
body
and
the
rigid
surface
,
the
constraint
responsible
for
maintaining
the
lack
of
penetration
is
implemented
by
transforming
the
degrees
of
freedom
of
the
contact
node
and
applying
a
boundary
condition
to
the
normal
displacement
.

Verification
of
the
Numerical
Model
</head>
<p>
The
optimal
design
of
the
chevron
type
thermal
actuator
requires
building
a
numerical
model
of
the
actuator
,
which
allows
one
to
calculate
the
values
of
criteria
with
the
satisfactory
level
of
accuracy
.
It
is
possible
to
analytically
calculate
electrical
,
thermal
and
structural
quantities
for
the
actuator
with
straight
arms
.
This
subsection
is
dedicated
to
the
verification
of
the
numerical
model
prepared
.
Simplifying
the
verification
procedure
comparison
between
the
numerical
and
analytical
models
only
for
mechanical
quantities
is
shown
.
Since
the
thickness
perpendicular
to
the
midplane
of
the
actuator
(
z-axis
)
and
boundary
conditions
are
constant
,
and
thickness
is
very
small
compared
to
other
dimensions
in
the
model
,
only
two-dimensional
models
will
be
considered
.
