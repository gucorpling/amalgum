<p>
Pussy-cat
sits
by

fire
--

should

In

&quot;
Pussy

How

you
do
mistress
Pussy
?
Mistress
Pussy
,
how
do
you
do
?
&quot;
&quot;
I
thank
you
kindly
,
little
dog
,
I
fare

Old
Rhyme

<p>
ONCE
upon
a
time
there
was
a
Pussy-cat
called
Ribby
,
who
invited
a
little
dog
called
Duchess
to
tea
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Come
in
good
time
,
my
dear
Duchess
,
&quot;
said
Ribby
's
letter
,
&quot;
and
we
will
have
something
so
very
nice
.
I
am
baking
it
in
a
pie-dish
--
a
pie-dish
with
a
pink
rim
.
You
never
tasted
anything
so
good
!
And
YOU
shall
eat
it
all
!
<hi rend="italic">
I
</hi>
will
eat
muffins
,
my
dear
Duchess
!
&quot;
wrote
Ribby
.
</p>
<p>
Duchess
read
the
letter
and
wrote
an
answer
:
--
&quot;I
will
come
with
much
pleasure
at
a
quarter
past
four
.
But
it
is
very
strange
.
<hi rend="italic">
I
</hi>
was
just
going
to
invite
you
to
come
here
,
to
supper
,
my
dear
Ribby
,
to
eat
something
MOST
DELICIOUS
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
will
come
very
punctually
,
my
dear
Ribby
,
&quot;
wrote
Duchess
;
and
then
at
the
end
she
added
--
&quot;I
hope
it
is
n't
mouse
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
And
then
she
thought
that
did
not
look
quite
polite
;
so
she
scratched
out
&quot;
is
n't
mouse
&quot;
and
changed
it
to
&quot;
I
hope
it
will
be
fine
,
&quot;
and
she
gave
her
letter
to
the
postman
.
</p>
<p>
But
she
thought
a
great
deal
about
Ribby
's
pie
,
and
she
read
Ribby
's
letter
over
and
over
again
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
am
dreadfully
afraid
it
WILL
be
mouse
!
&quot;
said
Duchess
to
herself
--
&quot;I
really
could
n't
,
COULDN'T
eat
mouse
pie
.
And
I
shall
have
to
eat
it
,
because
it
is
a
party
.
And
MY
pie
was
going
to
be
veal
and
ham
.
A
pink
and
white
pie-dish
!
and
so
is
mine
;
just
like
Ribby
's
dishes
;
they
were
both
bought
at
Tabitha
Twitchit
's
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Duchess
went
into
her
larder
and
took
the
pie
off
a
shelf
and
looked
at
it
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
It
is
all
ready
to
put
into
the
oven
.
Such
lovely
pie-crust
;
and
I
put
in
a
little
tin
patty-pan
to
hold
up
the
crust
;
and
I
made
a
hole
in
the
middle
with
a
fork
to
let
out
the
steam
--
Oh
I
do
wish
I
could
eat
my
own
pie
,
instead
of
a
pie
made
of
mouse
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Duchess
considered
and
considered
and
read
Ribby
'
s
letter
again
--
</p>
<p>
&quot;
A
pink
and
white
pie-dish-and
YOU
shall
eat
it
all
.
'
You
'
means
me
--
then
Ribby
is
not
going
to
even
taste
the
pie
herself
?
A
pink
and
white
pie-dish
!
Ribby
is
sure
to
go
out
to
buy
the
muffins
...
.
.
Oh
what
a
good
idea
!
Why
should
n't
I
rush
along
and
put
my
pie
into
Ribby
's
oven
when
Ribby
is
n't
there
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Duchess
was
quite
delighted
with
her
own
cleverness
!
</p>
<p>
Ribby
in
the
meantime
had
received
Duchess
's
answer
,
and
as
soon
as
she
was
sure
that
the
little
dog
would
come
--
she
popped
HER
pie
into
the
oven
.
There
were
two
ovens
,
one
above
the
other
;
some
other
knobs
and
handles
were
only
ornamental
and
not
intended
to
open
.
Ribby
put
the
pie
into
the
lower
oven
;
the
door
was
very
stiff
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
The
top
oven
bakes
too
quickly
,
&quot;
said
Ribby
to
herself
.
&quot;
It
is
a
pie
of
the
most
delicate
and
tender
mouse
minced
up
with
bacon
.
And
I
have
taken
out
all
the
bones
;
because
Duchess
did
nearly
choke
herself
with
a
fish-bone
last
time
I
gave
a
party
.
She
eats
a
little
fast
--
rather
big
mouthfuls
.
But
a
most
genteel
and
elegant
little
dog
infinitely
superior
company
to
Cousin
Tabitha
Twitchit
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Ribby
put
on
some
coal
and
swept
up
the
hearth
.
Then
she
went
out
with
a
can
to
the
well
,
for
water
to
fill
up
the
kettle
.
</p>
<p>
Then
she
began
to
set
the
room
in
order
,
for
it
was
the
sitting-room
as
well
as
the
kitchen
.
She
shook
the
mats
out
at
the
front-door
and
put
them
straight
;
the
hearth-rug
was
a
rabbit-skin
.
She
dusted
the
clock
and
the
ornaments
on
the
mantelpiece
,
and
she
polished
and
rubbed
the
tables
and
chairs
.
</p>
<p>
Then
she
spread
a
very
clean
white
table-cloth
,
and
set
out
her
best
china
tea-set
,
which
she
took
out
of
a
wall-cupboard
near
the
fireplace
.
The
tea-cups
were
white
with
a
pattern
of
pink
roses
;
and
the
dinner-plates
were
white
and
blue
.
</p>
<p>
When
Ribby
had
laid
the
table
she
took
a
jug
and
a
blue
and
white
dish
,
and
went
out
down
the
field
to
the
farm
,
to
fetch
milk
and
butter
.
</p>
<p>
When
she
came
back
,
she
peeped
into
the
bottom
oven
;
the
pie
looked
very
comfortable
.
</p>
<p>
Ribby
put
on
her
shawl
and
bonnet
and
went
out
again
with
a
basket
,
to
the
village
shop
to
buy
a
packet
of
tea
,
a
pound
of
lump
sugar
,
and
a
pot
of
marmalade
.
</p>
<p>
And
just
at
the
same
time
,
Duchess
came
out
of
HER
house
,
at
the
other
end
of
the
village
.
</p>
<p>
Ribby
met
Duchess
half-way
own
the
street
,
also
carrying
a
basket
,
covered
with
a
cloth
.
They
only
bowed
to
one
another
;
they
did
not
speak
,
because
they
were
going
to
have
a
party
.
</p>
<p>
As
soon
as
Duchess
had
got
round
the
corner
out
of
sight
--
she
simply
ran
!
Straight
away
to
Ribby
's
house
!
</p>
<p>
Ribby
went
into
the
shop
and
bought
what
she
required
,
and
came
out
,
after
a
pleasant
gossip
with
Cousin
Tabitha
Twitchit
.
</p>
<p>
Cousin
Tabitha
was
disdainful
afterwards
in
conversation
--
