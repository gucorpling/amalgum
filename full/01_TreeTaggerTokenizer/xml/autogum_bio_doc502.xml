the

wrote

dated

Therefore
,
Roger
was
dead
at
the
time
of
the
will

which
,
written
in

eliminates
the
Battle

date

death

Among
many
others
who
founded
or
were
pillars
of
early
New
England
communities
,
William
Dudley
,
a
son
of
David
,
was
the
first
of
this
line
in
the
family
of
the
lords
of
Dudley
to
move
to
Connecticut
,
where
he
founded
the
settlement
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilford,_Connecticut">
Guilford
</ref>
on
the
shores
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island_Sound">
Long
Island
Sound
</ref>
.
He
emigrated
to
New
England
sometime
between
1636
and
1643
,
a
period
corresponding
to
his
uncle
Thomas
's
political
ascendancy
in
Massachusetts
.
</p>
<p>
Three
of
William
Dudley
's
great
grandsons
were
to
give
their
family
name
to
their
new
home
in
the
Cornwall
hills
,
when
they
moved
to
Owlsbury
from
Guilford
in
the
mid
17th
century
.
Owlsbury
was
renamed
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dudleytown,_Connecticut">
Dudleytown
</ref>
,
and
thereafter
the
persistent
legend
of
America
's
most
haunted
town
was
born
.
