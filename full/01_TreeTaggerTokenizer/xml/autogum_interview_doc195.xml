</hi>
To
be
honest
-
I
do
n't
think
that
I
should
have
been
in
the
final
two
;
however
if
I
was
on
the
show
now
-
it
would
have
been
an
extremely
tight
competition
.

One
constant
criticism
by
the
judges
and
by
fans
was
that
you
lacked
confidence
,
and
certain
times
in
the
series
you
questioned
why
you
were
competing
against
girls
you
felt
were
&quot;
better
than
you
.
&quot;
Why
did
you
feel
that
way
?
Was
your
body
image
a
factor
,
and
if
so
,
how
much
of
a
factor
?
What
other
factors
were
there
in
the
way
you
felt
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">

</hi>
Let
's
just
say
that
99
%
of
[
the
time
I
was
]
filming
CNTM
,
I
was
only
focused
on
hiding
my
eating
disorder
,
therefore
affecting
everything
from
the
way
I
walked
on
runway
to
my
confidence
level
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
MH
:
</hi>
The
CityTV
final
episode
online
viewer
poll
had
the
question
&quot;
Should
Andrea
have
won
CNTM
?
&quot;
and
the
response
was
overwhelmingly
in
favor
of
&quot;
No
,
Andrea
should
n't
have
been
CNTM
!
She
's
too
skinny
and
the
crying
gets
annoying
!
&quot;
Was
hiding
your
anorexia
the
reason
why
you
were
as
emotional
as
you
were
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
AM
:
</hi>
Correct
.
I
was
so
emotionally
unstable
that
the
only
person
I
could
talk
to
was
my
Mom
because
she
knew
what
I
was
going
through
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
MH

</hi>
You
made
a
comment
during
the
series
that
you
felt
Stacey
McKenzie
was
the
most
critical
and
belittling
of
the
judges
.
Toward
the
second
half
of
the
competition
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada's_Next_Top_Model,_Cycle_1#Episode_6:_Beauty_Is_As_Beauty_Poses">
you
spent
an
entire
afternoon
alone
with
her
</ref>
at
the
house
and
it
was
shown
that
you
two
bonded
.
Do
you
feel
that
day
really
made
you
feel
better
about
how
Stacey
viewed
you
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
AM
:
</hi>
No
,
because
after
wrapping
up
the
day
with
Stacey
I
went
to
give
her
a
hug
in
front
of
all
the
other
girls
and
her
true
colours
shone
through
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
MH
:
</hi>
Please
elaborate
.
Her
&quot;
true
colors
&quot;
in
what
sense
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
AM
:
</hi>
The
bonding
was
completely
TV
material
and
not
really
there
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
MH
:
</hi>
Which
judge
do
you
feel
was
perhaps
the
most
genuine
in
terms
of
behavior
on-screen
and
off
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
AM
:
</hi>
Tricia
Helfer
and
Ron
(
one
of
the
producers
)
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
MH
:
</hi>
There
's
been
criticism
on
America
's
Next
Top
Model
that
Tyra
Banks
and
the
care
that
she
shows
to
her
models
is
an
act
for
TV
.
Do
you
think
Tricia
Helfer
is
the
opposite
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
AM
:
</hi>
Absolutely
,
and
do
n't
you
think
it
is
weird
that
she
no
longer
hosts
CNTM
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
MH
:
</hi>
Jay
Manuel
now
hosts
,
and
it
's
weird
to
see
because
he
's
in
a
different
mode
than
he
is
on
America
's
Next
Top
Model
,
where
he
's
often
very
blunt
and
sarcastic
.
[
...
]
Toward
the
end
,
there
was
a
lot
of
rather
cruel
teasing
towards
you
coming
from
Alanna
and
Brandi
.
As
you
may
remember
,
it
culminated
in
the
night
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada's_Next_Top_Model,_Cycle_1#Episode_7:_Get_Ready.2C_Get_Set.2C_Go_See.21">
they
went
through
your
belongings
</ref>
and
then
tampered
with
a
&quot;
treat
&quot;
they
prepared
for
you
and
Sisi
.
It
was
n't
a
complete
180
in
behavior
,
per
se
,
but
it
did
get
very
nasty
very
quickly
.
Why
do
you
think
they
acted
the
way
they
did
?
Also
,
you
were
never
shown
confronting
them
for
what
they
did
.
Did
you
end
up
doing
so
?
Finally
,
did
you
know
the
extent
of
all
they
had
done
right
away
,
or
did
you
not
find
out
until
you
actually
saw
the
episode
on
television
?
