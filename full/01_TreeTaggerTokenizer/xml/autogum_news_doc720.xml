released
the
2012
World
Development
Report
on
Gender
Equality
and
Development
.
The
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_States">
United
States
</ref>
is
referred
to
many
times
,
often
as
a
benchmark
to
foster
understanding
of
recent
gains
for
women
in
other
parts
of
the
globe
.
At
the
same
time
,
United
States
women
still
lag
behind
US
men
in
a
number
of
areas
.
</p>
<p>
In
2012
,
the
authors
note
women
in
the
United
States
still
face
challenges
economically
and
socially
.
They
are
represented
disproportionately
in
certain
professions
like
teaching
and
nursing
.
They
are
paid
less
than
their
male
counterparts
.
Jobs
traditionally
held
by
women
also
result
in
lower
wages
for
men
who
hold
these
jobs
.
They
are
under-represented
at
the
highest
level
of
business
,
with
only
28
of
Fortune
1000
companies
having
a
female
chief
executive
officer
.
The
bottom
20
%
of
women
economically
have
a
slightly
higher
birth
rate
than
their
peers
in
the
top
20
%
.
</p>
<p>
Immigrants
to
the
United
States
from
Southeast
Asia
and
India
have
higher
than
expected
male
to
female
birth
ratios
,
which
the
report
authors
suggest
is
partially
deliberate
sex
selection
based
on
cultural
attitudes
from
home
countries
.
In
2009
,
over
half
a
million
US
women
were
victims
of
intimate
partner
violence
.
The
report
suggests
US
men
have
greater
pension
assets
than
US
women
.
When
compared
to
elderly
US
men
,
elderly
women
in
the
United
States
are
more
likely
to
live
alone
than
with
a
spouse
.
US
women
are
disproportionately
under-represented
in
local
police
forces
,
accounting
for
less
than
20
%
of
all
police
officers
.
Women
in
the
United
States
also
bear
a
higher
percentage
of
housework
duties
than
men
at
61
%
.
When
US
women
take
part
time
work
while
raising
children
,
they
find
it
difficult
to
use
that
work
experience
to
gain
future
full
time
employment
.
US
women
are
disincentivized
from
re-entering
the
workforce
after
giving
birth
because
of
the
high
cost
of
childcare
.

Many
of
the
gains
for
United
States
women
took
place
a
while
ago
and
took
a
long
time
to
get
.
It
took
40
years
,
1870
–
1910
,
to
see
major
improvements
in
the
percentage
of
girls
aged
6
to
12
attending
school
.
In
1921
,
after
women
got
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's%20suffrage%20in%20the%20United%20States">
right
to
vote
in
the
United
States
</ref>
,
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_States_Congress">
United

Congress
</ref>
passed
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheppard – Towner%20Act">
Promotion
of

of

and

.
This
assisted
in
lowering
infant
mortality
from
23
%
to
15
%
.

in

the

hedged
and
did
not
draw
a
conclusion
about
the

of

other
than
to

Many
of
the
legislative
victories
for
United
States
women
came
early
compared
to
developing
countries
.
Property
rights
for
women
,
while
later
than
some
of
their
European
counterparts
like

Norway

and
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_Kingdom">

,
started
to
come
by

.
That
year

Act
</ref>
was
passed
in
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/New_York">
New

</ref>
.
It
was
the
first
legislation
of
its
kind
in
the
country
.
Other
states
soon
followed
.
Women
got
<ref target="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/suffrage">
suffrage
</ref>
on
a
state-by-state
level
in
the
country
until
they
got
federal
suffrage
in

Title
VII
of

barred
discrimination
against
women
and
allowed

women
to
make
loans
without
their
husband
's
consent
.
In
1980
,
airlines
were
barred
from
discriminating
against
flight
attendances
for
their
marital

during
the
hiring

.

The
number
of
United

respondents
agreeing
with
the
proposition
&quot;
a
university
education
is
more
important
for
a
boy
than
for
a
girl
&quot;
decreased
from
about
14
%
in
the
period
between
1994
and
1999
to
about
about
9
%
in
the
period
between
2005
and
2007
.
Similarly
,
the
number
of
people
who
agreed
with
&quot;
when
jobs
are
scarce
,
men
should
have
more
right
to
a

decreased
from
19

about
8
