Application
of
the
Discrete
Wavelet
Transform
(
DWT
)
</head>
<p>
Wavelet
transform
is
an
effective
tool
to
combine
time
domain
and
frequency
domain
.
In
most
applications
,
discrete
signals
are
used
.
Therefore
,
discrete
wavelet
transform
(
DWT
)
must
be
used
instead
of
continuous
wavelet
transform
.
Wavelet
transform
can
decompose
the
signal
by
band-pass
filter
.
The
result
of
the
band
filtering
operation
will
be
two
different
signals
,
one
will
be
related
to
the
high
frequency
components
and
the
other
related
to
the
low
frequency
component
of
the
original
signal
.
</p>
<p>
To
compute
the
DWT
of
an
image
of
size
,
it
must
identify
the
wavelet
scale
function
to
define
the
approximation
coefficients
and
the
wavelet
function
responsible
for
horizontal
,
vertical
and
diagonal
coefficients
following
the
equations
below
:
(

)
(

)
with
:
(

)
(

)
where
is
the
start
resolution
and
the
scale
parameter
<hi rend="italic">
j
</hi>
is
always
greater
or
equal
to
.
In
general
,
we
choose
and

Calculation
of
Information
Entropy
</head>
<p>
After
an
image
is
transformed
by
wavelet
,
a
series
of
sub-band
images
with
different
resolutions
can
be
obtained
.
<figure>
Figure

</figure>
shows
the
results
of
a
Barbara
image
with
a
size
of
512
Ã—
512
decomposed
by
two
layers
of
wavelets
.
The
upper
leftmost
part
of
each
layer
in
<figure>
Figure
1
</figure>
is
a
low-frequency
image
,
and
the
upper
right
,
lower
left
,
and
upper
right
corners
are
the
vertical
high-frequency
,
horizontal
high-frequency
,
and
diagonal
sub-band
images
,
respectively
.
The
second
layer
decomposes
the
low-frequency
image
of
the
first
layer
into
a
low-frequency
sub-band
image
(
upper
left
corner
in
<figure>
Figure
2
</figure>
)
and
a
high-frequency
sub-band
image
in
the
vertical
,
horizontal
,
and
diagonal
directions
.
Subsequently
,
the
third
layer
wavelet
transform
repeats
this
process
to
continue
to
decompose
the
low-frequency
image
of
the
second
layer
,
and
the
like
.
</p>
<p>
The
above
evaluation
shows
that
the
multiscale
analysis
of
wavelet
transform
can
efficiently
describe
the
global
and
local
information
of
the
image
.
Generally
,
a
low-frequency
image
reflects
the
global
information
of
the
entire
image
,
but
a
high-frequency
sub-band
image
reflects
the
local
details
,
such
as
edge
,
contour
,
and
other
image
areas
with
mutations
.
Therefore
,
this
section
calculates
the
corresponding
information
entropy
of
each
wavelet
sub-band
image
on
the
basis
of
the
information
of
multiple
directions
.
Then
,
each
information
entropy
is
used
as
the
visual
quality
weight
of
the
corresponding
sub-band
image
to
describe
the
effects
of
different
sub-band
images
on
the
quality
of
the
entire
image
.
The
calculation
process
of
information
entropy
is
summarized
as
follows
:
</p>
<p>
Distorted
image
<hi rend="italic">
I
</hi>
is
imput
,
and
S-layer
wavelet
decomposition
is
performed
for
distorted
image
to
obtain
low-frequency
,
horizontal
,
vertical
,
and
diagonal
sub-band
images
,
denoted
as
,
,
,
and
,
respectively
.
Then
,
each
sub-band
image
is
divided
into
image
sub-blocks
that
do
not
overlap
,
and
the
information
entropy
of
each
sub-block
is
calculated
.
Finally
,
the
average
information
entropy
of
all
sub-blocks
is
obtained
and
used
as
the
visual
content
weight
of
the
cost
function
.
The
number
of
layers
S
of
the
wavelet
decomposition
is
set
to
1
.
The
information
entropy
of
each
sub-block
is
calculated
as
follows
:
(
5
)
where
denotes
the
probability
of
wavelet
coefficient
appearing
in
the
sub-block
image
,
and
.
represents
the
wavelet
coefficients
of
the
sub-block
image
,
is
the
number
of
all
wavelet
coefficients
of
each
sub-block
image
.
</p>
<p>
Generally
,
information
entropy
reflects
the
intensity
of
image
information
to
a
certain
extent
.
The
larger
the
information
entropy
of
an
image
,
the
larger
the
amount
of
information
,
and
the
better
the
visual
quality
of
the
image
.
Moreover
,
the
information
entropy
of
the
image
includes
rich
structural
information
,
which
can
be
used
to
measure
the
sensitivity
of
the
local
image
.
Therefore
,
people
are
inclined
to
evaluate
the
visual
quality
of
images
from
areas
with
high
acuity
.

the
information
entropy
map
of
the
low-frequency
and
three
high-frequency
sub-band
images
after
the
wavelet
transform
of
Barbara
image
.
<figure>
Figure

</figure>
also
shows
the
large
amount
of
structural
information
and
the
distribution
of
the
information
entropy
,
which
is
close
to
the
image
area
of
human
visual
perception
.
Therefore
,
the
wavelet
information
entropy
of
the
image
can
be
used
as
the
visual
weight
to
improve
the
subjective
and
objective
consistencies
of
the
image
quality
evaluation
.
