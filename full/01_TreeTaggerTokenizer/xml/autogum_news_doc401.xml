&quot;
We
knew
Colombia
were
very
dangerous
at
set
plays
,
and
that
's
how
they
scored
their
first
goal
.
But
compliments
to
my
team
for
hitting
back
straightaway
.
We
were
in
the
driving
seat
after
that
and
thoroughly
deserved
our
lead
.
Colombia
played
a
lot
of
long
balls
in
the
second
half
,
exactly
as
we
expected
,
and
that
's
how
they
ended
up
equalising
.
Obviously
,
my
lads
are
a
shade
disappointed
because
we
've
thrown
it
away
today
.
But
I
ca
n't
fault
my
players
,
they
gave
everything
in
difficult
conditions
.
Colombia
kept
clean
sheets
against
Brazil
and
Argentina
at
the
South
American
championships
,
but
we
've
scored
three
against
them
today
.

&quot;
That
was
a
crucial
match
for
us
.
We
started
well
,
but
unfortunately
we
fell
3-1
behind
,
so
I
'm
incredibly
proud
of
the
fact
we
were
able
to
turn
it
around
.
Normally
,
our
main
strength
is
our
organisation
,
but
unfortunately
we
made
a
few
unnecessary
errors
in
defence
today
,
and
that
has
to
change
.
Cristian
Nazarith
was
excellent
today
,
but
all
my
players
are
working
very
hard
for
our
success
and
for
the
team
.

defender

:
&quot;
After
a
nervous
start
,
we
settled
well
.
We
played
the
better
football
,
we
had
Colombia
under
control
,
and
we
deserved
our
3-1
lead
.
But
we
dropped
too
deep
after
that
,
and
their
long-ball
game
paid
off
for
them
.
In
our
remaining
games
,
we
need
to
keep
it
a
little
tighter
at
the
back
and
not
drop
too
deep
,
although
there
's
not
a
lot
to
improve
in
our
attacking
play
.

:
&quot;
The
opening
goal
should
have
given
us
the
confidence
we
needed
,
but
after
that
we
let
Germany
play
far
too
much
football
.
I
'm
still
extremely
happy
with
the
result
,
because
in
my
opinion
,
Germany
are
the
strongest
team
in
the
group
.
Now
we
'll
do
our
best
to
beat
Trinidad
and
Ghana
.
