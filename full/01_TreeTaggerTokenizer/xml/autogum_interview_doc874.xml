What
we
need
to
clarify
is
where
the
rights
and
duties
are
.
As
guide
we
still
have
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles%20de%20Secondat,%20baron%20de%20Montesquieu">
Montesquieue
</ref>
.
Furthermore
I
have
been
pleading
for
years
now
for
an
&quot;
internet
driving
licence
&quot;
.
Last
week
I
heard
something
similar
said
in
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British%20House%20of%20Commons">
British
House
of

:
Wikipedia
says
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/semantic%20web">
semantic
web
</ref>
&quot;
derives
from
W3C
director
Sir
Tim
Berners-Lee
's
vision
of
the
Web
as
a
universal
medium
for
data
,
information
,
and
knowledge
exchange
,
&quot;
yet
you
're
not
a
fan
of
the
semantic
web
,
right
?
Is
that
because
the
semantic
web
will
have
as
a
result
that
&quot;
our
daily
lives
will
be
handled
by
machines
talking
to
machines
&quot;
?
Or
,
are
you
in
favour
of
a
spread
of
protocols
for
different
types
of
transactions
and
data
?

A
difficult
question
.
I
would
like
to
have
a
good
semantic
web
.
But
I
think
that
the
possibilities
for
abuse
and
misleading
are
greater
with
a
semantic
web
(
Tim
agreed
with
that
when
I
submitted
the
problem
to
him
,
but
he
is
a
steady
believer
in
the
goodness
of
humanity
)
.
</p>
<p>
It
's
a
theme
that
runs
through
this
interview
:
whom
can
you
trust
and
how
do
you
make
the
rules
that
will
keep
&quot;
problematic
behaviour
&quot;
within
bounds
?
Only
a
world-wide
convention
can
help
and
we
are
far
away
from
it
.
</p>
<hi rend="bold">
It
's
also
a
little
early
to
use
intelligent
machinery
.
...
You
have
no
idea
how
&quot;
half
witted
&quot;
machines
can
be
.
...
Maybe
here
too
we
should
think
and
experiment
first
before
we
let
the
beast
loose

<p>
It
's
also
a
little
early
to
use
intelligent
machinery
.
Before
we
reach
artificial
intelligence
we
need
to
cross
the
desert
of
the
half-witted
machines
.
And
you
have
no
idea
how
&quot;
half
witted
&quot;
machines
can
be
.
</p>
<p>
My
attitude
towards
the
semantic
web
is
also
liked
to
the
remark
that
we
went
too
fast
:
maybe
here
too
we
should
think
and
experiment
first
before
we
let
the
beast
loose
!

Can
you
predict
the
future
of

Are
you
optimistic
,
or
will
it
be

Cailliau

:
Matrix
but
worse
.
Flight
from
reality
is
an
unavoidable
side
effect
of
our
brain
structures
.
Since
thousands
of
years
people
prefer
to
listen
to
fairy
tales
than
face
the
boring
realities
.
Still
I
think
Web
2.0
is
a
good
trend
:
blogs
,
Wikipedia
,
rings
,
all
these
achievements
come
from
simple
people
sitting
behind
their
home
computers
who
share
with
others
what
they
experience
,
and
above
all
learn
from
others
!
This
learning
outside
school
is
the
biggest
strength
of
the
web
and
most
hopegiving
.

You

miss
it

How
do
you

Do

In
