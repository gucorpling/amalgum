Prevent
it
from
happening
.
The
best
way
is
to
prevent
it
from
happening
in
the
first
place

Easier
said
than
done
sometimes

research

ask
your
local
police

ways
to
locate
a
missing
child
such
as
phone
locator
apps
,
alarms
on
doors
and
windows
,
security
cameras
in
and
around
the
house
,
whistles/portable
alarms
,
and
other
security
measures
can
be
great
deterrents
for
both
would
be
offenders
and
sly
children
trying
to
sneak
out
!
