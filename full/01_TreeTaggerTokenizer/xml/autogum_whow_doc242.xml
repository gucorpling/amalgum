Create
a
Targeted
Advertisement
on
Facebook
and
Instagram
</head>
Advertising
is
the
best
way
to
display
and
deliver
products
and
services
to
the
right
people
.
What
better
way
of
advertising
is
there
than
through
social
media
,
particularly
Facebook
which
has
1.86
billion
active
users
and
Instagram
with
800
million
active
users
.
Since
Instagram
is
owned
by
Facebook
,
advertising
on
both
simultaneously
is
a
seamless
process
.
