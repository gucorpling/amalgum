the
government
of

requested

<p>
&quot;
It

on
terror
by
invading
Iraq

should
leave

<hi rend="italic">

President
Bush
said
,
&quot;
If
I
worried
about
polls
,
I
would
n't
be
doing
my
job
,
&quot;
on
the
topic
of
his
low
U.S.
approval
ratings
.
&quot;
I
think
the
American
people
â€”
I
know
the
American
people
want
somebody
to
stand
on
principle
,
make
decisions
and
stand
by
them
and
lead
this
world
toward
a
more
peaceful
tomorrow
,
and
I
strongly
believe
we
're
doing
that
,
&quot;
he
said
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
've
got
ample
[
political
]
capital
and
I
'm
using
it
to
spread
freedom
and
to
protect
the
American
people
,
plus
we
've
got
a
strong
agenda
to
keep
this
economy
growing
.
&quot;
President
Bush
also
said
that
Iraqis
must
choose
between
&quot;
chaos
or
unity
