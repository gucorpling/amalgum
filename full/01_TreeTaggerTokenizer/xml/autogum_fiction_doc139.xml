CHAPTER
XVI
</head>
<p>
George
Waldeaux
took
his
mother
and
boy
back
to
the
old
homestead
in
Delaware
.
They
arrived
at
night
,
and
early
the
next
morning
he
rowed
away
in
his
bateau
to
some
of
his
old
haunts
in
the
woods
on
the
bay
,
and
was
seen
no
more
that
day
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
He
is
inconsolable
!
&quot;
his
mother
told
some
of
her
old
neighbors
who
crowded
to
welcome
her
.
&quot;
His
heart
is
in
that
grave
in
Vannes
.
&quot;
The
women
listened
in
surprise
,
for
Frances
was
not
in
the
habit
of
exploiting
her
emotions
in
words
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
We
understood
,
&quot;
said
one
of
them
,
with
a
sympathetic
shake
of
the
head
,
&quot;
that
it
was
a
pure
love
match
.
Mrs.
George
Waldeaux
,
we
heard
,
was
a
French
artist
of
remarkable
beauty
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Frances
moved
uneasily
.
&quot;
I
never
thought
her
--
but
I
ca
n't
discuss
Lisa
!
&quot;
She
was
silent
a
moment
.
&quot;
But
as
for
her
social
position&quot;
--
she
drew
herself
up
stiffly
,
fixing
cold
defiant
eyes
on
her
questioner
--
&quot;as
for
her
social
position
,
&quot;
she
went
on
resolutely
,
&quot;
she
was
descended
on
one
side
from
an
excellent
American
family
,
and
on
the
other
from
one
of
the
noblest
houses
in
Europe
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
When
they
were
gone
she
hugged
little
Jacques
passionately
as
he
lay
on
her
lap
.
&quot;
That
is
settled
for
you
!
&quot;
she
said
.
</p>
<p>
When
George
came
back
in
the
evening
,
he
found
her
walking
with
the
boy
in
her
arms
on
the
broad
piazzas
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
really
think
he
knows
that
he
has
come
home
,
George
!
&quot;
she
exclaimed
.
&quot;
See
how
he
laughs
!
And
he
liked
the
dogs
and
horses
just
as
Lisa
thought
he
would
.
I
am
glad
it
is
such
a
beautiful
home
for
him
.
Look
at
that
slope
to
the
bay
!
There
is
no
nobler
park
in
England
!
And
the
house
is
as
big
as
most
of
their
palaces
,
and
much
more
comfortable
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Give
the
child
to
Colette
,
mother
,
and
listen
to
me
.
Now
that
I
have
settled
you
and
him
here
,
I
must
go
and
earn
your
living
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Yes
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
She
followed
him
into
the
hall
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
leave
you
to-morrow
.
There
is
no
time
to
be
lost
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
You
are
going
back
to
art
,
George
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
No
!
Never
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Frances
grew
pale
.
She
thought
she
had
torn
open
his
gaping
wound
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
did
not
mean
to
remind
you
of
--
of
--
--
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
No
,
it
is
n't
that
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
He
scowled
at
the
fire
.
Art
meant
for
him
his
own
countless
daubs
,
and
the
sickening
smell
of
oily
paints
and
musk
,
and
soiled
silk
tea
gowns
,
and
the
whole
slovenly
,
disreputable
scramble
of
Bohemian
life
in
Paris
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
loathe
art
!
&quot;
he
said
,
with
a
furious
blow
at
the
smouldering
log
in
the
fireplace
,
as
if
he
struck
these
things
all
down
into
the
ashes
with
it
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Will
you
go
back
into
the
Church
,
dear
?
&quot;
his
mother
ventured
timidly
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Most
certainly
,
no
!
&quot;
he
said
vehemently
.
&quot;
Of
all
mean
frauds
the
perfunctory
priest
is
the
meanest
.
If
I
could
be
like
one
of
the
old
holy
gospellers
--
then
indeed
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
He
was
silent
a
moment
,
and
then
began
to
stride
up
and
down
the
long
hall
,
his
head
thrown
back
,
his
chest
inflated
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
have
a
message
for
the
world
,
mother
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
am
sure
of
it
,
&quot;
she
interrupted
eagerly
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
But
I
must
deliver
it
in
my
own
way
.
I
have
lost
two
years
.
I
am
going
to
put
in
big
strokes
of
work
now
.
In
the
next
two
years
I
intend
to
take
my
proper
place
in
my
own
country
.
I
will
find
standing
room
for
George
Waldeaux
,
&quot;
with
a
complacent
smile
.
&quot;
And
in
the
meantime
,
of
course
,
I
must
make
money
enough
to
support
you
and
the
boy
handsomely
.
So
you
see
,
mother
,
&quot;
he
ended
,
laughing
,
&quot;
I
have
no
time
to
lose
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
No
,
George
!
&quot;
It
was
the
proudest
moment
of
her
life
.
How
heroic
and
generous
he
was
!
</p>
<p>
She
filled
his
pocket-book
the
next
day
,
when
he
went
to
New
York
to
take
the
world
by
the
throat
.
It
was
really
not
George
Waldeaux
's
fault
that
she
filled
it
.
</p>
<p>
Nor
was
it
his
fault
that
during
the
next
two
years
the
world
was
in
no
hurry
to
run
to
his
feet
,
either
to
learn
of
him
,
or
to
bring
him
its
bags
of
gold
.
The
little
man
did
his
best
;
he
put
his
&quot;
message
,
&quot;
as
he
called
it
,
into
poems
,
into
essays
,
into
a
novel
.
Publishers
thanked
him
effusively
for
the
pleasure
of
reading
them
,
and
--
sent
them
back
.
The
only
word
of
his
which
reached
the
public
was
a
review
of
the
work
of
a
successful
author
.
It
was
so
personal
,
so
malignant
,
that
George
,
when
he
read
it
,
writhed
with
shame
and
humiliation
.
He
tore
the
paper
into
fragments
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Am
I
so
envious
and
small
as
that
!
Before
God
,
no
words
of
mine
shall
ever
go
into
print
again
!
&quot;
he
said
,
and
he
kept
his
word
.
</p>
<p>
He
came
down
every
month
or
two
to
his
mother
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Why
not
try
teaching
,
George
?
&quot;
she
said
anxiously
.
&quot;
These
great
scholars
and
scientific
men
have
places
and
reputations
which
even
you
need
not
despise
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
He
laughed
bitterly
.
&quot;
I
tried
for
a
place
as
tutor
in
a
third-class
school
,
and
could
not
pass
the
examinations
.
I
know
nothing
accurately
.
Nothing
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
It
occurred
to
him
to
go
into
politics
and
help
reform
the
world
by
routing
a
certain
Irish
boss
.
He
made
a
speech
at
a
ward
meeting
,
and
broke
down
in
the
middle
of
it
before
the
storm
of
gibes
and
hootings
.
