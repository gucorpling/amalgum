Cavalry
(
maj

M.H.
Kidd
)
on
the
way
from
Fort
Arbuckle
to
Fort

On

,
on
the
way
from
Fort

to
the
Antelope
Hills
,
came
on
the
Nokoni
village
(
about
60
tipis
)
of
Horseback
and
Arrowpoint
,
where
Yamparika
chief
Howea
was
as
a
visitor
;
Horseback
,
the
peaceful

was
not
in

blood
was
still
boiling
after
the
Washita
massacre
.
Seeing
the
soldiers
arriving
,
and
being
taunted
by
the
Kiowa
allies
,
Arrowpoint
,
the
war
chief
,
led
the
Comanche
warriors
in
a
charge
,
but
he
was
killed
and
the
village
and
the
stocks
went
destroyed
.
Kiowa
warriors
led
by

came
to
take
part
in
the
fight
;
only
one
soldiers

there
surrendered

the
surrendering
of

last
hostile
Comanche
groups
coming
back
from

Staked
Plains

he
was
appointed
by
the
Army
as
head
chief
of
all
the
Comanches

was
ordered
to

out

to
send
them
to

the

and
the
Kiowa
chief
pointed
out
27
chiefs

warriors
,

Horseback
was
able
to
sacrifice
only
nine
men

not

chief
of

preventing
the

defeated
chiefs

,
unfortunately

not
the
life

Together
with
Quanah
and
some
of
the
old
chiefs
,
Horseback
was
a
constant
point
of
reference
for
the
Comanche
people
in
the
reservation
until
his
death
in
1888
