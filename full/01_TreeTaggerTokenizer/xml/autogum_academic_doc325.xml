Introduction
to
Analytical
Scenario
</head>
<p>
The
presented
research
on
utilizing
Augmented
Reality
(
AR
)
technology
and
analytical
products
concentrates
on
developing
specialized
combat
functionality
,
which
directly
supports
battlespace
data
acquisition
,
processing
,
and
distribution
between
friendly
side
assets
(
gaining
decision
superiority
)
.
This
task
is
performed
using
handheld
devices
connected
to
secured
tactical
networks
through
the
application
of
specialized
network
interfaces
.

present
a
test
scenario
that
presents
the
reporting
and
recon
aggregation
capabilities
of
the
mCOP
toolkit
.
The
presented
figures
document
the
combat
scenario
time
snapshots
reported
and
registered
by
separate
reconnaissance
elements
,
which
during
a
mission
are
supplemented
with
detailed
unit
information
.
Each
recon
report
contains
a
marked
enemy
or
unknown
elements
’
estimated
placements
,
any
equipment
recognized
,
and
personnel
.
Using
intelligence
knowledge
about
an
enemy
unit
’s
doctrinal
composition
,
a
system
can
recognize
and
determine
unit
templates
(
also
considering
different
aggregation
levels
)
.
</p>
<p>
To
support
the
type
of
recon
data
reported
in
each
mCOP
application
,
mCOP
is
able
to
register
an
individual
or
group
of
equipment/vehicles
,
marking
their
warfare
type
or
specific
model
or
utilizing
IoT-based
sensors
.
The
fusion
of
such
data
is
performed
automatically
in
the
tCOP
server
and
is
further
distributed
to
lower-level
mCOP
node
applications
.
The
fusion
algorithm
utilizes
the
reliability
of
the
reporting
source
and
the
correlating
data
of
individual
military
equipment
and
groups
.
Utilizing
doctrinal
patterns
,
the
algorithms
identify
and
recognize
specific
unit
types
and
their
affiliations
based
on
the
numbers
and
types
of
equipment
supplemented
with
communications
and
command
system
parameters
.
The
mCOP
application
contains
an
editable
and
configurable
equipment
database
(
internal
)
,
which
can
be
updated
and
extended
through
server
service
or
manual
interactions
.
However
,
to
fully
utilize
Tactical
Augmented
Reality
View
(
TARV
)
battle
space
object
annotations
and
evaluations
(
<figure>
Figure
3
</figure>
)
,
it
is
required
that
the
operator
provide
equipment
data
as
an
outcome
of
the
performed
reconnaissance
tasks
.
</p>
<p>
A
database
of
military
equipment
is
further
used
to
determine
the
full
composition
of
recognized
units
,
formulating
military
unit
potentials
,
which
can
be
further
used
for
tactical
calculations
utilizing
Lanchester
’s
model
.
With
detailed
scenario
data
stored
in
its
combat
database
,
mCOP
is
capable
of
calculating
the
combat
outcomes
of
the
selected
enemy
and
the
friendly
units
in
various
dynamic
tack
configurations
.
This
delivers
to
tactical
commanders
a
powerful
tool
for
current
situation
evaluation
.
The
described
situation
is
the
basis
for
further
studies
and
presentations
on
the
implementation
of
battlespace
evaluation
algorithms
.
To
demonstrate
such
capabilities
,
we
will
consider
a
scenario
composed
of
Table
1
and
Table
2
elements
(
infantry
battalion
vs
three
enemy
battalions
)
.
