Introduction

<p>
Straw
mushroom
(
<hi rend="italic">
Volvariella
volvacea
</hi>
)
,
also
known
as
Guangdong
mushroom
and
Chinese
mushroom
,
is
one
of
the
largest
cultivated
edible
fungi
in
the
world
and
one
of
the
main
exported
mushrooms
in
China
.
China
began
cultivating
straw
mushroom
300
years
ago
and
was
the
first
country
to
do
so
.
</p>
<p>
Straw
mushroom
is
a
kind
of
high-temperature
mushroom
that
is
not
only
delicious
but
also
has
a
high
nutritional
value
.
Its
antioxidant
,
low-fat
and
high-protein
properties
make
straw
mushroom
a
typically
healthy
food
in
the
public
mind
.
<hi rend="italic">
V.
volvacea
</hi>
grows
in
hot
and
rainy
environments
in
tropical
and
subtropical
areas
,
and
the
optimum
growth
temperature
of
this
mushroom
is
30
–
32
°C
,
which
is
similar
to
the
average
summer
temperature
of
its
main
production
area
.
However
,
the
high
temperature
is
not
conducive
to
the
storage
of
the
fruit
body
of
<hi rend="italic">
V.
volvacea
</hi>
.
During
transport
,
straw
mushroom
is
placed
in
paper
boxes
at
5
kg
per
box
.
Due
to
the
respiration
of
the
picked
<hi rend="italic">
V.
volvacea
</hi>
,
the
temperature
at
the
center
of
each
package
can
be
as
high
as
50
°C
,
which
is
extremely
unfavorable
for
the
preservation
of
<hi rend="italic">
V.
volvacea
</hi>
.
To
date
,
there
has
been
much
advancement
in
<hi rend="italic">
V.
volvacea
</hi>
cultivation
,
resulting
in
the
ready
availability
of
this
mushroom
,
while
the
preservation
of
<hi rend="italic">
V.
volvacea
</hi>
remains
a
serious
problem
.
<hi rend="italic">
V.
volvacea
</hi>
is
unable
to
withstand
low
temperatures
:
when
it
is
stored
at
4
°C
,
the
mycelium
disintegrates
and
dies
,
and
the
fruit
body
softens
and
undergoes
autolysis
,
which
complicates
the
preservation
of
<hi rend="italic">
V.
volvacea
</hi>
.
At
the
same
time
,
researchers
found
that
the
storage
time
of
<hi rend="italic">
V.
volvacea
</hi>
was
significantly
extended
when
the
temperature
was
approximately
15
°C
.
While
it
is
expensive
to
maintain
<hi rend="italic">
V.
volvacea
</hi>
at
the
ideal
storage
temperature
(
15
°C
)
,
it
is
also
difficult
to
control
the
temperature
at
the
center
of
the
box
at
15
°C
.
</p>
<p>
Numerous
studies
have
shown
that
bacteria
are
an
important
reason
for
food
spoilage
and
degradation
.
To
prolong
the
shelf
life
of
the
<hi rend="italic">
V.
volvacea
</hi>
fruit
bodies
,
this
study
focused
on
the
bacterial
community
succession
process
on
the
surfaces
of
postharvest
fruit
bodies
of
<hi rend="italic">
V.
volvacea
</hi>
and
aimed
to
find
a
solution
for
<hi rend="italic">
V.
volvacea
</hi>
fruit
body
preservation
.
</p>
<p>
The
bacterial
community
structures
differ
greatly
among
different
stages
of
food
spoilage
,
so
investigation
of
the
succession
of
the
bacterial
communities
could
help
the
identification
of
decay-causing
bacteria
.
To
explore
the
succession
of
bacteria
on
the
surfaces
of
<hi rend="italic">
V.
volvacea
</hi>
fruit
bodies
during
the
process
of
spoilage
,
a
high-throughput
sequencing
of
the
V4
16S
rRNA
gene
was
performed
to
identify
bacterial
species
.
The
purpose
of
this
research
was
to
identify
the
bacterial
community
that
played
a
key
role
in
the
process
of
<hi rend="italic">
V.
volvacea
</hi>
fruit
body
decay
,
thus
providing
a
reference
for
the
preservation
of
<hi rend="italic">
V.
volvacea
</hi>
fruit
bodies
.
