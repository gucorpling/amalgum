The

in

and
was
the
largest
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triptych">

Like
Stoss
'
other
large
works

it
required
a

specialized
painters
and
gilders
.

In

,
Stoss
returned
to
Nuremberg
with
his
wife
and
eight
children
.
He
reacquired
his
citizenship
for
three

and
resumed
his
work
there
as
a
sculptor
.
Between
1500
and
1503
he
carved
an
altar
,
now
lost
,
for
the
parish
church
of

In

,
he
was
arrested
for
forging
the
seal
and
signature
of
a
fraudulent
contractor
and
was
sentenced
to
be
branded
on
both

his
cheeks
and
prohibited
from
leaving
Nuremberg
without
the
explicit
permission
of
the
city

.
He
was

Despite

went
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Münnerstadt">

to

presumably
according

his
contract

not

Leaving
wood

a

perhaps
the
tastes
of

<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-7">
