Authorities
are
investigating
what
's
left
of
debris
believed
to
belong
to
a
plane
,
that
washed
ashore
several
small
islands
in
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Maldives">
Maldives
</ref>
.
The
investigation
began
as
a
result
of
photos
of
the
debris
being
uploaded
to
the
social
networking
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/website">

.
Some
of
the
debris
is
reported
to
have
washed
ashore
as
early
as
May
31
and
was
found
on
a
beach
owned
by
the
Banyan
Tree
Vabbinfaru
resort
,
located
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaafu%20Atoll">

Atoll
</ref>
.
In
the
past
few
days
,
several
other
pieces
of
debris
were
recovered
on
at
least
three
other
islands
.
Authorities
are
trying
to
determine
if
it
may
be
part
of
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Malaysia_Airlines_Flight_370">

(

Last

,
a

known
as
a

reported
to

,

Island
.

Pictures
taken
of
the
objects
recovered
in
the
Maldives
on
,
reportedly
,
May
31
,
were
posted
to
Facebook
by
an
employee
of
the
resort
.
That
prompted
authorities
to
launch
an
investigation
into
the
debris
,
but
before
it
could
be
examined
,
it
had
already
been
sent
away
for
disposal
.
The
photographs
show
a
large
white
object
,
possibly
two
,
stained
with
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/algae">
algae
</ref>
and
appear
to
be
made
of
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fiberglass">
fiberglass
</ref>
and
honeycomb
material
.
The
objects
appear
to
be
several
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foot%20(unit)">
feet

in
length
and
width
and
in
one
photo
where
the
paint
is
severely
peeled
,
red
letters
&quot;
IC
&quot;
can
be
seen
.
Those
pieces
,
along
with
others
,
were
taken
away
and
disposed
of
as
trash
.
When
authorities
discovered
the
photographs
,
they
returned
to
the
site
,
but
only
found
a
small
,
five
to
seven

)
piece
of
debris
they
say
does
n't
appear
to
be
part
of
a
plane
.
</p>
<p>
According
to
the
resort
's
manager
Mr.
Naseem
,
the
bigger
pieces
of
debris
and
other
waste
were
taken
away
and
disposed
of
in
the
usual
way
.
He
added
other
forms
of
debris
and
trash
with
no
value
,
such
as
buoys
and
suspected
military
waste
,
wash
up
on
the
islands
all
the
time
,
especially
during
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/monsoon">
monsoon
</ref>
season
.
Local
residents
and
resort
workers
regularly
collect
trash
which
is
sent
to
the
garbage
island
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thilafushi">
Thilafushi
</ref>
where
it
's
sorted
,
exported
for
recycling
,
or
burned
.
Reports
say
at
the
time
the
debris
was
collected
,
no
one
suspected
it
could
be
from
MH370
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Although
some
of
it
was
taken
to
Thilafushi
,
there
is
still
a
five
or
a
seven
inch
piece
on
the
resort
.
It
was
left
because
it
is
small
.
The
management
has
decided
to
hand
it
over
to
the
Police
&quot;
,
said
an
unnamed
official
to
<hi rend="italic">
SunOnline
</hi>
,
who
said
authorities
do
n't
know
if
any
of
the
debris
taken
away
has
been
destroyed
.

Yesterday
,
reports
stated
several
more
pieces
of
debris
,
one
piece
measuring
some
eight
feet
by
two
feet
(
about
2.4
by
0.6
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/metre">

were

and
washed
ashore
sometime
in

past
few
days
.
One
piece
appears
to
have
a
serial
number
on
the
side
,
possibly
reading
'

.
'
Initially
residents
who
found
the
debris
took
it
home
.
&quot;
A
resident
had
found
the
debris
and
taken
it
home
.
Nobody
had
thought
twice
about
it
then
.
When
he
heard
about
the
discovery
in
Vabbinfaru
resort
we
immediately
called
the
Police

without
a

on

,
2014
.
All
239
passengers
and
crew
are
believed
to
be
dead
.
On
the
day
the
plane
went
missing
,
residents
on
the
small
Maldive
island
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kudahuvadhoo">

claimed
to
have
seen
a
very
&quot;
low
flying
jumbo
jet
&quot;
crash
into
the

Some
also
noted
the
colors
appeared
to
resemble
that
of
a
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Malaysia_Airlines">
Malaysia

plane
.
&quot;
I
’ve
never
seen
a
jet
flying
so
low
over
our
island
before
.
We
've
seen
seaplanes
,
but
I
'm
sure
that
this
was
not
one
of
those
.
I
could
even
make
out
the
doors
on
the
plane
clearly

one
resident
was
quoted
as
saying
to
the
newspaper

Some
claim
the
plane
appeared
to
be
headed
in
the
direction
of

According

<hi rend="italic">

reported
the
witnesses
were
interviewed
by
authorities
who
deemed
their
statements
to
be
truthful
,
but
Maldive
military
officials
along
with
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Malaysia">
Malaysian
</ref>
officials
say
no
such
aircraft
was
in
Maldive
airspace
at
the
time
MH370
went
missing
.
&quot;
Based
on
the
monitoring
up
to
date
,
no
indication
of
Flight
MH370
has
been
observed
on
any
military
radars
in
the
country
[
Maldives
]
.
Furthermore
,
the
data
of
radars
at
Maldives
airports
have
also
been
analysed
and
shows
no
indication
of
the
said
flight

Transport
Minister
