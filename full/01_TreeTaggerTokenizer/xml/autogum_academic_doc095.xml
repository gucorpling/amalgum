<p>
There
are
many
definitions
of
cultural
tourism
,
yet
a
review
of
the
many
studies
defining
it
and
its
significance
is
not
the
objective
of
this
paper
.
We
simply
based
this
study
of
tourism
and
flamenco
on
the
definition
of
cultural
tourism
by
Richards
and
Munsters
:
<quote>
“
<hi rend="italic">
All
movements
of
persons
to
specific
cultural
attractions
,
such
as
heritage
sites
,
artistic
and

,

and
drama
outside
their
normal
place
of
residence

Broadening
this
definition
,
the
European
Centre
for
Traditional
and
Regional
Cultures
(
ECTARC
)
offers
eight
potential
focal
points
of
cultural
tourism
:
<list>
<item>
(
a
)
archaeological
sites
and
museums
;
</item>
<item>
(
b
)
architecture
(
ruins
,
famous
buildings
,

towns
)
;

cultures
and

.
</item>
</list>
</p>
<p>
As
noted
in
Point
(
d
)
,
music
and
dance
,
in
their
classical
or
contemporary
form
in
popular
folklore
,
are
elements
available
for
tourists
as
fundamental
elements
of
the
local
heritage
.
Hence
,
certain
destinations
are
unequivocally
associated
with
popular
music
and
dance
(
e.
g.
,
Cuba
with
salsa
,
Buenos
Aires
with
tango
,
Bali
with
Balinese
dance
,
and
Rio
de
Janeiro
with
samba
)
.
However
,
unlike
other
cultural
assets
,
music
and
dance
are
not
mere
elements
of
contemplation
but
are
first-level
resources
that
arouse
emotions
,
allowing
the
tourist
to
actively
and
inclusively
experience
the
local
culture
.
</p>
<p>
Additionally
,
in
an
era
where
the
internet
allows
immediate
worldwide
access
to
music
and
dance
,
the
offer
of
live
music
emotion
is
an
important
resource
for
managers
of
tourist
heritage
,
as
well
as
for
private
promoters
of
festivals
,
performances
,
hotels
,
etc.
.
</p>
<p>
A
broad
debate
,
therefore
,
ensues
regarding
the
authenticity
of
the
tourist
offerings
and
their
representativeness
of
the
local
musical
culture
.
This
issue
takes
on
more
weight
as
folklore
represents
the
patrimony
and
cultural
heritage
of
a
people
where
idiosyncratic
historical
,
religious
,
and
social
elements
of
the
culture
are
arcane
to
foreigners
.
Tourists
will
,
therefore
,
hardly
be
able
to
feel
emotions
when
partaking
something
for
which
they
are
not
prepared
.
This
leads
to
suspicion
as
to
the
product
’s
authenticity
,
and
to
what
degree
the
performance
is
adulterated
and
geared
toward
tourism
.
</p>
<p>
The
ability
of
the
visitor
to
distinguish
the
authentic
from
the
adulterated
product
designed
specifically
for
the
unwitting
depends
basically
on
the
motivation
leading
to
attendance
.
This
paper
based
its
classification
of
this
type
of
motivation
according
to
Bywater
and
McKercher
and
Du
Cros
as
follows
:
<list>
<item>
Intentional
Musical
Tourist
:
deliberately
attends
a
specific
event
and
is
usually
knowledgeable
of
the
culture
from
previous
visits
.
</item>
<item>
Cultural
–
Musical
Tourist
:
motivated
to
learn
about
a
local
culture
through
music
and
dance
.
Attendance
probably
is
based
on
previously
acquired
information
.
</item>
<item>
Casual
Musical
Tourist
:
motivated
in
the
broad
sense
,
open
to
music
and
dance
but
lacking
information
or
prior
knowledge
of
events
.
</item>
<item>
Accidental
Musical
Tourist
:
motivation
is
not
cultural
and
event
attendance
,
often
organized
by
a
tour
operator
,
takes
place
in
hotels
or
restaurants
.
</item>
</list>
</p>
<p>
Hence
,
the
degree
of
emotional
implication
,
understanding
of
the
event
,
and
appreciation
of
the
product
will
vary
greatly
as
a
function
of
the
tourist
type
.
Many
innovative
offers
exist
,
as
can
be
seen
in
<figure>
Figure

.
</p>
<p>
The
debate
of
authenticity
has
also
been
addressed
from
the
perspective
of
the
artists
and
researchers
who
report
that
economic
dependence
by
local
artists
on
tourism
provokes
a
loss
of
the
art
’s
essence
.
Moreover
,
it
is
obvious
that
offering
an
artistic
style
geared
toward
the
uninitiated
perverts
its
natural
evolution
,
resulting
in
a
less
“
pure
”
style
driven
by
marketing
.
Furthermore
,
initiatives
of
preservation
,
such
as
that
of
UNESCO
declaring
the
dance
Intangible
Cultural
Heritage
,
involve
two
serious
dangers
.
The
first
is
declaring
a
set
of
binding
typological
rules
following
criteria
deriving
from
tangible
cultural
heritage
.
The
second
is
assigning
responsibility
for
its
protection
to
local
,
regional
,
or
national
authorities
,
following
political
criteria
and
not
the
needs
of
artists
and
promoting
culture
from
marketing
criteria
instead
of
its
intrinsic
growth
.
