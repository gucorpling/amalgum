ON
THE
LOOK
OUT
</head>
<p>
In
these
times
of
ours
,
though
concerning
the
exact
year
there
is
no
need
to
be
precise
,
a
boat
of
dirty
and
disreputable
appearance
,
with
two
figures
in
it
,
floated
on
the
Thames
,
between
Southwark
bridge
which
is
of
iron
,
and
London
Bridge
which
is
of
stone
,
as
an
autumn
evening
was
closing
in
.
</p>
<p>
The
figures
in
this
boat
were
those
of
a
strong
man
with
ragged
grizzled
hair
and
a
sun-browned
face
,
and
a
dark
girl
of
nineteen
or
twenty
,
sufficiently
like
him
to
be
recognizable
as
his
daughter
.
The
girl
rowed
,
pulling
a
pair
of
sculls
very
easily
;
the
man
,
with
the
rudder-lines
slack
in
his
hands
,
and
his
hands
loose
in
his
waistband
,
kept
an
eager
look
out
.
He
had
no
net
,
hook
,
or
line
,
and
he
could
not
be
a
fisherman
;
his
boat
had
no
cushion
for
a
sitter
,
no
paint
,
no
inscription
,
no
appliance
beyond
a
rusty
boathook
and
a
coil
of
rope
,
and
he
could
not
be
a
waterman
;
his
boat
was
too
crazy
and
too
small
to
take
in
cargo
for
delivery
,
and
he
could
not
be
a
lighterman
or
river-carrier
;
there
was
no
clue
to
what
he
looked
for
,
but
he
looked
for
something
,
with
a
most
intent
and
searching
gaze
.
The
tide
,
which
had
turned
an
hour
before
,
was
running
down
,
and
his
eyes
watched
every
little
race
and
eddy
in
its
broad
sweep
,
as
the
boat
made
slight
head-way
against
it
,
or
drove
stern
foremost
before
it
,
according
as
he
directed
his
daughter
by
a
movement
of
his
head
.
She
watched
his
face
as
earnestly
as
he
watched
the
river
.
But
,
in
the
intensity
of
her
look
there
was
a
touch
of
dread
or
horror
.
</p>
<p>
Allied
to
the
bottom
of
the
river
rather
than
the
surface
,
by
reason
of
the
slime
and
ooze
with
which
it
was
covered
,
and
its
sodden
state
,
this
boat
and
the
two
figures
in
it
obviously
were
doing
something
that
they
often
did
,
and
were
seeking
what
they
often
sought
.
Half
savage
as
the
man
showed
,
with
no
covering
on
his
matted
head
,
with
his
brown
arms
bare
to
between
the
elbow
and
the
shoulder
,
with
the
loose
knot
of
a
looser
kerchief
lying
low
on
his
bare
breast
in
a
wilderness
of
beard
and
whisker
,
with
such
dress
as
he
wore
seeming
to
be
made
out
of
the
mud
that
begrimed
his
boat
,
still
there
was
a
business-like
usage
in
his
steady
gaze
.
So
with
every
lithe
action
of
the
girl
,
with
every
turn
of
her
wrist
,
perhaps
most
of
all
with
her
look
of
dread
or
horror
;
they
were
things
of
usage
.
</p>
<p>
‘
Keep
her
out
,
Lizzie
.
Tide
runs
strong
here
.
Keep
her
well
afore
the
sweep
of
it
.
’
</p>
<p>
Trusting
to
the
girl
’s
skill
and
making
no
use
of
the
rudder
,
he
eyed
the
coming
tide
with
an
absorbed
attention
.
So
the
girl
eyed
him
.
But
,
it
happened
now
,
that
a
slant
of
light
from
the
setting
sun
glanced
into
the
bottom
of
the
boat
,
and
,
touching
a
rotten
stain
there
which
bore
some
resemblance
to
the
outline
of
a
muffled
human
form
,
coloured
it
as
though
with
diluted
blood
.
This
caught
the
girl
’s
eye
,
and
she
shivered
.
</p>
<p>
‘
What
ails
you
?
’
said
the
man
,
immediately
aware
of
it
,
though
so
intent
on
the
advancing
waters
;
‘
I
see
nothing
afloat
.
’
</p>
<p>
The
red
light
was
gone
,
the
shudder
was
gone
,
and
his
gaze
,
which
had
come
back
to
the
boat
for
a
moment
,
travelled
away
again
.
Wheresoever
the
strong
tide
met
with
an
impediment
,
his
gaze
paused
for
an
instant
.
At
every
mooring-chain
and
rope
,
at
every
stationery
boat
or
barge
that
split
the
current
into
a
broad-arrowhead
,
at
the
offsets
from
the
piers
of
Southwark
Bridge
,
at
the
paddles
of
the
river
steamboats
as
they
beat
the
filthy
water
,
at
the
floating
logs
of
timber
lashed
together
lying
off
certain
wharves
,
his
shining
eyes
darted
a
hungry
look
.
After
a
darkening
hour
or
so
,
suddenly
the
rudder-lines
tightened
in
his
hold
,
and
he
steered
hard
towards
the
Surrey
shore
.
</p>
<p>
Always
watching
his
face
,
the
girl
instantly
answered
to
the
action
in
her
sculling
;
presently
the
boat
swung
round
,
quivered
as
from
a
sudden
jerk
,
and
the
upper
half
of
the
man
was
stretched
out
over
the
stern
.
</p>
<p>
The
girl
pulled
the
hood
of
a
cloak
she
wore
,
over
her
head
and
over
her
face
,
and
,
looking
backward
so
that
the
front
folds
of
this
hood
were
turned
down
the
river
,
kept
the
boat
in
that
direction
going
before
the
tide
.
Until
now
,
the
boat
had
barely
held
her
own
,
and
had
hovered
about
one
spot
;
but
now
,
the
banks
changed
swiftly
,
and
the
deepening
shadows
and
the
kindling
lights
of
London
Bridge
were
passed
,
and
the
tiers
of
shipping
lay
on
either
hand
.
</p>
<p>
It
was
not
until
now
that
the
upper
half
of
the
man
came
back
into
the
boat
.
His
arms
were
wet
and
dirty
,
and
he
washed
them
over
the
side
.
In
his
right
hand
he
held
something
,
and
he
washed
that
in
the
river
too
.
It
was
money
.
He
chinked
it
once
,
and
he
blew
upon
it
once
,
and
he
spat
upon
it
once
,
--
‘for
luck
,
’
he
hoarsely
said
--
before
he
put
it
in
his
pocket
.
