Measure
Your
Child
's
Pupillary
Distance

Eyeglasses
</head>
<p>
Pupillary
distance
,
or
PD
,
is
the
measurement
of
distance
in
millimeter
between
the
pupils
.
This
information
allows
opticians
to
place
the
optical
center
of
the
lenses
directly
in
front
of
the
pupils
,
allowing
for
the
best
vision
possible
.
PD
is
often
included
on
a
prescription
.
If
the
measurement
is
<hi rend="italic">
not
</hi>
included
,
it
is
easy
to
measure
for
yourself
or
your
child
.

Checking

You
can
make
this

even
more
accurate
by
taking
a
flashlight
and
shining
it
in
your
child
’s
eyes
.
The
reflection
on
the
pupils
will
help
you
to
find
the
center

the
pupils

When
doing
this
,
make
sure
that
the
child
continues
to
look
at
the
distant
object

</item>
<item>
Repeat
the

two

Whether

a
flashlight

take
this

to
ensure
that
your
