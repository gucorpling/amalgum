<p>
The
next
morning
Angelique
,
Amedee
's
wife
,
was
in
the
kitchen
baking
pies
,
assisted
by
old
Mrs.
Chevalier
.
Between
the
mixing-board
and
the
stove
stood
the
old
cradle
that
had
been
Amedee
's
,
and
in
it
was
his
black-eyed
son
.
As
Angelique
,
flushed
and
excited
,
with
flour
on
her
hands
,
stopped
to
smile
at
the
baby
,
Emil
Bergson
rode
up
to
the
kitchen
door
on
his
mare
and
dismounted
.
</p>
<p>
“
'
Medee
is
out
in
the
field
,
Emil
,
”
Angelique
called
as
she
ran
across
the
kitchen
to
the
oven
.
“
He
begins
to
cut
his
wheat
to-day
;
the
first
wheat
ready
to
cut
anywhere
about
here
.
He
bought
a
new
header
,
you
know
,
because
all
the
wheat
's
so
short
this
year
.
I
hope
he
can
rent
it
to
the
neighbors
,
it
cost
so
much
.
He
and
his
cousins
bought
a
steam
thresher
on
shares
.
You
ought
to
go
out
and
see
that
header
work
.
I
watched
it
an
hour
this
morning
,
busy
as
I
am
with
all
the
men
to
feed
.
He
has
a
lot
of
hands
,
but
he
's
the
only
one
that
knows
how
to
drive
the
header
or
how
to
run
the
engine
,
so
he
has
to
be
everywhere
at
once
.
He
's
sick
,
too
,
and
ought
to
be
in
his
bed
.
”
</p>
<p>
Emil
bent
over
Hector
Baptiste
,
trying
to
make
him
blink
his
round
,
bead-like
black
eyes
.
“
Sick
?
What
's
the
matter
with
your
daddy
,
kid
?
Been
making
him
walk
the
floor
with
you
?
”
</p>
<p>
Angelique
sniffed
.
“
Not
much
!
We
do
n't
have
that
kind
of
babies
.
It
was
his
father
that
kept
Baptiste
awake
.
All
night
I
had
to
be
getting
up
and
making
mustard
plasters
to
put
on
his
stomach
.
He
had
an
awful
colic
.
He
said
he
felt
better
this
morning
,
but
I
do
n't
think
he
ought
to
be
out
in
the
field
,
overheating
himself
.
”
</p>
<p>
Angelique
did
not
speak
with
much
anxiety
,
not
because
she
was
indifferent
,
but
because
she
felt
so
secure
in
their
good
fortune
.
Only
good
things
could
happen
to
a
rich
,
energetic
,
handsome
young
man
like
Amedee
,
with
a
new
baby
in
the
cradle
and
a
new
header
in
the
field
.
</p>
<p>
Emil
stroked
the
black
fuzz
on
Baptiste
's
head
.
“
I
say
,
Angelique
,
one
of
'
Medee
's
grandmothers
,
'
way
back
,
must
have
been
a
squaw
.
This
kid
looks
exactly
like
the
Indian
babies
.
”
</p>
<p>
Angelique
made
a
face
at
him
,
but
old
Mrs.
Chevalier
had
been
touched
on
a
sore
point
,
and
she
let
out
such
a
stream
of
fiery
PATOIS
that
Emil
fled
from
the
kitchen
and
mounted
his
mare
.
</p>
<p>
Opening
the
pasture
gate
from
the
saddle
,
Emil
rode
across
the
field
to
the
clearing
where
the
thresher
stood
,
driven
by
a
stationary
engine
and
fed
from
the
header
boxes
.
As
Amedee
was
not
on
the
engine
,
Emil
rode
on
to
the
wheatfield
,
where
he
recognized
,
on
the
header
,
the
slight
,
wiry
figure
of
his
friend
,
coatless
,
his
white
shirt
puffed
out
by
the
wind
,
his
straw
hat
stuck
jauntily
on
the
side
of
his
head
.
The
six
big
work-horses
that
drew
,
or
rather
pushed
,
the
header
,
went
abreast
at
a
rapid
walk
,
and
as
they
were
still
green
at
the
work
they
required
a
good
deal
of
management
on
Amedee
's
part
;
especially
when
they
turned
the
corners
,
where
they
divided
,
three
and
three
,
and
then
swung
round
into
line
again
with
a
movement
that
looked
as
complicated
as
a
wheel
of
artillery
.
Emil
felt
a
new
thrill
of
admiration
for
his
friend
,
and
with
it
the
old
pang
of
envy
at
the
way
in
which
Amedee
could
do
with
his
might
what
his
hand
found
to
do
,
and
feel
that
,
whatever
it
was
,
it
was
the
most
important
thing
in
the
world
.
“
I
'll
have
to
bring
Alexandra
up
to
see
this
thing
work
,
”
Emil
thought
;
“
it
's
splendid
!
”
</p>
<p>
When
he
saw
Emil
,
Amedee
waved
to
him
and
called
to
one
of
his
twenty
cousins
to
take
the
reins
.
Stepping
off
the
header
without
stopping
it
,
he
ran
up
to
Emil
who
had
dismounted
.
“
Come
along
,
”
he
called
.
“
I
have
to
go
over
to
the
engine
for
a
minute
.
I
gotta
green
man
running
it
,
and
I
gotta
to
keep
an
eye
on
him
.
”
</p>
<p>
Emil
thought
the
lad
was
unnaturally
flushed
and
more
excited
than
even
the
cares
of
managing
a
big
farm
at
a
critical
time
warranted
.
As
they
passed
behind
a
last
year
's
stack
,
Amedee
clutched
at
his
right
side
and
sank
down
for
a
moment
on
the
straw
.
</p>
<p>
“
Ouch
!
I
got
an
awful
pain
in
me
,
Emil
.
Something
's
the
matter
with
my
insides
,
for
sure
.
”
</p>
<p>
Emil
felt
his
fiery
cheek
.
“
You
ought
to
go
straight
to
bed
,
'
Medee
,
and
telephone
for
the
doctor
;
that
's
what
you
ought
to
do
.
”
</p>
<p>
Amedee
staggered
up
with
a
gesture
of
despair
.
“
How
can
I
?
I
got
no
time
to
be
sick
.
Three
thousand
dollars
'
worth
of
new
machinery
to
manage
,
and
the
wheat
so
ripe
it
will
begin
to
shatter
next
week
.
My
wheat
's
short
,
but
it
's
gotta
grand
full
berries
.
What
's
he
slowing
down
for
?
We
have
n't
got
header
boxes
enough
to
feed
the
thresher
,
I
guess
.
”
</p>
<p>
Amedee
started
hot-foot
across
the
stubble
,
leaning
a
little
to
the
right
as
he
ran
,
and
waved
to
the
engineer
not
to
stop
the
engine
.
</p>
<p>
Emil
saw
that
this
was
no
time
to
talk
about
his
own
affairs
.
He
mounted
his
mare
and
rode
on
to
Sainte-Agnes
,
to
bid
his
friends
there
good-bye
.
He
went
first
to
see
Raoul
Marcel
,
and
found
him
innocently
practising
the
“
Gloria
”
for
the
big
confirmation
service
on
Sunday
while
he
polished
the
mirrors
of
his
father
's
saloon
.
