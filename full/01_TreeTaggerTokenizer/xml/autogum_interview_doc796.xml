Another
policy
says
,
section
7
of
the
'
Charter
of
Rights
'
should
be
amended
to
qualify
the
term
&quot;
everyone
&quot;
with
the
words
,
&quot;
including
the
pre-born
child
from
the
moment
of
conception
&quot;
as
having
the
right
to
life
,
liberty
and
security
of
the
person
.
The
criminal
code
must
be
amended
to
recognize
the
personhood
of
all
human
beings
,
from
conception
to
natural
death
,
ensuring
their
rights
under
the
Constitution
.
These
are
only
a
few
out
of
a
few
hundred
policies
a
government
has
to
deal
with
.
But
these
are
all
Biblical
principles
which
the
CHP
defends
.
If
there
were
no
CHP
Candidate
,
we
could
not
vote
our
convictions
,
and
for
the
Christian
principles
we
hold
dear
.
</p>
<p>
In
the
Spectator
of
Sep
.
16
we
could
read
the
often
used
quote
,
&quot;
Those
who
do
not
learn
the
lessons
of
history
are
doomed
to
repeat
them
.
&quot;
Parties
that
rule
God
out
as
Supreme
Ruler
,
who
will
not
consider
him
as
King
of
kings
and
Lord
of
lords
,
who
are
not
based
on
Christian
principles
,
but
instead
are
based
on
the
'
shifting
sands
'
of
public
opinion
,
are
repeating
the
same
mistakes
of
the
past
.
History
has
proven
over
and
over
again
that
if
we
live
in
harmony
with
God
and
his
commandments
,
he
will
shower
us
with
blessings
,
but
the
converse
is
also
true
.
</p>
<p>
I
am
running
because
I
want
to
stand
up
for
the
truth
,
as
opposed
to
do
what
seems
expedient
.
I
am
running
because
the
CHP
policies
are
as
good
as
and
better
than
all
others
,
and
which
would
benefit
all
Canadians
the
most
,
based
on
the
Word
of
God
,
the
promises
of
God
,
borne
out
by
well
established
history
.
</p>
<p>
I
would
like
to
see
a
fairer
and
more
democratic
way
of
voting
,
such
as
Proportional
Representation
.
That
way
each
vote
would
count
.
The
'
First
Past
the
Post
'
system
we
have
now
should
be
scrapped
in
favor
of
the
Mixed
Member
Proportional
.
The
Conservatives
and
Liberals
are
not
in
favor
of
it
,
because
they
are
more
interested
in
power
and
majority
Parties
.
I
wished
that
this
would
change
soon
.
</p>
<p>
Well
,
I
went
on
long
enough
.
It
is
not
that
I
have
no
opinion
or
am
not
interested
in
the
important
issues
that
politicians
are
to
be
concerned
about
,
and
we
will
have
to
address
them
,
but
we
must
be
ruled
by
God
and
his
Biblical
principles
in
order
to
be
the
recipients
of
his
blessings
.
The
Bible
says
,
&quot;
Blessed
is
the
nation
whose
God
is
the
Lord
.

<p>
Yes
,
I
ran
as

before
,
and
we
will
have
to
face
the
same
issues
again
,
for
nothing
has
changed

only
got
worse
