Work
on

your
teeth
</ref>
.
If
you
're
lucky
enough
to
be
blessed
with
perfect
teeth
,
skip
this
part
.
if
not
,
use
it
.
First
,
sort
out
any
issues
you
may
have
with
them
.
Visit
your
orthodontist
,
and
see
if
you
can
get
braces
.
If
you
can
afford
the
invisible
ones
,
get
them
.
if
not
,
you
'll
have
to
stick
it
out
.
Wear
the
braces
.
After
your
teeth
are
perfectly
straight
,
get
them
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Whiten_Teeth">
whitened
</ref>
.
This
also
can
get
expensive
,
but
is
worth
it
.
Be
vigorous
with
brushing
and
flossing
.

Take
care
of
your
hair
.
No
matter
how
good
you
think
your
hair
is
,
it
could
always
be
better
.
Visit
a
good
hairdresser
(
not
one
that
is
unprofessional
or
cheap
)
.
If
it
's
short
,
let
it
grow
but
get
it
trimmed
every
six
weeks
.
Wash
it
every
day
if
it
's
oily
,
or
every
two
days
if
it
's
not
.
Do
n't
use
products
yet
.
if
it
's
long
and
thin
,
or
too
frizzy
,
have
it
all
cut
off
.
This
will
be
painful
.
Let
it
grow
and
again
,
look
after
it
.
When
it
's
the
right
length
,
have
your
colours
and
highlights
done
and
it
cut
to
suit
your
face
.
Look
after
it
even
MORE
thoroughly
now
.
Just
do
n't
overload
it
with
product
.
Use
a
light
hairspray
after
styling
it
.

Watch
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Maintain_a_Healthy_Weight">
your
weight
</ref>
.
Do
n't
starve
yourself
,
but
aim
to
be
slim
and
healthy
.
Eat
LOTS
of
fruit
and
vegetables
,
drink
loads
of
water
,
and
cut
down
on
carbs
and
fat
.
Visit
the
gym
at
least
3
times
a
week
.
Do
cardio
work
,
and
lift
some
weights
to
get
toned
.
Females
should
n't
worry
about
bulking
up
-
they
do
n't
have
enough
testosterone
to
obtain
extremely
big
muscles
.

Take
good
care
of
your
skin
.
Take
off
all
your
make-up
EVERY
night
without
fail
.
Cleanse
,
tone
and
moisturise
every
morning
and
night
.
Once
a
week
,
you
should
steam
your
face
,
exfoliate
,
and
do
a
face
mask
.
Skin
and
hair
are
the
most
important
features
of
your
look
.
<figure rend="Be Attractive in the Fashion World Step 4.jpg">

</item>
<item>
Do
n't
overdo
the
make-up
.
Have
a
happy
medium
.
Do
n't
pile
it
on
,
but
try
not
to
go
bare-faced
in
public
.
Wear
a
well-applied
foundation
that
reflects
light
and
is
the
right
shade
,
concealer
over
dark
circles
and
blemishes
,
if
you
're
the
retro
type
,
maybe
an
elegant
flick
of
black
liquid
eyeliner
on
your
top
lid
,
otherwise
just
a
light
taupe
shimmer
eyeshadow
and
some
grey
eyeliner
on
your
bottom
lid
.
Well-applied
non-clumpy
black
mascara
,
a
blusher
that
defines
your
cheekbones
and
a
light
neutral
lipstick(or
retro
girls
,
red
lipstick
is
the
best
)
.
Re-apply
this
throughout
the
day
and
watch
YouTube
tutorials
to
apply
it
WELL
.

Wear
what
clothes
fit
you
.
There
is
no
set
uniform
,
though
generally
glossy
fashion
types
(
which
is
what
this
article
is
about
)
do
n't
go
too
out
of
the
ordinary
.
Always
the
highest
stilettos
Manolo
has
to
offer
,
tight
leggings
or
skinny
jeans
,
or
maybe
a
pencil
skirt
,
or
one
of
those
Peter
Pilotto
print
dresses
or
skirts
.
The
choices
are
endless
.
Just
keep
in
mind
that
this
is
a
mature
look
,
and
fashion
glossies
do
n't
do
emo
,
scene
,
Barbie
,
or
any
of
those
other
cliques
.
Another
thing-
have
an
amazing
handbag
.
Expensive
.
You
can
get
away
with
cheaper
items
of
clothing
as
long
as
you
spent
a
fortune
on
your
shoes
AND
bag
.
Accessorize
tastefully
,
and
maybe
add
a
Starbucks
to-go
cup
.
You
're
done
!

Tips

<list type="unordered">
<item>
Have
perfect
nails
.
Get
a
good
French
manicure
.
</item>
<item>
Read
up
on
the
glossy
lifestyle
.
High-fashion
magazines
,
if
you
please
.
</item>
<item>
It
helps
to
speak
another
language
.
I
do
n't
know
why
,
it
just
does
.
French
is
perfect
.
Have
a
stylish
friend
from
there
and
jabber
away
on
the
phone
to
them
in
their
language
.
This
impresses
.
And
insert
random
words
from
that
language
into
your
conversation
.
</item>
<item>
Take
taxis
everywhere
.
</item>
<item>
Remember
to
keep
a
sense
of
pride
,
dignity
and
elegance
.
You
wo
n't
find
a
glossy
flashing
her
knickers
drunk
on
a
night
out
,
or
screaming
her
head
off
at
someone
who
offended
her
.
If
someone
hurts
your
feelings
,
give
them
a
look
,
say
a
comment
that
could
leave
em
'
speechless
,
and
walk
away
with
your
head
held
high
.
</item>
<item>
Get
a
business
phone
like
a
Black
Berry
or
iPhone
.

<list type="unordered">
<item>
Some
men
might
find
this
intimidating
.
Only
a
certain
type
of
man
will
have
confidence
to
make
a
move
.
Most
men
wish
to
,
but
they
are
terrified
.
If
you
like
someone
,
flirt
.
But
only
with
people
you
like
!
</item>
<item>
Again
,
please
,
please
,
PLEASE
do
n't
starve
yourself
.
Lots
of
people
in
the
fashion
industry
do
.
Unless
you
want
to
look
haggard
,
do
n't
.
You
're
a
fashion
person
,
not
one
of
those
waif-ish
models
.
</item>
<item>
You
may
be
treated
differently
now
.
Show
old
friends
that
even
though
you
're
a
new
person
,
you
're
still
you
at
the
heart
of
it
.
Never
,
EVER
sound
snooty
or
smug
.
