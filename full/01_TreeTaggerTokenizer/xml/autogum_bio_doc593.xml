Life

<p>
Some
details
of
Passereau
's
life
have
been
compiled
by
scholars
,
including
pioneering
19th-century
musicologist
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/François-Joseph_Fétis">
François-Joseph
Fétis
</ref>
in
his
enormous
<hi rend="italic">
Biographie
universelle
des
musiciens
</hi>
(
1834
)
.
Passereau
first
appears
in
the
historical
record
as
a
tenor
singer
in
the
chapel
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_of_Angoulême">

(
who
was
later
to
become
King
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_I_of_France">

I
</ref>
)
;
therefore
he
was
already
an
adult
,
and
born
before
about
1495
.
He
had
some
association
with
both

</ref>
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrai_Cathedral">

,
as
he
appears
in
the
records
of
both
places
,
and
is
documented
as
being
a
singer
at
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrai">

</ref>
between
1525
and

.
He
may
also
have
been
a
priest
at
the
church

Music
and
influence
</head>
<p>
Almost
everything
Passereau
wrote
,
or
everything
that
has
survived
,
are
chansons
.
Since
details
of
his
biography
are
spotty
,
it
is
difficult
to
determine
how
much
lost
work
there
may
be
.
He
is
known
to
have
written
one
sacred
composition
,
a
motet
,
<hi rend="italic">
Unde
veniet
auxilium
michi
</hi>
(
the
text
is
from
Psalm
120
,
and
used
in
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_the_Dead">
Office
of
the
Dead
</ref>
)
.
</p>
<p>
Passereau
's
chansons
are
mostly
light-hearted
affairs
,
similar
in
content
to
the
Italian
<hi rend="italic">
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frottola">
frottola
</ref>
,
</hi>
although
no
direct
influence
from
the
earlier
popular
Italian
form
has
been
reliably
demonstrated
.
He
liked
to
use
nonsense
syllables
,
often
in
imitation
of
animals
,
as
in
<hi rend="italic">
Il
est
bel
et
bon
</hi>
,
his
most
popular
piece
,
which
imitates
the
clucking
of
chickens
.
This
composition
was
sung
as
far
away
as
Venice
.
While
Passereau
may
have
gotten
the
idea
from
Janequin
,
who
was
writing
onomatopoeic
chansons
as
early
as
1515
(
<hi rend="italic">
Il
est
bel
et
bon
</hi>
was
published
in
1534
)
,
its
popularity
rivaled
that
of
the
music
of
Janequin
,
and
printer
Pierre
Attaingnant
devoted
a
book
entirely
to
the
music
of
the
two
composers
(
in
1536
)
.
It
is
possible
that
Francis
I
,
who
knew
Passereau
from
his
service
at
the
French
court
,
recommended
the
composer
to
the
printer
.

Additional
features
of
Passereau
's
chansons
include
the
use
of
quick
declamation
,
chordal
passages
with
occasional
polyphony
,
generally
syllabic
word
setting
,
satirical
and
ribald
subjects
,
and
catchy
rhythms
.
