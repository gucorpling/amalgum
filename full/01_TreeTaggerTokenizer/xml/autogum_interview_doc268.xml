We
are
here
because
Mr.
Beck
wants
[
the
]
Respondent
's
[
web
site
owner
]
website
shut
down
.
He
wants
it
shut
down
because
Respondent
's
website
makes
a
poignant
and
accurate
satirical
critique
of
Mr.
Beck
by
parodying
Beck
's
very
rhetorical
style
,

Additional
points

I
like
Muslims
,
I
've
been
to
mosques
.
...
And
I
have
to
tell
you
,
I
have
been
nervous
about
this
interview
because
what
I
feel
like
saying
is
,
sir
,
prove
to
me
that
you
are
not
working
with
our
enemies
.
&quot;
According
to
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen%20Media%20Law%20Project">
Citizen
Media
Law
Project
</ref>
,
the
website
's
joke
premise
takes
advantage
of
&quot;
a
perceived
similarity
between
Beck
's
rhetorical
style
and
the
Gottfried
routine
&quot;
.

<p>
Randazza
argues
in
the
response
filed
on
behalf
of
Eiland-Hall
that
Beck
is
using
the
process
of
the
WIPO
court
to
infringe
the
free
speech
rights
of
his
client
;
&quot;
Beck
is
attempting
to
use
this
transnational
body
to
circumvent
and
subvert
the
Respondent
's
constitutional
rights
[
to
freedom
of
speech
]

,
in
arguing
that
Beck
's
attorneys
advised
him
against
filing
legal
action
in
a
U.S.
court
because
the
website
would
likely
be
seen
as
a
form
of
parody
and
due
to
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">
First
Amendment
to
the
U.S.
Constitution
</ref>
,
such
legal
action
would
not
be
successful
.
</p>
<p>
On
September
29
,
Randazza
sent
a
request
to
Beck
's
representatives
,
asking
that
their
client
agree
to
stipulate
to
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United%20States%20Constitution">
United
States
Constitution
</ref>
,
and
especially
to
the
First
Amendment
,
during
the
case
before
the
WIPO
.
In
the
request
,
Randazza
quotes
a
statement
from
Beck
himself
about
the
usage
of
international
law
by
United
States
citizens
,
Beck
said
,
&quot;
[
o]nce
we
sign
our
rights
over
to
international
law
,
the
Constitution
is
officially
dead
.
&quot;
Randazza
wrote
in
the
request
,
&quot;
I
am
certain
that
neither
party
wishes
to
see
First
Amendment
rights
subordinated
to
international
trademark
principles
,
thus
unwittingly
proving
Mr.
Beck
's
point
.
Lest
this
case
become
an
example
of
international
law
causing
damage
to
the
constitutional
rights
that
both
of
our
clients
hold
dear
,
I
respectfully
request
that
your
client
agree
to
stipulate
to
the
application
of
American
constitutional
law
to
this
case
.

the
legal
conflict
between
Beck
and

a
phenomenon
where
an

to
make

Beck
should
have
ignored
the

instead
his
attempts

take

down

to
legitimize
it
