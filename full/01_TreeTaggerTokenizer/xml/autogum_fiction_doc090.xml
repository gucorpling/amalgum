The
Eye
of
Apollo
</head>
<p>
That
singular
smoky
sparkle
,
at
once
a
confusion
and
a
transparency
,
which
is
the
strange
secret
of
the
Thames
,
was
changing
more
and
more
from
its
grey
to
its
glittering
extreme
as
the
sun
climbed
to
the
zenith
over
Westminster
,
and
two
men
crossed
Westminster
Bridge
.
One
man
was
very
tall
and
the
other
very
short
;
they
might
even
have
been
fantastically
compared
to
the
arrogant
clock-tower
of
Parliament
and
the
humbler
humped
shoulders
of
the
Abbey
,
for
the
short
man
was
in
clerical
dress
.
The
official
description
of
the
tall
man
was
M.
Hercule
Flambeau
,
private
detective
,
and
he
was
going
to
his
new
offices
in
a
new
pile
of
flats
facing
the
Abbey
entrance
.
The
official
description
of
the
short
man
was
the
Reverend
J.
Brown
,
attached
to
St.
Francis
Xavier
’s
Church
,
Camberwell
,
and
he
was
coming
from
a
Camberwell
deathbed
to
see
the
new
offices
of
his
friend
.
</p>
<p>
The
building
was
American
in
its
sky-scraping
altitude
,
and
American
also
in
the
oiled
elaboration
of
its
machinery
of
telephones
and
lifts
.
But
it
was
barely
finished
and
still
understaffed
;
only
three
tenants
had
moved
in
;
the
office
just
above
Flambeau
was
occupied
,
as
also
was
the
office
just
below
him
;
the
two
floors
above
that
and
the
three
floors
below
were
entirely
bare
.
But
the
first
glance
at
the
new
tower
of
flats
caught
something
much
more
arresting
.
Save
for
a
few
relics
of
scaffolding
,
the
one
glaring
object
was
erected
outside
the
office
just
above
Flambeau
’s
.
It
was
an
enormous
gilt
effigy
of
the
human
eye
,
surrounded
with
rays
of
gold
,
and
taking
up
as
much
room
as
two
or
three
of
the
office
windows
.
</p>
<p>
“
What
on
earth
is
that
?
”
asked
Father
Brown
,
and
stood
still
.
“
Oh
,
a
new
religion
,
”
said
Flambeau
,
laughing
;
“
one
of
those
new
religions
that
forgive
your
sins
by
saying
you
never
had
any
.
Rather
like
Christian
Science
,
I
should
think
.
The
fact
is
that
a
fellow
calling
himself
Kalon
(
I
do
n’t
know
what
his
name
is
,
except
that
it
ca
n’t
be
that
)
has
taken
the
flat
just
above
me
.
I
have
two
lady
typewriters
underneath
me
,
and
this
enthusiastic
old
humbug
on
top
.
He
calls
himself
the
New
Priest
of
Apollo
,
and
he
worships
the
sun
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Let
him
look
out
,
”
said
Father
Brown
.
“
The
sun
was
the
cruellest
of
all
the
gods
.
But
what
does
that
monstrous
eye
mean
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
As
I
understand
it
,
it
is
a
theory
of
theirs
,
”
answered
Flambeau
,
“
that
a
man
can
endure
anything
if
his
mind
is
quite
steady
.
Their
two
great
symbols
are
the
sun
and
the
open
eye
;
for
they
say
that
if
a
man
were
really
healthy
he
could
stare
at
the
sun
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
If
a
man
were
really
healthy
,
”
said
Father
Brown
,
“
he
would
not
bother
to
stare
at
it
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Well
,
that
’s
all
I
can
tell
you
about
the
new
religion
,
”
went
on
Flambeau
carelessly
.
“
It
claims
,
of
course
,
that
it
can
cure
all
physical
diseases
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Can
it
cure
the
one
spiritual
disease
?
”
asked
Father
Brown
,
with
a
serious
curiosity
.
</p>
<p>
“
And
what
is
the
one
spiritual
disease
?
”
asked
Flambeau
,
smiling
.
</p>
<p>
“
Oh
,
thinking
one
is
quite
well
,
”
said
his
friend
.
</p>
<p>
Flambeau
was
more
interested
in
the
quiet
little
office
below
him
than
in
the
flamboyant
temple
above
.
He
was
a
lucid
Southerner
,
incapable
of
conceiving
himself
as
anything
but
a
Catholic
or
an
atheist
;
and
new
religions
of
a
bright
and
pallid
sort
were
not
much
in
his
line
.
But
humanity
was
always
in
his
line
,
especially
when
it
was
good-looking
;
moreover
,
the
ladies
downstairs
were
characters
in
their
way
.
The
office
was
kept
by
two
sisters
,
both
slight
and
dark
,
one
of
them
tall
and
striking
.
She
had
a
dark
,
eager
and
aquiline
profile
,
and
was
one
of
those
women
whom
one
always
thinks
of
in
profile
,
as
of
the
clean-cut
edge
of
some
weapon
.
She
seemed
to
cleave
her
way
through
life
.
She
had
eyes
of
startling
brilliancy
,
but
it
was
the
brilliancy
of
steel
rather
than
of
diamonds
;
and
her
straight
,
slim
figure
was
a
shade
too
stiff
for
its
grace
.
Her
younger
sister
was
like
her
shortened
shadow
,
a
little
greyer
,
paler
,
and
more
insignificant
.
They
both
wore
a
business-like
black
,
with
little
masculine
cuffs
and
collars
.
There
are
thousands
of
such
curt
,
strenuous
ladies
in
the
offices
of
London
,
but
the
interest
of
these
lay
rather
in
their
real
than
their
apparent
position
.
</p>
<p>
For
Pauline
Stacey
,
the
elder
,
was
actually
the
heiress
of
a
crest
and
half
a
county
,
as
well
as
great
wealth
;
she
had
been
brought
up
in
castles
and
gardens
,
before
a
frigid
fierceness
(
peculiar
to
the
modern
woman
)
had
driven
her
to
what
she
considered
a
harsher
and
a
higher
existence
.
She
had
not
,
indeed
,
surrendered
her
money
;
in
that
there
would
have
been
a
romantic
or
monkish
abandon
quite
alien
to
her
masterful
utilitarianism
.
She
held
her
wealth
,
she
would
say
,
for
use
upon
practical
social
objects
.
Part
of
it
she
had
put
into
her
business
,
the
nucleus
of
a
model
typewriting
emporium
;
part
of
it
was
distributed
in
various
leagues
and
causes
for
the
advancement
of
such
work
among
women
.
How
far
Joan
,
her
sister
and
partner
,
shared
this
slightly
prosaic
idealism
no
one
could
be
very
sure
.
But
she
followed
her
leader
with
a
dog-like
affection
which
was
somehow
more
attractive
,
with
its
touch
of
tragedy
,
than
the
hard
,
high
spirits
of
the
elder
.
For
Pauline
Stacey
had
nothing
to
say
to
tragedy
;
she
was
understood
to
deny
its
existence
.
