The
city
pops
up
first
when

think
of
the
<ref target="Ruhr">
Ruhr

valley
,
and
that
's
no
surprise
.
It
is
the

Ruhr

the
third
largest

after

for

But
therein
another
,
altogether
gentler
,
side
to
this
former
industrial
powerhouse
.
Modern
Dortmund
is
vibrant
and
cultural
,
well-known
for
excellent
shopping
,
a
range
of
fascinating
museums
and
theaters
,
one
of
Germany
's
most
surprising
startup
scenes
(
not
quite
on
the
same
level
as
Berlin
,
but
ahead
of
the
Rhine-Ruhr
area
and
even
Munich
)
,
and
with
half
the
city
given
over
to
parks
and
gardens
,
enough
green
areas
to
sooth
the
sense
.
</p>
<p>
And
yes
,
the
city
is
no
classy
beauty
,
and
rough
at

pretty

adorable

History
</head>
<p>
Founded
around
the
year
882
,
Dortmund
became
an
Imperial
Free
City
.
Throughout
the
13th
and
14th
centuries
,
it
was
the
&quot;
chief
city
&quot;
of
the
Rhine
,
Westphalia
,
and
of
the
Netherlandish
Circle
of
the
<ref target="Hanseatic%20League">
Hanseatic
League
</ref>
.
After
the
<ref target="Thirty%20Years%27%20War">
Thirty
Years
'
War
</ref>
,
the
city
was
destroyed
,
and
decreased
in
significance
until
the
onset
of
industrialization
;
then
,
it
became
one
of
Germany
's
most
important
coal
,
steel
and
beer
centres
.
Dortmund
acquired
the
nickname
<hi rend="italic">
Stahlstadt
</hi>
(
Steel
City
)
in
the
19th
century
,
when
it
became
the
world
center
of
steel
production
.
Consequently
,
the
city
was
one
of
the
most
heavily
bombed
cities
in
Germany
during
<ref target="World%20War%20II%20in%20Europe">
World
War
II
</ref>
.
The
devastating
bombing
raids
of
12
March
1945
,
with
more
than
1,110
aircraft
,
destroyed
98
%
of
buildings
in
the
inner
city
center
,
a
record
to
a
single
target
in
this
war
.
Much
of
what
you
see
in
the
city
center
was
built
in
the
last
50
years
.
The
region
has
adapted
since
the
collapse
of
its
steel
and
coal
industries
,
and
shifted
to
high
technology
,
biomedical
technology
,
micro
systems
technology
and
also
services
.

In

praised
