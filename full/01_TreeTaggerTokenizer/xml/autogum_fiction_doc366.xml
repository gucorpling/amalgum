CHAPTER
XVI
.
IN
WHICH
I
TURN
SMUGGLER
,
AND
THE
CAPTAIN
CASUIST
</head>
<p>
The
last
night
at
Midway
,
I
had
little
sleep
;
the
next
morning
,
after
the
sun
was
risen
,
and
the
clatter
of
departure
had
begun
to
reign
on
deck
,
I
lay
a
long
while
dozing
;
and
when
at
last
I
stepped
from
the
companion
,
the
schooner
was
already
leaping
through
the
pass
into
the
open
sea
.
Close
on
her
board
,
the
huge
scroll
of
a
breaker
unfurled
itself
along
the
reef
with
a
prodigious
clamour
;
and
behind
I
saw
the
wreck
vomiting
into
the
morning
air
a
coil
of
smoke
.
The
wreaths
already
blew
out
far
to
leeward
,
flames
already
glittered
in
the
cabin
skylight
;
and
the
sea-fowl
were
scattered
in
surprise
as
wide
as
the
lagoon
.
As
we
drew
farther
off
,
the
conflagration
of
the
Flying
Scud
flamed
higher
;
and
long
after
we
had
dropped
all
signs
of
Midway
Island
,
the
smoke
still
hung
in
the
horizon
like
that
of
a
distant
steamer
.
With
the
fading
out
of
that
last
vestige
,
the
Norah
Creina
,
passed
again
into
the
empty
world
of
cloud
and
water
by
which
she
had
approached
;
and
the
next
features
that
appeared
,
eleven
days
later
,
to
break
the
line
of
sky
,
were
the
arid
mountains
of
Oahu
.
</p>
<p>
It
has
often
since
been
a
comfortable
thought
to
me
that
we
had
thus
destroyed
the
tell-tale
remnants
of
the
Flying
Scud
;
and
often
a
strange
one
that
my
last
sight
and
reminiscence
of
that
fatal
ship
should
be
a
pillar
of
smoke
on
the
horizon
.
To
so
many
others
besides
myself
the
same
appearance
had
played
a
part
in
the
various
stages
of
that
business
:
luring
some
to
what
they
little
imagined
,
filling
some
with
unimaginable
terrors
.
But
ours
was
the
last
smoke
raised
in
the
story
;
and
with
its
dying
away
the
secret
of
the
Flying
Scud
became
a
private
property
.
</p>
<p>
It
was
by
the
first
light
of
dawn
that
we
saw
,
close
on
board
,
the
metropolitan
island
of
Hawaii
.
We
held
along
the
coast
,
as
near
as
we
could
venture
,
with
a
fresh
breeze
and
under
an
unclouded
heaven
;
beholding
,
as
we
went
,
the
arid
mountain
sides
and
scrubby
cocoa-palms
of
that
somewhat
melancholy
archipelago
.
About
four
of
the
afternoon
we
turned
Waimanolo
Point
,
the
westerly
headland
of
the
great
bight
of
Honolulu
;
showed
ourselves
for
twenty
minutes
in
full
view
;
and
then
fell
again
to
leeward
,
and
put
in
the
rest
of
daylight
,
plying
under
shortened
sail
under
the
lee
of
Waimanolo
.
</p>
<p>
A
little
after
dark
we
beat
once
more
about
the
point
,
and
crept
cautiously
toward
the
mouth
of
the
Pearl
Lochs
,
where
Jim
and
I
had
arranged
I
was
to
meet
the
smugglers
.
The
night
was
happily
obscure
,
the
water
smooth
.
We
showed
,
according
to
instructions
,
no
light
on
deck
:
only
a
red
lantern
dropped
from
either
cathead
to
within
a
couple
of
feet
of
the
water
.
A
lookout
was
stationed
on
the
bowsprit
end
,
another
in
the
crosstrees
;
and
the
whole
ship
's
company
crowded
forward
,
scouting
for
enemies
or
friends
.
It
was
now
the
crucial
moment
of
our
enterprise
;
we
were
now
risking
liberty
and
credit
;
and
that
for
a
sum
so
small
to
a
man
in
my
bankrupt
situation
,
that
I
could
have
laughed
aloud
in
bitterness
.
But
the
piece
had
been
arranged
,
and
we
must
play
it
to
the
finish
.
</p>
<p>
For
some
while
,
we
saw
nothing
but
the
dark
mountain
outline
of
the
island
,
the
torches
of
native
fishermen
glittering
here
and
there
along
the
foreshore
,
and
right
in
the
midst
that
cluster
of
brave
lights
with
which
the
town
of
Honolulu
advertises
itself
to
the
seaward
.
Presently
a
ruddy
star
appeared
inshore
of
us
,
and
seemed
to
draw
near
unsteadily
.
This
was
the
anticipated
signal
;
and
we
made
haste
to
show
the
countersign
,
lowering
a
white
light
from
the
quarter
,
extinguishing
the
two
others
,
and
laying
the
schooner
incontinently
to
.
The
star
approached
slowly
;
the
sounds
of
oars
and
of
men
's
speech
came
to
us
across
the
water
;
and
then
a
voice
hailed
us
.
</p>
<p>
“
Is
that
Mr.
Dodd
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Yes
,
”
I
returned
.
“
Is
Jim
Pinkerton
there
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
No
,
sir
,
”
replied
the
voice
.
“
But
there
's
one
of
his
crowd
here
;
name
of
Speedy
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
'm
here
,
Mr.
Dodd
,
”
added
Speedy
himself
.
“
I
have
letters
for
you
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
All
right
,
”
I
replied
.
“
Come
aboard
,
gentlemen
,
and
let
me
see
my
mail
.
”
</p>
<p>
A
whaleboat
accordingly
ranged
alongside
,
and
three
men
boarded
us
:
my
old
San
Francisco
friend
,
the
stock-gambler
Speedy
,
a
little
wizened
person
of
the
name
of
Sharpe
,
and
a
big
,
flourishing
,
dissipated-looking
man
called
Fowler
.
The
two
last
(
I
learned
afterward
)
were
frequent
partners
;
Sharpe
supplied
the
capital
,
and
Fowler
,
who
was
quite
a
character
in
the
islands
and
occupied
a
considerable
station
,
brought
activity
,
daring
,
and
a
private
influence
,
highly
necessary
in
the
case
.
Both
seemed
to
approach
the
business
with
a
keen
sense
of
romance
;
and
I
believe
this
was
the
chief
attraction
,
at
least
with
Fowler
--
for
whom
I
early
conceived
a
sentiment
of
liking
.
But
in
that
first
moment
I
had
something
else
to
think
of
than
to
judge
my
new
acquaintances
;
and
before
Speedy
had
fished
out
the
letters
,
the
full
extent
of
our
misfortune
was
revealed
.
</p>
<p>
“
We
've
rather
bad
news
for
you
,
Mr.
Dodd
,
”
said
Fowler
.
“
Your
firm
's
gone
up
.
”
