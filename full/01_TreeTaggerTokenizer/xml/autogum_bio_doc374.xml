Early
life
</head>
<p>
Chuqui
Huipa
was
the
daughter
of
the
Inca
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huayna_Capac">
Huayna
Capac
</ref>
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahua_Ocllo">
Rahua
Ocllo
</ref>
,
and
thus
the
full
sister
of
Huáscar
.
At
the
time
of
her
father
's
death
in
1527
,
she
,
her
mother
and
his
entire
harem
,
was
in
Quito
with
him
.
Her
father
had
willed
his
throne
to
his
illegitimate
son
,
her
half
brother
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atahualpa">
Atahualpa
</ref>
,
but
her
legitimate
full
brother
Huáscar
had
the
will
overturned
,
executed
his
fathers
’
executors
,
and
claimed
the
throne
for
himself
.
He
then
ordered
for
his
mother
,
sister
and
the
rest
of
the
harem
to
be
brought
to
Cuzco
,
as
he
wished
to
follow
the
ancient
custom
to
marry
his
sister
,
to
even
more
ensure
that
his
own
blood
line
would
be
completely
legitimate
.

Marriage
</head>
<p>
The
wedding
was
performed
with
some
difficulty
.
Her
mother
had
initially
refused
to
give
her
consent
to
it
,
which
was
crucial
for
it
to
take
place
.
Her
reason
is
reported
to
have
been
personal
discontent
with
Huáscar
,
and
disapproval
of
his
execution
of
her
late
husband
's
executors
.
She
is
reported
to
have
favored
the
illegitimate
son
of
her
spouse
,
Atahualpa
,
who
had
been
brought
up
in
her
household
,
before
Huáscar
.
As
the
wedding
was
important
for
the
succession
to
continue
undisturbed
,
this
presented
a
problem
for
Huáscar
.
Her
mother
was
finally
forced
to
consent
,
and
the
wedding
and
coronation
could
take
place
.

Queen
</head>
<p>
The
relationship
between
queen
Chuqui
Huipa
and
Huáscar
was
reportedly
not
a
happy
one
.
Huáscar
viewed
his
brother
Atahualpa
as
a
threat
and
had
many
people
at
court
executed
because
he
believed
their
loyalty
to
be
faltering
.
Atahualpa
,
who
resided
in
a
different
part
of
the
realm
,
had
been
absent
from
the
coronation
of
Huáscar
.
He
did
,
however
,
send
his
loyalists
and
spokespersons
with
gifts
and
greetings
to
the
queen
and
her
mother
in
Cuzco
,
who
received
them
kindly
.
This
exposed
them
both
to
suspicions
from
Huáscar
,
who
assumed
them
to
belong
to
the
opposition
and
of
taking
sides
with
Atahualpa
against
him
.
As
soon
as
the
visitors
left
,
Huáscar
caused
a
scene
by
entering
the
queen
's
audience
chamber
and
accusing
the
queen
's
mother
of
being
the
prime
adviser
of
Atahualpa
,
and
them
both
of
disloyalty
.
Both
the
queen
and
her
mother
denied
the
accusations
,
and
Huáscar
was
not
able
to
prove
anything
against
them
.
He
did
,
however
,
had
them
placed
under
guard
and
spies
placed
around
them
to
report
of
their
every
act
.
</p>
<p>
The
queen
reacted
very
badly
to
be
placed
under
such
circumstances
.
Reportedly
,
she
took
such
offence
of
being
put
under
watch
,
that
she
refrained
from
eating
during
day
time
and
only
took
one
meal
during
the
night
,
to
ensure
that
the
spies
would
have
nothing
to
report
,
not
even
such
innocent
activities
such
as
eating
.
Her
new
conditions
also
caused
a
depression
,
and
she
reportedly
took
to
abuse
coca
,
both
to
sleep
at
night
but
also
during
day
time
.
The
bad
relationship
between
the
royal
couple
was
noticed
and
attracted
public
attention
and
bad
publicity
.
When
Huáscar
had
several
members
of
the
embassy
Atahualpa
had
sent
to
him
in
Quito
executed
,
the
remaining
member
of
his
embassy
,
Quilaco
,
appealed
to
the
queen
and
her
mother
for
help
.
When
the
civil
war
erupted
between
the
two
brothers
,
the
situation
for
the
queen
and
her
mother
became
even
more
difficult
.
When
Atahualpa
escaped
from
his
brothers
custody
,
they
were
both
,
reportedly
,
very
close
to
being
arrested
and
executed
.
In
1532
,
Huáscar
was
defeated
and
taken
prisoner
by
the
army
of
Atahualpa
,
who
paraded
him
in
public
as
a
prisoner
to
the
capital
of
Cuzco
after
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Quipaipan">
Battle
of
Quipaipan
</ref>
.
Upon
entering
the
city
,
the
loyalists
of
Atahualpa
reportedly
called
Rahua
Ocllo
a
concubine
rather
than
a
queen
in
order
to
present
Huáscar
as
illegitimate
.
Despite
this
,
Rahua
Ocllo
approached
her
captive
and
deposed
son
by
reproaching
him
in
public
.
She
explained
that
though
he
was
her
son
,
he
deserved
his
present
predicament
because
of
his
execution
of
Atahualpa
's
ambassadors
,
for
all
his
misdeeds
,
and
for
having
dragged
down
his
entire
family
including
her
in
his
ruin
without
cause
,
and
slapped
him
in
public
.
