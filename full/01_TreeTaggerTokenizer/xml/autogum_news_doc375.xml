Iran
is
to
reduce

for
a
lifting
of
some
economic
sanctions
.
</p>
<p>
Iran
has
agreed
to
not

any

enrichment
facilities

to
halt
enrichment
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uranium">

<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kilogram">

this

the

<p>

Barack

welcomed
the
deal
:
&quot;
For
the
first
time
in
nearly
a
decade
,
we
have
halted
the
progress
of
the
Iranian
nuclear
program
,
and
key
parts
of
the
program
will
be
rolled
back
.
&quot;
He
said
the
provisions
of
the
deal
&quot;
cut
off
Iran
's
most
likely
paths
to
a
bomb
&quot;
.
</p>
<p>

the
deal
was
an
&quot;
important
first
step

and
Iran
was
&quot;
further
away
from
getting
a
nuclear
weapon

Now

that

,
prime

<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Israel">
Israel
</ref>
,
said
the
deal
was
a
&quot;
historic
mistake
&quot;
and
said
the
Iranians
had
agreed
only
to
&quot;
cosmetic
concessions
&quot;
that
&quot;
can
be
undone
by
the
Iranians
within
weeks
&quot;
.
&quot;
Israel
&quot;
,
he
said
,
&quot;
is
not
bound
to
this
agreement
while
Iran
is
committed
to
the
destruction
of
Israel
.
Israel
has
the
right
to
protect
itself
in
the
face
of
any
threat
.
I
wish
to
reiterate
that
as
the
prime
minister
of
Israel
—
Israel
will
not
allow
Iran
to
develop
nuclear
military
capabilities
.
&quot;
He
also
said
:
&quot;
Iran
is
receiving
billions
of
dollars
in
relief
in
the
sanctions
without
paying
any
sort
of
price
.
Iran
is
receiving
written
approval
to
violate
UN
Security
Council
resolutions
&quot;
.

<p>
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naftali%20Bennett">

,
the

economic
minister
,
warned
of
the
prospects
of
a
nuclear
Iran
:
&quot;
If
in
another
five
or
six
years
a
nuclear
suitcase
explodes
in

or
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Madrid">

</ref>
,
it
will
be
because
of
the
agreement
that
was
signed
this
morning
&quot;
.
</p>
<p>
A
spokesman
for
President
Obama
stated
:
&quot;
the
United
States
will
remain
firm
in
our
commitment
to
Israel
,
which
has
good
reason
to
be
skeptical
about
Iran
's
intentions
&quot;
.
Obama
phoned
Netanyahu
on
Sunday
to
try
and
reassure
him
.
