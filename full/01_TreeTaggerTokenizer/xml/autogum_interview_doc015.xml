Well
so
,
how
to
you
maintain
continuity
and
fluidity
of
the
story
across
the
pages
?

By
being
very
diligent
before
I
write
it
.
So
if
I
've
,
I
am
a
big
believer
that
you
should
outline
everything
.
So
before
I
write
the
script
I
've
got
it
all
planned
out
,
I
know
which
character
's
gonna
go
where
;
so
that
I
do
n't
have
to
make
it
up
and
hope
I
can
remember
what
's
all
going
to
happen
.
If
I
have
got
it
all
laid
out
,
&quot;
okay
,
Issue
#1
<hi rend="italic">
this
</hi>
happens
.
Issue
#2
<hi rend="italic">
this
</hi>
happens
.
&quot;
I
have
got
a
flow
chart
of
all
the
characters
and
where
they
are
.
That
,
it
might
be
a
bit
overkill
but
for
me
,
it
keeps
it
all
.
Of
course
,
when
I
sit
down
to
write
,
then
I
just
ignore
it
and
do
whatever
I
want
.
But
yeah
,
outlining
is
the
way
to
make
sure
the
story
flows
the
way
I
want
it
to
.

Do
you
enjoy
movie
adaptations
of
comics
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
(
(
</hi>
<hi rend="bold">
ROS
</hi>
<hi rend="bold">
)
)
</hi>
I
do
,
yeah
.
For
different
reasons
.
I
like
,
I
really
enjoy
<hi rend="italic">
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Walking%20Dead">
The
Walking
Dead
</ref>
</hi>
.
I
know
it
's
not
a
movie
,
but
,
actually
,
no
,
it
is
!
There
a
movie
coming
out
.
I
really
enjoy
that
because
,
what
I
find
fascinating
is
it
is
very
different
from
the
comic
,
but
it
appeals
to
the
same
idea
,
the
same
feel
.
Because
in
comic
,
certain
characters
set
stories
,
and
in
the
show
,
they
put
the
same
stories
,
but
they
mix
all
the
characters
up
,
like
who
is
doing
what
,
so
you
still
do
n't
know
who
's
going
to
die
,
who
is
going
to
be
the
hero
,
who
is
going
to
be
the
villain
,
and
I
like
that
unpredictability
.
I
do
n't
like
the
idea
of
taking
a
comic
and
making
it
exactly
the
same
in
the
film
.
I
think
that
you
should
translate
it
to
a
new
medium
and
use
that
new
medium
to
its
most
potential
.
So
,
yeah
,
I
really
enjoy
them
a
lot
.
Ah
,
and
yeah
,
obviously
the
Marvel
films
too
.

Who

My
mentors
?
Me
.
I
am
my
mentor
.
Because
a
lot
of
comics
is
self-learned
.
But
if
you
would
say
&quot;
Who
inspires
me
?
&quot;
,
&quot;
Which
writers
?
&quot;
I
would
say
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir%20Nabokov">
Vladimir
Nabokov
</ref>
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James%20Joyce">
James
Joyce
</ref>
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman%20Melville">
Herman
Melville
</ref>
.
[
...
]
They
're
probably
the
writers
who
,
essentially
any
writer
who
is
angry
,
and
argues
a
lot
in
their
books
,
they
are
the
ones
I
tend
to
like
.
I
think
,
okay
,
I
think
<hi rend="italic">
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eminem">
Eminem
</ref>
</hi>
is
probably
my
real
,
my
real
influence
.

If
you
could
travel
back
in
time

what
advice

you
give

your
younger
self
?

[
Pauses
for
a
while
]
&quot;
Stop
partying
so
much
,
go
home
,
and
write
.
Because
it
takes
ages
,
and
you
are
going
to
regret
[
all
]
this
time
spent
partying
.
Because
ultimately
what
you
want
to
do
with
your
life
,
Ryan
,
is
n't
party
,
it
's
to
write
.
So
get
on
with
it
.
&quot;
That
's
what
I'ld
tell
twenty-year-old
Ryan
.
But
I
'd
tell
fourteen-year-old
Ryan
:
&quot;
Ignore
mum
and
dad
.
Keep
playing
video
games
;
it
's
gonna
help
in
the
long
run
.
