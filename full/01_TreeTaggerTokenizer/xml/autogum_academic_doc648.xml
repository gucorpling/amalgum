Discussion
</head>
<p>
We
reviewed
for
the
first
time
the
studies
concerning
the
relation
between
macrostructural
and/or
microstructural
features
of
sleep
and
ADHD
,
considering
the
investigations
of
the
last
15
years
.
</p>

Macrostructural
Pattern
</head>
<p>
The
results
concerning
the
macrostructural
parameters
are
quite
conflicting
,
and
drawing
a
coherent
framework
is
challenging
.
Almost
half
of
the
selected
studies
did
not
find
differences
in
the
sleep
architecture
of
children
with
ADHD
,
compared
to
those
with
typical
development
.
</p>
<p>
The
investigations
revealing
significant
differences
between
the
ADHD
and
HC
groups
demonstrated
that
the
clinical
samplea
are
characterized
by
poorer
sleep
than
controls
.
Indeed
,
the
longer
SOL
,
the
shorter
TST
,
along
with
the
reduced
SE
and
the
indices
of
faster
transition
of
stages/cycles
(
e.
g.
,
a
higher
rate
of
SS
and
a
greater
number
of
sleep
cycles
)
reflect
-to
some
extent-
the
sleep
dysregulation
in
ADHD
.
On
the
one
hand
,
the
assumption
that
children
with
ADHD
have
an
altered
sleep
architecture
is
consistent
with
the
subjective
parent
reports
,
mentioning
a
delayed
sleep
onset
or
a
sleep
fragmentation
with
several
night
awakenings
.
On
the
other
hand
,
the
sleep
difficulties
reported
by
parents
appear
to
be
significantly
higher
as
compared
to
objective
measures
.
The
gap
between
subjective
and
objective
measures
may
be
ascribed
to
other
factors
that
cannot
be
revealed
by
the
PSG
recordings
.
The
subjective
reports
of
increased
SOL
—
confirmed
only
by
some
investigations
using
objective
measures
(
e.
g.
,
)
—
may
be
explained
by
“
behavioral
”
sleep
problems
occurring
<hi rend="italic">
before
</hi>
bedtime
.
In
this
regard
,
the
bedtime
resistance
could
depend
on
multiple
factors
:
(
a
)
inadequate
parenting
;
(
b
)
Inadequate
pre-sleep
bed
routines
and/or
sleep
environment
;
(
c
)
pharmacotherapy
side-effects
.
This
disturbance
in
ADHD
children
is
often
interpreted
as
oppositional
behavior
,
a
significant
source
of
distress
for
parents
.
In
light
of
the
above
,
it
is
fair
to
assume
that
subjective
reports
could
overestimate
sleep
problems
in
ADHD
,
reflecting
parental
concerns
.
</p>
<p>
NREM
sleep
architecture
did
not
show
specific
and
consistent
differences
between
children
with
ADHD
and
HC
.
We
have
to
underline
that
a
lower
SWS
has
been
found
in
an
ADHD
sample
characterized
by
a
higher
rate
of
comorbidities
or
when
a
higher
apnea-hypopnea
index
was
detected
.
In
this
respect
,
a
strong
relationship
between
SDB
and
ADHD
behavior
was
found
(
e.
g.
,
)
,
likely
inducing
the
disruption
of
sleep
homeostasis
and
less
deep
sleep
.
Moreover
,
as
previously
mentioned
,
the
exclusion
of
subjects
with
externalizing
and
internalizing
problems
from
the
analysis
abolished
all
differences
in
NREM
sleep
.
</p>
<p>
Although
no
other
differences
in
SWS
were
found
,
it
should
be
underlined
that
both
stage
4
amount
and
REM
sleep
density
were
correlated
with
the
improvement
in
motor
skills
performance
after
sleep
in
children
with
ADHD
,
as
assessed
by
Prehn-Kristensen
et
al.
.
This
study
suggested
a
possible
beneficial
role
of
sleep
on
tasks
measuring
procedural
memory
in
ADHD
,
that
–
instead-
showed
compromised
performance
during
the
waking
state
.
</p>
<p>
REM
sleep
abnormalities
seem
to
be
widespread
among
children
with
ADHD
,
consistently
with
previous
meta-analysis
.
REM
sleep
alterations
could
be
related
to
the
dysfunctional
reward
learning
,
one
of
the
core
deficits
of
ADHD
,
due
to
the
dopamine
hypofunction
.
</p>
<p>
Specifically
,
several
findings
highlighted
that
REM
sleep
duration
is
longer
in
children
with
ADHD
compared
to
controls
,
and
only
Gruber
et
al.
found
a
reduced
amount
of
REM
sleep
in
ADHD
.
It
is
worth
noting
that
this
latter
study
included
patients
with
PLMS
that
may
induce
REM
sleep
instability
,
contributing
to
its
shorter
duration
.
</p>
<p>
Interestingly
,
the
higher
REM
sleep
percentage
in
the
ADHD
group
was
found
along
with
a
higher
number
of
sleep
cycles
in
two
studies
.
As
already
suggested
,
the
increased
number
of
sleep
cycles
may
result
in
a
faster
transition
to
REM
sleep
,
contributing
to
the
increased
REM
sleep
amount
.
Once
again
,
the
presence
of
comorbidities
could
have
affected
these
results
.

Microstructural
Pattern
</head>
<p>
Concerning
the
eight
studies
reporting
sleep
microstructural
features
in
the
ADHD
group
,
the
results
are
not
homogenous
.
</p>
<p>
Findings
on
spindle
activity
are
still
scarce
and
very
difficult
to
interpret
.
In
particular
,
some
methodological
differences
in
the
spindle
analysis
should
be
taken
into
account
:
(
a
)
Saletin
et
al.
did
not
provide
a
specific
spindle
detection
,
analyzing
the
whole
sigma
band
;
(
b
)
some
protocols
did
not
include
parietal
derivations
,
where
the
spindles
typically
show
their
maximum
.
</p>
<p>
The
most
relevant
alterations
in
sleep
microstructure
of
ADHD
are
related
to
SWA
and
theta
activity
during
NREM
and
REM
sleep
,
respectively
.
