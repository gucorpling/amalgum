Introduction
</head>
<p>
Aerosols
are
known
to
affect
human
health
,
air
quality
,
and
climate
and
are
ubiquitous
in
the
atmosphere
.
They
can
also
act
as
condensation
nuclei
to
form
cloud
droplets
,
and
evaporation
of
liquid
water
from
the
cloud
droplets
allows
for
cycling
between
cloud
droplets
and
aqueous
aerosols
.
Cycling
between
these
two
aqueous
regimes
can
occur
on
timescales
of
seconds
to
minutes
,
significantly
shorter
than
the
typical
lifetime
of
aerosols
,
which
is
roughly
one
week
.
The
uptake
of
water
by
aerosols
or
the
evaporation
of
cloud
droplets
has
the
potential
to
impact
atmospheric
chemistry
by
altering
the
partitioning
of
semivolatile
species
,
or
perturbing
equilibrium
reactions
in
the
aqueous
phase
.
Although
the
composition
of
aqueous
aerosols
can
vary
considerably
,
liquid
water
and
aqueous
organic
material
are
a
significant
portion
of
atmospheric
aerosol
mass
,
and
much
of
the
aqueous-phase
organic
material
that
comprises
aerosols
is
known
to
be
secondary
.
The
cycling
between
aqueous
aerosols
and
cloudwater
provides
two
different
aqueous
environments
in
which
aqueous
secondary
organic
aerosol
material
(
aqSOA
)
can
form
.
Since
both
environments
are
aqueous
,
the
same
chemical
processes
occur
in
both
environments
.
However
,
different
processes
are
dominant
due
to
the
difference
in
water
content
,
and
therefore
dilution
of
nonvolatile
components
,
with
aqueous
aerosols
having
less
water
content
per
volume
of
air
than
cloudwater
where
clouds
are
present
.
For
example
,
relatively
lower
water
content
and
generally
lower
pH
are
typical
of
aqueous
aerosols
,
and
high
concentrations
of
organic
material
can
limit
the
availability
of
oxidants
.
This
results
in
dark
(
nonphotochemical
)
reactions
,
such
as
acid-catalyzed
accretion
reactions
and
organosulfate
formation
,
being
more
dominant
in
aerosol
water
than
in
cloudwater
.
Typical
cloudwater
pH
can
range
between
three
and
six
,
as
measured
at
the
Whiteface
Mountain
Field
Station
summit
observatory
in
Wilmington
,
NY
,
USA
,
whereas
aerosol
particles
tend
to
be
considerably
more
acidic
.

Isoprene
is
the
most
abundant
nonmethane
hydrocarbon
gas
in
the
atmosphere
and
a
major
source
of
aqSOA
.
One
of
the
most
significant
pathways
of
aqSOA
formation
from
isoprene
is
through
the
gas-phase
photooxidation
of
isoprene
to
form
isoprene
epoxydiols
(
IEPOX
)
.
IEPOX
secondary
organic
aerosols
(
SOA
)
,
which
in
part
consists
of
tetrols
and
organosulfates
,
is
formed
via
the
acid-catalyzed
ring
opening
of
the
epoxide
followed
by
nucleophilic
addition
of
water
or
anions
(
e.
g.
,
HSO4âˆ’
)
.
In
laboratory
studies
,
IEPOX
SOA
has
been
found
to
form
most
efficiently
at
low
pH
as
a
result
of
the
acid-catalyzed
ring-opening
step
.
The
low
pH
and
high
nucleophile
concentrations
in
aqueous
aerosol
provide
a
favorable
environment
for
IEPOX
SOA
formation
.
However
,
a
number
of
scenarios
which
are
believed
to
be
common
for
aqueous
aerosols
,
such
as
organic
coatings
,
phase
separation
,
or
low-viscosity
aerosols
,
are
known
to
result
in
mass
transfer
limitations
which
inhibit
the
uptake
of
IEPOX
into
aqueous
aerosols
,
limiting
subsequent
IEPOX
SOA
formation
.
Despite
this
,
IEPOX
SOA
is
observed
ubiquitously
in
the
environment
.
Therefore
,
it
is
possible
that
cloudwater
may
be
a
greater
source
of
IEPOX
SOA
than
previously
believed
.
Although
the
lower
acidity
and
sulfate
concentrations
of
cloudwater
would
make
the
rate
of
IEPOX
SOA
formation
in
cloudwater
lower
than
in
aqueous
aerosol
,
other
factors
,
such
as
high
liquid
water
content
and
lack
of
organic
coating
or
viscosity-based
mass
transfer
limitations
,
may
promote
SOA
formation
.
</p>
<p>
Currently
,
some
regional
and
global
models
cannot
accurately
predict
atmospheric
aqueous
organic
material
due
to
uncertainties
in
SOA
production
despite
the
availability
of
detailed
chemical
models
representative
of
atmospheric
processes
.
Such
discrepancies
between
models
and
observed
measurements
may
be
attributed
,
in
part
,
to
the
lack
of
consideration
of
the
cycling
between
cloudwater
and
aqueous
aerosol
in
the
models
.
Although
several
models
have
shown
that
SOA
formation
does
occur
in
cloudwater
,
the
extent
to
which
SOA
is
produced
as
compared
to
formation
in
aqueous
aerosol
is
unclear
since
very
few
models
represent
both
processes
.
In
this
work
,
we
aim
to
compare
IEPOX
SOA
production
in
both
cloudwater
and
aqueous
aerosols
while
considering
the
cycling
that
can
occur
between
the
two
phases
upon
evaporation
or
condensation
of
water
.
We
used
a
recently
updated
version
of
GAMMA
(
Gas-Aerosol
Model
for
Mechanism
Analysis
)
,
a
photochemical
box
model
developed
by
the
McNeill
group
,
to
quantify
IEPOX
SOA
formation
.
We
previously
used
GAMMA
and
a
related
model
,
simpleGAMMA
,
to
predict
IEPOX
SOA
in
aqueous
aerosols
,
and
the
results
were
in
good
agreement
with
ambient
measurements
.
The
recent
update
to
GAMMA
includes
uptake
of
IEPOX
and
subsequent
formation
of
SOA
in
cloudwater
,
allowing
for
the
direct
comparison
of
the
efficiency
of
IEPOX
SOA
formation
in
both
aqueous
environments
,
and
captures
the
coupled
effect
of
the
two
modes
of
processing
in
a
single
simulation
.
