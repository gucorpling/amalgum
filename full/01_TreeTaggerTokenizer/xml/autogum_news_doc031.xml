The
military
said
the
protests
were
an
&quot;
unprecedented
&quot;
demonstration
of
the
people
's
will
.

The
ultimatum
was
issued
by

state
television
hours

streams

including
the
youths
,
who
were
and
still
are
the
real
force
that
ignited
their
glorious
revolution
,

without
the
exclusion
of
any
party
&quot;
,
after
which
the
television

played
patriotic

The

also
said

would
enforce

the
people
wanted

&quot;
For
an
institution
of
state
to
come
and
stage
a
coup
against
the
president
,
this
will
not
happen
.
Any
force

is
a

The
ultimatum
was
due
to
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
that
protested
in
Egyptian
cities

yesterday
,
the
first
anniversary
of
Morsi
's
inauguration
,
and
today
,
demanding
Morsi
resign
.
Some
estimate
the
turnout
was
tens
of
thousands
,
some
hundreds
of
thousands
,
and
a
military
source
estimated
the
number
at
almost
fourteen
million
.
In
Cairo
,
the
protesters
were
massed
at
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Tahrir_Square">
Tahrir
Square

and
outside
the
presidential
palace
.
At

sixteen
people
died
and
780
were
injured
in
the
protests

Health
Ministry

<p>
Protesters
argue
Morsi
since
taking
power
has
failed
to
address
political
deadlock
,
economic
crises
,
and
personal
safety
problems
.
Many
are
angry
at
the
Muslim
Brotherhood
,
which
they
claim
hijacked
the
Egyptian
revolution
,
seizing
authoritarian
control
and
imposing
Islamic
law

<p>
The

reported
some
protesters
showed
anti-American
and
anti-Israeli
sentiment
,
noting
one
flag

A
presidential
spokesman
,
Ihab
Fahmi
,
said
people
must
&quot;
unite
and
listen
to
the
sound
of
wisdom
[
...
]
Political
diversity
necessitates
on
all
parties
to
abide
by
the
democratic
process
&quot;
.
Another
spokesman
,
Omar
Amer
,
said
&quot;
[
Morsi
]
announced
to
all
of
Egypt
’s
people
he
made
mistakes
and
that
he
is
in
the
process
of
fixing
these
mistakes
[
...
]
I
want
to
confirm
one
truth
,
if
there
is
a
total
lack
of
response
to
this
initiative
,
no
listening
to
it
,
no
interest
in
it
from
any
side
,
what
do
you
think
the
presidency
can
do
?
&quot;
.
Morsi
has
said
he
was
validly
elected
,
and
denied
instigating
religious
authority
clauses
in
the
new
Egyptian
constitution
.
