Guadalajara

<hi rend="bold">

Guadalajara
</ref>
</hi>
is
the
capital
of
the
central
state
of
<ref target="Jalisco">
Jalisco
</ref>
in
<ref target="Mexico">
Mexico
</ref>
,
and
the
second-largest
city
in
the
country
,
with
about
a
million
and
a
half
citizens
(
known
as
&quot;
Tapatíos
&quot;
)
.
It
is
considered
a
colonial
city
,
though
much
of
its
architecture
dates
from
the
independence
period
.
Although
it
has
a
far
more
relaxed
feel
than
<ref target="Mexico%20City">
Mexico
City
</ref>
,
the
city
center
can
still
seem
a
bit
stuffy
and
dusty
,
especially
during
rush
hour
when
the
sun
is
out
.
All
in
all
,
however
,
it
is
a
lovely
city
and
contains
many
nice
areas
for
walking
,
not
just
in
the
center
.
</p>
<head>
Understand
</head>
<p>
Guadalajara
is
Mexico
's
second
largest
city
,
and
one
of
the
fastest-growing
metropolitan
areas
in
the
country
.
This
growth
has
been
driven
in
part
by
the
booming
electronics
industry
in
the
industrial
outskirts
of
the
city
.
Other
important
and
growing
industries
are
pharmaceuticals
,
food
processing
,
and
fashion
.

<p>
Guadalajara
proper
is
divided
into
four
districts
corresponding
approximately
to
the
northwest
,
northeast
,
southwest
,
and
southeast
quarters
of
the
city
.
At
the
center
of
everything
is
the
main
area
of
interest
to
tourists
,
the
<hi rend="bold">
Centro
Histórico
</hi>
,
or
the
historic
downtown
.
Most
of
your
time
will
probably
be
spent
here
.
It
is
filled
with
colonial-era
buildings
and
,
famously
,
also
boasts
several
important
mural
paintings
by
Jalisco-born
José
Clemente
Orozco
,
one
of
Mexico
's
most
important
artists
.

History
</head>
<p>
The
co-founders
of
Guadalajara
were
Doña
Beatriz
de
Hernández
and
Governor
Cristobal
de
Oñate
.
In
the
Plaza
de
los
Fundadores
there
is
a
monument
in
honor
of
both
of
them
.
</p>
<p>
Guadalajara
,
and
Jalisco
in
general
,
were
the
epicenter
of
the
<hi rend="bold">
Cristero
Wars
</hi>
(
1926-1929
)
—
a
rebellion
by
Catholic
guerrillas
against
the
secularizing
reforms
of
President
Plutarco
Calles
.
One
of
the
first
armed
conflicts
of
the
rebellion
took
place
in
Guadalajara
in
the
<hi rend="bold">
Santuario
de
Nuestra
Señora
de
Guadalupe
</hi>
on
August
3
,
1926
,
where
a
group
of
several
hundred
Cristeros
engaged
in
a
shootout
with
federal
troops
.
Guadalajara
was
attacked
(
unsuccessfully
)
by
the
Cristero
armies
in
March
of
1929
.
</p>
<p>
In
the
1950s
,
Avenida
Juárez
was
widened
to
create
today
's
arterial
road
of
Juárez-Vallarta
which
you
see
today
.
A
famous
part
of
that
work
was
the
moving
of
the
central
telephone
exchange
without
the
disruption
of
service
.
Pictures
of
this
feat
of
engineering
can
be
seen
in
the
<hi rend="bold">
City
Museum
</hi>
<hi rend="italic">
(
Museo
de
la
Ciudad
)
</hi>
.
</p>
<p>
In
April
1992
,
Sector
Reforma
was
rocked
by
a
huge
explosion
of
gasoline
,
when
a
gasoline
pipeline
leaked
into
the
sewers
over
a
period
of
days
until
the
fumes
finally
detonated
.
Some
200
Tapatíos
were
killed
and
several
thousand
injured
.
The
explosion
affected
mostly
the
working-class
and
industrial
areas
on
the
south
side
of
the
city
.
</p>
<p>
In
May
1993
,
Cardinal
Juan
Jesús
Posadas
Ocampo
of
Guadalajara
was
killed
at
the
Guadalajara
airport
.
Though
at
the
time
the
murder
was
thought
to
have
been
some
sort
of
politically
motivated
assassination
,
subsequent
investigations
favor
the
theory
that
the
cardinal
was
caught
by
mistake
in
drug-related
violence
,
his
motorcade
having
been
mistaken
for
that
of
a
drug
lord
.
Cardinal
Ocampo
is
buried
beneath
the
high
altar
of
the
<hi rend="bold">
Catedral
de
Guadalajara
</hi>
,
probably
because
it
was
first
suspected
that
the
motives
for
his
murder
were
political
,
rather
than
accidental
.
