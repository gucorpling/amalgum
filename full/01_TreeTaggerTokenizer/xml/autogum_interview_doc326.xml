JR
:
</hi>
I
do
n't
know
if
I
have
a
most
treasured
,
but
I
have
a
most
precious
possession
.
Shall
I
go
get
it
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
Yeah
,
definitely
.
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
JR
:
</hi>
This
is
a
scraper
.
A
red
chert
scraper
that
I
found
walking
along
in
the
desert
in
New
Mexico
,
about
a
year
and
a
half
ago
.
Christmas
,
two
years
ago
.
With
two
kids
I
work
really
hard
--
pretty
much
constantly
.
But
the
thing
about
this
is
it
has
such
an
amazing
energy
,
to
hold
it
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
Mmm
.
I
feel
that
,
yeah
.
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
JR
:
</hi>
And
the
other
--
it
may
be
prehistoric
,
it
may
be
several
thousand
years
old
--
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
What
makes
it
a
scraper
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
JR
:
</hi>
This
is
what
's
interesting
,
to
me
--
after
you
killed
the
meat
,
this
is
what
you
would
use
to
scrape
the
inside
of
the
flesh
off
the
fur
.
Scraping
the
fat
or
the
gristle
off
the
top
of
the
meat
.
And
it
's
a
reminder
how
much
harder
things
were
,
you
know
?
Any
time
I
'm
feeling
down
on
myself
--
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
You
could
be
scraping
meat
off
bones
.
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
JR
:
</hi>
I
could
be
scraping
--
and
it
was
really
like
that
,
you
know
?
So
--
there
's
that
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
I
have
treasured
possessions
,
but
I
also
have
treasured
memories
.
I
found
a
suicide
in
the
woods
when
I
was
thirteen
:
a
kid
my
age
,
who
was
probably
fourteen
.
It
's
a
treasured
memory
in
some
ways
,
one
that
â€™s
lasted
my
whole
life
,
and
it
's
come
back
in
a
lot
of
ways
.
On
my
MySpace
profile
,
I
make
an
allusion
to
that
in
my
narrative
.
I
do
n't
think
people
actually
read
that
.
I
think
that
people
look
at
pictures
,
and
then
they
move
on
.
But
that
's
not
really
true
.
I
have
been
contacted
by
both
that
individual
's
younger
sister
,
who
was
eight
when
he
killed
himself
,
and
the
girlfriend
he
killed
himself
over
.
Separately
.
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
JR
:
</hi>
Yeah
,
people
do
read
the
stuff
on
there
.
People
do
.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">
JR
:
</hi>
The
kids
have
made
me
a
better
writer
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
Really
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
JR
:
</hi>
Yeah
,
on
the
Shakespeare
thing
,
I
think
part
of
what
was
holding
me
back
from
finishing
it
was
--
because
I
had
written
the
first
half
in
2003
--
that
I
had
n't
had
kids
.
I
did
n't
understand
the
characters
who
had
children
.
I
did
n't
really
understand
them
.
And
once
I
had
had
kids
,
I
could
approach
them
differently
.
And
it
's
great
when
kids
appear
in
your
work
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
Gives
it
depth
and
also
maybe
opens
you
up
to
a
new
audience
.
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
JR
:
</hi>
Yeah
,
I
ca
n't
believe
I
did
n't
have
any
kids
in
my
books
.
I
did
have
kids
in
my
first
novel
,
but
not
having
kids
or
parents
in
your
work
is
so
weird
.
It
's
just
such
a
weird
lack
.
You
often
see
literary
books
that
do
n't
have
them
.
