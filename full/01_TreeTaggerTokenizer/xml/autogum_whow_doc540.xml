Everyone
's

there
--
that
moment
when
you
're
browsing
the
Internet
and
you
come
across
a
video
of
some
lucky
duck
that
owns
a
guinea
pig
,
rat
,
dog
,
or
something
else
.
You

want
one
,

you
already
have
a
Fido
or
a
Priscilla
.

guide
to
help
convince

Research
thoroughly
.
Although
this
is
a
given
,
you
must
be
prepared
to
show
off

your
parents
and

knowledge
.
Not
to
mention
,
if
you
give
improper
care
to
your
pet
,
it
will
be
unhappy
and
mean
.
This
wo
n't

happy

Prepare
your
information
in
a
report-
but
be
ready
to
answer
any
questions
!
Also
,
be
sure
to
say
anything
that
will
indicate
that
the
pets
you
already
have
will
not
affect
your
new
furry-or
feathered-
friend
.

Cats
are
a
very
controversial
topic
,
especially
if
you
're
getting
a
smaller
pet
.
If
you
have
a
cat
,
try
to
convince
your
peers
that
your
new
pet
will
be
far
from
danger
.
</item>
<item>
If
you
're
asking
for
a
bigger
pet
,
such
as
a
dog
,
try
to
come
up
with
strategies
to
prevent
conflict
between
the
two
.

Try
to
be
as
responsible
as
possible
.
Make
some
kind
of
deal
with
with
your
parents
;
for
example
,
if
you
keep
your
room
clean
and
do
all
the
things
a
perfect
angel
child
will
do
,
they
'll
consider
getting
you
a
pet
.
#*Never
explicitly
say
,
&quot;
Get
me
a
pet
.
&quot;
It
's
everything
that
you
'll
do
stacked
up
on
top
of
each
other
that
'll
help
convince
a
parent
.

Pay
for
everything
!
If
your
parents
have
to
fork
over
$
200
to
buy
you
a
pet
,
that
is
almost
a
guarantee
you
will
get
a
no
.
Save
up
--
if
you
are
n't
willing
to
spend
some
cash
on
your
friend
,
maybe
you
should
n't
have
him/her
after
all
.

Find
out
why
your
parents
do
n't
want
you
to
have
this
certain
pet
.
If
your
parent
has
a
serious
reason
that
you
ca
n't
get
a
pet
,
like
if
you
want
a
dog
,
but
you
already
own
one
that
hates
other
dogs
,
and
for
some
reason
you
ca
n't
separate
them
,
then
try
suggesting
another
pet
,
like
a
ferret
,
hedgehog
,
or
hamster
.

Tips
</head>
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Do
n't
cry
,
scream
,
or
act
immature
if
they
say
no
.
Just
come
up
with
a
reason
to
counter
their
no
.
</item>
<item>
If
it
's
not
the
right
time
,
make
it
wait
.
Observe
your
peer
's
behavior
.
If
they
are
cheery
,
it
's
a
perfect
time
to
ruin
their
day
!
</item>
<item>
Do
n't
nag
,
but
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Be_Persistent">
be
persistent
</ref>
.
Parents
will
almost
always
say
no
,
and
then
maybe
even
try
to
ignore
your
request
.
</item>
<item>
If
a
recent
pet
has
passed
away
and
you
're
looking
for
a
replacement
to
fill
that
empty
space
in
your
heart
,
it
would
be
a
good
time
to
ask
.
</item>
<item>
Sometimes
your
parents
just
wo
n't
break
,
so
sometimes
,
you
have
to
give
it
time
.
Sometimes
maybe
even
a
year
,
but
if
you
really
want
the
pet
,
you
will
still
want
it
when
the
time
comes
to
bring
it
up
again
.
</item>
<item>
Politely
ask
,
and
if
they
say
no
,
wait
two
to
three
days
before
asking
again
.
</item>
<item>
If
you
already
have
a
pet
,
and
do
n't
take
full
responsibility
of
it
,
take
more
responsibility
so
you
can
show
your
parents
that
you
are
responsible
enough
for
another
one
.
</item>
<item>
Do
all
your
chores
and
everything
before
they
ask
.
They
will
immediately
think
you
are
more
responsible
.
</item>
<item>
Come
up
with
good
reasons
why
you
should
have
both
,
but
make
sure
that
there
are
no
counter
arguments
to
your
reasons
because
of
there
are
then
it
might
seem
like
your
parents
know
more
than
you
about
getting
pets
and
just
say
no
and
remember
not
to
forget
about
your
other
pet(s)
if
you
do
get
a
new
one
because
of
you
do
then
your
parents
might
give
away
one
or
all
of
your
pets
.
</item>
<item>
If
you
have
other
animals
try
to
clean
,
bathe
,
feed
and
spend
time
with
them
and
maybe
they
will
see
how
responsible
you
can
be
.
</item>
<item>
Be
very
responsible
and
show
off
in
front
of
your
parents
whether
that
means
picking
up
trash
or
cleaning
up
the
dishes
to
keeping
your
room
tidy
but
do
it
without
being
asked
.
Do
n't
just
do
it
for
a
day
,
keep
at
it
hard
wok
pays
off
.
</item>
<item>
Find
what
animal
you
want
,
then
research
all
about
it
,
frequently
throw
facts
about
the
animal
to
them
but
not
to
often
that
your
annoying
,
then
find
a
good
time
to
ask
.
If
they
say
no
,
ask
why
then
solve
the
problems
.
Ask
again
a
few
days
later
,
no
again
?
Make
a
speech
!
</item>
<item>
If
there
are
any
animals
in
the
house
hold
that
are
not
yours
,
try
taking
care
of
it
for
a
week
or
two
,
this
will
show
your
parents
that
you
are
able
to
take
care
of
another
pet
.

Remember
never
to
get

about
a
new
one
--

're
all
living
creatures
and
deserve
equal
care
and
respect
