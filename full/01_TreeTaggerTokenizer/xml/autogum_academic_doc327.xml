Introduction

<p>
Floor
cleaning
in
a
commercial
and
domestic
environment
is
usually
a
monotonous
,
tedious
,
and
boring
task
,
and
thus
robots
are
a
viable
alternative
option
to
perform
such
tasks
.
The
floor
cleaning
problem
has
attracted
many
researchers
as
it
extends
the
focus
on
the
problem
of
path
planning
,
the
design
of
the
robot
,
executing
autonomous
motion
,
and
area
coverage
in
an
unstructured
environment
.
Many
commercially
available
cleaning
robots
,
like
iRoomba
,
Samsung
Powerbot
,
Bobsweep
,
Moneual
RYDIS
,
Miele
scout
,
Infinuvo
Clean
Mate
,
etc.
,
are
available
with
autonomy
and
path
planning
features
.
However
,
these
fixed
morphology
robots
are
generally
either
equipped
with
selected
modules
like
wet
mopping
,
dry
cleaning
,
autodocking
for
recharge
and
vacuum
modules
.
Apart
from
this
,
one
major
factor
for
their
performance
loss
is
due
to
fixed
morphology
design
.
Their
fixed
physical
morphology
act
as
a
constraint
on
the
area
covered
in
the
unstructured
environment
where
the
shape
,
size
,
and
location
of
obstacles
like
narrow
spaces
between
furniture
,
room
corners
,
and
curved
passages
are
unknown
during
navigation
.
</p>
<p>
The
design
philosophy
of
mechanically
transformable
shape
or
self-reconfigurability
is
beneficial
to
implement
in
a
cleaning
robot
to
overcome
the
above-discussed
pitfalls
.
Reconfigurable
systems
are
defined
as
those
that
can
reversibly
attain
distinct
configurations
or
states
via
alternating
system
form
or
function
to
achieve
the
desired
outcome
within
acceptable
reconfiguration
time
,
cost
,
and
energy
.
The
mechanism
reconfigurability
is
classified
as
intra-reconfigurability
and
inter-reconfigurability
.
An
intra-reconfigurable
robot
can
be
viewed
as
a
collection
of
components
(
sensors
,
actuators
,
mechanical
parts
,
power
sources
,
controllers
,
etc.
)
acting
as
a
single
entity
while
having
the
ability
to
change
,
for
instance
,
its
structure
,
mobility
,
or
principal
activity
without
requiring
any
external
assembly
or
disassembly
.
The
inter-reconfigurability
defines
to
what
extent
a
robotic
system
can
change
its
morphology
through
assembling
and
disassembling
its
robotic
components
.
In
,
the
self-reconfigurable
mobile
robot
,
called
Hinged-Tetro
,
was
conceived
for
the
first
time
.
It
was
based
on
the
theory
of
hinged
dissection
of
polyominoes
as
reported
in
and
was
inspired
from
the
tile-matching
puzzle
video
game
called
“
Tetris
”
,
which
consists
of
four
identical
square
blocks
that
can
transform
into
seven
shapes
,
therefore
named
as
hinged-Tetro
.
</p>
<p>
In
the
first
reported
work
on
hinged-Tetro
,
the
hinged
dissection
of
polyominoes
was
described
in
detail
.
Using
theorems
on
hinged
dissection
in
which
using
the
lemmas
it
was
proved
that
the
hinged
Tetromino
(
hTetro
)
can
be
dissected
as
{
LLL
,
LLR
,
LRR
,
LRL
,
RLL
,
RLR
,
RRL
,
and
RRR
}
.
It
was
proved
that
only
LLL
and
LLR
dissection
could
attain
all
the
required
one-sided
transformations
or
forms
named
as
{
I
,
J
,
L
,
O
,
S
,
T
,
Z
}
on
the
basis
of
shape
as
shown
in
<figure>
Figure
1
</figure>
.
The
one-sided
polyominoes
are
distinct
when
none
is
a
translation
or
rotation
of
another
(
geometry
cannot
be
flipped
over
)
.
Note
that
the
two
pairs
,
i.
e.
,
{
L
,
J
}
and
{
S
,
Z
}
,
of
tetrominoes
look
very
similar
,
but
we
cannot
rotate
one
of
them
to
get
the
other
.
In
an
extension
of
this
work
the
nested
reconfigurability
and
reported
initial
tests
with
hTetro-LLR
without
the
dynamic
modeling
of
the
system
.
</p>
<p>
In
this
paper
,
we
carried
out
the
detailed
and
systematic
measure
for
the
power
consumption
during
the
reconfiguration
of
both
the
architectures
,
i.
e.
,
hTetro-LLL
and
hTetro-LLR
with
its
dynamic
modeling
,
simulation
,
and
experimental
results
.
Moreover
,
with
this
study
,
one
can
understand
the
current
consumption
and
behavior
of
hTetro
reflected
by
the
movement
of
each
hinge
motor
during
reconfiguration
.
As
hTetro
is
designed
to
perform
the
floor
cleaning
task
,
the
efficient
area
coverage
of
hTetro
over
the
fixed
morphology
robots
was
compared
.
Experimentally
,
they
observed
that
hTetro
covered
95
%
of
the
area
in
a
given
fixed
environment
.
</p>
<p>
Functional
modeling
is
a
key
step
in
the
product
design
process
,
whether
using
the
original
or
redesigns
with
the
inductive
approach
.
<figure>

depicts
the
advantages
of
the
reconfigurable
floor
cleaning
robot
in
terms
of
covering
sharp
edges
,
area
coverage
in
an
unknown
environment
.
In
this
work
,
we
have
built
the
hTetro-LLL
and
hTetro-LLR
,
as
shown
in
<figure>
Figure

b
,
c
,
respectively
,
with
each
of
its
block
designed
for
higher
payload
using
four
omni-wheels
.
The
four
omni-wheels
in
each
module
will
provide
mechanical
stability
to
the
base
along
with
the
higher
acceleration
over
the
three
omni-wheels
.
The
pavement
sweeping
robot
with
reconfigurability
and
differential
wheels
were
presented
in
.
The
matrices
for
analyzing
the
performance
are
,
measurement
of
the
covered
area
using
computer
vision
technique
and
the
distance
covered
by
the
cleaning
robot
which
depends
on
the
energy
consumption
.
To
evaluate
the
optimal
configuration
of
the
self-reconfigurable
robot
which
will
help
to
improve
power
management
will
be
extremely
useful
for
energy-efficient
performance
.
