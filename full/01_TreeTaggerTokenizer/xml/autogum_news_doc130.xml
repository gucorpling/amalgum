that

would
never

as

<p>
&quot;
We
shall
never

never

anything
that
smells
of

the

These
pathetic
puppets
taking
over
this
country
?
Let
's
see
.
That
is
not
going

,
&quot;
Mugabe
said
at
the
funeral
of
a
former

.
&quot;
It
shall
never
happen
...
as
long
as
we
are
alive
and
those
who
fought
for

country
are
alive
,
&quot;
he
added
.
&quot;
We
are
prepared

fight
for
our

and
to
go
to
war
for
it
.

<p>
He
described
Tsvangirai
and
the
opposition
as
&quot;
traitors
&quot;
and
characterized
them
as
puppets
of
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_Kingdom">
Great
Britain
</ref>
and
the
&quot;
white
man
&quot;
,
who
ruled
Zimbabwe
until
the
country
gained
independence
in
1980
.
&quot;
This
country
shall
not
again
come
under
the
rule
and
control
of
the
white
man
,
direct
or
indirect
,
&quot;
Mugabe
said

<p>
Mugabe
accused
British
Prime
Minister
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon%20Brown">
Gordon
Brown
</ref>
of
interfering
in
Zimbabwe
's
affairs
,
after
Brown
called
for
&quot;
free
and
fair
elections
&quot;
and
&quot;
an
end
to
violence
&quot;
on
Friday
.
&quot;
We
have
become
the
focus
of
the
British
and
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_States">
Americans
</ref>
.
The
U.S.
has
provided
$
70
million
to
the
MDC
for
regime
change
...
and
British
Prime
Minister
Gordon
Brown
is
interfering
in
our
internal
affairs
,
&quot;
Mugabe
said
.
&quot;
Once
again
we
want
to
make
it
clear
to
the
British
and
Americans
that
we
are
no
one
's
subjects
and
will
never
be
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
opposition
accuses
Mugabe
's
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZANU-PF">
ZANU-PF
</ref>
party
of
using
violence
and
intimidation
in
an
attempt
to
win
the
run-off
election
.
According
to
the
MDC
,
66
of
its
followers
have
been
killed
in
attacks
since
the
contested
March
election
,
in
which
Morgan
Tsvangirai
won
the
most
votes
but
failed
to
secure
a
majority
.
</p>
<p>
Today
,
police
arrested
Tsvangirai
for
the
fifth
time
in
less
than
ten
days
.
He
was
released
a
few
hours
later
along
with
11
of
his
colleagues
.
&quot;
It
is
clearly
impossible
to
talk
about
a
free
and
fair
election
in
Zimbabwe
,
&quot;
the
MDC
said
following
Tsvangirai
's
arrest
.
&quot;
To
suggest
otherwise
is
to
be
clearly
blind
to
the
grave
harassment
,
intimidation
and
violence
that
the
people
of
Zimbabwe
have
had
to
endure
over
the
past
few
years
.

The
Secretary-General
of
the
MDC
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendai%20Biti">
Tendai
Biti
</ref>
,
appeared
in
court
today
after
being
arrested
on
Thursday
.
Prosecutors
said
they
planned
to
charge
him
with
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treason">
treason
</ref>
,
for
proclaiming
victory
in
the
March
election
before
official
results
were
announced
and
for
&quot;
publishing
a
document
that
was
explaining
a
transitional
strategy
around
March
26
&quot;
.
Biti
's
lawyer
says
these
charges
could
carry
a
death
penalty
.

,
criticized
the
government
of

in
an
open
letter
,
demanding
an
end
to

,

and
violence
&quot;
.
Meanwhile
,
Mugabe
said
that
veterans
of
Zimbabwe
's
liberation
war
would
be
willing
to
take
up
arms
in
order
to
prevent
the
opposition
from
coming
into
power
