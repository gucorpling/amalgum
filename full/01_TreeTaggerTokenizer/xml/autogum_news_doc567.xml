notes
the
differences
.
&quot;
...
dock
identification
is
a
more
important
part
of
court
procedure
[
in
Scotland
]
and
therefore
pictures
of
the
accused
cannot
be
published
until
the
trial
is
over
.
Scottish
judges
consider
it
contempt
to
publish
pictures
of
the
accused
.
&quot;
Despite
this
,
many
sources
,
including
the
BBC
,
have
named
a
person
detained
by
police
and
published
their
photograph
.
The
BBC
did
this
online
,
in
addition
to
naming
the
detained
individual
on
Radio
4
.
</p>
<p>
Our
correspondent
is
based
in
Scotland
and
has
been
advised
by
a
lawyer
not
to
identify
anybody
detained
until
they
have
appeared
in
court
,
even
if
they
have
been
arrested
and
charged
.
The
Contempt
of
Court
Act
1981
is
designed
to
prevent
prejudicial
material
going
in
front
of
juries
before
trial
.
Although
UK-wide
legislation
,
the
law
is
interpreted
differently
north
of
the
border
than
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England%20and%20Wales">
England
and
Wales
</ref>
.
</p>
<p>
The
BBC
College
of
Journalism
advises
Scottish
legal
advice
be
sought
before
publishing
images
of
the
accused
.

notes
&quot;
the
law
has
tended
to
be
interpreted
more
strictly
in
Scotland
&quot;
but
does
not
advise
on
how
so
.
Images
of
arrested
persons
in
high-profile
cases
are
often
published
in
cases
south
of
the
border
.
</p>
<p>
Channel
4
is
also
amongst
organisations
to
have
named
the
detained
person
and
put
an
image
of
them
online
.
Police
announced
last
night
that
a
body
believed
to
be
the
missing
child
had
been
found
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fife">
Fife
</ref>
and
that
an
individual
had
been
detained
.
The
boy
had
been
missing
since
Thursday
morning
although
there
was
a
possible
sighting
of
him
then
.
Hundreds
of
volunteers
have
assisted
police
searching
the
Scottish
capital
for
the
boy
.

of
the

Unlike
in
England
and
Wales
,
where
only
the
Attorney
General
can
prosecute
contempt
of
this
sort
,
in
Scotland
the
media
organisations
can
be
charged
by
an
accused
person
.
Wikinewsies
in
Scotland
have
noted
remarks
made
about
the
named
person
's
alleged
wrongdoing
on
public
transport
and
Facebook
,
suggesting
widespread
knowledge
of
their
identity

<p>
Several
of
the
organisations
involved
are
no
stranger
to
being
prosecuted
for
contempt
over
cases
in
neighbouring
England
.
In
2011
<hi rend="italic">
The
Sun
</hi>
and
<hi rend="italic">
The
Daily
Mail
</hi>
were
successfully
prosecuted
for
contempt
by

Attorney
General
</ref>
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Dominic_Grieve">
Dominic
Grieve
</ref>
after
they
published
a
photo
of
a
murder
defendant
posing
with
a
gun
.
The
case
did
not
involve
firearms
and
Grieve
spoke
of
&quot;
seriously
impeded
or
prejudiced
&quot;
proceedings
if
any
jurors
saw
the
photos
.
The
trial
was
not
stopped
as
the
photo
was
removed
from
circulation
before
the
jury
saw
it
and
the
defendant
was
found
guilty
.
</p>
<p>
In
2011
<hi rend="italic">
The
Sun
</hi>
and
<hi rend="italic">
Mirror
</hi>
were
fined
for
reporting
negatively
about
an
arrested
suspect
in
the
high-profile
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder%20of%20Joanna%20Yeates">
Jo
Yeates
murder
investigation
</ref>
.
Chris
Jeffries
,
landlord
of
the
victim
,
was
subsequently
released
from
police
custody
and
proved
to
be
entirely
innocent
.
Jeffries
also
pursued
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/libel">
libel
</ref>
action
against
a
number
of
publications
.
Politicians
subsequently
considered
a
law
banning
the
naming
of
arrested
persons
who
have
not
been
charged
throughout
the
UK
as
a
direct
result
of
this
case
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">
The
Daily
Mail
</hi>
and
<hi rend="italic">
Mirror
</hi>
were
back
in
court
the
next
year
for
their
coverage
of
a
trial
involving
serial
killer
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi%20Bellfield">
Levi
Bellfield
</ref>
.
The
two
papers
were
again
fined
after
Dominic
Grieve
told
the
High
Court
in
London
of
an
&quot;
avalanche
&quot;
of
&quot;
seriously
prejudicial
&quot;
stories
.
The
papers
published
their
stories
after
Bellfield
was
convicted
of
abducting
and
murdering
schoolgirl
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milly%20Dowler">
Milly
Dowler
</ref>
.
The
trial
was
not
yet
over
,
however
,
as
the
jury
was
still
considering
an
additional
charge
relating
to
another
alleged
attempted
abduction
.
That
charge
was
dropped
because
of
news
coverage
.
