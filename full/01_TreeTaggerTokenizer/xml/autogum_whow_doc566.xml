Hold
a
Dog
and
Tickle
Its
Toes
</head>
<p>
When
owning
a
pupper
and
having
the
urge
to
tickle
it
,
you
want
to
do
it
properly
so
that
your
doggo
does
n't
give
you
strange
looks
or
misunderstand
your
intentions
.
If
your
doge
is
n't
ready
for
this
kind
of
intimacy
you
might
consider
talking
about
it
with
them
or
waiting
until
your
relationship
is
ready
for
it
.

To
do
the
Lappy
Tappy
,
you
must
first
get
the
doggo
into
your
lap
.
If
your
dog
is
smaller
this
step
is
easier
to
do
because
you
can
usually
just
pick
it
up
.
However
,
If
your
dog
is
bigger
you
might
have
to
lure
your
dog
.
Here
are
some
ways
to
get
the
dog
into
position
:

Words
of
endearment
.
Your
dog
probably
loves
you
,
but
if
they
do
n't
you
might
try
just
using
a
tone
of
voice
that
is
non-threatening
and
saying
something
like
,
&quot;
Here
puppy
.
&quot;
Or
&quot;
Come
here
precious
.
&quot;
</item>
<item>
If
all
else
fails
you
might
just
have
to
grab
the
doggo
and
carry
it
to
the
designated
spot
.
Be
careful
when
doing
this
because
some
doggies
do
not
like
to
be
picked
up
or
manhandled

Getting

Getting
the
pupper
into

the
harder
part

give
you
access
to
the
little
foot

you
wish
