Introduction

Gear
transmission
is
one
of
the
most
important
transmission
methods
in
modern
machinery
because
of
its
many
attractive
properties
like
high
transmission
efficiency
,
accurate
and
stable
,
high
transmission
power
,
and
wide
applicable
speed
range
.
With
the
progress
of
technology
and
the
development
of
gear
transmission
,
the
gear
is
developed
toward
high
speed
,
heavy
load
,
complex
service
environment
,
and
high
reliability
.
The
development
of
transmission
systems
has
made
gear
materials
to
be
upgraded
in
the
direction
of
light
weight
,
good
wear
resistance
,
good
corrosion
resistance
,
and
economic
efficiency
.
</p>
<p>
The
primary
failure
mode
of
gears
is
wear
,
which
is
a
gradual
loss
of
surface
materials
because
of
the
friction
between
the
two
contact
gears
.
The
friction
on
the
gear
surfaces
greatly
affects
the
power
loss
and
service
life
of
the
transmission
system
.
Unfavorable
working
environment
,
such
as
poor
lubricity
,
can
lead
to
rapid
failure
of
the
gears
,
seriously
undermining
the
reliability
of
the
transmission
system
.
According
to
incomplete
statistics
,
about
1/3~1/2
of
primary
energy
is
consumed
by
friction
,
and
about
70
%
of
equipment
failures
are
related
to
the
wear
failure
of
gears
.
Therefore
,
how
to
improve
the
gear
service
performance
,
reduce
material
loss
and
energy
consumption
,
and
avoid
safety
accident
caused
by
friction
and
wear
are
of
great
significance
.
</p>
<p>
Improving
the
wear
resistance
of
gear
materials
mainly
starts
from
two
aspects
:
one
is
to
improve
the
surface
hardness
of
the
gear
material
,
and
the
other
is
to
introduce
a
lubricating
medium
.
For
the
first
,
surface
strengthening
methods
such
as
carburizing
,
nitriding
,
carbonitriding
,
thermal
chromizing
,
electron
beam
surface
treatment
,
electro
brush-plating
,
double
glow
plasma
surface
alloying
,
or
deformation
induced
martensite
are
commonly
used
to
improve
the
performance
of
the
steel
surface
.
However
,
the
hard
surface
accelerates
the
wear
of
its
counterpart
and
is
ineffective
in
preventing
strain
fatigue
of
the
substrate
,
which
results
in
scuffing
failure
,
especially
under
boundary
lubrication
of
rubbing-pairs
.
Generally
,
the
lubricity
of
the
materials
can
be
improved
by
introducing
liquid
or
solid
lubrication
medium
,
designing
shallow
holes
for
storing
lubricating
oil
on
the
surface
of
the
material
,
introducing
nanoparticles
as
lubricant
additives
,
replacing
metal
–
metal
friction
pairs
by
metal
–
polymer
ones
,
surface
texturing
treatment
,
and
surface
geometry
modification
.
Depositing
a
solid
lubricating
coating
on
the
gear
surface
is
considered
to
be
a
simple
and
very
effective
approach
to
improve
the
wear
resistance
of
materials
.
FeS
is
considered
as
an
excellent
solid
lubricant
because
of
its
hexagonal
structure
,
low
shear
strength
,
and
high
melting
point
.
Moreover
,
the
cost
is
very
low
,
only
about
1
%
that
of
MoS2
coating
which
is
also
considered
as
a
good
solid
lubricant
for
the
gears
.
Recently
,
it
has
been
confirmed
that
the
FeS
solid
lubrication
coatings
deposited
on
steels
by
ion
sulfurizing
,
plasma
spraying
,
plasma
source
ion
sulfurizing
,
can
significantly
improve
the
lubrication
property
of
steels
.
In
this
study
,
the
FeS
coatings
were
prepared
on
commercial
AISI
5140
steel
by
a
chemical
bath
deposition
(
CBD
)
coating
technique
at
various
temperatures
.
The
influence
of
reaction
temperature
on
the
microstructure
,
microcracks
,
and
lubrication
properties
were
investigated
.
