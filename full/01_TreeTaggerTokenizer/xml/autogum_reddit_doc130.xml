Hey
guys
,
so
I
am
going
to
be
getting
a
pair
of
AirPods
for
the
first
time
in
about
two
weeks
.
I
wanted
to
know
what
you
guys
think
of
them
.
Please
only
respond
if
you
’ve
had
them
for
an
extended
period
of
time
(
6+
months
)
as
I
want
to
know
how
well
they
hold
up
.
I
plan
on
using
them
about
3
hours
a
day
.
Thanks
everyone
!
(
P.S.
if
you
’ve
had
them
under
6
months
but
are
really
feeling
like
chiming
in
or
have
some
helpful
tips
or
advice
please
feel
free
to
join
in
!

I
’ve
had
mine
for
about
4
months
give
or
take
so
I
wo
n’t
mention
anything
about
longevity
but
I
use
mine
probably
6
hours
a
day
with
about
1.5
being
on
the
phone
and
would
never
make
it
an
entire
day
without
the
case
but
this
is
a
non
issue
because
the
case
is
always
in
my
pocket
.
They
last
far
less
time
on
the
phone
.
I
think
the
2
rated
hours
is
pretty
accurate
but
mine
are
almost
never
at
100
%
when
I
start
a
phone
call
.
Usually
I
only
use
one
at
a
time
and
they
charge
faster
than
they
discharge
so
I
’ve
never
been
caught
without
them
or
even
really
been
bothered
by
them
not
lasting
super
long
on
the
phone
.
</p>
<p>
The
case
also
charges
quite
fast
and
I
tend
to
plug
that
in
every
couple
of
days
or
just
while
on
a
quick
car
ride
just
out
of
habit
and
rarely
because
it
’s
actually
dead
.
</p>
<p>
With
the
case
charger
being
always
in
my
pocket
it
is
n’t
super
common
for
me
to
run
out
of
battery
when
I
’m
listening
to
music
throughout
the
day
but
I
do
try
and
get
equal
use
out
of
left
and
right
and
switch
between
the
two
.
I
feel
out
of
the
loop
if
I
leave
both
while
at
work
.
</p>
<p>
Due
to
using
them
one
at
a
time
a
lot
I
was
worried
about
one
battery
wearing
faster
than
the
other
but
I
have
n’t
noticed
anything
yet
.
</p>
<p>
My
biggest
gripe
is
the
switching
back
and
forth
with
my
phone
and
Apple
Watch
.
I
honestly
have
n’t
figured
out
if
it
’s
a
phone
,
watch
,
or
airpods
issue
but
quite
often
the
airpods
will
get
stuck
in
limbo
and
wo
n’t
connect
to
the
Apple
Watch
.
Almost
always
they
reconnect
to
the
phone
but
I
have
a
few
playlists
(
workout
mostly
”
on
my
watch
that
I
do
n’t
leave
on
my
phone
since
it
’s
not
with
me
on
a
run
.
If
I
happen
to
want
to
play
one
of
those
songs
and
my
phone
is
in
Bluetooth
range
it
’s
about
a
25
%
success
rate
of
actually
being
able
to
listen
to
them
without
manually
pairing
them
the
the
watch
.
</p>
<p>
Anyways
sorry
for
rambling
.
Feel
free
to
PM
me
if
you
have
any
questions
.
</p>
<p>
Edit
:
I
would
recommend
getting
a
pair
and
never
looking
back
at
your
wired
earbuds
again
</p>
