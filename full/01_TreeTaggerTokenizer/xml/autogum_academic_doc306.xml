Introduction

<p>
Transparent
conductive
oxides
(
TCOs
)
play
an
important
role
as
contact
materials
in
solar
cells
.
The
front
contacts
simultaneously
fulfill
numerous
requirements
:
high
transparency
,
high
conductivity
,
and
in
some
cases
exhibit
a
surface
texture
that
facilitates
a
good
optical
performance
of
the
solar
cell
.
Many
publications
have
already
addressed
the
importance
of
balancing
the
transparency
to
reduce
absorption
losses
and
the
electrical
properties
of
TCO
films
in
thin-film
solar
cells
.
An
even
larger
number
of
publications
address
the
importance
of
rough
interfaces
for
optical
performance
.
While
most
studies
focus
on
silicon
thin
film
solar
cells
,
light
management
has
been
studied
in
copper
indium
gallium
selenide
(
CIGS
)
and
metal
halide
perovskite
technology
as
well
.
The
majority
of
these
publications
refer
to
the
necessity
of
good
light-trapping
in
the
device
to
foster
the
absorption
of
the
otherwise
weakly
absorbed
red
portion
of
the
solar
spectrum
.
Ideally
,
the
light
is
trapped
completely
within
the
device
due
to
total
internal
reflection
or
in
other
words
:
it
is
coupled
to
waveguide
modes
.
The
pathway
enhancement
is
of
special
importance
for
the
wavelength
range
that
faces
a
low
absorption
coefficient
(
in
silicon
:
700
nm
–
1100
nm
)
.
Numerous
optical
models
have
been
designed
to
describe
the
scattering
effects
at
the
front
ZnO
:
Al/Si
interface
.
While
the
haze
,
which
represents
scattering
of
the
rough
interface
transmitted
or
reflected
into
air
,
is
easily
measured
,
scattering
of
that
interface
towards
the
subsequent
silicon
layer
with
a
higher
refractive
index
reduces
the
scattering
angle
by
refraction
.
Recent
studies
also
addressed
the
importance
of
the
back
contact
texture
rather
than
the
front
contact
texture
.
In
a
simple
picture
,
the
light
passes
the
front
contact
interface
with
small
scattering
angles
,
while
a
significant
scattering
takes
place
at
the
rough
reflector
.
However
,
the
coupling
to
waveguide
modes
is
a
complicated
interplay
between
front
and
back
surface
texture
.
Hence
,
the
back
contact
topography
is
of
great
importance
for
the
light-trapping
ability
of
the
solar
cell
.
Before
light
can
be
trapped
it
has
to
enter
the
absorber
layer
first
.
This
is
facilitated
by
an
improvement
of
the
light-coupling
into
the
device
and
is
very
important
for
technologies
using
absorbers
with
high
refractive
index
like
silicon
.
Some
groups
applied
special
anti-reflection
coatings
with
intermediate
refractive
index
between
the
TCO
and
the
silicon
.
In
addition
,
rough
interfaces
are
well
known
to
reduce
reflection
losses
.
An
effective
refractive
index
grading
at
rough
interfaces
is
given
once
the
two
materials
,
e.
g.
,
Si
and
TCO
,
mesh
in
the
sub-wavelength
length
scale
.
The
incoming
light
experiences
a
gradual
change
from
the
pure
refractive
index
of
ZnO
to
the
one
of
Si
.
The
extent
of
the
improvement
and
the
wavelengths
that
benefit
most
depend
strongly
on
the
texture
properties
.
Small
features
are
required
for
good
light-coupling
,
while
larger
features
more
effectively
scatter
light
.
Thus
,
double
textures
have
been
developed
including
chemical
deposition
of
ZnO
or
SnO2
,
etched
TCOs
,
a
combination
of
those
,
and
textured
substrates
.
A
theoretical
approach
to
double
textured
gratings
was
derived
by
Lee
et
al.
.
Some
papers
mention
the
anti-reflection
effect
.
However
,
a
detailed
distinction
of
the
effects
of
light
scattering
and
its
anti-reflection
effect
is
lacking
.

In
this
study
,
we
present
the
analysis
of
the
impact
of
different
surface
topographies
on
the
aspects
of
light-coupling
and
light-trapping
.
We
utilize
sputter-deposited
aluminum-doped
zinc
oxide
(
ZnO
:
Al
)
and
subsequent
wet-chemical
etching
to
demonstrate
various
kinds
of
textures
that
exhibit
different
abilities
for
light-trapping
and
light-coupling
.
As
a
detector
,
we
apply
a
silicon
thin-film
tandem
solar
cell
consisting
of
hydrogenated
amorphous
and
microcrystalline
silicon
as
absorber
.
Its
structure
is
given
in
<figure>
Figure

a.
Based
on
these
findings
a
double
texture
is
demonstrated
,
which
combines
the
advantages
of
providing
a
light
scattering
with
that
of
providing
a
light-coupling
interface
.
The
double
texture
was
realized
by
two-step
etching
of
sputter
deposited
ZnO
:
Al
.
Applied
in
a
tandem
solar
cell
it
showed
significant
improvement
in
optical
performance
.
