Nine
people
were
killed
on
Thursday
by
26-year-old
Chris
Harper
Mercer
on
the
campus
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umpqua%20Community%20College">
Umpqua
Community
College
</ref>
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roseburg,%20Oregon">
Roseburg
</ref>
,
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Oregon">
Oregon
</ref>
.
By
various
reports
seven
or
nine
people
were
also
injured
.
Officials
said
Mercer
killed
himself
during
the
subsequent
shootout
with
police
.
</p>
<p>
Mercer
began
the
killing
spree
in
a
class
where
he
was
a
student
by
shooting
the
class
teacher
,
and
killed
eight
students
in
that
and
at
least
one
other
classroom
.
In
the
next
classroom
,
a
student
nurse
unsuccessfully
tried
to
save
the
life
of
her
friend
who
was
wounded
by
the
gunman
.
Another
student
,
ex-soldier
Chris
Mintz
,
was
shot
seven
times
after
coming
to
help
.

<p>
The
reasons
for
the
attack
are
not
known
but
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/CNN">
CNN
</ref>
reports
he
singled
out
people
who
identified
themselves
as
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Christianity">
Christian
</ref>
.
The
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/BBC">
BBC
</ref>
noted
Mercer
may
have
revealed
his
plans
via
social
media
and
possibly
left
a
written
statement
.
He
briefly
served
in
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US%20Army">
US
Army
</ref>
in
2008
.

An

agent
said
authorities
found
six
weapons
at
the
college
and
a
further
seven
weapons
from
the
gunman
's
home
,
including
a
shotgun
,
all
of
which
appear
to
have
been
obtained
lawfully
by
Mercer
and
members
of
his
family
.
State
laws
permit
people
to
carry
concealed
weapons
in
higher
education
institutions
and
at
least
one
other
person
at
the
college
was
armed
.
Oregon
recently
passed
a
new
gun
law
in
response
to
a
shooting
incident
in
2012
,
in
which
a
man
used
a
stolen
rifle
to
murder
two
other
people
in
a

<p>
Later
on
Thursday
,
President
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Barack_Obama">
Barack
Obama
</ref>
spoke
for
twelve
minutes
about
the
incident

called
for
stricter

in
line
with
other
countries
like

Referring
to
earlier
similar
shootings
,
he
said
&quot;
Somehow
this
has
become
routine
.
The
reporting
is
routine
.
My
response
here
at
this
podium
ends
up
being
routine
,
the
conversation
in
the
aftermath
of
it
.
We
have
become
numb
to
this
&quot;
.
This
is
reportedly
the
fifteenth
occasion
Obama
has
spoken
out
after
such
a
killing
spree
.
He
expressed
his
belief
that
there
would
soon
be
a
&quot;
press
release
&quot;
from
the
pro-gun
lobby
,
who
would
call
for
a
reduction
of
gun
controls
.
He
also
predicted
there
would
be
criticism
levelled
at
him
about
his
politicization
of
the
matter
,
but
he
said
&quot;
this
is
something
we
should
politicize
.
&quot;
Although
no
new
initiative
was
outlined
,
Obama
highlighted
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/US_Congress">
Congressional
</ref>
opposition
which
had
stopped
&quot;
the
collection
of
data
on
shooting
incidents
&quot;
and
stated
&quot;
this
is
not
something
I
can
do
myself
.
