Is
n’t
the
answer
to
that
question
that
wise
decisions
are
made
with
a
basis
from
memory
?
Although
a
computer
can
have
…
</hi>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">
SP
</hi>
:
No
,
no
.
Forget
memory
.
Look
,
the
new
age
is
unprecedented
.
When
something
is
unprecedented
,
it
means
it
does
n’t
have
a
past
,
does
n’t
have
a
history
.
It
’s
totally
oriented
on
the
future
.
And
whoever
dwells
in
the
past
,
does
n’t
understand
the
future
because
the
past
is
full
of
prejudices
,
of
commitments
.
It
arrests
us
.
And
then
you
say
you
wo
n’t
commit
a
mistake
,
so
you
’ll
commit
new
mistakes
.
It
does
n’t
matter
.

What
about
the
adage
,
“
Those
who
forget
history
are
doomed
to
repeat
it
”
?
</hi>

<hi rend="bold">
I
say
brains
is
the
greater
producer
of
wealth
,
not
oil
.
It
’s
limitless
,
and
you
’ll
see
that
the
GNP
of
Israel
is
very
close
to
the
Saudis
’
.
So
they
are
3
times
larger
than
us
and
they
have
all
the
oil
in
the
world
.
We
have
brains
.

Peres

on
whether

eclipse

So
they
will
make
new
mistakes
.
Mistake
is
inevitable
as
long
as
there
are
human
beings
.
But
you
cannot
repeat
mistakes
because
the
world
is
not
built
on
repetition
;
it
’s
built
on
mutation
.

Do
n’t
you
think
Darfur
is
repetition
?
</hi>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">
SP
</hi>
:
I
think
Darfur
is
,
again
,
the
last
,
or
among
the
last
battles
between
old
and
new
.
What
are
they
fighting
for
?
What
are
they
killing
killing
killing
over
?
They
do
n’t
carry
futures
.
It
’s
not
a
mistake
.
It
belongs
to
a
past
.
It
does
n’t
have
a
moment
.
I
am
sure
that
the
reasons
for
war
are
over
,
even
though
still
there
are
wars
which
are
an
inertia
from
the
past
,
a
continuation
that
does
n’t
make
sense
.
I
’m
answering
your
question
.
The
problem
is
how
to
enable
the
whole
world
to
enter
the
new
future
,
including
the
Arabs
.
And
there
are
already
Arabs
who
did
it
.
Look
at
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accession%20of%20Turkey%20to%20the%20European%20Union">
Turkey
,
who
is
knocking
on
the
doors
of
the
united
Europe
</ref>
.
Why
?
It
’s
not
a
geographic
endeavor
,
it
is
an
intellectual
endeavor
.
They
say
you
can
be

DS
:
Like
Dubai
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
SP
</hi>
:
Dubai…you
must
be
very
careful
because
Dubai
is
a
small
people
with
a
large
service
sector
.
The
citizens
of
Dubai
are
almost
unnoticed
.
The
rest
are
hired
people
.
Turkey
is
different
.
Take
Dubai
or
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar">
Qatar
</ref>
;
in
Qatar
you
have
180,000
citizens
with
700,000
foreign
workers
.
That
also
belongs
to
the
past
,
because
you
see
what
’s
happening
:
they
live
on
oil
.
Oil
is
not
produced
by
human
beings
,
the
producer
of
oil
is
the
land
.
It
takes
a
million
years
to
produce
oil
without
any
human
interferences
.
The
need
for
oil
is
growing
,
so
the
cost
of
oil
goes
up
which
is
forcing
people
to
go
to
alternative
energies
to
balance
it
.
Just
because
oil
is
discovered
does
n’t
mean
every
year
more
and
more
and
more
people
will
pay
for
the
same
discovery
.
To
hell
with
you
,
I
shall
look
for
an
alternative
!
Even
for
Israel
.
If
you
have
to
make
a
choice
between
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi%20Aramco">
Saudi
Arabia
</ref>
and
the
sun
,
it
should
go
to
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar%20energy">
sun
</ref>
.
