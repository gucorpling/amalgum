Research
Methodology
,
Sample
and
Data
Collection
</head>
<p>
The
methodological
approach
of
this
research
is
quantitative
.
The
sample
consists
of
the
2019
MOOCs
on
citizenship
and/or
sustainability
;
allowing
a
selection
of
161
MOOCs
from
Coursera
(
38
)
,
Edx
(
117
)
and
MiriadaX
(
6
)
that
can
be
divided
into
five
macro
reference
areas
(
<figure>
Figure

</figure>
)
:
Experimental
Sciences
(
38
)
,
Health
Sciences
(
9
)
,
Technical
Teachings
(
5
)
,
Social
and
Legal
Sciences
(
85
)
and
Humanities
(
24
)
.
The
search
bars
from
the
respective
platforms
were
used
to
define
the
sample
.
Keywords
for
searching
were
“
citizen
”
,
“
citizenship
”
,
“
sustainability
”
and
“
footprint
”
,
in
all
languages
of
the
European
Union
(
EU
)
.
</p>
<p>
Regarding
the
didactical
and
technical
dimensions
of
MOOCs
,
the
data
collection
tool
is
adapted
from
the
<hi rend="italic">
Questionnaire
for
the
evaluation
of
teaching
</hi>
,
<hi rend="italic">
technical
and
educational
aspects
of
teaching
sites
</hi>
and
<hi rend="italic">
Questionnaire
</hi>
to
measure
the
quality
of
a
MOOC
;
maintaining
,
with
exceptions
,
the
’
Yes
’
and
’
No
’
scale
.
In
relation
to
the
specific
citizenship
and
sustainability
blocks
,
items
for
data
collection
are
related
to
the
theoretical
background
described
above
,
focusing
on
main
elements
of
the
different
types
of
citizenship
and
fingerprints
for
sustainability
;
including
the
following
scale
:
With
,
&quot;
not
worked
&quot;
,
&quot;
indirectly
worked
&quot;
,
&quot;
explicitly
worked
&quot;
.
</p>
<p>
The
instrument
consists
of
three
items
for
classification
(
massive
open
online
course
(
MOOC
)
platform
,
educational
institution
,
macro
reference
area
)
,
followed
by
a
series
of
items
that
have
been
grouped
based
on
a
four-part
system
related
to
the
categories
system
.

Categories
System
and
Data
Analysis
</head>
<p>
Once
the
problem
is
defined
and
after
the
bibliographic
review
,
a
system
of
categories
whose
specific
structure
is
adapted
from
several
proposals
is
designed
.
This
system
consists
of
four
categories
:
Didactic
dimension
(
Table
1
)
,
technical
dimension
(
Table
2
)
,
citizenship
(
Table
3
)
and
sustainability
(
Table
4
)
.
</p>
<p>
After
categorization
,
prior
to
the
analysis
and
with
the
support
of
the
“
SPSS
”
statistical
program
,
the
data
are
entered
.
Subsequently
,
descriptive
methods
(
exploratory
analysis
)
are
applied
for
all
categories
and
correlational
(
factor
analysis
)
for
16
items
of
the
specific
categories
of
citizenship
and
sustainability
that
allow
us
to
discover
the
latent
relationships
between
variables
.
