Anti-Giardiasis
</head>
<p>
Giardiasis
is
caused
by
the
protozoan
parasite
<hi rend="italic">
G.
intestinalis
</hi>
(
also
known
as
<hi rend="italic">
G.
lamblia
</hi>
or
<hi rend="italic">
G.
duodenalis
</hi>
)
.
It
is
also
known
by
the
common
name
“
beaver
fever
,
”
because
this
infection
was
reported
in
campers
who
drank
contaminated
water
that
was
inhabited
by
beavers
.
Giardiasis
is
the
most
common
protozoan
infection
in
human
beings
,
and
it
occurs
in
both
developing
and
industrialized
countries
.
Its
global
incidence
is
believed
to
range
between
20
%
–
60
%
,
with
2
%
–
7
%
incidence
in
industrialized
nations
.
<hi rend="italic">
Giardia
intestinalis
</hi>
was
first
described
in
1681
after
the
Dutch
microscopist
Antonie
van
Leeuwenhoek
observed
the
protozoan
in
his
own
diarrheic
stools
.
This
disease
is
often
prevalent
in
poor
countries
and
communities
that
have
untreated
water
,
inadequate
sanitation
,
and
poor
dietary
status
.
The
infection
is
caused
by
fecal
–
oral
transmission
and
initiated
by
the
ingestion
of
infectious
cysts
from
contaminated
water
or
through
person-to-person
contact
.
After
excystation
,
flagellated
trophozoites
colonize
the
upper
small
intestine
,
where
they
attach
to
the
epithelial
lining
but
do
not
invade
the
mucosa
.
The
duration
of
Giardia
infection
is
variable
;
however
,
chronic
infection
and
reinfection
commonly
occur
.
Approximately
50
%
of
the
symptoms
classically
associated
with
giardiasis
are
asymptomatic
including
diarrhea
,
abdominal
pain
,
nausea
,
vomiting
,
and
anorexia
.
However
,
infected
individuals
can
also
develop
extraintestinal
and
postinfectious
complications
.
Chronic
extraintestinal
sequelae
may
affect
the
joints
,
skin
,
eyes
,
and
central
nervous
system
,
but
the
underlying
mechanisms
are
unknown
.
According
to
research
data
,
Giardia
has
eight
distinct
genetic
assemblages
labelled
as
assemblage
“
A
”
through
“
H
”
,
and
assemblages
“
A
”
and
“
B
”
are
responsible
for
infection
in
humans
.

Three
classes
of
drugs
are
currently
used
for
the
treatment
of
giardiasis
:
metronidazole
,
mepacrine
analogs
,
and
nitrofurans
,
such
as
furazolidone
(

)
.
Metronidazole
is
the
most
widely
used
drug
for
the
treatment
of
giardiasis
globally
and
it
is
generally
effective
and
well-tolerated
.
However
,
the
United
States
Food
and
Drug
Administration
(
FDA
)
has
not
yet
approved
this
drug
for
the
treatment
of
Giardia
infection
because
of
its
toxicity
and
major
side
effects
,
such
as
seizures
,
ataxia
,
peripheral
neuropathy
,
transient
myopia
,
gastric
mucosal
irritation
,
sperm
damage
,
and
hematuria
.
Tinidazole
is
an
N1-position
modified
5-nitro
imidazole
,
which
has
been
approved
by
the
FDA
for
the
treatment
of
giardiasis
.
Nitazoxanide
(
NTZ
)
belongs
to
an
emerging
class
of
5-nitrothiazole
compounds
with
potential
antigiardial
activity
.
However
,
although
NTZ
is
generally
well
tolerated
,
some
adverse
effects
such
as
abdominal
pain
,
diarrhea
,
and
nausea
limit
the
safe
use
for
human
beings
.
Mepacrine
is
no
longer
available
in
the
United
States
,
and
it
is
being
replaced
in
most
of
its
applications
with
safer
and
more
specific
drugs
.
Furazolidone
also
has
serious
side
effects
,
such
as
gastrointestinal
disturbances
,
hemolytic
anemia
,
disulfiram-like
reactions
to
alcohol
,
and
hypersensitivity
reactions
,
as
well
as
evidence
of
tumorigenicity
in
rodent
studies
.
Furthermore
,
<hi rend="italic">
G.
lamblia
</hi>
resistance
to
this
drug
has
also
been
reported
.
Therefore
,
research
focusing
on
the
development
of
novel
,
alternative
drugs
for
the
treatment
of
giardiasis
is
highly
desirable
.
In
view
of
these
considerations
,
researchers
have
designed
and
synthesized
some
novel
molecules
for
the
treatment
of
giardiasis
,
their
results
are
summarized
in
Table
