I
CLIMB
THE
CRAGS
A
SECOND
TIME
</head>
<p>
I
remember
that
I
looked
over
the
brink
into
the
yeasty
abyss
with
a
mind
hovering
between
perplexity
and
tears
.
I
wanted
to
sit
down
and
cry
--
why
,
I
did
not
know
,
except
that
some
great
thing
had
happened
.
My
brain
was
quite
clear
as
to
my
own
position
.
I
was
shut
in
this
place
,
with
no
chance
of
escape
and
with
no
food
.
In
a
little
I
must
die
of
starvation
,
or
go
mad
and
throw
myself
after
Laputa
.
And
yet
I
did
not
care
a
rush
.
My
nerves
had
been
tried
too
greatly
in
the
past
week
.
Now
I
was
comatose
,
and
beyond
hoping
or
fearing
.
</p>
<p>
I
sat
for
a
long
time
watching
the
light
play
on
the
fretted
sheet
of
water
and
wondering
where
Laputa
's
body
had
gone
.
I
shivered
and
wished
he
had
not
left
me
alone
,
for
the
darkness
would
come
in
time
and
I
had
no
matches
.
After
a
little
I
got
tired
of
doing
nothing
,
and
went
groping
among
the
treasure
chests
.
One
or
two
were
full
of
coin
--
British
sovereigns
,
Kruger
sovereigns
,
Napoleons
,
Spanish
and
Portuguese
gold
pieces
,
and
many
older
coins
ranging
back
to
the
Middle
Ages
and
even
to
the
ancients
.
In
one
handful
there
was
a
splendid
gold
stater
,
and
in
another
a
piece
of
Antoninus
Pius
.
The
treasure
had
been
collected
for
many
years
in
many
places
,
contributions
of
chiefs
from
ancient
hoards
as
well
as
the
cash
received
from
I.D.B.
I
untied
one
or
two
of
the
little
bags
of
stones
and
poured
the
contents
into
my
hands
.
Most
of
the
diamonds
were
small
,
such
as
a
labourer
might
secrete
on
his
person
.
The
larger
ones
--
and
some
were
very
large
--
were
as
a
rule
discoloured
,
looking
more
like
big
cairngorms
.
But
one
or
two
bags
had
big
stones
which
even
my
inexperienced
eye
told
me
were
of
the
purest
water
.
There
must
be
some
new
pipe
,
I
thought
,
for
these
could
not
have
been
stolen
from
any
known
mine
.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
After
that
I
sat
on
the
floor
again
and
looked
at
the
water
.
It
exercised
a
mesmeric
influence
on
me
,
soothing
all
care
.
I
was
quite
happy
to
wait
for
death
,
for
death
had
no
meaning
to
me
.
My
hate
and
fury
were
both
lulled
into
a
trance
,
since
the
passive
is
the
next
stage
to
the
overwrought
.
</p>
<p>
It
must
have
been
full
day
outside
now
,
for
the
funnel
was
bright
with
sunshine
,
and
even
the
dim
cave
caught
a
reflected
radiance
.
As
I
watched
the
river
I
saw
a
bird
flash
downward
,
skimming
the
water
.
It
turned
into
the
cave
and
fluttered
among
its
dark
recesses
.
I
heard
its
wings
beating
the
roof
as
it
sought
wildly
for
an
outlet
.
It
dashed
into
the
spray
of
the
cataract
and
escaped
again
into
the
cave
.
For
maybe
twenty
minutes
it
fluttered
,
till
at
last
it
found
the
way
it
had
entered
by
.
With
a
dart
it
sped
up
the
funnel
of
rock
into
light
and
freedom
.
</p>
<p>
I
had
begun
to
watch
the
bird
in
idle
lassitude
,
I
ended
in
keen
excitement
.
The
sight
of
it
seemed
to
take
a
film
from
my
eyes
.
I
realized
the
zest
of
liberty
,
the
passion
of
life
again
.
I
felt
that
beyond
this
dim
underworld
there
was
the
great
joyous
earth
,
and
I
longed
for
it
.
I
wanted
to
live
now
.
My
memory
cleared
,
and
I
remembered
all
that
had
befallen
me
during
the
last
few
days
.
I
had
played
the
chief
part
in
the
whole
business
,
and
I
had
won
.
Laputa
was
dead
and
the
treasure
was
mine
,
while
Arcoll
was
crushing
the
Rising
at
his
ease
.
I
had
only
to
be
free
again
to
be
famous
and
rich
.
My
hopes
had
returned
,
but
with
them
came
my
fears
.
What
if
I
could
not
escape
?
I
must
perish
miserably
by
degrees
,
shut
in
the
heart
of
a
hill
,
though
my
friends
were
out
for
rescue
.
In
place
of
my
former
lethargy
I
was
now
in
a
fever
of
unrest
.
</p>
<p>
My
first
care
was
to
explore
the
way
I
had
come
.
I
ran
down
the
passage
to
the
chasm
which
the
slab
of
stone
had
spanned
.
I
had
been
right
in
my
guess
,
for
the
thing
was
gone
.
Laputa
was
in
truth
a
Titan
,
who
in
the
article
of
death
could
break
down
a
bridge
which
would
have
taken
any
three
men
an
hour
to
shift
.
The
gorge
was
about
seven
yards
wide
,
too
far
to
risk
a
jump
,
and
the
cliff
fell
sheer
and
smooth
to
the
imprisoned
waters
two
hundred
feet
below
.
There
was
no
chance
of
circuiting
it
,
for
the
wall
was
as
smooth
as
if
it
had
been
chiselled
.
The
hand
of
man
had
been
at
work
to
make
the
sanctuary
inviolable
.
</p>
<p>
It
occurred
to
me
that
sooner
or
later
Arcoll
would
track
Laputa
to
this
place
.
He
would
find
the
bloodstains
in
the
gully
,
but
the
turnstile
would
be
shut
and
he
would
never
find
the
trick
of
it
.
Nor
could
he
have
any
kaffirs
with
him
who
knew
the
secret
of
the
Place
of
the
Snake
.
Still
if
Arcoll
knew
I
was
inside
he
would
find
some
way
to
get
to
me
even
though
he
had
to
dynamite
the
curtain
of
rock
.
I
shouted
,
but
my
voice
seemed
to
be
drowned
in
the
roar
of
the
water
.
It
made
but
a
fresh
chord
in
the
wild
orchestra
,
and
I
gave
up
hopes
in
that
direction
.
