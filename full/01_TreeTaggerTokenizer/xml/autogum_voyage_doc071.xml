Nissa
is
one
of
the
most
important
sites
of
the
<hi rend="italic">
Parthian
Empire
</hi>
.
The
Parthians
ruled
in
Persia
from
247
BC
to
228
AD
.
They
defeated
the
Seleucids
(
successors
of
Alexander
the
Great
)
and
conquered
great
parts
of
the
Middle
East
and
southwest
Asia
.
</p>
<p>
The
earliest
settlements
in
the
area
of
Nissa
date
back
to
the
4th
millenium
BC
.
In
the
3rd
century
BC
the
Parthians
built
an
impressive
fortress
at
Old
Nisa
and
erected
a
royal
residence
,
which
probably
was
the
first
royal
residence
of
the
Parthian
kings
.
The
city
was
named
<hi rend="bold">
Mithradatkert
</hi>
(
fortress
of
Mithradates
)
during
the
reign
of
<hi rend="italic">
King
Mithradates
the
Great
</hi>
(
174-138
BC
)
.
Greek
sources
refer
to
the
city
as
administrative
and
economic
centre
during
the
reign
of
the
Arsacid
dynasty
.
The
Arsacid
dynasty
conquered
a
huge
area
from
the
Indus
to
the
Euphrates
and
Nisa
became
an
important
city
on
the
crossroads
of
many
cultures
from
Persia
,
Greece
and
Central
Asia
.
</p>
<p>
New
Nisa
was
conquered
by
the
Arabian
Caliphate
in
the
7th
century
and
became
part
of
the
Seljuk
Empire
in
the
11th
century
.
</p>
<p>
Archaeological
research
at
the
site
began
in
the
1930s
.
Since
1990
it
is
excavated

The
<hi rend="italic">
Building
with

Square
Hall
</hi>
is
the

city
(
<hi rend="italic">
ark
</hi>
)
and
the
lower
city
(
<hi rend="italic">
shakhristan
</hi>
)
.
The
layout
clearly
indicates
a
densely
populated
town
.
The
Parthian
buildings
are
interpreted
as
remains
of
the
fortress
,
burial
houses
and
storehouses
.
