Jointly
with
the
HTC
Corporation
,
Peng
led
a
team
,
called
Dynamical
Biomarkers
Group
(
DBG
)
,
of
physicians
,
scientists
and
engineers
to
compete
in
the
Qualcomm
Tricorder
XPRIZE
international
competition
,
the
biggest
biomedical
prize
in
history
.
Since
its
announcement
in
2012
,
this
XPRIZE
attracted
the
interest
of
more
than
300
teams
around
the
world
.
The
goal
of
the
competition
is
to
develop
a
mobile
solution
for
end-patients
to
diagnose
their
health
conditions
and
monitor
their
vital
signs
.
The
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricorder">
Tricorder
</ref>
name
is
based
on
the
medical
diagnostic
device
of
<ref target="http://www.startrek.com/">
Star
Trek
</ref>
fame
.
After
4
years
of
competition
and
several
rounds
of
eliminations
,
DBG
is
one
of
the
top
2
teams
that
advanced
to
the
final
round
of
competition
,
and
received
a
$
1
million
prize
for
its
achievement
in
April
2017
.
