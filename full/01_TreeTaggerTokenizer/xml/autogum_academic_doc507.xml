A
search
was
performed
of
regulatory
and
scientific
literature
to
identify
sources
of
clinical
data
to
be
used
to
compare
the
efficacy
and
safety
of
BRAFi/MEKi
combination
therapies
for
the
treatment
of
<hi rend="italic">
BRAF
</hi>
-mutant
metastatic
melanoma
.
The
full
details
of
the
literature
search
are
outlined
in
Table
S4
.
Four
phase
III
studies
were
identified
:
coBRIM
,
a
phase
III
trial
of
cobimetinib
plus
vemurafenib
versus
vemurafenib
monotherapy
in
previously
untreated
patients
with
advanced
<hi rend="italic">
BRAF
</hi>
-mutant
melanoma
;
COMBI-d
,
a
phase
III
trial
of
dabrafenib
and
trametinib
versus
dabrafenib
monotherapy
in
previously
untreated
patients
with
unresectable
stage
IIIC
or
stage
IV
melanoma
with
a
<hi rend="italic">
BRAF
</hi>
V600E
or
V600K
mutation
;
COMBI-v
,
a
phase
III
trial
of
dabrafenib
plus
trametinib
versus
vemurafenib
monotherapy
in
previously
untreated
patients
with
unresectable
stage
IIIC
or
IV
melanoma
with
<hi rend="italic">
BRAF
</hi>
mutation
;
and
COLUMBUS
Part
1
,
a
phase
III
trial
of
encorafenib
plus
binimetinib
versus
vemurafenib
or
encorafenib
monotherapy
in
patients
with
<hi rend="italic">
BRAF
</hi>
-mutant
melanoma
.
Three
of
the
identified
studies
(
coBRIM
,
COMBI-v
,
and
COLUMBUS
Part
1
)
,
had
vemurafenib
960
mg
twice
daily
(
BID
)
as
a
control
arm
,
and
were
the
chief
sources
of
data
for
the
comparisons
presented
here
.
Although
the
COMBI-d
was
identified
as
part
of
the
initial
literature
search
,
it
was
not
included
in
the
efficacy
comparison
of
the
cross-trial
comparison
due
to
the
lack
of
a
vemurafenib
control
arm
.
It
should
be
noted
,
however
,
that
the
outcomes
in
COMBI-d
were
substantially
similar
to
those
in
COMBI-v
.
The
key
design
features
of
the
three
included
phase
III
trials
are
summarized
in
Table
5
.
To
assist
with
the
completeness
of
the
cross-trial
comparison
,
medical
information
requests
were
made
to
the
registered
sponsor
of
cobimetinib
,
vemurafenib
,
dabrafenib
,
trametinib
,
encorafenib
,
or
binimetinib
if
any
missing
data
were
identified
.
</p>
<p>
The
data
sources
for
the
coBRIM
and
COMBI-v
trials
included
primary
and
secondary
publications
of
data
,
European
public
assessment
reports
(
EPAR
)
,
U.S.
Food
and
Drug
Administration
(
FDA
)
medical
review
documents
,
and
the
current
U.S.
prescribing
information
(
see
Table
S5
,
which
illustrates
the
data
sources
and
cutoff
dates
for
COMBI-v
,
coBRIM
,
and
COLUMBUS
trials
)
.
The
data
sources
for
the
COLUMBUS
trial
include
a
primary
publication
,
U.S.
prescribing
information
,
and
Array
BioPharma
data
on
file
.
</p>
<p>
The
efficacy
outcomes
presented
are
PFS
,
objective
response
rate
(
ORR
)
,
duration
of
response
(
DOR
)
per
investigator
assessment
,
and
OS
.
The
assessments
of
the
tumor
response
across
the
studies
were
performed
using
Response
Evaluation
Criteria
in
Solid
Tumors
(
RECIST
)
version
1.1
.
</p>
<p>
The
safety
comparisons
were
made
using
the
adverse
event
(
any
untoward
medical
occurrence
regardless
of
causal
relationship
)
and
adverse
drug
reaction
(
noxious
and
unintended
responses
with
at
least
a
reasonable
possibility
of
a
causal
relationship
)
data
.
The
adverse
event
data
included
the
overall
summaries
(
comprising
all-grade
,
serious
,
and
grade
3/4
AEs
,
and
AEs
leading
to
death
,
dose
interruption/modification
,
and
discontinuation
)
and
the
incidence
of
specific
all-grade
and
grade
3/4
AEs
by
individual
preferred
terms
per
the
MedDRA
dictionary
.
All
studies
utilized
the
National
Cancer
Institute
(
NCI
)
Common
Terminology
Criteria
for
Adverse
Events
(
CTCAE
)
to
assess
severity
.
The
coBRIM
and
COMBI-v
trials
used
version
4.0
,
whereas
the
COLUMBUS
trial
used
version
4.03
.
The
primary
source
of
data
on
adverse
drug
reactions
was
the
available
U.S.
prescribing
information
.
The
additional
adverse
event
data
for
the
dabrafenib
plus
trametinib
combination
was
derived
from
the
COMBI-d
trial
.
For
the
cobimetinib
plus
vemurafenib
combination
,
the
coBRIM
trial
was
utilized
.
The
COLUMBUS
study
was
utilized
as
a
source
of
additional
information
for
adverse
events
for
the
encorafenib
plus
binimetinib
combination
.
