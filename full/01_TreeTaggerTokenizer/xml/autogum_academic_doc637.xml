<p>
In
the
present
study
,
the
absorption
pattern
and
pharmacokinetic
pattern
of
free
choline
from
Superba
<hi rend="italic">
Boost
</hi>
TM
krill
oil
and
choline
bitartrate
were
investigated
.
In
Superba
<hi rend="italic">
Boost
</hi>
TM
,
choline
is
bound
in
a
lipid-soluble
form
as
phosphatidylcholine
,
while
it
is
present
as
a
water-soluble
salt
structure
in
choline
bitartrate
.
Results
show
that
free
choline
levels
in
plasma
were
comparable
between
Superba
<hi rend="italic">
Boost
</hi>
TM
and
choline
bitartrate
,
but
peak
choline
concentrations
were
reached
significantly
later
upon
intake
of
Superba
<hi rend="italic">
Boost
</hi>
TM
compared
to
choline
bitartrate
.
Moreover
,
levels
of
the
choline
metabolites
betaine
and
DMG
were
higher
,
while
levels
of
TMAO
were
lower
upon
intake
of
Superba
<hi rend="italic">
Boost
</hi>
TM
compared
to
choline
bitartrate
.
</p>
<p>
The
dependency
between
choline
intake
and
circulating
levels
of
free
choline
and
its
metabolites
is
concealed
by
homeostatic
regulations
and
rapid
tissue
uptake
.
Thus
,
concentrations
of
choline
and
its
metabolites
are
usually
within
a
narrow
range
.
In
the
literature
,
endogenous
free
fasting
choline
levels
under
physiological
conditions
range
between
7
–
12
µmol/L
,
which
could
be
confirmed
in
the
present
study
with
a
mean
choline
concentration
of
9.6
µmol/L
before
product
intake
.
Moreover
,
baseline
values
were
highly
comparable
within
all
groups
and
within
the
two
kinetic
days
.
</p>
<p>
It
is
well
known
that
choline
levels
are
influenced
by
nutrition
,
and
choline
sources
depend
on
the
diet
,
In
a
normal
Western
diet
,
choline
can
be
obtained
from
eggs
,
liver
,
soybeans
and
pork
,
where
choline
is
present
primarily
as
phosphatidylcholine
.
It
was
shown
that
the
consumption
of
a
small
breakfast
led
to
25
–
30
%
higher
choline
levels
compared
to
the
fasting
condition
,
and
that
a
high
choline-containing
diet
resulted
in
an
up
to
two-fold
increase
in
plasma
choline
.
In
a
recent
study
by
Cho
et
al.
,
eggs
were
provided
as
a
choline
source
,
which
contained
comparable
amounts
of
choline
(
479
mg
)
as
the
herein
investigated
study
products
(
choline
bitartrate
:
620
mg
;
Superba
<hi rend="italic">
Boost
</hi>
TM
:
572
mg
)
.
Cho
et
al.
reported
a
1.6-fold
increase
in
free
choline
after
consumption
of
the
egg
meal
,
in
comparison
to
the
fruit
control
meal
.
Correspondingly
,
the
choline
increase
in
the
current
study
upon
supplement
intake
was
comparable
(
choline
bitartrate
:
1.35-fold
;
Superba
<hi rend="italic">
Boost
</hi>
TM
:
1.48-fold
)
.
</p>
<p>
To
control
for
confounding
factors
of
food
,
subjects
of
the
present
study
adhered
to
a
diet
low
in
choline
three
days
before
the
study
intervention
and
consumed
standardized
meals
during
the
kinetic
days
.
In
addition
,
a
parallel
study
arm
was
included
,
whose
subjects
underwent
a
single
kinetic
dose
after
the
intake
of
fish
oil
as
a
placebo
control
that
was
devoid
of
choline
.
Of
note
,
we
observed
a
minor
increase
in
choline
levels
in
the
placebo
group
after
the
4
h
time
point
;
thus
,
the
standardized
lunch
served
after
four
hours
could
have
contributed
to
this
elevation
.
However
,
no
such
effect
was
seen
in
the
study
groups
receiving
choline
supplements
.
In
addition
,
by
implementing
the
control
group
,
we
were
able
to
exclude
possible
circadian
rhythm-dependent
variations
in
choline
levels
,
in
contrast
to
Park
et
al.
,
who
observed
a
slight
elevation
of
free
choline
levels
in
the
afternoon
during
a
12
h-lasting
observation
of
endogenous
choline
levels
.

<p>
Krill
oil
is
increasingly
recognized
as
a
useful
source
of
phosphatidylcholine
,
in
addition
to
its
acknowledged
role
in
providing
the
omega-3
fatty
acids
EPA
and
DHA
.
In
a
former
study
,
phosphatidylcholine
was
shown
to
raise
plasma
choline
levels
more
efficiently
compared
to
ingestion
of
free
choline
as
choline
chloride
.
In
the
current
study
we
observed
a
significant
increase
of
choline
after
single
doses
of
both
phosphatidylcholine
and
the
reference
product
choline
bitartrate
;
however
,
phosphatidylcholine
was
not
more
efficient
,
since
there
were
no
significant
differences
in
the
pharmacokinetic
endpoints
AUC
and
Cmax
.
This
discrepancy
compared
to
the
former
study
could
be
due
to
possible
differences
in
the
bioavailability
of
the
chosen
choline
salts
.
However
,
to
the
best
of
our
knowledge
,
choline
bitartrate
and
choline
chloride
bioavailability
has
not
been
directly
compared
to
date
.
Still
,
the
uptake
profile
of
free
choline
in
the
current
study
indicated
a
slower
increase
upon
phosphatidylcholine
(
Superba
<hi rend="italic">
Boost
</hi>
TM
)
intake
compared
to
choline
bitartrate
.
This
difference
in
Tmax
between
the
study
products
could
result
from
the
structural
differences
between
the
choline
forms
and
from
the
associated
differences
in
absorption
and
metabolism
.
Phosphatidylcholine
and/or
its
isoforms
may
be
absorbed
intact
and
can
also
be
hydrolyzed
into
phosphatidic
acid
and
free
choline
by
phospholipase
D.
Due
to
this
conversion
step
,
it
supposedly
takes
longer
to
obtain
free
choline
from
phosphatidylcholine
compared
to
choline
bitartrate
,
where
free
choline
from
the
salt
structure
is
more
rapidly
available
.
Our
findings
are
in
agreement
with
former
findings
showing
that
choline
levels
after
choline
chloride
reached
peak
levels
earlier
and
were
reduced
to
baseline
earlier
than
after
phosphatidylcholine
intake
,
where
levels
remained
elevated
for
12
h.
