arrived
in
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/France">
France
</ref>
today
,
two
days
after
being
rescued
from
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary%20Armed%20Forces%20of%20Colombia">
Revolutionary
Armed
Forces
of

(

,
who
had
kept
her
captive
in
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Colombia">
Colombian
</ref>
jungle
for
more
than
six
years
.
</p>
<p>
Standing
alongside
President
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Nicolas_Sarkozy">
Nicolas
Sarkozy
</ref>
at
a
military
air
base
southwest
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris">

,
Betancourt
said
,
&quot;
I
cry
with
joy
.
&quot;
The
Colombian-French
politician
was
greeted
at
the
air
base
by
the
President
and
the
First
Lady
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carla%20Bruni-Sarkozy">
Carla
Bruni-Sarkozy
</ref>
,
along
with
some
supporters
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
have
been
dreaming
for
seven
years
of
this
moment
.
I
owe
everything
to
you
,
&quot;
she
said
,
thanking
France
for
pressuring
Colombia
to
&quot;
think
of
other
than
military
options
&quot;
.
She
added
,
&quot;
France
is
my
home
and
you
are
my
family
.
&quot;
Sarkozy
said
her
safe
return
shows
people
in
difficult
situations
that
&quot;
there
is
hope
,
light
at
the
end
of
the
tunnel
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
After
the
welcome
at
the
air
base
,
which
was
broadcast
live
on
national
television
,
Betancourt
went
to
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Élysée%20Palace">
Élysée
Palace
</ref>
,
the
President
's
official
residence
.
Again
accompanied
by
Sarkozy
,
she
recounted
her
experiences
as
a
hostage
in
the
Colombian
jungle
,
describing
the
lack
of
sunlight
and
hostile
conditions
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
It
's
a
completely
hostile
environment
with
dangerous
animals
,
&quot;
Betancourt
said
.
&quot;
The
most
dangerous
,
of
course
,
is
man
.
Those
men
who
were
behind
me
with
huge
rifles
,
pushing
me
,
telling
me
to
walk
,
telling
me
to
walk
more
quickly
.
And
in
this
world
of
hostility
where
everything
is
an
enemy
,
dangerous
,
against
you
,
there
is
God
.
And
above
all
,
there
was
you
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
She
called
on
Sarkozy
to
continue
working
toward
freeing
the
hostages
who
were
left
behind
.
&quot;
We
cannot
leave
them
there
where
they
are
suffering
,
where
they
are
alone
,
&quot;
she
stated
,
saying
that
some
of
them
are
contemplating
suicide
.
In
response
,
Sarkozy
said
,
&quot;
We
will
carry
on
working
to
free
them
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Betancourt
was
one
of
the
15
hostages
rescued
on
July
2
by
the
Colombian
army
,
who
tricked
FARC
into
handing
over
the
hostages
by
pretending
to
be
part
of
a
non-governmental
organization
.
She
was
kidnapped
in
February
2002
while
campaigning
for
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President%20of%20Colombia">
President
of
Colombia
</ref>
.
</p>
<p>
At
a
press
conference
,
her
third
public
event
in
the
hours
since
returning
to
France
,
Betancourt
condemned
the
actions
of
FARC
.
&quot;
I
think
the
whole
world
is
aware
of
the
fact
that
FARC
inflicts
suffering
on
human
beings
&quot;
,
she
said
,
calling
on
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guerrilla">
guerrilla
</ref>
organization
to
&quot;
accept
defeat
gracefully
&quot;
and
&quot;
stop
being
terrorists
.
&quot;
She
called
on
the
international
community
to
help
end
the
&quot;
terrible
trend
of
kidnapping
in
Colombia
&quot;
.
</p>
<p>
Betancourt
also
rejected
the
idea
that
the
rescue
operation
was
staged
to
cover
up
ransom
payments
to
FARC
.
&quot;
I
think
what
I
saw
was
certainly
not
a
staged
event
,
&quot;
she
said
.
&quot;
There
was
a
degree
of
tension
.
