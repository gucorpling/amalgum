:
Accusations
of
harassment
focused
on
the
uploader
,
rather
than
the
artist
;
the
successive
heated
discussions
,
over
about
six
months
,
that
ultimately
led
to
the
video
's
deletion
from

How
do
you
compare
the
reactions
by
Mayor
of
Cape
Town
Helen
Zille
who
said
your
portrait
painting
of
her
was
a
product
of
a
&quot;
free
society
&quot;
and
a
reflection
of
how
people
&quot;
exercise
their
freedom
&quot;
with
the
comment
by
Jimmy
Wales
calling
the
publication
of
your
artwork
&quot;
harassment
&quot;
?
Which
of
these
individuals
do
you
feel
is
correct
,
Mayor
Zille
or
Wales
,
and
why
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Pricasso
</hi>
:
I
think
Helen
got
it
.
They
in
South
Africa
are
struggling
with
change
from
being
suppressed
to
one
of
freedom
as
she
said
&quot;
a
free
society
&quot;
.
Jimmy
Wales
on
the
other
hand
although
promoting
himself
as
The
Free
Speech
Guy
is
censoring
things
he
does
not
agree
with
and
calling
it
Harassment
,
not
a
good
look
Jimmy
!
!
</p>
<p>
I
did
put
the
video
of
Helen
Zille
being
painted
on
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/YouTube">
YouTube
</ref>
.
It
was
there
for
a
few
months
but
they
too
delete
my
work
quite
regularly
so
it
's
probably
long
gone
.
</p>
<p>
She
is
an
experienced
politician
and
would
weigh
up
the
fors
and
against
before
she
acted
,
obviously
the
fors
had
it
.
</p>
<p>
Mr.
Wales
on
the
other
hand
has
probably
not
seen
a
lot
of
my
work
;
if
he
had
he
would
know
I
do
it
for
fun
and
not
really
to
be
taken
too
seriously
,
it
's
a
comedy
performance
,
but
he
could
not
see
the
unique
talent
of
someone
who
has
cornered
the
world
market
of
penis
portraits
painting
with
no
imitators
for
the
past
10
years
,
so
before
too
many
people
could
have
a
small
chuckle
at
his
expense
he
had
it
deleted
,
I
'm
sure
there
would
be
many
others
who
would
like
to
remove
things
on
Wikipedia
but
do
n't
have
the
muscle
to
do
so
.

Have
you
experienced
censorship
or
attempts
by
others
to
limit
your
freedom
of

?
How
so
,
and
what
was
your
reaction

</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Pricasso
</hi>
:
As
I
said
before
YouTube
is
always
deleting
my
videos
when
someone
complains
,
sometimes
even
when
there
is
no
genitals
visible
.
Once
one
was
taken
down
because
the
guy
I
was
painting
had
the
word
(
fuck
)
on
his
tee
shirt
;
I
mean
how
many
films
have
this
word
in
the
dialogue
.
Also
in
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Macau">
Macau
</ref>
at
the
adult
show
,
the
people
who
make
the
rules
make
me
perform
inside
an
enclosed
area
,
and
people
are
wary
of
coming
in
through
the
door
so
is
a
bit
slow
there
;
and
the
guys
that
run
the
show
are
so
polite
and
passionate
trying
to
change
China
slowly
,
making
it
more
open
,
that
I
keep
on
returning
year
after
year
.
