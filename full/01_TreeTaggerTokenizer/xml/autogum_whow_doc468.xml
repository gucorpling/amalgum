Start
picking
your
beans
in
the
middle
of
summer
.
Beans
planted
in
the
spring
can
be
harvested
in
the
later
summer
months
,
typically
August
and
September
in
the
Northern
hemisphere
.
Keep
track
of
when
you
planted
your
beans
to
determine
the
best
time
to
start
your
harvest
.

Harvest
the
pods
when

long
.
Look
for
bean
pods
that
still
have
a
smooth
texture
.
If
you
can
see
the
beans
through
the
outer
pod
,
the
beans
are
past
their
prime
and
may
have
a
tough
,
stringy
texture
when
you
eat
them
.

Larger
bean
pods
may
look

but
they
’ll
have
a
rougher
and
less
desirable
texture
.

Pull
the
bean
pod

index
finger
.
Hold
the
stem
with
your
other
hand
