Build
a
Homemade
Rube
Goldberg
Machine
</head>
<p>
Rube
Goldberg
(
1883-1970
)
was
a
scientist
and
cartoonist
who
produced
satirical
work
on
people
’s
overly
complex
problem
solving
methods
.
In
his
comical
cartoons
,
he
linked
together
chain
reactions
with
simple
machines
to
complete
basic
tasks
,
like
turning
on
a
lamp
or
frying
an
egg
.
Designing
and
building
a
Rube
Goldberg
machine
requires
innovation
and
patience
.
While
every
machine
is
different
,
many
builders
include
versions
of
other
people
's
ideas
,
tweaking
them
or
linking
them
in
exciting
ways
.

,
you
will
get
a
packet
of
information
and
rules
.
Before
you
plan
or
build
your
machine
,
read
through
this
material
carefully
.
While
you
read
,
identify
the
goal
,
requirements
,
and
restrictions
.

Select
a
basic
task
for
your
machine
to
accomplish
.
Rube
Goldberg
machines
are
complex
structures
that
rely
on
chain
reactions
to
execute
one
simple
task
.
Before
you
design
your
machine
,
determine
what
you
want
the
machine
to
do
.
If
you
are
competing
in
a
Rube
Goldberg
competition
or
completing
an
assignment
for
school
,
you
may
not
have
the
freedom
to
choose
this
task
.
If
can
pick
,
consider
some
of
the
following
options
:

Look
for

Developing
a
zany
,
complex
machine
is
not
an
easy
task
.
Before
you
create
your
own
Rube
Goldberg
machine
,
you
may
find
it
helpful
to
see
some
examples
.
While
you
should
use
these
examples
as
a
source
of
inspiration
and
direction
,
do
not
copy
someone
else
’s
machine
.
Instead
of
replicating
these
machines
,
make
it
your
goal
to
improve
,
alter
,
or
modernize
them
.

transform
traditional
building
materials
,
everyday
items
,
and
unique
objects
into
functional
pieces
of
equipment
that
work
together
to
execute
a

Spend
time
gathering

unique
objects
at
flea

Rube
Goldberg
machines
complete
a
simple
task
with
a
complex
chain
reaction
.
You
can
break
down
the
chain
reaction
into
several
different
steps
,
or
phases
.
The
steps
are
connected
together
by
a
link
.
When
you
design
the
machine
,
it
is
helpful
to
start
with
the
last
step
and
work
your
way
to
the
first
step
.
You
can
create
the
building
plan
by
listing
these
steps
or
drawing
the
machine
.

its
