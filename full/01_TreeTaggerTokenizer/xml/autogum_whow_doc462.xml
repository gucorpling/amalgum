Be
a
Handyman
</head>
<p>
Have
you
ever
felt
powerless
when
faced
with
a
vexing
home
repair
problem
?
Were
you
left
in
awe
by
a
handyman
who
capably
did
what
needed
to
be
done
?
You
can
be
that
awe-inspiring
person
.
That
's
right
,
&quot;
person
&quot;
.
You
do
n't
have
to
be
a
<hi rend="italic">
man

to
be

Remember
:
<hi rend="bold">
safety
first
!
</hi>
You
want
to
be
a
handyman
,
not
a
dead
man
.
Consider
,
for
example
,
that
many
of
the
warnings
that
appear
in
manuals
,
on
labels
or
on
tools
are
rooted
in
someone
else
's
misfortune
or
stupidity
.
Be
sure
to
read
and
heed
them
.
Putting
safety
first
is
your
first
step
in
doing
the
job
right
and
presenting
a
professional
image
-
even
if
it
's
just
to
yourself
.
&quot;
Safety
first
&quot;
will
mean
different
things
in
different
situations
,
but
some
basic
rules
apply
to
nearly
every
job
.
For
example
,
a
well-lit
workspace
is
fundamental
.
It
will
help
you
see
otherwise
hidden
or
obscure
dangers
.
You
're
also
not
likely
to
do
well
at
a
job
that
you
ca
n't
see
well
.

Have
the
right
tools
for
the
job
.
The
first
tools
you
need
are
those
that
make
the
job
safe
,
such
as
a
face-mask
or
respirator
when
working
with
insulation
or
toxic
dust
.
Using
the
wrong
tool
(
e.
g.
,
a
shaky
chair
instead
of
a
stable
ladder
)
or
using
a
tool
improperly
invites
injury
to
yourself
and
can
compromise
the
quality
of
the
job
you
're
doing
.
Get
the
right
tools
and
use
them
the
right
way
.
Never
buy
a
tool
you
do
n't
need
,
but
always
buy
(
or
rent
or
borrow
)
the
tool
required
by
the
job
.
This
makes
for
a
simple
solution
to
the
question
&quot;
What
tools
should
I
have
?
&quot;
It
's
the
tools
that
you
need
to
do
the
job
safely
and
correctly
.

Educate
yourself
.
Learn
all
you
can
before
starting
a
job
.
Go
on-line
(
see
below
for
helpful
links
)
.
Go
to
the
library
.
Read
the
instructions/the
manual
.
Find
people
who
have
done
that
type
of
job
and
ask
what
they
did
right
and
what
they
would
do
differently
if
they
knew
then
what
they
know
now
.
Check
with
your
local
government
's
building
permits
office
re
any
needed
permits
or
other
requirements
.
Just
as
&quot;
an
ounce
of
prevention
is
worth
a
pound
of
cure
&quot;
,
an
hour
of
education
is
worth
a
day
of
doing
it
over
.

Be
open
to
new
approaches
.
Never
assume
that
you
know
the
best
way
to
do
anything
;
arrogant
people
are
closed
to
learning
.
Be
open
to
ideas
and
insights
from
any
source
-
including
a
spouse
,
a
child
,
and
a
customer
once
you
get
to
that
point
.
The
less
experienced
they
are
,
the
more
likely
it
is
that
you
'll
hear
something
you
would
never
have
considered
.

Allow
enough
time
.
The
time
you
<hi rend="italic">
think
</hi>
the
job
will
take
is
likely
based
more
on
your
fond
hopes
than
unforgiving
reality
.
Jobs
often
involve
complications
that
appear
only
once
you
're
underway
.
On
those
rare
and
splendid
occasions
when
the
job
goes
faster
than
planned
,
you
wo
n't
think
that
you
misjudged
-
you
'll
be
too
absorbed
in
contemplating
your
genius
.
Having
planned
enough
time
,
be
sure
to
take
it
.
Carpenters
say
,
e.
g.
,
to
&quot;
measure
twice
and
cut
once
.
&quot;
What
that
really
means
is
take
the
time
to
carefully
measure
.

Have
a
good
work
ethic
.
A
job
worth
doing
is
worth
doing
well
.
It
's
also
a
requirement
,
as
with
the
electrical
code
mandate
that
all
work
be
done
&quot;
in
a
workmanlike
manner
.
&quot;
Your
name
is
going
to
be
on
that
job
,
literally
or
figuratively
,
so
make
a
good
name
for
yourself
.
A
good
work
ethic
applies
to
every
aspect
and
every
stage
of
a
job
,
and
it
always
appears
in
the
final
results
.
For
example
,
when
hanging
a
framed
picture
on
the
middle
of
a
wall
,
do
n't
&quot;
gaze
and
guess
&quot;
at
the
center
point
of
the
wall
--
use
a
tape
measure
and
pencil
to
mark
it
.
If
you
're
replacing
a
light
switch
,
use
a
level
to
align
the
switch
when
tightening
the
screws
so
as
to
avoid
a
lopsided
look
once
the
cover
plate
is
attached
.

Clean
up
.
The
job
's
not
over
until
the
dirt
is
swept
up
,
the
tools
cleaned
and
put
away
,
and
the
trash
removed
.
This
is
a
hallmark
of
a
real
pro
.
Plan
ahead
to
ease
that
clean-up
by
,
e.
g.
,
using
drop-cloths
,
clearing
the
work
area
of
objects
that
may
get
dirty
,
sealing-off
the
work
area
to
prevent
dust
from
spreading
,
or
using
fans
to
ventilate
airborne
dust
out
the
window
.

Celebrate
when
it
's
over
!
You
've
done
your
best
and
your
best
deserves
a
pat
on
the
back
,
even
if
it
's
from
your
own
arm
twisted
over
your
shoulder
.
Was
the
job
absolutely
perfect
?
That
's
rarely
the
case
.
The
point
is
,
you
did
what
amounts
to
a
hand-made
job
,
and
hand-made
is
bound
to
have
slight
imperfections
.
So
do
n't
obsess
or
slam
yourself
for
what
may
be
apparent
only
to
yourself
.
Also
,
&quot;
celebrate
when
it
's
over
&quot;
implies
not
celebrating
(
with
intoxicants
)
while
you
're
working
,
which
brings
us
back
to
the
opening
and
most
important
point
:
