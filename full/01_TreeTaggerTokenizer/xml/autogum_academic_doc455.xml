Introduction
</head>
<p>
Water
is
an
essential
element
involved
in
dental
care
,
as
it
allows
cooling
and
irrigation
of
certain
parts
of
equipment
such
as
rotors
and
mechanical
scalers
.
Furthermore
,
it
acts
on
treated
teeth
to
avoid
iatrogenic
overheating
,
to
remove
debris
from
the
surgical
site
,
and
to
rinse
the
patient
’s
mouth
.
Although
the
water
used
in
dental
offices
is
not
standardized
,
it
must
at
least
meet
criteria
of
drinking
water
.
The
maintenance
of
water
quality
is
crucial
because
patients
and
dental
staff
are
exposed
to
water
through
three
routes
during
dental
care
.
Firstly
,
they
are
exposed
to
water
by
projection
on
skin
and
mucous
membranes
.
Secondly
,
they
are
exposed
to
water
by
aerosol
.
Bio-aerosols
generated
during
dental
care
contain
micro-organisms
able
to
disperse
to
a
distance
of
one
meter
around
the
patient
and
remain
in
suspension
for
twenty
minutes
.
Thirdly
,
patients
can
ingest
water
during
dental
care
.
</p>
<p>
Dental
unit
waterlines
(
DUWLs
)
have
an
accumulating
and
growing
biofilm
on
their
inner
surfaces
.
This
serves
as
a
reservoir
of
micro-organisms
that
will
be
released
during
dental
care
in
the
water
circulating
inside
the
DUWL
.
Unfortunately
,
the
tubes
of
dental
units
provide
a
favorable
environment
for
the
development
of
biofilms
for
many
reasons
.
These
are
as
follows
:
the
quality
of
the
water
supplying
the
unit
;
the
numerous
periods
of
inactivity
of
the
unit
accompanied
by
water
stagnation
;
the
narrowness
of
the
pipes
,
which
generates
a
low
water
flow
rate
at
the
periphery
of
the
canal
lumen
;
the
complex
interconnections
of
long
and
narrow
waterlines
of
units
;
the
plastic
materials
constituting
the
tubes
;
the
anti-retraction
valves
that
fail
to
completely
prevent
retro-contamination
by
oral
fluids
;
and
sometimes
the
presence
of
a
water
heating
device
.
This
last
produces
a
pleasant
water
temperature
for
the
patient
,
but
favors
the
development
of
micro-organisms
.
</p>
<p>
The
DUWL
output
water
often
contains
multiple
bacteria
in
greater
quantities
than
recommended
,
including
opportunistic
pathogenic
bacteria
such
as
<hi rend="italic">
Pseudomonas
aeruginosa
</hi>
,
<hi rend="italic">
Legionella
pneumophila
</hi>
,
and
nontuberculous
<hi rend="italic">
Mycobacterium
</hi>
.
Only
a
few
cases
of
infections
related
to
dental
units
’
water
have
been
reported
.
However
,
the
immunocompromised
,
cancer
patients
,
diabetic
,
very
young
,
and
elderly
patients
are
particularly
vulnerable
populations
to
contaminated
water
.
Some
infections
have
been
reported
to
be
fatal
for
patients
and
a
possible
fatal
case
was
reported
for
one
dentist
.
Thus
,
while
the
incidence
of
reported
dental
unit
waterborne
infections
appears
to
be
minimal
,
the
risk
should
not
be
underestimated
.
Some
infections
have
probably
not
been
identified
because
of
a
failure
to
associate
infections
with
exposure
to
DUWL
output
water
.
Sporadic
infections
not
requiring
hospitalization
are
not
likely
to
be
investigated
in
depth
,
and
it
would
be
extremely
difficult
to
trace
the
origin
of
an
infection
contracted
from
contaminated
DUWL
output
water
if
clinical
manifestations
develop
a
number
of
weeks
after
exposure
.
</p>
<p>
The
water
used
in
dentistry
is
not
standardized
,
so
it
must
only
meet
the
criteria
of
drinking
water
.
In
France
,
that
means
the
absence
of
<hi rend="italic">
Escherichia
coli
</hi>
and
<hi rend="italic">
Enterococci
</hi>
,
with
an
ideal
revivable
aerobic
flora
at
22
°C
less
than
100
colony-forming
units
per
milliliter
(
CFU/mL
)
at
the
inlet
,
and
a
differential
of
less
than
a
factor
of
10
between
inlet
and
outlet
water
.
In
the
United
States
,
the
Center
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
(
CDC
)
recommends
less
than
500
CFU/mL
in
water
used
for
non-surgical
dental
care
.
For
surgical
procedures
,
the
use
of
sterile
water
is
recommended
.
The
French
dental
guideline
towards
the
prevention
of
healthcare-associated
infections
re-iterates
that
dentists
must
ensure
that
a
set
of
physical
and
chemical
measures
are
in
place
to
maintain
an
acceptable
water
quality
of
their
units
’
outflow
.
</p>
<p>
The
aim
of
this
survey
was
to
assess
the
means
used
by
dentists
operating
outside
public
health
institutions
in
Eastern
France
to
maintain
the
water
quality
of
their
dental
care
units
.
