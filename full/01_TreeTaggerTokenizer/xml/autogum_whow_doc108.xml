Get
Popular
on
the
Internet
</head>
<p>
You
've
been
on
the
net
for
years
.
Yet
,
almost
nobody
knows
about
your
web
presence
.
You
just
want
to
be
well
known
and
you
want
people
to
talk
about
your
online
prowess
and
exploits
.
To
become
popular
on
the
internet
is
possible
,
it
'll
just
require
a
bit
more
effort
beyond
what
you
're
doing
normally
.

Creating
an
Online
Presence

<list type="ordered">
<item>
Understand
why
do
you
want
to
get
popular
.
Be
absolutely
certain
that
you
want
to
be
a
popular
online
presence
.
With
popularity
comes
loss
of
peace
,
the
inability
to
move
around
quietly
and
a
need
to
maintain
a
great
reputation
in
your
chosen
field
of
popularity
.
This
can
add
up
to
a
lot
of
effort
,
especially
if
you
're
not
being
paid
for
it
and
have
to
keep
that
day
job
up
.
It
can
also
erode
your
humility
and
cause
you
to
behave
in
ways
that
are
n't
entirely
you
and
can
lead
to
dissatisfaction
.
If
you
're
okay
with
this
,
proceed
with
the
next
steps
.

Be
unique

If
you
're
copying
everyone
else
,
there
is
a
good
chance
that
you
're
not
going
to
be
seen
or
heard
about

Few
people
are
keen
to
see
the

,
same
.
Thus
,
think
of
a

trend

something
that
nobody
has
done
before
,
even
if
it
's
a

<item>
Do
n't
give
up
.
You
will
never
become
popular
on
the
internet
just
in
a
week
.
For
some
,
it
takes
six
months
,
for
others
it
takes
longer
.
</item>
<item>
Do
n't
let
popularity
spoil
you
.
If
you
're
popular
,
it
does
n't
mean
that
you
're
any
better
than
your
(
internet
)
friends
.
Respect
everyone
.
</item>
<item>
Do
n't
get
into
fights
.
This
might
make
people
dislike
you
.
And
your
popularity
might
move
down/
become
lower
.
</item>
<item>
Popularity
dies
easily
.
It
's
okay
to
be
away
from
the
internet
for
a
week
,
two
weeks
.
But
when
you
reach
five
months
,
do
n't
be
surprised
if
someone
has
taken
your
place
.
This
is
how
it
is
,
people
love
novelty
and
fresh
faces
.
Becoming
popular
is
easy
but
keeping
it
is
hard
at
the
same
time
.
