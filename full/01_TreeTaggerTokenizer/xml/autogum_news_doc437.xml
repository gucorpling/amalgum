<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/France">
French

<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/French_National_Assembly">
National
Assembly

passed
a
bill
that
would

the
bill
calls

</ref>
of
the

.
The
French
government
however
opposes
the
bill
;
Catherine
Colonna

Minister
charged
with
European
Affairs
,
reacted
that
&quot;
It
's
the
task
,
first
and
foremost
,
of
historians
and
not
of
lawmakers
to
clarify
history
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
label
&quot;
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genocide">
genocide
</ref>
&quot;
is
disputed
by
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Turkey">
Turkish
</ref>
government
,
who
has
called
the
vote
a
&quot;
serious
blow
&quot;
to
diplomatic
relations
.
Turkey
has
been
known
to
prosecute
Turkish
intellectuals
who
discuss
the
Armenian
genocide
,
including
recent
Nobel
Prize
winner
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orhan%20Pamuk">

.
Under
the
Turkish
Penal
Code
,
&quot;
prosecution
for
anti-national
plots
&quot;
faces
those
who
call
&quot;
for
the
recognition
of
the
Armenian
genocide
&quot;
.

he

In

to

,
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President%20of%20the%20French%20Republic">
French

<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Jacques_Chirac">
Jacques

launched
the
idea
that
recognition
as
a
&quot;
genocide
&quot;
would
be
necessary
for
Turkey
to
enter
the
E.U.
,
causing
the
media
to
label
it
as
the
&quot;
Chirac
criterion
&quot;
.
The
European
Commission
,
which
has
confirmed
that
such
a
criterion
would
not
be
instituted
,
deplored
the
initiative
of
the
French
parliament
,
because
it
could
damage
contacts
with

</p>
<p>
Most
historians
view
the
events
comprising
the
Armenian
genocide
as
a
state-sponsored
plan
of
mass
extermination
.
Their
reasons
include
various
eye
witness
reports
,
Turkey
's
recruitment
of
violent
criminals
to
posts
within
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special%20Organization%20(Ottoman%20Empire)">
&quot;
Special
Organization
&quot;
</ref>
,
and
the
sheer
number
of
dead
,
estimates
of
which
remain
as
high
as
1.5
million
.
Some
politically
influential
countries
like
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_States">
U.S.
</ref>
,
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Canada">
Canada
</ref>
,
and
France
have
driven
efforts
to
interpret
these
events
as
an
attempt
to
eradicate
an
ethnic
group
.
The
Turkish
government
,
as
well
as
a
few
historians
,
estimate
the
number
of
casualties
much
lower
,
and
attribute
them
to
inter-ethnic
strife
,
disease
and
famine
during
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/World_War_I">

.
</p>
<p>
Armenia
has
congratulated
France
over
its
&quot;
natural
response
&quot;
to
an
&quot;
aggressive
&quot;
policy
of
&quot;
denial
&quot;
by
the
Turkish
government
.
Armenians
often
argue
that
Turkey
's
recognition
will
help
prevent
similar
events
in
the
future
.
These
assertions
include
claims
that
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig%20Maximilian%20Erwin%20von%20Scheubner-Richter">

's

the
same
as

It
must
still
be
approved
by
the

</ref>
and
the
President
,
and
due
to
the
parliamentary
calendar
,
news
sources
think
it
is
unlikely
that
it
will
be
discussed
before

end
of
