Unclog
a
Toilet
with
Dish
Soap
</head>
<p>
A
clogged
toilet
is
something
we
've
all
experienced
:
the
rising
of
water
to
the
brim
,
the
sense
of
panic
as
it
does
n't
stop
,
the
scurrying
for
the
plunger
.
But
dish
soap
is
a
simple
solution
that
can
bring
you
back
from
the
fate
of
a
flood
of
toilet
water
with
nothing
but
your
favorite
product
and
some
hot
water
!
Whether
you
start
by
pouring
the
boiling
water
into
the
toilet
or
adding
dish
soap
,
if
all
goes
well
the
end
result
is
unclogged
piping
.

Locate
the
toilet
flapper
and
stop
water
flow
from
the
tank
.
Remove
the
lid
from
your
toilet
tank
and
locate
the
toilet
flapper
.
The
flappers
are
typically
black
,
blue
,
or
red
and
provide
the
seal
for
the
flush
valve
.
Either
close
it
using
the
chain
attached
or
with
your
hands
.

To
prevent
water
supply
altogether
,
turn
the
handle
behind
the
toilet
near
the
floor
in
a
clockwise
direction
.
If
you
're
having
trouble
turning
the
handle
,
apply
an
oil
spray
.
</item>
<item>
Do
n't
worry
about
contaminated
water
in
the
toilet
tank
—
germs
do
not
enter
this
part
of
the
fixture
.
If
you
're
worried
,
wash
your
hands
thoroughly
afterward
.
</item>

</item>
<item>
Boil
a
pot
of
water
.
Turn
your
stove
on
high
heat
and
place
a
water-filled
pot
onto
the
stove
.
Then
,
cover
your
pot
with
a
lid
and
wait
for
the
water
to
boil
.
You
can
also
fill
the
pot
or
bucket
with
hot
water
from
the
tap
,
but
make
sure
it
's
as
hot
as
possible
—
the
higher
the
temperature
,
the
more
effective
it
will
be
at
fighting
the
clog
.

If
you
only
have
a
smaller
pot
or
bucket
,
fill
it
up
multiple
times
until
you
have
about
of
boiling
,
or
very
hot
,
water
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Pour
of
hot
water
into
the
bowl
.
Pour
gently
and
make
sure
the
water
does
n't
pass
the
rim
.
Be
careful
not
to
spill
any
to
avoid
burning
yourself
.
If
your
bucket
has
a
metal
handle
,
hold
it
up
with
one
hand
and
tilt
the
bucket
with
your
other
hand
by
turning
it
from
the
bottom
.

Adding
Dish
Soap
</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Pour
about
of
dish
soap
into
the
water
.
The
dish
soap
will
float
to
the
bottom
of
the
bowl
because
it
is
heavier
and
denser
than
water
.
Let
the
soap
sit
for
about
20
to
30
minutes
.
After
this
time
,
the
water
should
lower
.

Always
pour
the
water
slowly
and
be
careful
not
to
overflow
the
bowl
.

<item>
Pour
another
of
boiling
water
into
the
toilet
.
Fill
another
pot
with
hot
water
and
place
it
onto
the
stove
to
boil
.
Again
,
hot
water
is
also
effective
,
but
boiling
water
is
always
ideal
.

Turn
the

on
high
heat
for
the
fastest
results
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Continue
pouring
water
into
the
toilet
and
let
it
sit
.
After
about
2
to
3
rounds
,
flush
the
toilet
to
check
if
the
clog
is
gone
.
Be
sure
to
give
each
of
boiling
water
about
20
minutes
to
settle
.

Wait
overnight
if
your
toilet
is
still
not
flushing
properly
.
If
it
's
not
unclogged
in
the
morning
,
try
using
a
plunger
.

<item>
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Plunge_a_Toilet">
Plunge
your
toilet
</ref>
if
it
's
still
clogged
.
Even
if
you
've
already
tried
to
plunge
the
clog
,
dish
soap
can
weaken
it
,
so
it
's
always
worth
a
second
shot
!
Place
the
plunger
into
the
bowl
and
aim
it
at
the
hole
.
Press
down
sharply
in
short
,
fast
strokes
,
and
be
sure
to
lift
sharply
to
create
suction
.
After
4
or
5
full
strokes
,
lift
the
plunger
on
the
last
upward
motion
<figure rend="Unclog a Toilet with Dish Soap Step 7.jpg">

Run
the
plunger
under
hot
water
for
30
seconds
prior
to
plunging
to
warm
the
rubber
up
.

<item>
If
the
clog
still
does
n't
come
loose
,
call
a
plumber
.
