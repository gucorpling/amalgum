In
1781
,
after
getting
his
master
's
consent
,
Armistead
volunteered
to
join
the
army
under
Lafayette
.
Lafayette
utilized
Armistead
as
a
spy
,
with
the
latter
posing
as
a
runaway
slave
.
Armistead
joined
the
camp
of
Brigadier
General
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedict_Arnold">
Benedict
Arnold
</ref>
,
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turncoat">
turncoat
</ref>
who
was
leading
some
British
forces
in
the
area
.
Pretending
to
be
a
spy
for
them
allowed
Armistead
to
gain
Arnold
's
confidence
to
the
extent
that
Arnold
used
him
to
guide
British
troops
through
local
roads
.
&quot;
The
ex-slave
,
who
later
renamed
himself
James
Armistead
Lafayette
in
the
general
's
honor
,
served
as
a
double
agent
against
the
British
under
the
avowedly
anti-slavery
Lafayette
.

After
Arnold
departed
north
in
the
spring
of
1781
,
James
went
to
the
camp
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Cornwallis">
Lord
Charles
Cornwallis
</ref>
and
continued
his
work
.
He
moved
frequently
between
British
camps
where
the
officers
would
speak
openly
about
their
strategies
in
front
of
him
.
Armistead
documented
this
information
in
written
reports
,
which
he
delivered
to
other
American
spies
.
In
this
way
,
he
relayed
much
information
about
the
British
plans
for
troop
deployment
and
their
arms
.
The
intelligence
reports
from
his
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage">
espionage
</ref>
were
instrumental
in
helping
the
revolutionary
forces
defeat
the
British
during

Lafayette
's
return
</head>
<p>
In
1824
,
the
Marquis
de
Lafayette
returned
to
the
United
States
at
the
invitation
of
President
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Monroe">
James
Monroe
</ref>
.
He
made
a
tour
of
all
24
states
,
during
which
he
was
met
by
huge
crowds
and
everywhere
feted
as
a
hero
.
He
visited
Washington
's
grave
at
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Vernon">
Mount
Vernon
</ref>
and
gave
a
speech
to
the
House
of
Delegates
in
Richmond
.
While
in
Richmond
,
he
abruptly
had
his
carriage
stopped
when
he
saw
Armistead
in
the
crowd
and
rushed
to
embrace
him
.

Although
Virginia
passed
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manumission">
manumission
</ref>
act
in
1782
allowing
for
the
freedom
of
any
slave
who
had
fought
in
the
Revolution
,
James
Armistead
remained
the
property
of
William
Armistead
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-7">

</ref>
This
was
because
a
1783
law
specifically
freed
only
slaves
whose
owners
had
used
them
as
substitutes
for
army
service
in
exchange
for
their
liberty
.
This
was
not
the
case
for
Armistead
,
who
had
been
a
spy
,
not
a
soldier
.
However
,
in
1786
,
with
the
support
of
William
Armistead
–
then
a
member
of
the
House
of
Delegates
–
and
a
1784
testimonial

to
James

's

made
by
the
Marquis
himself
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-8">

James
petitioned
the
Virginia
Assembly
for
his
freedom
.
On
January
9
,
1787
,
the
Assembly
granted
the
petition
.
At
that
time
,
he
added
&quot;
Lafayette

to
his
name
to
honor
the
general
