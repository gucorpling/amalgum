What
one

do

feel

</hi>
Part
of
mitigating
development
impact
is
bringing
about
better
traffic
and
transit
management
.
Residents
of
Don
Valley
East
are
passionate
about
both
these
elements

city
life

Q
:
</hi>
Why
have
you
chosen
to
involve
yourself
in
the
political
process
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
A
:
</hi>
I
entered
politics
in
1995
,
concerned
about
a
better
education
system
and
ultimately
a
better
City
for
my
own
children
.
I
felt
that
a
better
future
for
them
could
only
be
achieved
by
building
a
stronger
community
for
everyone
.
After
10
years
,
I
find
the
work
constant
but
endlessly
rewarding
.

Why
do

represent

<p>
<hi rend="bold">
A
:
</hi>
Ward
33
always
feels
like
a
microcosm
of
the
whole
City
of
Toronto
to
me
.
Residents
of
all
backgrounds
are
engaged
in
civic
issues
like
never
before
.
They
they
[
<hi rend="italic">
sic
</hi>

want
a
city
that
supports
the
next
generation
economically
and
socially
,
and
we
need
a
City
that
supports
their
hard
work
.

Q

</hi>
How
are
you
currently
involved
in
the
community

<p>
<hi rend="bold">
A
:
</hi>
Serving
first
as
a
School
Board
Trustee
and
now
as
City
Councillor
has
spread
my
community
involvement
across
a
broad
range
of
activities
.
I
visit
and
participate
in
multi-cultural
seniors
organizations
,
childrens
'
service
providers
,
and
residents
'
associations
.
I
have
created
two
new
additions
to
the
list
of
resident/ratepayer
associations
as
well
as
running
my
own
Ward
Advisory
Council

Q
:
</hi>
What
does
Toronto
mean
to
you
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
A
:
</hi>
Toronto
is
at
the
edge
of
becoming
the
North
American
City
that
shows
all
of
the
others
how
to
grow
without
compromising
the
quality
of
life
and
the
environment
.
The
decisions
we
make
will
serve
as
an
example
of
how
a
progressive
city
should
act
.
Our
Youth
Strategy
,
which
I
helped
author
,
asks
that
we
never
create
another
City
initiative
without
asking
if
we
are
leaving
youth
or
the
marginalized
behind
.
As
Works
Committee
Chair
,
I
always
ask
,
&quot;
How
does
this
benefit
the
environment
?
&quot;
We
have
to
lead
by
example
,
and
I
hope
to
build
a
city
that
does
.
