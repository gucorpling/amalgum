<p>
Unless
you
're
living
in
your
own
home
,
you
may
find
yourself
wishing
for
a
larger
bathroom
.
While
it
’s
not
a
problem
for
homeowners
to
completely
remodel
and
redecorate
,
apartment
renters
are
rather
limited
.
It
can
be
a
challenge
,
because
you
have
to
work
with
what
is
provided
.
There
’s
still
a
lot
you
can
do
without
replacing
tiles
or
knocking
down
walls
.
With
a
little
bit
of
planning
,
some
creative
organizational
skills
and
clever
use
of
color
,
you
can
easily
make
your
apartment
bathroom
seem
more
spacious
than
it
really
is
.
These
simple
decorating
tips
are
quick
,
easy
,
and
best
of
all
,
cheap
.

A

,
neat
bathroom
will
always
look
bigger
.
Yes
,
this

you
’ll
have

serious

organizing

Items
that
are
infrequently
used
should
be
stored
out
of
sight
.
This
does
n’t
mean
you
have
to
hide
everything
out
of
sight
,
though
.
There
are
plenty
of
attractive
smaller
storage
options
that
allow
you
to
put
your
items
in
place
and
on
display
at
the
same
time
.

Tall
and
thin
cabinets
always
come
in
handy
when
space
is
at
a
premium
.

Vertical
displays
also
create
an
illusion
of
greater
space
in
height
.
Narrow
shelving
over
the
toilet
will
not
impinge
upon
floor
space
.
Fold
towels
in
thirds
to
stack
neatly
on
the
shelves
.
Store
cosmetics
in
a
basket
on
the
shelf
.
Include
a
toothbrush
case
,
toothpaste
and
a
small
glass
in
a
separate
basket
.
Place
the
more
cluttered
basket
on
a
higher
shelf
so
that
the
contents
will
not
be
within
view
.
Provide
space
for
a
tissue
box
.
Keep
these
shelves
limited
to
a
few
items
that
require
quick
access
on
a
daily
basis
.

Avoid
multiple
dispensers

Try
to
avoid
using
a
rack
with
multiple

One

With
a
single
swoop
of
the
arm
–
push
back
the
shower
curtain
to
one
side
when
it
’s
not
in
use
.
If
you
can
see
all
the
way
to
the
back
wall
(
instead
of
just
to
the
curtain
)
,
your
eye
will
think
the
room
is
larger
.

One
sheer
curtain
covering
the
entire
window
will
provide
privacy
and
abundant
light
during
the
day
.
A
shade
behind
the
curtain
can
be
pulled
down
at
night
.
