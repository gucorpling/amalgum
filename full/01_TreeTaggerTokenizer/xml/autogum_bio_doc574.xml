from

<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyar">

clan
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow">
Moscow

and
was
,
prior
to

of

.
His
immediate
predecessor
in
Novgorod
,
Sergei
,
served
less
than
a
year
and
was
recalled
and
confined
to
the
Chudov
Monastery
apparently
due
to
mental
illness
.
</p>
<p>
Gennady
was
named
Archbishop
of
Novgorod
in
Moscow
and
placed
in
office
on
12
December
1484
,
the
first
Novgorodian
prelate
not
chosen
by
lots
since
1359
.

He
arrived
in
Novgorod
in
January
1485
with
the
task
(
as
had
been
Sergei
's
)
of
bringing
the
newly
conquered
Novgorodian
church
(
the
city
had
been
brought
under
direct
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscovy">
Muscovite
</ref>
control
only
in
1478
and
the
last
locally
elected
archbishop
,
Feofil
,
had
been
removed
only
in
1480
)
more
in
line
with
Muscovite
ecclesiastical
practices
.
He
faced
opposition
from
the
local
clergy
by
his
commemoration
of
several
Muscovite
saints
,
but
dealt
with
this
opposition
by
including
several
local
saints
in
his
commemoration
.
</p>
<p>
Gennady
's
main
difficulty
during
his
archepiscopate
,
however
,
was
rooting
out
the
Judaizer
heresy
from
Novgorod
and
also
Moscow
,
where
it
had
spread
when
several
Novgorodian
clergymen
were
transferred
to
the
capital
.
He
is
said
to
have
borrowed
methods
from
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Inquisition">
Spanish
Inquisition
</ref>
,
admiring
how
the
King
of
Spain
had
dealt
with
heterodoxy
in
his
kingdom
,
and
he
burned
several
heretics
with
the
support
of
the
grand
prince
and
metropolitan
.

The
<hi rend="italic">
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novgorodian_Fourth_Chronicle">
Novgorodian
Fourth
Chronicle
</ref>
</hi>
notes
that
Gennady
also
helped
pay
for
one
third
of
the
reconstruction
of
the
current
Detinets
or
Kremlin
walls
between
1484
and
1490
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-3">

</ref>
and
in
1492
,
he
calculated
Easter
for
the
next
thousand
years
.
The
Orthodox
believed
the
year
7000
AM
,
but
the
constantinopolian
reckoning
,
would
be
the
end
of
the
world
(
this
corresponds
to
the
year
1492
AD
)
and
thus
they
did
not
calculate
Easter
after
that
.
This
would
have
had
dire
consequences
,
not
only
for
the
performance
of
religious
rituals
,
but
also
in
determining
when
to
plant
and
harvest
crops
,
and
could
potentially
have
led
to
famine
.
Gennady
's
contribution
thus
went
beyond
merely
knowing
when
Easter
was
.
</p>
<p>
Gennady
took
part
in
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Council_of_1503">
Moscow
Council
of
1503
</ref>
,
but
the
following
year
he
was
accused
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simony">
simony
</ref>
and
retired
from
office
.
After
returning
to
Moscow
,
he
died
on
4
December
1505
in
the
Chudov
Monastery
.
He
was
buried
near
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexius,_Metropolitan_of_Moscow">
Metropolitan
Aleksei
</ref>
in
the
main
church
of
the
monastery
until
its
destruction
in
1929
,
after
which
his
remains
were
lost
,
as
were
those
of
more
than
a
hundred
other
people
buried
in
the
Kremlin
.
