Q
:
</hi>
For
readers
who
did
n't
watch
America
's
Got
Talent
,
how
did
Celtic
Spring
first
start
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
A
:
</hi>
Celtic
Spring
had
its
beginnings
in
my
interest
to
pass
on
the
culture
of
my
grandparents
to
our
children
.
My
grandparents
were
from
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland">
Ireland
</ref>
,
and
they
loved
their
culture
and
passed
on
a
love
of
the
culture
to
me
.
I
wanted
to
pass
the
love
on
to
our
children
so
when
each
one
turned
four
years
old
,
he
or
she
began
to
learn
to
play
the
fiddle
and
to
Irish
dance
.
We
never
intended
to
be
a
performing
family
,
but
the
children
loved
the
music
and
dance
and
became
quite
accomplished
at
an
early
age
.
We
also
began
going
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fiddle">
fiddle
</ref>
camps
when
the
children
were
very
young
.
At
the
camps
great
fiddlers
are
brought
in
from
Ireland
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland">
Scotland
</ref>
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape%20Breton">
Cape
Breton
</ref>
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shetland%20Islands">
Shetland
Islands
</ref>
,
etc.
and
the
children
would
learn
the
tunes
&quot;
by
ear
&quot;
from
amazing
musicians
who
would
teach
the
music
and
provide
enough
inspiration
for
the
whole
year
.
Ten
years
ago
our
children
began
fiddling
at
a
local
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmers'%20market">
farmers
'
market
</ref>
to
earn
money
for
fiddle
camp
and
thus
Celtic
Spring
was
born
.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Q
:
</hi>
Celtic
Spring
was
consistently
a
fan-favorite
,
as
one
of
the
Viewer
's
Choice
in
the
semi-finals
,
and
in
the
top
5
of
the
finals
.
Why
do
you
think
America
loved
your
performance
as
it
did
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
A
:
</hi>
America
loved
Celtic
Spring
's
performance
because
the
Irish
fiddle
music
is
beautiful
to
listen
to
and
the
Irish
stepdancing
is
awesome
;
furthermore
,
Celtic
Spring
members
are
excellent
musicians
and
dancers
.
I
think
people
love
that
they
are
all
one
family
and
that
they
also
fiddle
and
dance
at
the
same
time
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Q
:
</hi>
Overall
,
are
you
satisfied
with
the
experience
<hi rend="italic">
America
's
Got
Talent
</hi>
provided
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
A
:
</hi>
Celtic
Spring
had
a
wonderful
experience
with
<hi rend="italic">
America
's
Got
Talent
</hi>
.
We
were
thrilled
that
our
audience
liked
our
performance
so
much
!
We
also
had
a
great
time
getting
to
know
the
other
performers
and
all
the
staff
at
the
show
.
The
talent
and
the
staff
became
like
a
big
family
.
Most
of
all
,
we
liked
having
all
that
time
together
as
a
family
.
We
are
sad
that
the
show
has
ended
and
all
the
family
have
expressed
the
sadness
.
We
are
grateful
for
all
the
friends
and
fans
we
have
made
through
the
show
and
hope
to
meet
them
as
we
perform
around
the
country
.
