<p>
i
would
hope
moore
for
wr2
so
he
do
nt
have
to
get
with
the
cb1
or
what
if
moore
is
good
enough
to
take
the
cb1
and
let
devin
be
more
productive
at
wr2
.
what
do
you
guys
think
?

I
mean
they
play
different
positions
and
will
be
used
differently
.
I
think
maybe
Funch
will
have
more
grabs
and
DJ
will
have
more
yards
and
TDs
.
</p>
<p>
I
think
Funch
,
Olsen
and
CMC
are
most
likely
to
be
our
third-down
go-to
guys
.
DJ
will
get
some
1st
2nd-down
screens
and
he
'll
probably
house
a
couple
,
and
he
'll
break
an
ankle
or
two
to
get
himself
wide
open
downfield
.
</p>
<p>
He
and
Samuel
might
run
some
jet
sweeps
and
end
arounds
.
I
mean
the
ideal
situation
is
CMC
is
Brian
Westbrook
,
Funch
is
like
Moose
Alshon
Jeffery
Dez
Bryant
Brandon
Marshall
,
Samuel
is
like
Tyreek
Hill
Percy
Harvin
,
and
Moore
is
like
Steve
Smith
Antonio
Brown
.
That
's
what
the
offensive
coaches
will
be
daydreaming
about
,
and
while
it
's
unlikely
everyone
reaches
that
level
,
each
of
them
has
the
potential
to
do
so
.
If
they
all
maximize
their
potential
and
we
have
anything
resembling
an
O-Line
and
a
healthy
Cam
we
'll
have
a
top
5
offense
year-in
year-out
for
several
years
.
</p>
<p>
I
think
people
are
overestimating
Smith
's
likely
role
in
the
team
.
We
traded
a
guy
we
were
gonna
cut
for
a
guy
they
were
gonna
cut
.
He
's
very
much
fighting
for
a
spot
on
the
53
with
Wright
,
Byrd
&amp;
Shepard
.
He
could
show
signs
of
the
old
Torrey
Smith
and
make
himself
a
lock
,
or
he
could
show
signs
of
continued
decline
and
become
a
bubble
guy
.
</p>
<p>
I
think
it
's
very
possible
Shep
makes
the
53
as
a
special
teams
ace
since
there
are
enough
receivers
ahead
of
him
that
his
value
on
special
teams
is
higher
than
a
#6
receiver
(
so
really
a
#8
passing
target
because
of
Greg
CMC
)
who
does
n't
strengthen
our
ST
as
much
.
Special
teams
are
important
</p>
<p>
Smith
is
29
,
Wright
is
28
,
Byrd
is
25
.
Byrd
and
Smith
would
be
likely
to
play
the
same
role
in
the
offense
,
so
I
think
there
's
a
chance
Wright
makes
the
team
as
basically
Funch
's
backup
and
it
comes
down
to
whether
Smith
is
enough
better
than
Byrd
to
make
up
for
the
age
difference
</p>
<p>
Chemistry
with
Cam
will
play
a
huge
role
in
who
gets
targets
,
too
.
We
know
he
has
good
chemistry
with
Funchess
,
Olsen
&amp;
CMC
,
so
to
break
into
that
tier
of
targets
,
Cam
will
have
to
trust
the
player
.
I
expect
Cam
will
love
DJ
Moore
and
they
'll
click
immediately
.
He
was
also
developing
great
chemistry
with
Byrd
before
Byrd
's
injury
.
He
and
Shep
did
n't
really
click
(
which
would
matter
way
less
if
Shep
is
the
#6
receiver
instead
of
,
at
times
last
year
,
the
#2
)
.
We
do
n't
know
yet
how
well
Samuel
,
Smith
&amp;
Wright
will
click
with
Cam
,
and
I
guess
Thomas
is
part
of
that
group
as
well
.
So
that
's
a
factor
as
well
