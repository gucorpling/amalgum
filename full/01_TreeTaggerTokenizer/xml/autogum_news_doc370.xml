government
panel
met
last
Tuesday
and
is
drafting
a
report
aimed
to
urge
Japan
to
loosen
restrictions
on
participation
in
military
combat
—
restriction
of
military
to
self-defense
—
imposed
in
its

They
expected
to
finalize
the
report
after

The

fourteen
members
headed
by
Shunji
Yanai
,
former
ambassador
to
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/US">

</ref>
—
sought
ways
to
reinterpret
the
constitution
on
the
grounds
there
was
not
enough
public
support
for
revising
,
or
rewriting
,
the
constitution
itself
.
</p>
<p>
Shinzo
Abe
said
he
was
motivated
to
help
keep
international
peace
—
by
protecting
other
nations
'
troops
,
which
was
beyond
the
scope
currently
allowed
under
the
constitution
.
He
interpreted
it
as
a
country
's
right
,
commenting
,
&quot;
it
's
about
whether
we
can
exercise
this
right
that
every
country
has
&quot;
.
</p>
<p>
During
the
Tuesday
meeting
,
Abe
also
expressed
a
concern
that
the
country
's
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national%20security">
national
security
</ref>
was
not
ready
for
potential
regional
conflicts
:
&quot;
Japan
's
preparation
for
national
security
threats
in
the
region
is
not
sufficient
.
We
must
cover
all
the
bases
to
protect
the
people
's
lives
and
safety
in
any
possible
scenario
&quot;
.
Yousuke
Isozaki
,
a
security
policy
adviser
to
Mr
Abe
,
said
a
revised
military
policy
would
strengthen
Japan
's
ties
with
allies
,
the
US
in
particular
.

saying
Abe
was
trying

up
fears
