ONCE
upon
a
time
,
it
matters
little
when
,
and
in
stalwart
England
,
it
matters
little
where
,
a
fierce
battle
was
fought
.
It
was
fought
upon
a
long
summer
day
when
the
waving
grass
was
green
.
Many
a
wild
flower
formed
by
the
Almighty
Hand
to
be
a
perfumed
goblet
for
the
dew
,
felt
its
enamelled
cup
filled
high
with
blood
that
day
,
and
shrinking
dropped
.
Many
an
insect
deriving
its
delicate
colour
from
harmless
leaves
and
herbs
,
was
stained
anew
that
day
by
dying
men
,
and
marked
its
frightened
way
with
an
unnatural
track
.
The
painted
butterfly
took
blood
into
the
air
upon
the
edges
of
its
wings
.
The
stream
ran
red
.
The
trodden
ground
became
a
quagmire
,
whence
,
from
sullen
pools
collected
in
the
prints
of
human
feet
and
horses
’
hoofs
,
the
one
prevailing
hue
still
lowered
and
glimmered
at
the
sun
.
</p>
<p>
Heaven
keep
us
from
a
knowledge
of
the
sights
the
moon
beheld
upon
that
field
,
when
,
coming
up
above
the
black
line
of
distant
rising-ground
,
softened
and
blurred
at
the
edge
by
trees
,
she
rose
into
the
sky
and
looked
upon
the
plain
,
strewn
with
upturned
faces
that
had
once
at
mothers
’
breasts
sought
mothers
’
eyes
,
or
slumbered
happily
.
Heaven
keep
us
from
a
knowledge
of
the
secrets
whispered
afterwards
upon
the
tainted
wind
that
blew
across
the
scene
of
that
day
’s
work
and
that
night
’s
death
and
suffering
!
Many
a
lonely
moon
was
bright
upon
the
battle-ground
,
and
many
a
star
kept
mournful
watch
upon
it
,
and
many
a
wind
from
every
quarter
of
the
earth
blew
over
it
,
before
the
traces
of
the
fight
were
worn
away
.
</p>
<p>
They
lurked
and
lingered
for
a
long
time
,
but
survived
in
little
things
;
for
,
Nature
,
far
above
the
evil
passions
of
men
,
soon
recovered
Her
serenity
,
and
smiled
upon
the
guilty
battle-ground
as
she
had
done
before
,
when
it
was
innocent
.
The
larks
sang
high
above
it
;
the
swallows
skimmed
and
dipped
and
flitted
to
and
fro
;
the
shadows
of
the
flying
clouds
pursued
each
other
swiftly
,
over
grass
and
corn
and
turnip-field
and
wood
,
and
over
roof
and
church-spire
in
the
nestling
town
among
the
trees
,
away
into
the
bright
distance
on
the
borders
of
the
sky
and
earth
,
where
the
red
sunsets
faded
.
Crops
were
sown
,
and
grew
up
,
and
were
gathered
in
;
the
stream
that
had
been
crimsoned
,
turned
a
watermill
;
men
whistled
at
the
plough
;
gleaners
and
haymakers
were
seen
in
quiet
groups
at
work
;
sheep
and
oxen
pastured
;
boys
whooped
and
called
,
in
fields
,
to
scare
away
the
birds
;
smoke
rose
from
cottage
chimneys
;
sabbath
bells
rang
peacefully
;
old
people
lived
and
died
;
the
timid
creatures
of
the
field
,
the
simple
flowers
of
the
bush
and
garden
,
grew
and
withered
in
their
destined
terms
:
and
all
upon
the
fierce
and
bloody
battle-ground
,
where
thousands
upon
thousands
had
been
killed
in
the
great
fight
.
But
,
there
were
deep
green
patches
in
the
growing
corn
at
first
,
that
people
looked
at
awfully
.
Year
after
year
they
re-appeared
;
and
it
was
known
that
underneath
those
fertile
spots
,
heaps
of
men
and
horses
lay
buried
,
indiscriminately
,
enriching
the
ground
.
The
husbandmen
who
ploughed
those
places
,
shrunk
from
the
great
worms
abounding
there
;
and
the
sheaves
they
yielded
,
were
,
for
many
a
long
year
,
called
the
Battle
Sheaves
,
and
set
apart
;
and
no
one
ever
knew
a
Battle
Sheaf
to
be
among
the
last
load
at
a
Harvest
Home
.
For
a
long
time
,
every
furrow
that
was
turned
,
revealed
some
fragments
of
the
fight
.
For
a
long
time
,
there
were
wounded
trees
upon
the
battle-ground
;
and
scraps
of
hacked
and
broken
fence
and
wall
,
where
deadly
struggles
had
been
made
;
and
trampled
parts
where
not
a
leaf
or
blade
would
grow
.
For
a
long
time
,
no
village
girl
would
dress
her
hair
or
bosom
with
the
sweetest
flower
from
that
field
of
death
:
and
after
many
a
year
had
come
and
gone
,
the
berries
growing
there
,
were
still
believed
to
leave
too
deep
a
stain
upon
the
hand
that
plucked
them
.
</p>
<p>
The
Seasons
in
their
course
,
however
,
though
they
passed
as
lightly
as
the
summer
clouds
themselves
,
obliterated
,
in
the
lapse
of
time
,
even
these
remains
of
the
old
conflict
;
and
wore
away
such
legendary
traces
of
it
as
the
neighbouring
people
carried
in
their
minds
,
until
they
dwindled
into
old
wives
’
tales
,
dimly
remembered
round
the
winter
fire
,
and
waning
every
year
.
Where
the
wild
flowers
and
berries
had
so
long
remained
upon
the
stem
untouched
,
gardens
arose
,
and
houses
were
built
,
and
children
played
at
battles
on
the
turf
.
The
wounded
trees
had
long
ago
made
Christmas
logs
,
and
blazed
and
roared
away
.
The
deep
green
patches
were
no
greener
now
than
the
memory
of
those
who
lay
in
dust
below
.
The
ploughshare
still
turned
up
from
time
to
time
some
rusty
bits
of
metal
,
but
it
was
hard
to
say
what
use
they
had
ever
served
,
and
those
who
found
them
wondered
and
disputed
.
An
old
dinted
corselet
,
and
a
helmet
,
had
been
hanging
in
the
church
so
long
,
that
the
same
weak
half-blind
old
man
who
tried
in
vain
to
make
them
out
above
the
whitewashed
arch
,
had
marvelled
at
them
as
a
baby
.
If
the
host
slain
upon
the
field
,
could
have
been
for
a
moment
reanimated
in
the
forms
in
which
they
fell
,
each
upon
the
spot
that
was
the
bed
of
his
untimely
death
,
gashed
and
ghastly
soldiers
would
have
stared
in
,
hundreds
deep
,
at
household
door
and
window
;
and
would
have
risen
on
the
hearths
of
quiet
homes
;
and
would
have
been
the
garnered
store
of
barns
and
granaries
;
and
would
have
started
up
between
the
cradled
infant
and
its
nurse
;
and
would
have
floated
with
the
stream
,
and
whirled
round
on
the
mill
,
and
crowded
the
orchard
,
and
burdened
the
meadow
,
and
piled
the
rickyard
high
with
dying
men
.
So
altered
was
the
battle-ground
,
where
thousands
upon
thousands
had
been
killed
in
the
great
fight
.
