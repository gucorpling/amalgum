Love

Do
you
keep
a
large
circle

I
would

close

How

</hi>
Yeah
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
I
keep
it
pretty
close
or
I
find
it
too
overwhelming
because
I
am
always
working
on
projects
and
I
need
to
concentrate
.
But
in
terms
of
self
destruct
?
If
I
was
to
self
destruct
I
would
say
four
people
that
would
be
there
.

</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Sharin

</hi>
Yeah
,
I

I
did
n't
count
in
my
mom

my
dad
...
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
No
,
I
did
n't
,
either
.
How
about
you
?
If
you
self-destructed
how
many
people
could
you
count
on
to
stay
by
you
?

No

close

Sharin
would
be
there

Within
the
band
,
our
drummer
in
Denmark
is
my
really
good
friend
,
because
we
have
been
living
such
a
crazy
life
together
for
so
long
that
we
just
became
so
close
.
And
over
here
I
might
have
maybe
five
,
six
people
,
maybe
.

DS
:
As
your
fame
has
increased
,
have
you
found
it
more
difficult
to
trust
people
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Sune
:
</hi>
Not
at
all
.
I
have
n't
experienced
anything
like
that
.
I
have
found
it
easier
to
meet
people
.
But
I
have
n't
found
too
many
phonies
,
and
I
have
n't
had
a
problem
with
that
.
I
do
n't
go
out
much
,
and
when
I
go
out
I
just
usually
go
out
with
my
friends
and
I
'll
occasionally
go
out
to
see
a
show
.
So
,
I
really
do
n't
meet
that
many
people
.
And
the
people
I
meet
on
the
road
are
fans
and
stuff
,
and
I
always
try
to
be
polite
and
accommodate
them
as
best
I
can
.

Do
you
guys
see
an
end
to
the
band
,
a
day
when
you
can
see
yourselves
feeling
done
with
it
?

<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Sune

</hi>
I
do
n't
know
...
I
guess
sometimes
we
think
about
if
we
want
to
start
a
family
or
something
like
that
.
Or
maybe
there
will
be
other
priorities
at
a
certain
point
...
we
joke
about
it
a
lot
,
actually
...
