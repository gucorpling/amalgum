Perperikon
</hi>

The
ancient
Thracian
town
of
Perperikon
is
located
in
the
Eastern
Rhodopes
,
about
15
km
northeast
of
the
Kardzhali
on
a
470
m
high
rocky
hill
,
which
is
thought
to
have
been
a
sacred
place
.
The
village
of
Gorna
Krepost
(
&quot;
Upper
Fortress
&quot;
)
is
located
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
and
the
gold-bearing
Perpereshka
River
flows
near
it
.
Perperikon
is
the
largest
megalith
ensemble
in
the
Balkans
.
It
is
thought
that
the
famous
Temple
of
Dionysius
is
located
at
this
location
.
</item>
<item>
<hi rend="bold">
Tatul
</hi>
.
The
Thracian
sanctuary
is
one
of
the
most
imposing
megalithic
monuments
discovered
on
the
territory
of
Bulgaria
.
The
sanctuary
is
a
massive
rock
structure
and
its
top
is
a
truncated
pyramid
.
The
complex
comprises
two
sarcophagi
,
a
rectangular
bed
for
the
main
altar
,
and
a
three-metre-deep
well
.
It
dates
back
to
the
end
of
the
5th
and
the
beginning
of
the
4th
centuries
BC
.

The
Womb
cave
</hi>
.
This
Thracian
megalith
-
The
Womb
Cave
(
Cult
complex
“
Utroba
cave
”
Тракийско
светилище
Пещера
Утроба
)
is
located
near
village
of
Ilinica
.
The
temple
is
shaped
like
the
opening
to
a
vagina
.
It
leads
into
a
22
m
deep
cave
.
At
the
end
of
the
cave
,
a
carved
altar
(
1.3
in
height
)
symbolises
the
womb
itself
.
At
midday
as
the
sun
approaches
its
highest
point
,
the
sun
light
seeps
into
the
cave
through
a
special
opening
in
the
ceiling
and
projects
a
perfectly
recognisable
representation
of
a
phallus
onto
the
floor
.
As
the
sun
progresses
further
,
and
the
light
slants
across
the
interior
of
the
cave
,
the
phallus
grows
longer
,
reaching
out
to
the
womb
altar
.
Only
during
some
months
of
the
year
,
when
the
sun
is
lowest
on
the
horizon
,
the
phallus
becomes
long
enough
to
reach
the
altar
and
symbolically
fecundate
the
womb
.
A
well
marked
tourist
route
exists
through
Enchec
village
and
around
300m
after
mountain
cottage
“
Borovica
”
.
The
way
to
the
cave
includes
around
an
hour
of
walking
up
.
The
path
is
steep
but
with
three
big
alcoves
and
a
shelter
right
under
the
cleft
of
the
cliff
.
Local
people
know
the
place
as
Dangardak
kaya
(
The
echoing
stone
)
.
Today
childless
couples
visit
the
Womb
cave
to
gain
a
long-awaited
child
