Poseidon
's
Wrath

<p>
&quot;
A
family
reunion
would
be
nice
.
I
really
do
n't
get
around
as
much
as
I
used
to
.
The
job
,
you
know
.
Duties
.
Responsibilities
.
You
humans
!
You
just
do
n't
understand
how
vexing
it
can
be
,
being
a
God
.
Why
,
every
day
,
day
in
and
day
out
,
I
've
got
to
have
the
sun
rise
.
No
big
chore
,
but
it
's
only
one
of
many
.
&quot;
Zeus
shook
his
head
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
The
moon
,
if
I
do
n't
watch
her
,
goes
wandering
off
.
Messes
up
the
tides
terribly
.
Disconcerting
to
young
lovers
,
too
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
He
looked
,
head
cocked
to
the
side
,
at
Demo
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
So
,
what
may
I
ask
,
do
you
want
here
at
Olympus
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
For
a
moment
Demo
was
nonplused
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Sire
,
I
gathered
you
had
sent
for
me
.
I
came
not
of
my
own
volition
.
Perhaps
some
other
has
need
of
my
services
.
.
.
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Somebody
is
playing
games
,
and
they
are
surely
going
to
get
themselves
into
a
mess
of
trouble
.
Yes
!
A
mess
.
.
.
of
.
.
.
trouble
!
&quot;
Zeus
glanced
around
,
a
thoughtful
expression
on
his
face
.
</p>
<p>
A
titter
sounded
from
the
inner
hallway
.
</p>
<p>
Zeus
glanced
at
Demo
to
see
whether
he
had
noted
the
sound
.
</p>
<p>
Demo
was
silent
.
Best
to
leave
all
surmises
alone
.
After
all
,
he
thought
,
who
am
I
to
criticize
the
dalliances
of
Zeus
.
</p>
<p>
Zeus
smiled
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Anyway
,
you
are
here
,
so
let
's
get
you
started
on
another
exciting
excursion
.
By
the
way
,
you
've
really
done
remarkably
well
,
and
I
am
proud
of
you
.
Here
,
let
me
give
you
a
slight
token
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
He
thought
a
moment
,
smiled
once
more
,
and
waved
his
hands
nonchalantly
in
the
air
.
The
medal
was
large
and
shiny
as
Zeus
slipped
the
supporting
chain
over
Demo
's
head
.
Demo
took
the
medal
in
his
hands
,
read
the
legend
thereon
.
Although
the
words
were
difficult
to
read
in
an
inverted
position
he
managed
to
decipher
them
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
For
Ungodly
Support
to
the
Gods
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Zeus
kissed
him
on
one
cheek
,
then
the
other
.
&quot;
I
'm
never
sure
the
order
in
which
I
'm
supposed
to
do
that
.
Never
mind
.
If
I
got
it
wrong
,
we
'll
merely
change
the
ritual
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
He
glanced
rather
anxiously
toward
the
hallway
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Young
man
,
rather
quickly
now
.
I
want
you
to
drop
in
on
Poseidon
.
Lovely
fellow
,
you
'll
like
him
.
Eh
,
do
n't
ever
discuss
fishing
with
him
.
He
has
a
dread
of
the
subject
.
I
was
fishing
one
day
and
he
nibbled
at
the
bait
,
and
.
.
.
Anyway
,
a
subject
not
to
be
discussed
.
Where
was
I
.
.
.
?
&quot;
Zeus
glared
at
Demo
as
though
the
boy
had
stolen
his
train
of
thought
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Take
this
bag
with
you
,
and
give
it
into
his
hands
,
and
his
only
.
He
'll
know
what
to
do
.
By
the
way
,
do
you
own
a
bathing
suit
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Zeus
,
Olympus
,
and
all
else
seemed
to
be
fading
away
.
Demo
seemed
to
hear
,
faintly
,
Zeus
scolding
.
&quot;
Now
,
you
know
you
are
n't
supposed
to
play
with
my
powers
.
You
just
leave
that
young
man
alone
,
my
dear
.
I
'm
such
an
ogre
when
I
'm
jealous
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
He
landed
with
a
splash
.
</p>
<p>
Zeus
'
aim
was
plainly
off
.
</p>
<p>
Almost
always
he
had
landed
in
his
home
,
the
forest
.
But
this
?
</p>
<p>
The
middle
of
a
stream
,
of
course
.
He
slipped
under
the
water
,
propelled
himself
upward
,
glancing
quickly
around
at
the
height
of
his
watery
leap
.
A
shudder
went
through
him
.
</p>
<p>
No
river
,
this
!
</p>
<p>
Neither
shores
,
nor
the
green
forest
,
nor
the
high
mountains
of
home
!
</p>
<p>
Water
,
only
water
!
Deep
blue
water
,
extending
as
far
as
eye
could
see
.
Blue
.
.
.
and
salty
.
Surely
he
had
landed
in
the
ocean
!
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Zeus
,
Oh
,
Zeus
!
I
do
think
you
may
have
erred
.
.
.
only
slightly
,
of
course
.
Zeus
.
.
.
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Who
dares
call
on
Zeus
,
when
he
swims
in
my
domain
?
How
come
you
here
,
earthling
?
Where
is
your
ship
?
Do
you
not
fear
my
watchdogs
,
the
great
sharks
that
guard
my
kingdom
.
And
why
call
you
on
Zeus
.
Poseidon
rules
these
waves
!
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
.
.
.
My
name
is
Demo
.
I
was
merely
doing
an
errand
for
Zeus
.
And
,
through
some
mischance
,
I
landed
in
these
waters
.
Perhaps
you
can
direct
me
to
the
nearest
shore
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Mischance
,
eh
?
Well
,
Zeus
is
putting
on
the
years
.
.
.
Odd
,
but
he
may
be
losing
his
grip
.
Oughta
spend
more
time
at
the
seashore
.
Relaxing
.
Yes
indeed
.
&quot;
The
voice
seemed
to
emanate
from
a
puff-fish
,
which
floated
rather
nonchalantly
at
arms
length
away
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
The
nearest
shore
.
Of
course
.
You
earthlings
.
I
would
invite
you
down
for
a
meal
,
but
you
lack
the
necessary
organs
to
join
me
.
Toward
the
setting
sun
.
A
small
island
.
I
'll
race
you
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Demo
looked
to
the
west
.
Water
,
only
water
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Is
it
,
well
,
very
far
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
No
,
no
!
Just
a
good
swim
away
.
Ah
,
forgive
me
.
It
could
be
a
bit
strenuous
for
you
.
I
'll
take
care
of
it
,
though
.
&quot;
The
puff-fish
whistled
loudly
,
popped
up
above
the
water
to
peruse
its
surface
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Here
he
comes
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Demo
followed
the
puff-fish
's
gaze
.
He
wished
he
had
n't
!
</p>
<p>
The
shark
was
approaching
at
alarming
speed
.
Its
fin
split
the
water
's
smooth
surface
,
drawing
ever
closer
.
Demo
's
eyes
widened
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Hey
,
that
's
a
shark
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Yes
,
yes
indeed
!
Actually
,
merely
a
minnow
as
sharks
grow
.
Actually
,
he
was
the
only
one
in
the
area
,
so
I
flagged
him
down
.
Oh
,
taxi
,
right
this
way
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
shark
circled
slowly
,
at
times
rising
to
the
surface
,
its
cold
eyes
regarding
Demo
with
hungry
interest
.
