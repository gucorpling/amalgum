Early

<p>
Anjirō
was

samurai
</ref>
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satsuma_Domain">
Satsuma

,
and
was
described
to
be
&quot;
rich
and
of
a
noble
extraction
&quot;
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-butler-2">

</ref>
but
he
killed
a
man
and
was
forced
to
go
on
the
run
.
In
the
port
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kagoshima">
Kagoshima
</ref>
,
he
met
the
Portuguese
captain
of
a
trading
ship
,
Alvaro
Vas
,
to
whom
he
confessed
his
deed
and
described
his
hardships
as
an
outlaw
.
Vas
got
him
a
job
on
a
Portuguese
ship
,
but
Anjirō
reported
to
the
wrong
ship
and
presented
himself
to
Captain
Jorge
Álvares
,
a
personal
friend
of

.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-3">

Álvares
took
him
to
Malacca
to
see
Xavier
since
he
felt
Xavier
was
better
suited
to
hear
Anjirō
's
confession
.
Upon
their
arrival
,
however
,
they
had
discovered
that
Xavier
had
departed
for
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moluccas">

Disappointed
,
Anjirō
boarded
a
ship
that
would
take
him
back
to
Japan
,
but
it
encountered
a
storm
and
had
to
take
shelter
on
the
Chinese
coast
.
There
,
he
met
yet
another
Portuguese
captain
,
who
informed
him
that
Xavier
had
returned
to
Malacca
,
and
the
captain
took
Anjirō
back
to
Malacca
,
where
he
finally
met
Xavier
in
December
1547
.

With
Xavier
</head>
<p>
Anjirō
had
picked
up
some
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pidgin">
pidgin
</ref>
Portuguese
by
this
time
and
could
communicate
with
Xavier
directly
.
The
priest
told
Anjirō
the
word
of
God
while
Anjirō
described
the
land
of
Japan
to
Xavier
,
which
impressed
the
priest
so
much
that
he
became
resolved
to
go
to
Japan
himself
.
Anjirō
then
went
with
Xavier
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goa">
Goa
</ref>
,
the
headquarters
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_India">
Portuguese

</ref>
where
he
was
baptized
with
the
name
Paulo
de
Santa
Fé
(
Paul
of
the
Holy
Faith
)
,
furthered
his
training
in
the

On
14
April
1549
,
Xavier
left
Goa
and
made
his
way
to
Japan
with
a
party
of
seven
,
including
Anjirō
as
interpreter
,
and
reached
Malacca
by
25
April
.

,

<p>
The
party
landed
in
Kagoshima
on
August
15
,
1549
and
soon
attracted
attention
as
foreigners
who
came
all
the
way
from
India
,
or
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenjiku">
Tenjiku
</ref>
,
which
was
where
the
Japanese
understood
as
the
birthplace
of
Buddhism
.
Anjirō
gathered
crowds
by
vividly
describing
his
experiences
in
India
,
and
even
the
Satsuma
daimyo
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimazu_Takahisa">
Shimazu
Takahisa
</ref>
became
curious
and
sent
for
Anjirō
and
Xavier
for
an
audience
at
his
court
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-8">
[

</ref>
Xavier
made
a
good
impression
on
the
young
daimyo
,
who
allowed
his
vassals
to
convert
to
Xavier
's
creed
.
At
the
time
,
the
Japanese
did
not
realize
that
Xavier
was
actually
preaching
a
new
religion
different
from
Buddhism
since
he
had
come
from
India
.
The
confusion
was
compounded
by
Anjirō
's
choice
of
using
the
term
&quot;
Dainichi
&quot;
,
the
Japanese
word
for
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vairocana_Buddha">
Vairocana
Buddha
</ref>
,
to
refer
to
the
Christian
God
since
he
mistakenly
assumed
that
Japan
had
only
one
creator
God
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-9">
[

</ref>
Xavier
eventually
realized
the
mistake
in
the
summer
of
1551
when
he
was
preaching
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaguchi,_Yamaguchi">
Yamaguchi
</ref>
,
far
away
from
Satsuma
.
He
used
the
Latin
word
&quot;
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus">
Deus
</ref>
&quot;
henceforth
and
denounced
&quot;
Dainichi
&quot;
as
&quot;
an
invention
of
the
devil
&quot;
.
The
Buddhist
monks
,
who
initially
respected
Xavier
,
now
resented
him
,
forming
an
obstacle
to
the
efforts
of
the
Jesuits
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-10">
[

]
</ref>
Xavier
acknowledged
that
Anjirō
was
uneducated
in
the
written
language
(
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Chinese">
Classical
Chinese
</ref>
)
and
so
could
not
read
well
enough
to
give
evidence
about
the
religious
affairs
of
his
homeland
.

Recently
,
the
circumstances
of
Anjirō
's
translation
have
been
complicated
by
scholars
,
including
Jason
Ānanda
Josephson
.
Josephson
notes
that
Anjirō
's
choice
to
translate
<hi rend="italic">
Deus
</hi>
as
<hi rend="italic">
Dainichi
</hi>
reflects
earlier
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shingon_Buddhism">
Shingon
Buddhist
</ref>
means
of
coping
with
religious
difference
,
with
which
Anjirō
may
have
been
familiar
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-12">
[

]
</ref>
Thus
Anjirō
's
terminology
may
have
represented
an
indigenous
Japanese
belief
that
&quot;
translation
can
bridge
divergence
.

After
Xavier
</head>
<p>
After
less
than
a
year
in
Kagoshima
,
Xavier
went
to
Kyoto
in
hopes
of
converting
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_of_Japan">
Emperor
of
Japan
</ref>
to
Christianity
so
the
whole
nation
would
follow
.
He
left
Anjirō
to
lead
the
small
congregation
that
they
had
managed
to
gather
in
Kagoshima
.

After
Xavier
returned
from
his
unsuccessful
endeavour
in
Kyoto
,
during
which
he
realized
both
the
Emperor
of
Japan
and
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashikaga_shogun">
Ashikaga

</ref>
were
powerless
during
the
chaotic
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sengoku_period">

and
their
conversion
would
achieve
nothing
,
he
was
recalled
to
Goa
in

set
his
sights
on
China
,
dying
on
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shangchuan_Island">

off
its

in
the

.
After
Xavier
's
departure
from
Japan
,
Anjirō
's
mission
in
Kagoshima
became
deserted
in
just
two
years
,
and
Anjirō
was
driven
out
by
religious
persecution
.
He
descended
into
piracy
and
died
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wokou">

pirate
</ref>
on
a
raid
in
China
