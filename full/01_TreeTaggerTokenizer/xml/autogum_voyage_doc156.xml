<p>
Gotland
is
said
to
be
the
homeland
of
the
legendary
Goths
,
who
migrated
through
Central
Europe
sacked
the
<ref target="Roman%20Empire">
Roman
Empire
</ref>
during
the
5th
century
AD
.
Medieval
Gotland
language
has
many
similarities
with
the
Gothic
language
,
though
there
are
no
first-hand
historical
records
that
the
Goths
really
came
from
Gotland
.
In
its
early
history
,
Gotland
was
an
independent
kingdom
and
still
today
,
the
older
generations
do
not
regard
themselves
as
Swedes
-
they
are
nothing
but
Gotlanders
.
</p>
<p>
Gotland
was
a
central
location
of
the
<ref target="Vikings%20and%20the%20Old%20Norse">
Viking
Age
</ref>
of
the
8th
to
11th
centuries
.
While
the
true
Vikings
(
pirates
or
mercenaries
)
were
not
from
Gotland
,
many
people
on
the
island
were
sailing
merchants
;
<hi rend="italic">

.
During
the
<ref target="Hanseatic%20League">
Hanseatic
period
</ref>
in
the
Middle
Ages
,
<ref target="Visby">
Visby
</ref>
and
Gotland
was
an
important
stop
on
the
trade
routes
on
the
Baltic
Sea
.
The
island
lost
its
role
after
a
Danish
war
in
the
14th
century
.
One
of
the
best-known
events
of
the
island
's
history
was
Danish
king
Valdemar
Atterdag
's
ransom
for
Visby
,
where
he
demanded
large
amounts
of
gold
and
silver
to
spare
the
city
from
being
burnt
down
.
The
written
records
are
unreliable
,
though
.
</p>
<p>
As
the
Hanseatic
League
lost
importance
,
the
Danes
took
control
over
the
island
for
300
years
,
ending
Gotland
's
golden
age
.
The
Dano-Swedish
wars
of
the
16th
and
17th
centuries
gave
Sweden
the
dominant
power
of
the
Baltic
Sea
,
including
Gotland
.
The
island
was
a
poor
backwater
until
the
late
19th
century
,
as
cement
manufacturing
,
tourism
and
military
presence
gave
the
island
a
renaissance
.

Swedish
filmmaker
Ingmar
Bergman
recorded
many
films
on
Gotland
and
the
surrounding
smaller
islands
,
especially
<ref target="F%C3%A5r%C3%B6">
Fårö
</ref>
.
</p>
<p>
The
island
holds
many
medieval
memories
;
old
farmlands
and
more
than
90
churches
,
all
with
different
architecture

Talk

<p>
The
Gotland
dialect
is
remarkable
and
is
easy
to
recognize
.
Still
,
the
islanders
understand
standard
Swedish
,
and
virtually
everyone
but
the
oldest
speaks
English

Gotland

still
only
about
120
km

50

across

and
with
relatively
short
distances
between
