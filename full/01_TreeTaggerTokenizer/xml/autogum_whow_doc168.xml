Steps

<list type="ordered">
<item>
If
you
do
n't
have
one
,
start
a
spy
club
!
They
usually
have
3-6
people
in
them
.
You
can
have
a
big
army
or
a
small
group
of
spies
.
Here
are
the
jobs
you
will
need
to
assign
:
President
:
This
is
the
main
leader
spy
.
You
can
have
just
one
or
,
if
your
group
is
big
,
you
can
even
have
a
small
staff
of
3-5
people
.
Lone
Spy
:
This
is
the
spy
who
spies
the
most
.
This
spy
should
be
allowed
around
town
already
.
Scout
:
This
spy
searches
out
the
spying
area
for
tiny
cameras
,
hidden
weapons
,
etc.
This
stuff
you
will
probably
only
find
if
you
have
an
enemy
spy
club
.
Computer
Spy
:

<item>
Gets

and
keeps
track
of
it
in
a
notebook
.
Conclusion
Spy
:
figures
out
things
.
Trainees
:
rookie
spies
who
are
being
trained
.

Finally
,
let
's
get
down
to
the
school
.
If
you
have
a
staff
,
they
will
be
teachers
.
If
you
do
not
have
a
staff
then
choose
a
few
advanced
spies
.

<item>
Make
the
arrangements
.
Who
will
teach
defense/attack
classes
?
Who
will
teach
about
disguising
?
<figure rend="Start a Spy School Step 5.jpg">

</item>
<item>
Have
at
LEAST
one
person
in
your
club
take
karate
.
They
will
be
the
defense/attack
teacher
.
This
is
an
optional
step
.
If
there
is
no
karate
person
then
just
teach
simple
punching
,
kicking
,
and
slapping
routines
.

Optional
:
make

people
with

<figure rend="Start a Spy School Step 8.jpg">

</item>
<item>
Have
an
official
place
for
the
school
.
<figure rend="Start a Spy School Step 9.jpg">
</figure>
</item>
<item>
Make
a
time
every
week
for
spy
school-
YOU
get
to
choose
how
many
times
you
have
it
per
week
.
I
would
say
only
about
3
times
,
as
spies
need
breaks
,
and
they
need
time
for
homework/fun
.
<figure rend="Start a Spy School Step 10.jpg">
</figure>
</item>
<item>
If
you
want
,
you
can
occasionally
assign
homework
.
Only
something
that
would
take
five
or
ten
minutes
though
.
Spies
do
not
like
wasting
time
.

Eventually
,
you
WILL
get
caught
on
a
mission
.
On
missions
,
always
have
an
excuse/Plan
B.
Your
friends
may
get
mad
if
you
have
the
school
too
often
,
or
if
the
homework
is
long/hard
.
They
WILL
quit
if
they
get
too
mad
!
if
they
get
mad
at
all
,
cut
down
on
the
spy
school
and
spy
homework
!
