<p>
One

'
s
main
tourist
attractions
,
<hi rend="bold">
Vianden
</hi>
is
a
delightful
historic
town
with
a
stunningly
restored
medieval
castle
,
spectacularly
situated
on
a
rock
high
above
town
.
Think
charming
cobblestoned
streets
with
typically
pastel-coloured
Luxembourg
mansions
and
a
gorgeous
<hi rend="italic">
Our
</hi>
valley
backdrop
.
Vianden
is
a
traveller
's
favourite
and
although
high
season
will
bring
in
some
crowds
,
it
's
a
most
pleasant
little
town
with
a
restaurant
at
every
corner
and
all
the
fairytale
atmosphere
you
could
ask
for
.
Coming
here
,
you
'll
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
countless
celebrities
,
famously
going
back
to
Victor
Hugo
,
who
repeatedly
spent
time
here
.
</p>
<head>
History
</head>
<p>
Vianden
's
history
goes
far
back
,
with
a
Gallo-Roma
castellum
preceding
the
current
castle
.
The
earliest
documented
mentions
of
the
town
,
then
called
<hi rend="italic">
Viennensis
</hi>
,
date
from
the
end
of
the
7th
century
.
Building
of
the
castle
began
in
the
11th
century
and
Vianden
soon
became
the
seat
of
the
counts
of
Vianden
,
but
the
city
gained
its
charter
only
in
1308
.
The
town
flourished
in
the
Middle
Ages
,
when
it
was
known
for
its
craftsmen
,
and
later
on
for
its
leather
works
.
The
last
leather
tannery
closed
in
the
1950s
.
</p>
<p>
The
power
of
the
counts
of
Vianden
was
at
its
peak
in
the
13th
century
,
and
so
was
the
grandeur
of
their
castle
.
A
Renaissance-style
structure
was
added
to
the
castle
in
the
17th
century
,
but
over
time
the
state
of
the
fort
diminished
with
the
stature
of
its
lords
.
As
Luxembourg
fell
under
Dutch
rule
,
the
town
became
of
little
consequence
,
with
earthquakes
and
a
fire
further
damaging
its
castle
.
Things
worsened
when
William
I
of
the
Netherlands
,
uninterested
in
Vianden
and
its
castle
,
eventually
sold
the
premises
to
a
local
merchant
,
who
in
turn
sold
off
its
interior
piecemeal
,
leaving
the
place
in
ruins
.
There
were
several
largely
unfruitful
attempts
at
restoration
,
but
it
was
only
in
the
late
1970s
that
serious
repairs
took
place
and
the
castle
was
returned
to
its
former
glory
.
For
anyone
who
's
interested
in
the
town
's
history
,
a
visit
to
the
castle
is
a
must-do
,
as
it
provides
a
wealth
of
information
on
the
matter
.
</p>
<head>
Vianden
today
</head>
<p>
The
revival
of
the
castle
immediately
turned
Vianden
into
a
major
tourist
destination
in
the
region
.
With
its
winding
roads
and
rolling
hills
,
the
area
around
town
is
particularly
popular
among
motorcyclists
,
who
are
welcomed
by
local
establishments
for
the
business
they
bring
.
On
sunny
summer
afternoons
the
town
can
get
a
bit
crowded
and
noisy
because
of
the
many
motorbikes
and
visitors
,
but
early
risers
will
find
a
peaceful
village
even
in
high
season
.

Get

<p>
The
town
itself
is
small
and
just
<hi rend="bold">
walking
</hi>
down
the
Rue
Grande
(
which
does
have
some
vehicular
traffic
)
is
a
must
do
.
The
castle
is
situated
on
a
rock
some
300
m
above
the
town
centre
.
You
can
drive
a
good
part
up
the
hill
and
park
there
,
go
up
by
foot
,
or
walk
down
from
the
télésiège
stop
.
</p>
<p>
The
<hi rend="bold">
télésiège
</hi>
leads
from
the
river
side
to
a
restaurant
stop
even
higher
than
the
castle
,
providing
some
lovely
views
over
town
.
From
there
,
it
's
a
15min
downhill
walk
through
the
forest
to
the
castle
;
the
path
is
fairly
rough
and
steep
,
so
a
reasonable
level
of
fitness
and
appropriate
footwear
are
required
.
The
télésiège
provides
return
tickets
,
but
if
you
want
to
see
the
castle
in
one
go
,
you
will
need
to
walk
the
path
back
up
.
In
that
case
,
buying
a
single
ticket
up
and
strolling
down
the
hill
from
the
castle
to
town
is
at
least
as
convenient
.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively
,
in
summer
,
there
's
a
little
<hi rend="bold">
tourist
train
</hi>
that
runs
through
town
and
up
to
the
castle
,
offering
a
convenient
way
to
reach
the
castle
for
elderly
or
less
mobile
visitors
,
or
another
fun
activity
for
kids

There
's
no

to
miss
the
grand
castle
of
Vianden
,
overlooking

dominating
the

restored
in

as
it

have
been
in

in

Others
have
been
restored
but
leave
more
to
the
imagination
,
including
the
upper
chapel
,
the
impressive
Knight
's
hall
and
the
beautiful
Byzantine
Gallery
.
There
's
an
arms
room
and
a
genealogy
room
,
where
the
family
history
of
the
castle
masters
is
explained
.
In

,
take
your
time
to
wander
through
these
ancient
halls
.

a
fine
trip
for
adults
and

alike

a

He
left

a

at
