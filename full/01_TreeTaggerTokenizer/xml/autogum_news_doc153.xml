'
s
political
opposition
says
mediation
efforts
with
the
government
over
Kenya
's
flawed
December
elections
have
collapsed
and
the
opposition
is
now
calling
for
mass
rallies
across
the
country
next
week
.
</p>
<p>
Orange
Democratic
Movement
(
ODM
)
Secretary-General
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anyang%20Nyongo">
Anyang
Nyongo
</ref>
called
for
Kenyans
in
towns
around
Kenya
to
gather
for
three
days
of
protests
next
week
,
in
a
move
that
it
hopes
will
mimic
the
Ukrainian
revolution
that
led
to
the
overturning
of
flawed
election
results
.
</p>
<p>
Just
minutes
after
the
plan
was
announced
,
Kenya
's
police
commissioner
said
the
rallies
would
not
be
allowed
.
</p>
<p>
Leaders
of
the
opposition
laid
blame
for
the
country
's
political
deadlock
in
the
lap
of
President
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Mwai_Kibaki">
Mwai
Kibaki
</ref>
'
s
government
which
says
the
opposition
should
bring
its
complaints
to
court
.
Opposition
leaders
says
that
the
vote
count
,
which
has
been
surrounded
by
allegations
of
rigging
,
was
a
violation
of
the
constitution
and
that
the
courts
are
in
Mr.
Kibaki
's
pocket
.
</p>
<p>
Flanked
by
opposition
presidential
candidate
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Raila_Odinga">
Raila
Odinga
</ref>
and
ODM
lawmakers
who
won
parliamentary
seats
,
Nyongo
called
the
vote-rigging
and
the
government
's
stance
a
betrayal
of
the
rights
of
all
Kenyans
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
The
Kibaki
side
does
not
want
a
just
solution
,
&quot;
he
said
.
&quot;
It
is
hell-bent
on
clinging
to
power
regardless
of
the
verdict
of
the
people
of
Kenya
.
The
Kibaki
side
wants
only
to
dictate
terms
that
we
should
follow
.
There
are
no
compromises
and
no
second
thoughts
about
what
they
have
done
.
Talks
are
just
an
opportunity
for
them
to
delay
and
silence
us
,
while
they
consolidate
themselves
in
power
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
At
least
500
people
have
been
killed
and
more
than
250,000
displaced
in
violence
that
erupted
since
Kenya
's
vote
,
and
neither
side
has
shown
any
willingness
to
compromise
.

<p>
President
Kibaki
has
named
several
members
of
his
new
Cabinet
despite
the
controversy
over
the
vote
,
which
international
observers
say
appears
to
have
been
rigged
.
Almost
all
of
those
appointed
are
political
allies
,
a
fact
that
the
opposition
has
said
is
proof
of
his
unwillingness
to
compromise
.
</p>
<p>
The
government
says
it
is
committed
to
constructive
dialogue
,
but
opposition
leader
Nyongo
says
that
is
a
sham
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Stealing
is
still
going
on
,
cheating
is
still
going
on
,
and
quite
honestly
,
Kibaki
should
be
embarrassed
to
be
,
embarrassed
every
day
by
the
fact
that
he
stole
,
&quot;
he
added
.
&quot;
I
do
n't
think
it
's
a
very
good
sign
to
be
a
head
of
state
who
has
the
extra
title
of
eminent
thief
.

on
Thursday

was
to
arrive
with
several
prominent
African
leaders
to
try
to
broker
a
compromise
.
Mr.
Odinga
's
team
has
said
it
only
wants
talks
to
take
place
through
a
mediator
,
while
President
Kibaki
has
insisted
on
face-to-face
negotiations
.
