Make
a
Basement
Apartment
</head>
<p>
If
your
home
has
a
basement
level
,
it
may
be
worthwhile
to
consider
how
often
you
use
it
.
Chances
are
you
'll
find
that
your
basement
is
being
used
primarily
for
storage
.
Consider
instead
putting
your
basement
to
work
by
converting
it
into
an
apartment
;
basement
apartments
allow
you
to
supplement
your
income
or
host
a
family
member
that
ca
n't
afford
to
live
on
their
own
.
Learning
how
to
make
a
basement
apartment
is
largely
a
matter
of
ensuring
that
the
legal
criteria
are
met
.
The
scope
of
renovations
required
to
make
the
space
attractive
to
tenants
will
depend
on
your
basement
's
existing
condition
.

Make
sure
that
the
basement
apartment
has
a
dedicated
exit
.
Regulations
regarding
basement
apartment
requirements
vary
between
jurisdictions
,
but
it
is
very
common
that
a
separate
entrance
is
required
.
This
ensures
ease
of
access
but
also
serves
as
a
method
of
emergency
egress
in
case
of
a
fire
.
If
your
basement
already
has
a
door
to
the
outside
,
this
requirement
is
likely
fulfilled
.

Ensure
that
the
basement
has
enough
light
.
Many
building
codes
require
separate
dwellings
to
have
a
certain
amount
of
natural
light
.
Whether
or
not
your
unit
has
adequate
sunlight
can
be
tested
by
a
local
building
inspector
using
special
equipment
.
If
you
ca
n't
pass
this
requirement
,
you
will
have
to
have
additional
windows
installed
along
an
exterior
wall
in
order
to
create
a
legal
basement
apartment
.

Improve
the
sound
and
fire
insulation
between
dwellings
.
Another
major
requirement
concerns
the
amount
of
insulation
between
your
main
dwelling
and
the
basement
unit
.
You
will
almost
certainly
have
to
replace
the
door
to
the
stairway
separating
the
units
with
a
fire
door
;
these
doors
are
usually
made
from
steel
and
can
withstand
a
burn
for
2
hours
or
more
before
giving
way
.
Additional
insulation
for
soundproofing
and
fire
resistance
may
also
be
required
in
the
floor
between
the
units
.
If
your
basement
is
currently
unfinished
,
adding
this
insulation
will
be
easy
.

Plan
a
bathroom
and
kitchen
for
the
basement
apartment
.
If
your
basement
does
not
already
have
a
bathroom
and
kitchen
,
you
'll
want
to
plan
on
adding
them
.
A
bathroom
is
a
necessary
requirement
,
and
building
codes
should
be
kept
in
mind
regarding
aspects
like
head
space
over
the
toilet
and
GFCI
electrical
outlets
.
In
a
very
small
unit
,
you
could
consider
adding
a
kitchenette
rather
than
a
full
kitchen
.
To
install
a
kitchen
from
scratch
,
you
will
need
to
run
new
plumbing
lines
,
as
well
as
gas
lines
for
a
gas
stove
and
ductwork
if
you
want
to
install
a
ducted
range
hood
.

Add
or
remove
any
walls
to
optimize
the
floor
plan
.
A
basement
that
was
not
designed
as
a
separate
dwelling
may
not
have
a
layout
that
will
be
attractive
to
tenants
.
When
planning
changes
to
the
layout
,
consider
whether
the
apartment
will
be
a
studio
,
a
1-bedroom
,
or
a
2-bedroom
.
Remember
that
even
in
a
small
unit
,
partitioning
off
a
separate
space
as
a
bedroom
will
usually
allow
you
to
command
a
higher
rent
.

Update
the
finishes
and
fixtures
as
necessary
.
The
final
step
is
to
consider
all
the
aspects
that
will
make
the
unit
more
attractive
to
tenants
than
other
rental
properties
.
Unless
you
are
trying
to
command
a
very
high
rent
,
finishes
do
not
have
to
be
top-quality
,
but
they
should
not
be
worn
and
damaged
.
Painting
the
walls
and
installing
inexpensive
carpet
are
2
economical
methods
for
quickly
freshening
a
basement
space
.

Renters
cannot
usually
be
expected
to
care
for
a
property
as
diligently
as
owners
.
To
accommodate
this
fact
,
take
steps
to
make
your
rental
unit
as
low-maintenance
as
possible
.
For
example
,
wiring
your
bathroom
fan
to
turn
on
any
time
the
lights
are
on
will
ensure
that
the
bathroom
stays
ventilated
.
</item>
<item>
Market
your
rental
unit
as
aggressively
as
possible
.
Being
able
to
choose
from
a
wide
pool
of
prospective
renters
will
allow
you
to
choose
a
reliable
,
tidy
,
and
respectful
tenant
.
