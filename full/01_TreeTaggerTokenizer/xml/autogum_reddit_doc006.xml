Quick
shout
out
and
thank
you
to
all
who
commented
and
those
who
helped
me
be
more
aware
of
what
to
expect/experience
and
provided
great
suggestions
for
a
first
timer
.
This
will
be
an
even
longer
post
...
I
have
a
pretty
good
memory
but
a
lot
of
my
recollection
of
this
night
is
hazy
as
I
got
deeper
in
.
It
was
all
dreamlike
and
in
that
sense
it
's
like
trying
to
remember
a
dream
that
you
know
actually
happened
.
Thankfully
I
've
been
keeping
a
journal
and
actually
detail
sex
whenever
we
have
it
.
I
wanted
to
remember
this
so
I
wrote
in
my
journal
after
rounds
.
It
is
most
of
what
was
going
on
and
what
we
did
vs
the
sensation
.
Though
I
still
remember
the
sensations
which
I
will
write
about
.

Background
:
</hi>
Neither
my
wife(26F
)
or
I(31M
)
have
ever
been
high
nor
really
messed
with
any
drugs
.
So
my
apologies
if
I
use
lame
terms
or
the
wrong
words
to
describe
things
.
My
wife
has
always
been
interested
but
we
've
just
never
pursued
it
.
She
's
gotten
into
the
CBD
oil
and
other
related
products
like
a
cream
that
we
massage
on
our
necks
for
tension
headaches
that
works
great
.
So
she
's
been
into
the
medicinal
side
of
it
and
I
was
willing
to
try
.
Of
course
there
's
no
THC
so
there
's
no
real
mental
effects
.
During
a
recent
trip
to
Cali
she
got
introduced
to
it
by
her
brother
and
his
wife
as
he
uses
it
medicinally
and
to
get
great
sleep
when
he
gets
behind
.
I
'm
sure
other
things
but
those
were
his
reasons
.
She
did
let
me
know
before
she
left
for
the
trip
that
she
was
thinking
of
getting
some
stuff
for
us
as
I
got
more
open
to
it
after
my
initial
post
above
.
I
was
fine
with
that
but
I
was
slightly
bummed
when
I
found
out
she
already
tried
it
with
her
brother
and
his
wife
.
I
kind
of
wanted
to
experience
it
for
the
first
time
together
but
it
was
nice
to
hear
her
experience
and
what
it
was
like
for
her
.
It
helped
alleviate
some
apprehension
on
my
side
.
I
have
no
idea
what
any
of
the
stuff
was
called
as
I
was
uninterested
and
in
my
head
at
the
moment
when
she
was
showing
me
what
she
got
us
.
It
was
a
black
&quot;
pen
&quot;
that
had
what
looked
like
a
USB
connector
on
one
end
and
she
got
some
oil
in
a
vial
that
connected
to
the
pen
.
The
oil
was
an
indica
strain
as
she
wanted
to
use
it
for
her
really
bad
migraines
and
to
reduce
anxiety
.
The
great
thing
about
this
was
that
it
did
n't
give
off
a
smell
unless
you
were
just
about
to
take
a
hit
and
after
.
Very
discreet
.
Funny
thing
...
She
did
n't
know
how
to
use
the
pen
as
it
was
completely
different
than
the
one
her
brother
had
.
She
kept
saying
the
end
looked
like
a
USB
but
did
n't
know
why
.
She
tried
to
take
a
hit
from
the
USB
end
and
...
Nothing
.
We
later
laughed
as
she
read
the
box
and
learned
that
it
was
in
fact
a
USB
connector
used
for
charging
.
You
took
a
hit
on
the
vial
end
which
actually
had
a
hole
and
mouth
piece
at
closer
inspection
.
A
light
lit
up
when
you
took
a
hit
.
I
was
starting
to
get
a
headache
so
she
asked
if
I
wanted
to
try
and
I
said
not
while
the
baby
was
still
awake
.
So
we
put
it
away
.
She
asked
me
if
I
was
scared
and
I
said
a
little
as
I
do
n't
know
how
it
would
affect
me
.
I
know
this
is
completely
different
but
I
have
a
bad
reaction
to
alcohol
so
I
was
a
bit
concerned
as
to
what
this
could
do
to
me
.
Look
up
&quot;
Asian
Flush
&quot;
and
that
's
what
I
have
.
Anybody
can
have
it
but
apparently
it
's
dominant
in
Asians
?
?
Basically
I
'm
missing
an
enzyme
in
my
liver
that
breaks
down
the
alcohol
.

Story
and
Observations
:
</hi>
Later
that
night
after
my
wife
put
our
daughter
to
bed
my
wife
took
out
the
pen
and
took
a
hit
while
we
were
in
bed
.
She
wanted
a
good
night
's
rest
.
She
waited
a
few
minutes
then
took
another
.
She
said
she
could
feel
it
shortly
after
the
second
hit
.
I
was
skeptical
of
it
working
that
fast
but
apparently
it
can
?
After
she
got
done
coughing
(
lol
)
she
was
noticeably
more
relaxed
.
Still
skeptical
that
it
could
work
that
fast
and
thought
she
was
just
inexperienced
and
thought
she
was
high
but
not
actually
there
yet
.
I
decided
to
take
a
hit
despite
my
worries
and
the
idea
of
having
to
be
taken
to
the
hospital
during
a
nasty/awesome
summer
storm
going
on
.
My
wife
told
me
how
to
do
it
beforehand
and
I
suprisingly
did
something
naturally
that
helped
me
not
cough
as
much
.
Though
I
was
still
hit
kind
of
bad
with
the
coughing
fit
.
Wife
was
looking
up
how
to
do
it
without
coughing
and
one
advice
was
to
breathe
in
some
air
with
the
hit
before
you
exhale
.
Which
I
did
.
I
put
my
mouth
on
the
piece
,
inhaled
and
continued
to
inhale
after
taking
the
piece
out
,
then
exhaled
.
To
my
surprise
I
could
see
vapor
.
I
honestly
do
n't
know
how
all
of
it
works
and
since
we
only
had
a
lamp
on
I
did
n't
see
any
vapors
when
my
wife
exhaled
.
So
I
got
annoyed
as
I
thought
it
would
put
the
smell
in
our
room
(
it
did
n't
)
.
But
started
observing
how
I
was
feeling
.
I
started
to
panic
a
little
as
I
felt
like
something
was
expanding
inside
my
chest
and
wondered
if
this
was
natural
or
me
having
a
bad
reaction
.
It
was
maybe
10-15
seconds
of
panic
and
feeling
that
expansion
.
The
expanding
then
started
to
make
me
cough
.
The
expanding
feeling
continued
.
After
the
coughing
fit
I
was
fine
and
I
started
to
wonder
if
I
was
feeling
it
.
I
did
n't
think
I
did
but
felt
this
tingly
sensation
in
the
back
of
my
head
and
sort
of
behind
my
eyes
.
Hindsight
I
think
I
might
have
been
actually
feeling
it
but
very
low
as
I
was
skeptical
about
things
my
wife
was
saying
.
Waited
a
few
mins
to
see
if
anything
else
happened
and
I
took
another
hit
.
Same
way
but
this
time
inhaled
more
of
the
pen
and
air
.
I
felt
the
expansion
in
my
chest
again
though
not
as
long
nor
scary
like
the
first
and
this
time
I
did
n't
cough
at
all
.
She
mocked
me
being
an
expert
.
I
sat
up
in
bed
waiting
and
observing
and
wondering
if
I
was
feeling
it
while
still
feeling
the
tingly
sensation
.
I
started
to
notice
things
around
the
room
more
and
making
skeptical
faces
at
whatever
my
wife
was
saying
.
Still
unsure
if
I
was
actually
feeling
it
.
Then
after
thinking
of
what
I
was
doing/feeling
vs
how
I
normally
would
...
I
knew
I
was
feeling
something
.
Main
thing
that
tipped
me
off
was
me
zoning
in
on
objects
in
the
room
and
just
wondering
about
how
much
I
noticed
certain
aspects
of
said
object
.
Here
's
where
memory
gets
a
bit
hazy
.
I
know
I
turned
off
the
lamp
as
we
sunk
into
bed
.
My
wife
snuggled
up
against
me
into
the
crook
of
my
arm
and
her
head
on
my
chest/shoulder
.
Talking
about
whatever
.
Meanwhile
I
just
noticed
and
observed
the
darkness
of
the
room
and
the
faint
light
coming
through
the
curtains
from
the
window
.
The
occasional
brightness
with
the
lightning
.
My
wife
said
something
about
not
judging
her
for
probably
going
and
eating
cereal
in
a
bit
.
I
responded
with
,
&quot;
You
're
hungry
?
&quot;
.
I
do
n't
remember
what
she
said
but
I
then
replied
with
,
&quot;
I
'm
just
surprised
you
're
still
hungry
.
&quot;
.
She
then
gets
off
of
me
and
moves
to
her
side
of
the
bed
.
I
know
she
's
upset
but
my
brain
is
going
from
I
do
n't
care
to
why
is
she
upset
to
guess
I
need
to
reassure
her
.
She
's
been
iffy
about
her
weight
as
she
's
going
through
a
lot
of
emotions
and
stress
.
She
's
the
biggest
she
's
ever
been
but
she
does
n't
look
big
to
me
as
her
weight
is
pretty
evenly
distributed
with
her
height
and
settles
mostly
in
her
ass
and
hips
then
to
her
boobs
.
She
thicc
which
I
enjoy
.
She
asked
recently
if
I
cared
and
I
was
honest
.
So
my
brain
went
back
and
forth
between
not
caring
as
she
should
remember
what
I
said
before
about
it
to
...
&quot;
You
need
to
reassure
her
,
bro
.
&quot;
.
This
was
a
long
time
in
my
head
.
It
most
likely
was
not
as
time
slows
down
when
you
're
high
.
I
then
touched
her
,
asked
if
she
was
mad
,
told
her
I
did
n't
mean
anything
by
it
and
that
I
'm
feeling
really
weird
.
She
laughed
and
we
started
talking
some
more
.
I
remember
saying
something
like
,
&quot;
I
was
super
confused
as
to
why
you
got
upset
cuz
I
did
n't
mean
anything
at
all
by
it
.
I
was
just
talking
.
&quot;
Then
for
some
reason
found
it
funny
and
we
both
started
laughing
.
Yeah
...
Definitely
feeling
it
.
I
had
my
arm
around
her
and
then
said
I
wished
she
was
n't
on
her
period
.
She
responded
that
she
's
been
officially
period
free
since
that
afternoon
.
She
's
been
gone
on
her
trip
and
I
just
picked
her
up
that
morning
so
I
was
more
than
ready
to
jump
her
bones
.
<hi rend="bold">
READ
HERE
:
</hi>
I
was
planning
to
put
in
what
I
wrote
in
my
journal
here
but
it
's
more
explicit
than
what
I
've
seen
in
this
sub
.
I
do
n't
completely
know
the
rules
about
that
here
so
I
'll
leave
it
out
.
I
can
put
it
in
later
if
a
mod
says
it
's
OK
.
So
instead
I
'll
just
describe
the
sensations
and
thought
processes
with
some
details
.
First
off
,
this
was
where
it
really
felt
like
I
was
dreaming
.
Like
I
was
completely
zoned
in
on
what
I
was
doing
and
how
she
felt
and
made
me
feel
.
Definitely
understand
the
cotton
mouth
and
cotton
vagina
now
.
Made
out
with
her
which
was
interesting
with
the
dry
mouth
.
Not
as
dry
as
it
sounds
but
definitely
not
as
wet
as
normal
making
out
.
Interesting
to
make
out
in
that
state
for
sure
.
She
grabbed
her
dildo
nearby
and
we
shared
control
of
it
on
her
.
Continued
making
out
and
her
giving
me
oral
in
the
process
.
Dry
mouth
did
n't
affect
this
sensation
at
all
.
It
actually
felt
amazing
especially
when
she
tended
to
my
balls
.
Normally
I
feel
a
bit
of
pain
.
Like
an
extremely
minor
kick
in
the
balls
when
she
sucks
them
but
I
felt
none
of
that
.
Just
pure
pleasure
.
I
also
noticed
my
voice
changed
.
Like
it
was
softer
more
soothing
.
Guessing
cuz
I
was
a
lot
more
relaxed
.
She
then
got
in
doggy
and
I
discovered
the
cotton
vagina
.
This
was
an
interesting
observation
as
my
wife
normally
gets
really
wet
but
also
because
we
used
the
dildo
beforehand
.
She
felt
wet
on
my
fingers
when
I
controlled
the
dildo
and
she
was
completely
aroused
and
into
it
so
I
was
surprised
I
could
n't
go
in
as
easy
.
I
kept
asking
her
to
get
the
lube
but
she
was
just
zoned
in
.
So
I
finally
gave
up
and
started
thrusting
hoping
she
'd
get
wet
as
I
started
.
Thankfully
she
very
quickly
did
.
I
felt
like
I
was
in
a
completely
different
place
.
Just
the
complete
dark
around
me
and
feeling
my
wife
's
body
and
having
sex
.
I
'm
really
big
on
visual
and
seeing
things
so
the
fact
I
was
so
immersed
without
seeing
things
was
awesome
.
Whenever
I
sort
of
zoned
back
out
so
I
could
see
her
it
was
like
waking
up
from
a
dream
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
wondering
if
you
were
still
dreaming
.
Commenced
more
dirty
talk
as
I
did
n't
have
any
inhibitions
and
have
been
wanting
her
to
talk
more
dirty
.
She
asked
to
be
gripped
harder
and
deeper
.
So
I
obliged
for
a
good
while
.
Then
I
went
to
say
something
else
and
she
came
right
as
I
started
to
speak
and
this
surprised
me
.
It
's
difficult
to
make
her
cum
in
PIV
and
she
has
n't
done
it
in
months
.
I
do
n't
think
she
's
ever
came
in
doggy
either
so
it
was
cool
to
feel
her
buck
and
quiver
in
that
position
while
I
was
still
in
her
.
I
would
say
awesome
but
my
brain
was
in
surprised
mode
throughout
most
of
the
orgasm
before
it
went
into
sly
,
confident
mode
to
be
more
aware
of
the
sensation
and
capitalize
to
help
it
continue
.
She
said
it
felt
so
good
while
I
kept
thrusting
.
Skipping
some
details
I
eventually
also
came
through
doggy
through
lots
of
dirty
talk
from
her
as
she
rallied
from
her
own
orgasm
for
me
.
Again
,
I
was
completely
zoned
in
throughout
most
of
it
.
Only
zoning
out
to
just
see
what
I
was
doing
and
what
was
going
on
only
to
slip
back
into
the
awesome
dream
.
We
then
took
a
break
where
she
had
her
cereal
and
watched
Friends
on
her
phone
while
I
journaled
.
I
could
feel
myself
coming
back
down
from
the
high
as
I
was
more
aware
of
the
room
rather
than
being
in
my
weird
dream/hazy
state
.
I
was
somewhere
in
between
that
stage
and
my
initial
stage
of
noticing
the
details
in
the
room
.
I
knew
I
was
still
affected
as
my
writing
was
broken
into
1
and
2
sentence
paragraphs
and
looked
really
choppy
.
Like
I
was
trying
to
scramble
and
remember
everything
as
it
came
to
me
before
the
memories
disappeared
.
I
fixed
this
the
next
day
.
I
asked
her
how
she
felt
and
she
said
everything
felt
amazing
and
that
she
was
so
in
the
moment
.
She
did
n't
have
normal
anxiety
of
me
wearing
her
out
or
just
anxiety
about
it
in
general
.
We
also
drank
a
glass
of
water
each
and
acknowledged
the
dry
mouth
with
each
other
.
After
she
finished
her
cereal
she
came
back
with
more
water
and
took
2
hits
and
another
which
surprised
me
.
She
shrugged
when
I
questioned
3
.
I
took
one
hit
.
Same
expanding
in
chest
feeling
and
coughed
a
little
this
time
.
Then
we
started
another
round
.
She
started
with
giving
me
oral
and
she
thought
I
was
bigger
to
which
she
then
measured
by
seeing
how
much
of
me
fit
in
her
mouth
.
Normally
she
can
get
close
to
the
base
but
this
time
she
was
n't
close
.
Probably
a
good
inch
further
than
where
she
normally
can
go
.
Always
a
nice
gesture
to
get
cock
size
acknowledged
and
then
proceed
to
be
measured
by
mouth
:
)
.
Tbh
...
I
'm
average
but
if
this
was
the
case
this
would
of
put
me
at
7
&quot;
.
I
will
admit
I
'm
judging
based
on
hazy
memory
and
I
also
do
n't
know
how
much
effort
my
wife
put
in
regarding
measuring
.
But
I
do
recall
me
hitting
the
back
of
her
throat
and
her
closing
her
lips
around
me
.
I
had
a
good
idea
of
where
I
felt
her
lips
.
I
also
did
feel
bigger
and
harder
with
little
mental
effort
on
my
part
.
My
wife
then
said
she
was
ready
and
we
started
making
out
while
I
fingered
her
.
She
was
n't
as
wet
so
I
asked
for
the
lube
again
.
She
was
zoned
in
again
but
I
was
persistent
and
she
finally
admitted
that
she
did
n't
know
.
She
then
gave
me
a
suggestion
on
where
to
look
...
Looked
.
Not
there
.
She
then
found
it
right
next
to
her
on
her
dresser
the
whole
time
.
I
asked
her
why
she
could
n't
have
got
it
before
and
she
came
back
asking
why
I
did
n't
see
it
myself
.
I
replied
with
&quot;
I
dunno
.
I
was
just
doing
my
thing
.
&quot;
She
gave
me
a
look
stating
she
was
doing
the
same
.
We
also
got
her
vibrator
and
she
came
that
way
.
More
dirty
talk
and
sharing
fantasies
uninhibited
.
She
put
herself
in
pretzel
pose
and
I
was
able
to
go
deeper
and
harder
.
Hit
one
of
her
fornixes
a
few
times
.
Came
a
lot
more
and
harder
than
the
first
round
.
We
drank
more
water
and
talked
a
bit
more
and
I
attempted
a
third
round
.
It
actually
went
a
long
while
with
her
&quot;
pillow
princessing
&quot;
it
which
was
fine
as
I
was
purely
focused
on
just
wanting
to
do
a
quickie
.
She
would
just
caress
my
back
,
sides
,
and
arms
.
Occasionally
push
herself
against
me
.
I
took
a
long
while
and
she
was
fine
the
whole
time
as
I
would
check
in
but
despite
the
sensation
I
could
n't
cum
.
We
kissed
and
said
our
goodnights
happy
and
fulfilled
.
I
checked
my
clock
and
the
whole
thing
was
maybe
1.5-2
hrs.
I
was
shocked
as
I
thought
it
would
've
been
2
in
the
morning
or
4/5
hrs
judging
how
long
everything
felt
.
I
did
n't
care
that
it
felt
like
a
long
time
due
to
how
awesome
everything
felt
plus
I
just
did
n't
care
or
think
about
anything
else
other
than
the
sex
we
were
having
.
I
was
actually
really
happy
it
was
only
12:20
and
we
both
slept
hard
and
so
well
.
I
did
wake
up
around
2:30
to
get
our
daughter
as
she
was
crying
and
I
felt
like
I
was
still
feeling
the
effects
.
It
might
've
just
been
feeling
the
effects
of
waking
up
from
a
really
deep
sleep
though
.
I
noticed
the
next
day
that
I
still
kind
of
felt
different
.
Genuinely
wondered
if
I
was
still
feeling
the
effects
somehow
as
I
noticed
I
was
just
a
bit
more
aware
than
normal
and
when
I
did
focus
in
on
something
.
I
was
pretty
zoned
in
.
This
feeling
lasted
until
the
evening
started
and
I
genuinely
felt
completely
normal
.
My
wife
never
indicated
or
said
that
she
felt
different
that
day
other
than
the
amazing
sleep
she
had
.
As
parents
who
still
co-sleep
(
put
the
baby
to
sleep
in
her
bed
,
take
her
or
she
walks
to
our
bed
in
the
middle
of
the
night
)
...
I
think
the
extra/great
sleep
we
both
experienced
just
gave
us
minor
super
powers
for
the
day
.

Tips
:
</hi>
<hi rend="bold">
Be
aware
and
prepared
for
the
dry
mouth
and
vagina
.
It
's
real
.
Hopefully
someone
can
comment
below
on
how
to
combat
it
.
</hi>
Indica
is
a
more
relaxing
strain
.
Sativa
is
a
more
heightened
awareness
.
Do
your
research
on
both
.
My
wife
did
and
I
trusted
her
.
A
hybrid
is
apparently
the
way
to
go
for
sex
though
.
*
Experience
it
first
in

environment

you
feel

You
just

do
n't

it

Final
Thoughts
:
</hi>
This
was
absolutely
amazing
for
both
my
wife
and
I.
With
her
cumming
while
in
doggy
I
'm
wondering
what
other
opportunities
this
opens
up
for
PIV
orgasms
.
I
love
watching
and
giving
her
orgasms
but
it
was
usually
clitoral
.
So
her
having
one
while
I
was
still
inside
her
WITH
normal
effort
is
awesome
.
The
times
I
've
made
her
come
through
PIV
it
was
through
a
lot
of
physical
effort
or
really
,
really
getting
her
going
mentally
.
Even
then
...
Circumstance
was
at
play
.
I
almost
only
ever
want
to
have
high
sex
now
and
I
wish
we
did
this
way
before
we
had
a
kid
.
This
is
coming
from
someone
who
really
likes
to
keep
their
senses
and
wits
about
them
especially
for
sex
so
I
can
be
more
present
,
aware
,
and
just
really
enjoy
the
moment
.
High
sex
heightened
all
of
that
.
I
was
purely
focused
on
her
pleasure
and
mine
.
She
had
no
anxiety
or
worries
about
anything
she
'd
normally
have
during
sex
.
Said
that
she
wanted
to
do
it
again
soon
as
it
was
just
way
better
.
We
were
both
just
completely
immersed
with
each
other
and
what
we
were
doing
.
I
was
a
lot
more
vocal
and
so
was
she
.
Both
in
communicating
what
we
wanted
and
the
gasps
and
moans
of
amazing
sex
.
I
also
had
more
stamina
and
felt
and
was
bigger
due
to
the
heightened
arousal
.
Her
brother
is
supposed
to
send
us
a
hybrid
indica/sativa
.
Supposedly
even
better
for
sex
as
the
sativa
will
heighten
sensation
and
awareness
but
the
indica
will
balance
it
with
it
's
mellow
effect
.
Feel
free
to
ask
any
questions
or
provide
better
tips
.
Could
definitely
use
more
tips
to
make
the
next
experience
better
or
more
prepared
.
I
thought
I
'd
share
my
first
experience
and
give
my
insight
and
observations
as
a
first
timer
to
help
others
.
Would
definitely
like
to
hear
others
first
experience
of
high
sex
.
We
plan
on
going
to
a
hotel
soon
.
Wife
will
get
her
wax
,
possibly
do
the
day
with
no
panties
and
a
dress
and
going
out
in
public
the
day
of
the
hotel
,
then
her
dressing
up
in
bed
.
Most
likely
exploring
more
of
both
sexual
mile
stones
.
Gonna
be
a
fun
and
very
sexual
day/night
.

UPDATE
:
</hi>
Had
sex
last
night
with
me
sober
and
my
wife
high
.
It
was
interesting
as
I
was
wondering
what
that
would
be
like
earlier
that
day
.
She
wanted
to
relax
before
sleep
but
I
guess
got
horny
in
the
middle
of
it
as
she
did
n't
have
any
underwear
and
just
wrapped
her
leg
around
me
and
started
humping
while
smiling
at
me
.
We
kissed
a
couple
times
but
then
she
just
got
in
doggy
and
we
went
at
it
like
that
for
awhile
.
She
was
more
wet
initially
than
the
first
time
but
still
not
as
wet
as
she
usually
gets
.
She
quickly
got
wetter
as
we
started
going
and
stayed
that
way
throughout
.
Never
really
changed
position
.
Just
speed
,
depth
,
stance
etc.
Honestly
it
was
n't
that
much
different
from
normal
sex
other
than
I
could
tell
she
was
in
it
a
lot
more
.
Just
in
that
zone
but
because
I
was
a
bit
inhibited
due
to
my
MIL
staying
that
night
I
did
n't
really
dive
into
what
I
wanted
.
Just
focused
on
trying
to
get
her
off
.
Unfortunately
it
did
n't
happen
.
I
actually
kind
of
came
a
little
during
a
really
heated
moment
but
not
fully
and
kept
going
for
a
decent
while
until
another
really
heated
moment
and
then
finally
,
fully
came
when
I
could
n't
hold
back
.
Mild
though
as
I
was
still
thrusting
and
trying
to
get
her
off
but
then
&quot;
faked
&quot;
the
orgasm
very
shortly
after
when
I
knew
she
was
n't
.
I
ended
up
staying
inside
her
as
she
just
rocked
back
and
forth
into
me
which
felt
really
good
.
Very
awesome
visual
and
enjoyable
to
experience
.
After
a
good
long
while
of
that
she
finally
stopped
and
laid
down
.
She
said
that
she
could
've
gone
forever
.
Like
a
rocking
chair
.
Lol
.
Offered
to
get
her
vibrator
and
she
said
no
in
her
relaxed
state
.
She
just
laid
there
touching
and
caressing
herself
and
I
did
the
same
to
her
.
