A

failure
five
minutes
from

end
interrupted

Group

The

,
was
stopped
for
27
minutes
after
the
lighting
on
one
half
of
the
stadium
suddenly
turned
off
.
</p>
<p>
At
the
time
of
the
disruption
-
84
minutes
35
seconds
played
-
the
match
was
delicately
poised
at
one
goal
apiece
.
</p>
<p>
An
spokesperson
for
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian%20Football%20Confederation">
Asian
Football
Confederation
</ref>
has
said
that
the
lighting
failure
was
'
due
to
problems
with
power
around

.

from
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Australia">
Australia
</ref>
,
immediately
stopped
the
match
after
the
lights
turned
out
.
Under
tournament
rules
,
officials
had
one
hour
to
get
the
lights
and
play
restarted
before
the
match
would
have
to
be
abandoned
.
An
emergency
generator
was
used
to
restore
some
of
the
knocked-out
lights
to
a
sufficient
level
for
playing
,
allowing
Shield
to
restart
play
after
the
lengthy
delay
.
</p>
<p>
The
match
was
an
eventful
one
generally
,
especially
after
half
time
.
Both
teams
played
a
cautious
first
half
which
was
devoid
of
any
real
scoring
opportunities
.
</p>
<p>
However
,
after
the
break
,
Korea
went
1-0
ahead
through
striker
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choi%20Sung-Kuk">
Choi
Sung-Kuk
</ref>
after
sixty-six
minutes
.
A
curling
cross
from
the
left-hand
wing
found
the
head
of
Sung-Kuk
,
who
moved
in
front
of
the
Saudi
defender
and
headed
the
ball
into
the
bottom
right-hand
corner
of
the
net
.
</p>
<p>
Eleven
minutes
later
,
referee
Shield
awarded
Saudi
Arabia
a

minutes

</p>
<p>
After
play
was
restarted
due
to
the
power
failure
,
Saudi
Arabia
had
an
excellent
chance
to
win
the
match
with
the
final
kick
of
the
game
.
