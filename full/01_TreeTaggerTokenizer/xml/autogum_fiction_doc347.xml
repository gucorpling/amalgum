Nikobob
Refuses
a
Crown
</head>
<p>
Almost
the
first
persons
that
Zella
saw
when
she
landed
from
the
silver-lined
boat
at
Regos
were
her
father
and
mother
.
Nikobob
and
his
wife
had
been
greatly
worried
when
their
little
daughter
failed
to
return
from
Coregos
,
so
they
had
set
out
to
discover
what
had
become
of
her
.
When
they
reached
the
City
of
Regos
,
that
very
morning
,
they
were
astonished
to
hear
news
of
all
the
strange
events
that
had
taken
place
;
still
,
they
found
comfort
when
told
that
Zella
had
been
seen
in
the
boat
of
Prince
Inga
,
which
had
gone
to
the
north
.
Then
,
while
they
wondered
what
this
could
mean
,
the
silver-lined
boat
appeared
again
,
with
their
daughter
in
it
,
and
they
ran
down
to
the
shore
to
give
her
a
welcome
and
many
joyful
kisses
.
</p>
<p>
Inga
invited
the
good
people
to
the
palace
of
King
Gos
,
where
he
conferred
with
them
,
as
well
as
with
Rinkitink
and
Bilbil
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Now
that
the
King
and
Queen
of
Regos
and
Coregos
have
run
away
,
&quot;
he
said
,
&quot;
there
is
no
one
to
rule
these
islands
.
So
it
is
my
duty
to
appoint
a
new
ruler
,
and
as
Nikobob
,
Zella
's
father
,
is
an
honest
and
worthy
man
,
I
shall
make
him
the
King
of
the
Twin
Islands
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Me
?
&quot;
cried
Nikobob
,
astounded
by
this
speech
.
&quot;
I
beg
Your
Highness
,
on
my
bended
knees
,
not
to
do
so
cruel
a
thing
as
to
make
me
King
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Why
not
?
&quot;
inquired
Rinkitink
.
&quot;
I
'm
a
King
,
and
I
know
how
it
feels
.
I
assure
you
,
good
Nikobob
,
that
I
quite
enjoy
my
high
rank
,
although
a
jeweled
crown
is
rather
heavy
to
wear
in
hot
weather
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
With
you
,
noble
sir
,
it
is
different
,
&quot;
said
Nikobob
,
&quot;
for
you
are
far
from
your
kingdom
and
its
trials
and
worries
and
may
do
as
you
please
.
But
to
remain
in
Regos
,
as
King
over
these
fierce
and
unruly
warriors
,
would
be
to
live
in
constant
anxiety
and
peril
,
and
the
chances
are
that
they
would
murder
me
within
a
month
.
As
I
have
done
no
harm
to
anyone
and
have
tried
to
be
a
good
and
upright
man
,
I
do
not
think
that
I
should
be
condemned
to
such
a
dreadful
fate
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Very
well
,
&quot;
replied
Inga
,
&quot;
we
will
say
no
more
about
your
being
King
.
I
merely
wanted
to
make
you
rich
and
prosperous
,
as
I
had
promised
Zella
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Please
forget
that
promise
,
&quot;
pleaded
the
charcoal-burner
,
earnestly
;
&quot;
I
have
been
safe
from
molestation
for
many
years
,
because
I
was
poor
and
possessed
nothing
that
anyone
else
could
envy
.
But
if
you
make
me
rich
and
prosperous
I
shall
at
once
become
the
prey
of
thieves
and
marauders
and
probably
will
lose
my
life
in
the
attempt
to
protect
my
fortune
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Inga
looked
at
the
man
in
surprise
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
What
,
then
,
can
I
do
to
please
you
?
&quot;
he
inquired
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Nothing
more
than
to
allow
me
to
go
home
to
my
poor
cabin
,
&quot;
said
Nikobob
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Perhaps
,
&quot;
remarked
King
Rinkitink
,
&quot;
the
charcoal-burner
has
more
wisdom
concealed
in
that
hard
head
of
his
than
we
gave
him
credit
for
.
But
let
us
use
that
wisdom
,
for
the
present
,
to
counsel
us
what
to
do
in
this
emergency
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
What
you
call
my
wisdom
,
&quot;
said
Nikobob
,
&quot;
is
merely
common
sense
.
I
have
noticed
that
some
men
become
rich
,
and
are
scorned
by
some
and
robbed
by
others
.
Other
men
become
famous
,
and
are
mocked
at
and
derided
by
their
fellows
.
But
the
poor
and
humble
man
who
lives
unnoticed
and
unknown
escapes
all
these
troubles
and
is
the
only
one
who
can
appreciate
the
joy
of
living
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
If
I
had
a
hand
,
instead
of
a
cloven
hoof
,
I
'd
like
to
shake
hands
with
you
,
Nikobob
,
&quot;
said
Bilbil
the
goat
.
&quot;
But
the
poor
man
must
not
have
a
cruel
master
,
or
he
is
undone
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
During
the
council
they
found
,
indeed
,
that
the
advice
of
the
charcoal-burner
was
both
shrewd
and
sensible
,
and
they
profited
much
by
his
words
.
</p>
<p>
Inga
gave
Captain
Buzzub
the
command
of
the
warriors
and
made
him
promise
to
keep
his
men
quiet
and
orderly
--
if
he
could
.
Then
the
boy
allowed
all
of
King
Gos
's
former
slaves
,
except
those
who
came
from
Pingaree
,
to
choose
what
boats
they
required
and
to
stock
them
with
provisions
and
row
away
to
their
own
countries
.
When
these
had
departed
,
with
grateful
thanks
and
many
blessings
showered
upon
the
boy
Prince
who
had
set
them
free
,
Inga
made
preparations
to
send
his
own
people
home
,
where
they
were
told
to
rebuild
their
houses
and
then
erect
a
new
royal
palace
.
They
were
then
to
await
patiently
the
coming
of
King
Kitticut
or
Prince
Inga
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
My
greatest
worry
,
&quot;
said
the
boy
to
his
friends
,
&quot;
is
to
know
whom
to
appoint
to
take
charge
of
this
work
of
restoring
Pingaree
to
its
former
condition
.
My
men
are
all
pearl
fishers
,
and
although
willing
and
honest
,
have
no
talent
for
directing
others
how
to
work
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
While
the
preparations
for
departure
were
being
made
,
Nikobob
offered
to
direct
the
men
of
Pingaree
,
and
did
so
in
a
very
capable
manner
.
As
the
island
had
been
despoiled
of
all
its
valuable
furniture
and
draperies
and
rich
cloths
and
paintings
and
statuary
and
the
like
,
as
well
as
gold
and
silver
and
ornaments
,
Inga
thought
it
no
more
than
just
that
they
be
replaced
by
the
spoilers
.
So
he
directed
his
people
to
search
through
the
storehouses
of
King
Gos
and
to
regain
all
their
goods
and
chattels
that
could
be
found
.
Also
he
instructed
them
to
take
as
much
else
as
they
required
to
make
their
new
homes
comfortable
,
so
that
many
boats
were
loaded
full
of
goods
that
would
enable
the
people
to
restore
Pingaree
to
its
former
state
of
comfort
.
