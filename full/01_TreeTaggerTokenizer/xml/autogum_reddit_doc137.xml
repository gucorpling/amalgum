I
think
polish
and
refinement
of
gameplay
mechanics
is
even
more
important
than
simply
adding
new
things
when
it
comes
to
the
enjoyment
of
a
video
game
sequel
.

<sp who="#Prince_Perseus">

For
example
,
AC
Origins
.
Bayek
never
did
something
I
did
n't
want
him
to
do
.
He
climbed
when
I
wanted
him
to
climb
,
he
jumped
down
when
I
wanted
him
to
jump
down
.
He
stopped
when
I
wanted
and
ran
when
I
wanted
.
This
was
made
very
apparent
to
me
when
I
played
AC
Syndicate
.
Controlling
Jacob
felt
like
I
was
nudging
him
in
a
general
direction
then
he
did
whatever
the
hell
he
wanted
.
It
's
really
hard
to
get
into
the
game
after
Origins
.
I
remember
having
similar
thoughts
when
I
first
played
Mass
Effect
2
after
playing
3
.
Mass
Effect
2
was
still
enjoyable
but
I
noticed
that
the
gunplay
,
powers
,
and
movement
felt
a
lot
better
to
me
in
Mass
Effect
3
which
did
much
more
for
me
than
the
new
weapons
and
powers
.
Certain
game
franchises
get
a
lot
of
flak
for
having
games
that
are
too
similar
but
the
refinement
of
gameplay
mechanics
is
just
as
important
as
new
things
.
I
think
extra
polish
and
refinement
is
even
more
important
for
one
's
enjoyment
of
a
game
than
simply
changing
things
up
.
This
is
a
big
reason
why
I
'm
excited
for
the
upcoming
State
of
Decay
2
and
Spider-man
PS4
.
I
loved
the
concept
of
the
original
State
of
Decay
but
my
enjoyment
was
hampered
by
clunky
controls
and
bugs
.
If
these
issues
were
resolved
then
my
personal
enjoyment
of
the
game
would
have
tripled
.
While
I
'm
sure
the
new
Spider-man
will
be
doing
some
new
things
,
I
'm
more
excited
by
how
Insomniac
seems
to
have
taken
inspiration
from
the
gameplay
of
the
TASM
games(Which
had
a
lot
of
good
ideas
imo
)
and
elevated
it
to
new
heights
.
Do
n't
care
how
many
new
costumes
there
are
,
as
long
as
the
game
looks
and
feels
good
then
I
am
more
than
satisfied
.
Also
,
I
think
ELEX
would
have
benefited
<hi rend="bold">
immensely
</hi>
by
a
lot
less
&quot;
Euro-Jank
&quot;
.
I
'm
not
sure
why
such
a
thing
is
liked
by
this
sub
.
</p>

<sp who="#aggressive-cat">
<p>
It
gets
a
lot
of
shit
for
other
reasons
,
but
the
refinement
of
the
controls
from
Crysis
to
Crysis
2
was
one
of
the
most
impressive
ux
upgrades
I
can
think
of
.
</p>
<p>
If
you
're
unaware
in
the
original
game
you
had
to
select
a
mode
with
a
ui
wheel
(
which
was
uncommon
in
pc
games
at
the
time
)
or
bind
buttons
to
switching
modes
.
It
was
serviceable
but
often
hilariously
awkward
than
useful
.
</p>
<p>
In
the
second
game
they
took
away
the
modes
,
but
integrated
all
the
effects
into
a
more
standard
control
scheme
.
So
instead
of
selecting
power
mode
and
kicking
or
throwing
something
,
you
just
hold
in
the
interaction
button
to
get
the
'
power
'
version
.
</p>
<p>
Literally
the
only
thing
that
ended
up
going
away
from
the
original
game
was
being
able
to
select
speed
mode
while
prone
and
power
crawl
,
lol
.
A
single
lost
feature
,
but
a
much
slicker
and
intuitive
control
scheme
was
really
impressive
.
