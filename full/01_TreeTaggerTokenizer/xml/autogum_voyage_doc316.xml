Loei
is
a
city
surrounded
by
undulating
mountain
ranges
whose
fog-shrouded
summits
are
abundant
with
flora
.
The
well-known
mountains
are
Phu
Kradung
,
Phu
Luang
,
and
Phu
Ruea
.
Its
temperature
is
comfortably
cool
,
with
beautiful
geographical
surroundings
,
as
well
as
unique
cultures
and
traditions
.
In
the
cool
season
it
can
get
decidedly
chilly
,
one
of
the
few
parts
of
Thailand
that
ever
gets
down
to
0
degrees
Celsius
.
</p>
<p>
Loei
is
520
km
from
Bangkok
,
covering
an
area
of
11,424
square
kilometres
.
The
city
's
population
is
roughly
23,000
.
It

part
of

,
on
the
bank
of
the
Mekong
River
along
the
Phetchabun
mountain
range
.
</p>
<p>
In
the
past
,
it
was
a
small
community
in
a
prosperous
empire
during
the
same
period
as
the
Thai
Kingdom
of
Ayutthaya
.
Later
,
the
Lan
Chang
Empire
became
weaker
,
therefore
,
the
community
moved
to
be
with
Ayutthaya
.
During
the
reign
of
King
Rama
V
of
the
Rattanakosin
period
,
the
community
was
upgraded
to
become
Loei
Province
.
