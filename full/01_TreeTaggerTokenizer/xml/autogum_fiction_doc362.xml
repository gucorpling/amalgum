Inside
the
Sphere
</head>
<p>
&quot;
Go
on
,
&quot;
said
Cavor
,
as
I
sat
across
the
edge
of
the
manhole
,
and
looked
down
into
the
black
interior
of
the
sphere
.
We
two
were
alone
.
It
was
evening
,
the
sun
had
set
,
and
the
stillness
of
the
twilight
was
upon
everything
.
</p>
<p>
I
drew
my
other
leg
inside
and
slid
down
the
smooth
glass
to
the
bottom
of
the
sphere
,
then
turned
to
take
the
cans
of
food
and
other
impedimenta
from
Cavor
.
The
interior
was
warm
,
the
thermometer
stood
at
eighty
,
and
as
we
should
lose
little
or
none
of
this
by
radiation
,
we
were
dressed
in
shoes
and
thin
flannels
.
We
had
,
however
,
a
bundle
of
thick
woollen
clothing
and
several
thick
blankets
to
guard
against
mischance
.
</p>
<p>
By
Cavor
's
direction
I
placed
the
packages
,
the
cylinders
of
oxygen
,
and
so
forth
,
loosely
about
my
feet
,
and
soon
we
had
everything
in
.
He
walked
about
the
roofless
shed
for
a
time
seeking
anything
we
had
overlooked
,
and
then
crawled
in
after
me
.
I
noted
something
in
his
hand
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
What
have
you
got
there
?
&quot;
I
asked
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Have
n't
you
brought
anything
to
read
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Good
Lord
!
No.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
forgot
to
tell
you
.
There
are
uncertainties
--
The
voyage
may
last
--
We
may
be
weeks
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
But
--
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
We
shall
be
floating
in
this
sphere
with
absolutely
no
occupation
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
wish
I
'd
known
--
&quot;
</p>
<p>
He
peered
out
of
the
manhole
.
&quot;
Look
!
&quot;
he
said
.
&quot;
There
's
something
there
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Is
there
time
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
We
shall
be
an
hour
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
I
looked
out
.
It
was
an
old
number
of
<hi rend="italic">
Tit-Bits
</hi>
that
one
of
the
men
must
have
brought
.
Farther
away
in
the
corner
I
saw
a
torn
<hi rend="italic">
Lloyd
's
News
</hi>
.
I
scrambled
back
into
the
sphere
with
these
things
.
&quot;
What
have
you
got
?
&quot;
I
said
.
</p>
<p>
I
took
the
book
from
his
hand
and
read
,
&quot;
The
Works
of
William
Shakespeare
&quot;
.
</p>
<p>
He
coloured
slightly
.
&quot;
My
education
has
been
so
purely
scientific
--
&quot;
he
said
apologetically
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Never
read
him
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Never
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
He
knew
a
little
,
you
know
--
in
an
irregular
sort
of
way
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Precisely
what
I
am
told
,
&quot;
said
Cavor
.
</p>
<p>
I
assisted
him
to
screw
in
the
glass
cover
of
the
manhole
,
and
then
he
pressed
a
stud
to
close
the
corresponding
blind
in
the
outer
case
.
The
little
oblong
of
twilight
vanished
.
We
were
in
darkness
.
For
a
time
neither
of
us
spoke
.
Although
our
case
would
not
be
impervious
to
sound
,
everything
was
very
still
.
I
perceived
there
was
nothing
to
grip
when
the
shock
of
our
start
should
come
,
and
I
realised
that
I
should
be
uncomfortable
for
want
of
a
chair
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Why
have
we
no
chairs
?
&quot;
I
asked
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
've
settled
all
that
,
&quot;
said
Cavor
.
&quot;
We
wo
n't
need
them
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Why
not
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
You
will
see
,
&quot;
he
said
,
in
the
tone
of
a
man
who
refuses
to
talk
.
</p>
<p>
I
became
silent
.
Suddenly
it
had
come
to
me
clear
and
vivid
that
I
was
a
fool
to
be
inside
that
sphere
.
Even
now
,
I
asked
myself
,
is
to
too
late
to
withdraw
?
The
world
outside
the
sphere
,
I
knew
,
would
be
cold
and
inhospitable
enough
for
me
--
for
weeks
I
had
been
living
on
subsidies
from
Cavor
--
but
after
all
,
would
it
be
as
cold
as
the
infinite
zero
,
as
inhospitable
as
empty
space
?
If
it
had
not
been
for
the
appearance
of
cowardice
,
I
believe
that
even
then
I
should
have
made
him
let
me
out
.
But
I
hesitated
on
that
score
,
and
hesitated
,
and
grew
fretful
and
angry
,
and
the
time
passed
.
</p>
<p>
There
came
a
little
jerk
,
a
noise
like
champagne
being
uncorked
in
another
room
,
and
a
faint
whistling
sound
.
For
just
one
instant
I
had
a
sense
of
enormous
tension
,
a
transient
conviction
that
my
feet
were
pressing
downward
with
a
force
of
countless
tons
.
It
lasted
for
an
infinitesimal
time
.
</p>
<p>
But
it
stirred
me
to
action
.
&quot;
Cavor
!
&quot;
I
said
into
the
darkness
,
&quot;
my
nerve
's
in
rags
.
I
do
n't
think
--
&quot;
</p>
<p>
I
stopped
.
He
made
no
answer
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Confound
it
!
&quot;
I
cried
;
&quot;
I
'm
a
fool
!
What
business
have
I
here
?
I
'm
not
coming
,
Cavor
.
The
thing
's
too
risky
.
I
'm
getting
out
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
You
ca
n't
,
&quot;
he
said
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Ca
n't
!
We
'll
soon
see
about
that
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
He
made
no
answer
for
ten
seconds
.
&quot;
It
's
too
late
for
us
to
quarrel
now
,
Bedford
,
&quot;
he
said
.
&quot;
That
little
jerk
was
the
start
.
Already
we
are
flying
as
swiftly
as
a
bullet
up
into
the
gulf
of
space
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
--
&quot;
I
said
,
and
then
it
did
n't
seem
to
matter
what
happened
.
For
a
time
I
was
,
as
it
were
,
stunned
;
I
had
nothing
to
say
.
It
was
just
as
if
I
had
never
heard
of
this
idea
of
leaving
the
world
before
.
Then
I
perceived
an
unaccountable
change
in
my
bodily
sensations
.
It
was
a
feeling
of
lightness
,
of
unreality
.
Coupled
with
that
was
a
queer
sensation
in
the
head
,
an
apoplectic
effect
almost
,
and
a
thumping
of
blood
vessels
at
the
ears
.
Neither
of
these
feelings
diminished
as
time
went
on
,
but
at
last
I
got
so
used
to
them
that
I
experienced
no
inconvenience
.
</p>
<p>
I
heard
a
click
,
and
a
little
glow
lamp
came
into
being
.
</p>
<p>
I
saw
Cavor
's
face
,
as
white
as
I
felt
my
own
to
be
.
We
regarded
one
another
in
silence
.
The
transparent
blackness
of
the
glass
behind
him
made
him
seem
as
though
he
floated
in
a
void
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Well
,
we
're
committed
,
&quot;
I
said
at
last
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Yes
,
&quot;
he
said
,
&quot;
we
're
committed
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Do
n't
move
,
&quot;
he
exclaimed
,
at
some
suggestion
of
a
gesture
.
&quot;
Let
your
muscles
keep
quite
lax
--
as
if
you
were
in
bed
.
We
are
in
a
little
universe
of
our
own
.
Look
at
those
things
!
&quot;
