See
your
dog
as
a
reflection
of
yourself
.
This
is
not
required
,
but
it
does
shed
light
on
how
the
monks
view
and
treat
their
dogs
.

On
a
deeper
level
,
when
we
pay
close
attention
,
dogs
mirror
us
back
to
ourselves
in
unmistakable
ways
that
,
if
we
are
open
,
foster
understanding
and
change
.

You

Create
a
genuinely
positive
,
encouraging
attitude
whenever
you
work
with
your
dog
.
Dogs
are
very
perceptive
and
will
pick
up
on
your
negative
emotions
.
Before
training
your
dog
,
take
a
few
deep
breaths
and
clear
your
mind
.
Visualize
the
training
session
you
're
about
to
have
with
your
dog
.
When
you
feel
calm
and
ready
,
proceed
.

Include
your
dog
in
your
life
on
as
many
different
levels
as
possible
.

Use
eye
contact
to
communicate
.
Use
gentle
looks
to
foster
acceptance
and
trust
.
Use
piercing
and
sustained
eye
contact
when
your
dog
has
done
something
it
should
not
do
,
and
<hi rend="italic">
knows
</hi>
it
should
not
do
(
such
as
snapping
at
strangers
)
.

Approach
training
holistically
.
It
's
not
just
a
set
of
exercises
contained
within
sessions
,
though
that
is
important
.

Understand
your
dog
's
roots
.
Learn
about
wolf
behavior
.
Investigate
the
breed
of
your
dog
,
and
what
that
breed
was
intended
to
do
.

Use
praise
as
a
foundation
,
not
just
as
a
reward
.
Many
people
use
praise
to
&quot;
bribe
&quot;
their
dog
,
and
that
's
something
a
dog
can
easily
see
through
.
Praise
your
dog
generously
and
genuinely
.
Find
out
what
kind
of
praise
animates
your
dog
;
experiment
!
Use
both
physical
and
verbal
praise
.

&quot;
Praise
is
an
attitude
,
a
stance
.
Dogs
who
live
in
an
atmosphere
of
praise
come
to
love
the
human
voice
.
They
are
more
trusting
and
accepting
.
They
are
approachable
by
strangers
but
not
demanding
.
Dogs
confident
of
praise
from
their
owners
do
not
live
o
the
edge
of
an
emotional
abyss
,
always
seeking
out
attention
and
sulking
when
they
do
not
get
it
.
If
praise
is
part
of
your
attitude
toward
your
dog
,
you
have
a
rich
and
exciting
relationship
ahead
.

Use
discipline
with
meaning
and
care

Never
call
a
dog
to
you
to
discipline
him
.
Always
go
to
the
dog
,
even
if
it
means
you
have
to
chase
him
.
</item>
<item>
Do
n't
use
objects
to
discipline
or
punish
.
</item>
<item>
Do
n't
use
your
dog
's
name
when
correcting
behavior
.
</item>
<item>
Discipline
in
proportion
to
the
offense
.
Verbal
discipline
and
leash
corrections
can
fix
most
offenses
.
</item>
<item>
Make
eye
contact
as
you
discipline
.
</item>
<item>
Be
dramatic
.
</item>
<item>
Stop
paying
attention
to
the
dog
for
about
30
minutes
after
a
stern
correction
.
Just
be
passive
and
avoid
eye
contact
,
you
do
not
need
to
be
aggressive
or
vocal
at
all
.
Then
make
up
with
your
dog
by
taking
him
for
a
walk
or
giving
him
his
favorite
toy
.
It
does
n't
have
to
be
dramatic
,
just
resume
your
normal
relationship
.
</item>
<item>
&quot;
Watch
yourself
-
owners
who
are
physically
or
verbally
domineering
wind
up
with
cringing
,
neurotic
dogs
.
Discipline
,
like
praise
,
must
be
meaningful
.
It
must
communicate
the
owner
's
displeasure
clearly
,
and
on
the
dog
's
level
of
understanding
and
perception
,
for
unacceptable
behavior
.
