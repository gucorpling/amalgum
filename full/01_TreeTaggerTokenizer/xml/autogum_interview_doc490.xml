Do
you
believe
the

government
should
have
the
right
to
access
data
on
foreign
nationals
using
services
such
as
Twitter

The
same
NYT
article
describes
you
as
a
WikiLeaks
supporter
;
is
this
still
the
case
?
What
attracts
you
to
their
'
radical
transparency
'
?

I
support
the
concept
of
WikiLeaks
.
While
we
do
n't
have
a
culture
of
protection
for
sources
and
whistleblowers
we
need
sites
like
WikiLeaks
.
Plus
,
I
think
it
is
important
to
give
WikiLeaks
credit
for
raising
awareness
about
in
how
bad
shape
freedom
of
information
and
expression
is
in
our
world
and
it
is
eroding
at
an
alarming
rate
because
of
the
fact
that
legal
firms
for
corporations
and
corrupt
politicians
have
understood
the
borderless
nature
of
the
legalities
of
the
information
flow
online
–
we
who
feel
it
is
important
that
people
have
access
to
information
that
should
remain
in
the
public
domain
need
to
step
up
our
fight
for
those
rights
.
WikiLeaks
has
played
an
important
role
in
that
context
.
I
do
n't
support
radical
transparency
–
I
understand
that
some
things
need
to
remain
secret
.
It
is
the
process
of
making
things
secret
that
needs
to
be
both
more
transparent
and
in
better
consensus
with
nations
.

How
do
you
think
the
Icelandic
government
would
have
reacted
if
it
were
tens
of
thousands
of
their
diplomatic
communications
being
leaked
?

I
am
not
sure
–
A
lot
of
our
dirty
laundry
has
been
aired
via
the
USA
cables
–
our
diplomatic
communications
with
USA
were
leaked
in
those
cables
,
so
far
they
have
not
stirred
much
debate
nor
shock
.
It
is
unlikely
for
tens
of
thousands
of
cables
to
leak
from
Iceland
since
we
do
nt
have
the
same
influence
or
size
as
the
USA
,
nor
do
we
have
a
military
.

Your
ambassador
in
the
US
has
spoken
to
the
Obama
administration
.
Can
you
discuss
any
feedback
from
that
?
Do
you
have
your
party
's
,
and
government
's
,
backing
in
challenging
the
ordered
Twitter
data
release
?

I
have
not
had
any
feedback
from
that
meeting
,
I
did
however
receive
a
message
from
the
DOJ
via
the
USA
ambassador
in
Iceland
.
The
message
stated
three
things
:
1
.
I
am
free
to
travel
to
the
USA
.
2
.
If
I
would
do
so
,
I
would
not
be
a
subject
of
involuntary
interrogation
.
3
.
I
am
not
under
criminal
investigation
.
If
this
is
indeed
the
reality
I
wonder
why
they
are
insisting
on
getting
my
personal
details
from
Twitter
.
I
want
to
stress
that
I
understand
the
reasoning
of
trying
to
get
to
Assange
through
me
,
but
I
find
it
unacceptable
since
there
is
no
foundation
for
criminal
investigation
against
him
.
If
WikiLeaks
goes
down
,
all
the
other
media
partners
should
go
down
at
the
same
time
.
They
all
served
similar
roles
.
The
way
I
see
it
is
that
WikiLeaks
acted
as
the
senior
editor
of
material
leaked
to
them
.
They
could
not
by
any
means
be
considered
a
source
.
The
source
is
the
person
that
leaks
the
material
to
WikiLeaks
.
I
am
not
sure
if
the
media
in
our
world
understands
how
much
is
at
stake
for
already
shaky
industry
if
WikiLeaks
will
carry
on
carrying
the
brunt
of
the
attacks
.
I
think
it
would
be
powerful
if
all
the
medias
that
have
had
access
to
WikiLeaks
material
would
band
together
for
their
defence
.
