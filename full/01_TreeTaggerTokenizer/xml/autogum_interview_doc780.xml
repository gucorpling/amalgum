Why
have
you
chosen
to
involve
yourself
in
the
political
process
?
Why
did
you
choose
to
run
in
this
constituency
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
The
first
time
I
was
able
to
vote
,
in
the
fall
of
the
year
I
turned
eighteen
,
I
read
the
platforms
and
policies
of
the
various
parties
and
I
voted
Green
.
After
that
,
I
started
voting
against
people
.
For
ten
years
,
I
inflicted
my
vote
on
the
politician
I
thought
was
the
worst
,
rather
than
awarding
it
to
the
best
.
I
felt
disenfranchised
.
I
really
had
no
voice
in
this
democracy
,
except
to
complain
.
Finally
,
I
had
had
enough
,
and
voted
the
way
I
really
wanted
to
.
After
that
,
I
was
happy
about
democracy
again
.
I
've
been
hooked
ever
since
.
This
is
where
the
future
is
decided
.
The
exchange
of
ideas
is
vital
to
the
process
,
and
it
's
my
favourite
part
.
Some
of
the
highlights
of
this
campaign
have
been
conversations
with
competing
parties
.
I
'm
running
in
London
North
Centre
because
it
's
where
I
live
,
and
I
want
to
be
able
to
shape
the
destiny
of
my
neighbourhood
,
in
my
city
,
in
my
province
.

What
prior
political
experience
do
you
have
?
What
skills
and
insight
can
you
bring
to
office
,
from
other
non-political
positions
you
may
have
held
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
I
've
been
a
member
of
the
Green
Party
since
2004
,
shortly
after
the
last
election
.
I
've
been
on
the
Constituency
Association
since
shortly
after
I
joined
.
This
is
my
first
run
for
public
office
.
I
have
been
involved
politically
with
the
Kinsmen
and
Kinettes
of
Canada
:
club
executive
,
club
president
,
district
treasurer
and
secretary
,
and
in
a
bid
for
national
office
,
as
well
.
I
understand
democracy
,
the
history
of
Ontario
,
the
issues
at
hand
,
and
the
steps
required
to
address
those
issues
.
I
understand
other
cultures
and
all
faiths
.
I
understand
people
from
all
backgrounds
.
I
am
intelligent
.
I
am
a
problem-solver
.

Which
of
your
competitors
do
you
expect
to
pose
the
biggest
challenge
to
your
candidacy
?
Why
?
What
makes
you
the
most
desirable
of
all
candidates
running
in
the
riding
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
The
incumbent
is
the
biggest
challenge
,
aside
from
the
voters
themselves
.
The
incumbent
has
the
immediate
benefit
of
name
recognition
and
a
pretty
good
track
record
in
office
.
She
's
done
a
pretty
good
job
,
just
for
the
wrong
party
,
in
my
opinion
.
The
voters
are
a
challenge
because
some
of
the
policies
that
the
Green
Party
are
suggesting
seem
strange
and
radical
.
In
some
ways
,
they
are
:
comprehensive
,
inclusive
,
and
holistic
.
We
do
n't
compartmentalize
policy
.
Transit=climate
change=health=economy
.
They
're
all
connected
.
And
that
's
what
makes
any
Green
candidate
the
best
option
:
we
're
thinking
of
the
whole
picture
,
now
and
tomorrow
.
I
understand
this
city
.
I
understand
this
province
.
I
understand
the
challenges
we
will
face
,
and
I
'm
prepared
to
take
step
NOW
to
address
them
.
I
'm
ready
to
educate
the
other
politicians
in
Queen
's
Park
,
and
tell
them
what
I
think
needs
to
be
done
.
I
also
know
that
there
's
no
such
thing
as
a
free
lunch
,
and
we
're
going
to
have
to
pay
up
,
sooner
or
later
.
i
do
n't
want
my
daughter
to
have
to
pick
up
the
tab
.
