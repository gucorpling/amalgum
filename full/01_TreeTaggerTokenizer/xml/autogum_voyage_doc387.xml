One

<p>
Medicine

Early
history
,
the
Margraves
and
the
Huguenots
</head>
<p>
While
Erlangen
can
trace
its
history
back
to
a
first
mention
(
as
&quot;
Villa
Erlangon
&quot;
)
over
a
thousand
years
ago
,
it
was
soon
overshadowed
by
its
neighbor
,
Nuremberg
,
which
is
50-odd
years
younger
.
The
biggest
lasting
influence
upon
Erlangen
was
its
former
rulers
,
the
Margraves
from
the
Ansbach-Bayreuth
branch
line
of
the
Hohenzollern
(
the
leaders
of
Prussia
and
later
all
of
Germany
)
dynasty
.
They
ruled
the
city
for
most
of
the
early
modern
period
,
but
preferred
to
reside
in
<ref target="Bayreuth">
Bayreuth
</ref>
and
<ref target="Ansbach">
Ansbach
</ref>
respectively
most
of
the
time
.
When
the
French
Protestants
were
expelled
by
Louis
XIV
,
the
Margrave
,
much
like
his
distant
relatives
in
<ref target="Brandenburg">
Brandenburg
</ref>
,
decided
to
invite
them
to
come
to
Erlangen
.
The
old
houses
,
the
one-way
streets
of
the
&quot;
Huguenot-town
&quot;
(
which
are
almost
unnavigable
unless
you
ride
a
bike
like
most
locals
do
)
,
and
a
centrally
located
rather
impressive
reformed
church
(
right
next
to
<hi rend="italic">
Hugenottenplatz
</hi>
)
still
bear
witness
to
this
era
.
With
the
Huguenots
a
certain
wealth
entered
town
and
Erlangen
has
been
a
center
for
various
industries
,
trades
and
research
ever
since
.
This
was
aided
when
the
Margraves
decided
to
open
a
new
university
in
Erlangen
,
which
later
got
two
faculties
in
Nuremberg
.
A
common
joke
(
probably
made
up
by
a
student
of
theology
from
Erlangen
)
claims
that
Erlangen
is
the
only
German
place
mentioned
in
the
Bible
with
the
(
real
sounding
but
fake
)
quote
&quot;
Suchet
das
Himmelreich
zu
erlangen
&quot;
.
This
can
be
translated
either
as
&quot;
seek
to
reach
heaven
&quot;
or
&quot;
Search
for
heaven
in
Erlangen
&quot;
.
However
,
no
such
quote
is
to
be
found
in
any
common
German
version
of
the
Bible
.

Industrialization
and
World
War
II
</head>
<p>
When
Erlangen
became
part
of
Bavaria
in
the
first
years
of
the
19th
century
,
all
universities
in
Franconia
were
to
be
shut
down
in
favor
of
the
universities
of
&quot;
Old-Bavaria
&quot;
.
But
someone
pointed
out
that
Erlangen
had
a
unique
selling
point
no
other
university
in
the
new
kingdom
had
:
an
evangelical
theological
faculty
.
As
the
new
king
wanted
protestant
ministers
to
be
educated
somewhere
,
he
decided
to
shut
down
the
university
in
Altdorf
(
near
Nuremberg
)
,
and
retain
the
university
of
Erlangen
.
This
proved
a
good
decision
for
the
city
and
with
the
industrialization
,
Erlangen
became
an
important
center
of
cotton
processing
plants
.
ErBa
(
Erlangen-Bamberg
)
and
Baumwollspinnerei
(
Cotton
factory
)
are
names
from
this
period
and
still
found
in
some
place
names
in
Erlangen
.
While
Erlangen
was
not
unaffected
by
the
Nazis
and
the
<ref target="World%20War%20II%20in%20Europe">
Second
World
War
</ref>
,
it
was
much
less
bombed
than
Nuremberg
or
Munich
and
in
the
waning
days
of
the
war
.
The
mayor
(
who
had
been
member
of
the
Nazi
party
since
1933
)
and
a
high
ranking
general
called
Walter
Lorleberg
somehow
managed
to
surrender
the
town
to
the
American
army
despite
orders
to
the
contrary
.
While
the
details
are
not
known
,
Lorleberg
died
in
the
waning
hours
of
the
war
,
presumably
killed
by
fanatic
Nazis
or
through
suicide
.
A
square
in
Erlangen
is
still
named
after
him
,
which
is
controversial
because
he
was
a
high
ranking
Nazi
general
.
</p>
<head>
Post
war
</head>
<p>
After
the
war
Siemens
decided
to
move
out
of
Berlin
,
which
had
been
almost
entirely
destroyed
.
To
avoid
the
Soviets
,
they
decided
to
build
two
headquarters
in
the
American
Zone
,
one
of
which
would
become
Erlangen
(
the
other
is
in
Munich
)
.
This
decision
continues
to
benefit
the
city
.
Siemens
'
policies
and
decisions
are
followed
almost
as
intensely
as
mayoral
politics
in
Erlangen
.
Erlangen
grew
rapidly
from
just
under
30,000
inhabitants
in
1925
.
Between
people
moving
in
and
the
incorporation
of
suburbs
such
as
Dechsendorf
,
by
1975
the
city
had
reached
100,000
people
.
Thus
attaining
&quot;
Großstadt
&quot;
status
,
which
it
still
holds
at
population
figures
below
110
000
but
above
100
000
.
Erlangen
had
been
the
site
of
a
garrison
of
the
Bavarian
Army
since
the
mid
19th
century
and
became
a
garrison
of
the
German
Army
after
<ref target="World%20War%20I">
World
War
I
</ref>
.
After
the
defeat
of
the
Nazis
in
1945
,
the
garrison
was
taken
over
by
the
US
Army
and
expanded
.
However
,
in
the
course
of
post-cold
war
downsizing
of
the
troop
presence
,
the
garrison
was
closed
in
the
early
1990s
and
has
been
turned
into
direly
needed
housing
as
well
as
nature
reserve
.
It
is
sometimes
cited
as
an
example
of
the
&quot;
peace
dividend
&quot;
that
many
hoped
would
result
after
the
cold
war
as
military
installations
were
turned
over
to
civilian
uses
.
Erlangen
's
mayor
from
1972-1996
,
Dietmar
Hahlweg
,
decided
against
building
more
and
bigger
streets
or
relying
solely
on
public
transport
.
Instead
he
encouraged
cycling
as
a
means
of
getting
around
investing
in
infrastructure
and
riding
a
bike
to
work
himself
to
set
an
example
.
Today
many
residents
(
even
those
working
for
Siemens
and
the
mayor
)
get
to
work
on
their
bikes
every
day
,
and
the
cars
clogging
the
streets
often
have
number-plates
of
the
surrounding
villages
and
suburbs
.
Erlangen
thrives
economically
today
,
but
is
still
dependent
upon
its
university
and
Siemens
.

<p>
The
next
airport
is
in
<ref target="Nuremberg%23By%20plane">
Nuremberg
</ref>
(
NUE
)
with
domestic
and
limited
international
connections
.
The
U-Bahn
(
subway
)
takes
you
to
the
Nuremberg
main
station
in
roughly
12
minutes
,
from
where
you
can
take
a
wide
variety
of
inter-city
(
ICE
and
IC
)
,
regional
(
RE
and
RB
)
and
commuter-trains
(
the
S-Bahn
)
to
Erlangen
.
The
subway
and
regional
trains
are
fully
integrated
within
the
VGN
tariff
union
.
There
is
also
a
direct
bus
(
line
30
)
from
the
airport
to
downtown
Erlangen
every
20
minutes
on
weekdays
(
40
minutes
on
weekends
)
.
This
option
takes
a
bit
under
half
an
hour
.

with
one

Erlangen
can
