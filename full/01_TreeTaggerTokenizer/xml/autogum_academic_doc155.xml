Introduction
</head>
<p>
Power
grid
investment
behavior
(
PGIB
)
is
the
core
business
of
power
grid
enterprises
,
the
basis
of
the
stable
operation
of
power
systems
,
and
also
an
important
guarantee
for
social
and
economic
development
.
The
scientific
supervision
of
PGIB
can
contribute
to
rationalizing
the
transmission
and
distribution
price
system
,
as
well
as
reducing
the
price
of
electricity
consumption
,
thereby
promoting
the
optimal
allocation
of
resources
and
stimulating
the
vitality
of
the
real
economy
.
</p>
<p>
In
March
2015
,
a
new
round
reform
of
power
system
in
China
was
launched
,
which
established
the
reform
plan
of
“
promoting
the
marketization
of
generation
and
sale
side
,
and
strengthening
government
supervision
of
the
power
grid
link
”
.
For
PGIB
,
the
task
of
“
strengthening
the
supervision
of
investment
behavior
,
cost
,
and
investment
operating
efficiency
of
power
grids
”
was
clearly
presented
.
Since
the
implementation
of
the
new
power
reform
,
the
process
of
the
power
market
construction
steadily
advanced
,
and
obvious
marketization
effects
was
achieved
on
the
power
generation
side
and
power
sale
side
.
However
,
the
supervision
of
the
monopoly
link
to
the
power
grid
is
insufficient
.
</p>
<p>
After
the
new
power
reform
,
scholars
chose
different
subjects
and
perspectives
to
study
the
related
issues
of
the
development
of
China
’s
power
industry
.
There
were
many
studies
focused
on
the
marketization
of
the
power
industry
.
Around
the
theme
of
irrationality
in
the
electricity
pricing
mechanism
,
Reference
used
the
fundamental
theory
of
electricity
economics
to
analyze
the
pricing
methods
and
the
forms
of
China
’s
power
market
with
the
reform
of
electric
power
industry
,
and
pointed
out
the
characteristics
and
main
problems
of
China
’s
existing
tiered
electricity
pricing
.
Reference
proposed
an
inter-regional
electricity
transaction
model
to
illustrate
the
new
pricing
mechanism
.
Reference
constructed
transmission
reliability
indices
and
a
unified
cross-regional
transmission
pricing
model
based
on
the
cross-regional
electricity
trading
,
electrical
regime
,
and
price
polices
in
China
.
There
were
also
many
scholars
that
studied
the
theme
of
transaction
mode
and
operation
strategy
of
the
power
retailers
and
generators
in
the
electricity
market
.
Reference
constructed
a
master
–
slave
game
model
considering
bilateral
contract
transactions
between
multiple
generators
and
large
consumers
,
and
gave
the
solution
of
Nash
equilibrium
solution
of
the
game
,
such
that
both
generators
and
consumers
can
benefit
from
participating
in
the
game
.
Reference
considered
China
’s
new
electricity
reform
and
related
policies
as
a
prerequisite
,
carried
out
a
depth
analysis
of
the
power
generation
and
sales
companies
bidding
model
,
and
put
forward
a
game
strategy
of
a
single
sales
company
and
multiple
power
producers
that
considered
network
constraints
based
on
the
principle
of
dark
auction
in
game
theory
.
</p>
<p>
In
addition
to
the
marketization
of
power
industry
,
as
the
main
cost
of
power
grid
enterprises
,
PGIB
has
an
important
impact
on
the
approval
of
transmission
and
distribution
prices
,
which
should
be
strictly
monitored
by
the
government
.
However
,
at
present
,
whether
from
the
perspective
of
government
or
academic
research
,
attention
to
the
supervision
of
PGIB
is
relatively
limited
.
Specifically
,
from
the
perspective
of
government
functions
,
the
supervision
of
the
electric
power
industry
in
China
is
mainly
carried
out
by
the
National
Development
and
Reform
Commission
(
NDRC
)
,
the
State-Owned
Assets
Supervision
and
Administration
Management
Commission
of
the
State
Council
(
SASAC
)
,
the
National
Energy
Administration
(
NEA
)
,
and
other
auxiliary
departments
.
Among
them
,
the
SASAC
is
the
owner
of
the
power
grid
enterprise
assets
;
thus
,
its
supervision
aims
at
maintaining
and
increasing
the
value
of
state-owned
assets
,
and
does
not
involve
industrial
supervision
.
As
a
national
macro-control
department
,
the
NDRC
’s
supervision
of
the
power
industry
is
mainly
based
on
industry
strategic
planning
and
terminal
supervision
such
as
electrovalence
,
but
does
not
focus
on
the
PGIB
.
The
NEA
is
responsible
for
the
formulation
and
implementation
of
industry
specific
policies
,
but
there
is
no
systematic
regulatory
document
for
the
regulation
of
PGIB
.
However
,
the
above-mentioned
regulatory
authorities
are
yet
to
form
a
synergistic
supervision
of
PGIB
.
In
addition
,
China
’s
power
grid
enterprises
have
high
administrative
level
and
monopoly
status
,
which
increase
the
information
asymmetry
between
the
government
and
enterprises
,
bring
many
obstacles
to
the
implementation
of
regulatory
policies
,
and
lead
to
the
high
cost
of
power
grid
enterprises
and
the
difficulty
of
rationalizing
the
pricing
mechanism
of
power
transmission
and
distribution
.
</p>
<p>
From
the
perspective
of
academic
research
,
the
studies
were
mainly
related
to
the
macro
description
and
analysis
of
the
current
situation
and
development
direction
of
supervision
.
Reference
pointed
out
that
the
current
situation
of
China
’s
energy
legislation
could
not
meet
the
requirements
of
coordination
of
economic
,
security
,
and
ecological
objectives
of
power
regulation
.
Reference
argued
that
China
’s
regulatory
capacity
should
be
comprehensively
enhanced
from
three
aspects
:
(
1
)
strengthening
the
incentive
supervision
of
transmission
and
distribution
links
,
(
2
)
vigilance
against
market
forces
,
and
(
3
)
strengthening
the
overall
planning
of
electricity
reform
and
environmental
policies
.
The
abovementioned
researches
did
not
provide
a
feasible
regulatory
approach
for
the
supervision
of
PGIB
.
