He
coined
a
philosophy
for
a
terrorist
.
Like
‘
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trotskyite">
Trotskyite
</ref>
’
--
there
never
really
existed
this
phrase
&quot;
Osama
bin
Ladenist
.
&quot;
Do
you
think
it
elevated
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osama%20bin%20Laden">
bin
Laden
</ref>
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
JR
:
</hi>
Yeah
,
it
was
so
bizarre
.
He
was
selling
<hi rend="italic">
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%20Why%20Orwell%20Matters">
Why
Orwell
Matters
</ref>
</hi>
at
the
time
.
With
that
book
they
were
trying
to
reorient
Orwell
away
from
this
Cold
War
model
.
I
do
n't
know
if
they
can
do
it
,
really
.
They
've
done
so
much
damage
to
his
canon
.
I
do
n't
know
if
they
can
shift
it
out
of
a
sort
of
Cold
War
emphasis
.
Maybe
they
can
.
The
idea
that
Snowball
brings
capitalism
to
the
farm
--
we
see
the
pitfalls
there
--
it
's
anathema
to
a
sort
of
CIA
model
of
the
Cold
War
.
But
they
've
got
to
change
it
,
because
the
Cold
War
is
over
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
But
the
thinking
is
there
.
Right
after
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet%20Union">
Soviet
Union
</ref>
ended
--
you
could
sense
it
,
you
could
feel
it
in
the
air
--
this
&quot;
Who
do
we
set
our
sights
on
?
&quot;
I
think
that
all
of
us
felt
that
way
to
a
degree
,
if
not
just
because
we
were
socialized
to
think
that
way
.
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
JR
:
</hi>
Yeah
.
Yeah
.
I
think
that
's
what
they
were
trying
to
do
,
to
by

...
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
JR
:
</hi>
Yeah
.
I
think
that
there
's
a
little
bit
of
that
.
I
do
n't
know
if
it
's
quite
as
transparent
as
it
was
with
the
Cold
War
,
the
Dark
Empire
model
,
but
it
's
still
there
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
Do
you
think
it
's
a
little
bit
trying
to
fit
a
square
peg
through
a
round
hole
,
like
the
old
paradigm
of
the
Soviet
Union
as
the
evil
empire
,
and
now
the
evil
empire
is
this
very
disparate
range
of
peoples
from
Indonesia
to
Iran
and
trying
to
make
them
into
a
‘
Soviet
Union
?
’
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
JR
:
</hi>
Yeah
,
it
's
a
tough
sell
.
But
they
're
doing
it
,
they
're
all
over
it
over
there
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
It
's
worked
.
It
's
sold
.
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
JR
:
</hi>
Yeah
,
they
're
doing
it
.
I
ca
n't
even
believe
how
much
money
they
've
spent
over
there
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
They
are
going
to
be
spending
a
lot
more
;
it
'll
be
a
trillion
dollar
war
.
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
JR
:
</hi>
Yeah
,
and
that
's
the
other
thing
:
this
whole
idea
that
we
're
in
this
capitalist
country
.
We
're
not
really
in
a
capitalist
country
;
we
're
in
something
else
.
Because
if
it
were
pure
capitalism
,
then
these
decisions
would
be
terrible
decisions
.
That
's
why
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron%20Paul">
Ron
Paul
</ref>
is
so
interesting
.
Because
he
's
up
there
just
with
steam
coming
out
of
his
ears
,
saying
,
&quot;
We
're
spending
too
much
money
!
This
is
crazy
!
&quot;
And
it
is
.
It
's
not
fiscally
responsible
.
We
're
bolstering
these
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil%20companies">
oil
companies
</ref>
,
who
peddle
a
vestigial
energy
source
,
when
we
have
all
kinds
of
other
options
.
We
know
it
's
not
where
we
should
be
.
But
we
're
there
because
that
's
where
the
economy
is
;
that
's
what
these
large
corporations
are
.
But
that
's
not
capitalism
.
That
's
some
kind
of
weird
version
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate%20welfare">
corporate
socialism

--
our
whole
government
is
now
buoying
antiquated
technologies
