there'sStanley

,
and
you
see
in
--
I
've
talked
about
when
you
pull
the
sacredness
out
of
marriage
,
the
marriage
rates
go
down
,
you
've
seen
this
probably
as
pronounced
as
anywhere
in
a
number
of
countries
of
Northern
Europe
,
where
you
're
now
getting
close
to
eighty
percent
out-of-wedlock
birth
rates
on
first
children
in
some
counties
in
Northern
Europe
.
They
've
kind
of
gone
from
&quot;
Well
,
we
do
n't
really
need
to
be
married
;
anybody
,
any
two
people
can
get
married&quot;-you
've
just
,
you
've
taken
the
sacredness
out
of
the
institution
.
This
is
the
work
that
I
'm
citing
though
,
off
of
that
.

But
it
's
looking
at
the
totality
of
--
within
the
last
forty
years
,
it
's
a
different
societal
view
of
marriage
.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
Why
did
you
vote
against
the
Federal
expansion
of
hate
crimes
to
include
sexual
orientation
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
SB
:
</hi>
Well
,
for
a
couple
of
reasons
.
One
,
it
was
in
the
defense
bill
,
which
I
did
n't
think
it
was
appropriate
to
be
in
there
.
Number
two
,
it
's
a
state
issue
.
I
think
it
's
unconstitutional
to
put
this
out
at
the
Federal
level
.
For
the
Federal
government
to
enact
a
crime
,
there
has
to
be
an
interstate
commerce
nexus
to
it
.
Number
three
,
the
states
are
handling
this
well
;
the
two
cases
cited
--
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew%20Shephard">
Shephard
</ref>
case
in
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Wyoming">
Wyoming
</ref>
and
the
case
in
Texas
,
you
've
got
the
death
penalty
in
one
case
and
life
imprisonment
in
the
other
.
You
ca
n't
get
much
harder
on
somebody
there
.
And
the
final
issue
on
this
is
that
there
's
a
substantial
possibility
of
a
chilling
effect
on
free
speech
of
people
of
religion
--
if
there
are
ministers
speaking
from
the
pulpit
on
their
view
of
homosexuality
from
a
spiritual
perspective
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
Ministers
speaking
out
against
homosexuality
would
come
under
the
province
of
a
hate
crime
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
SB
:
</hi>
A
number
of
people
believe
strongly
that
it
will
.
Those
are
a
series
of
reasons
why
.
