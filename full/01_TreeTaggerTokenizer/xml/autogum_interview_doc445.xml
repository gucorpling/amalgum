Sporting
games
are
more
popular
with
younger
gamers
and
sporting
people
with
a
conjunction
from
two
industries
,
between
sporting
and
gaming
.
Although
games
from
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA">
NBA
</ref>
series
are
not
the
official
games
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World%20Cyber%20Games">
World
Cyber
Games
</ref>
,
but
with
fashions
of
the
NBA
,
and
PC
gaming
population
having
a
stable
scale
,
the
NBA
game
series
attracted
not
only
basketball
and
game
fans
but
also
sporting
and
gaming
media
world-wide
,
and
its
market
was
progressively
expanded
from
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/America">
America
</ref>
and
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Europe">

</ref>
to
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Asia">

and

Nice
to
visit
this
gaming
competition
by
NBA
Asia
.
After
I
received
and
read
the
official
press
release
,
I
'm
really
surprised
that
Japan
was
not
selected
as
the
qualifier
stage
of
the
NBA
2K8
Asia
Championship
Tournament
,
but
Singapore
,
Taiwan
,
Hong
Kong
and
Korea
were
.
I
know
that
Japan
is
one
of
the
great
gaming
countries
of
the
world
,
why
did
n't
NBA
Asia
consider
not
to
select
this
country
and
instead
select
Korea
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Ritchie
Lai
</hi>
:
Generally
,
Japan
is
a
notable
gaming
country
,
but
due
to
some
factors
on
market
share
,
sponsorships
,
and
gaming
population
in
Japan
,
we
finally
decided
to
give
up
this
plan
even
though
we
tried
to
enter
the
sport
gaming
market
into
Japan
.

As
of
some
facts
on
the
Gamerscore
Blog
,
famous
in
Europe
and
America
,
several
cyber-gaming
competitions
are
often
held
in
many
divisions
from
Europe
and
America
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Ritchie
</hi>
:
You
got
the
point
.
Because
the
notability
of
NBA
and
the
prosperous
of
the
gaming
population
and
market
in
Europe
and
America
,
some
of
the
game
stores
were
risen
up
with
conjunction
of
the
sporting
industry
.
</p>
<p>

It
's
a
good
idea
with
a
conjunction
between
the
gaming
and
sporting
industries
.
I
remembered
that
a
sports
game
had
to
be
named
as
the
official
game
of
the
World
Cyber
Games
since
2001
,
and
during
some
gaming
expositions
like
G-star
in
South
Korea
and
Tokyo
Game
Show
in
Japan
,
show
organizers
often
held
a
large-scale
cyber-gaming
competition
which
included
PC
games
and
console
games
for
gamers
from
several
countries
world-wide
.
As
of
some
good
examples
,
would
the
NBA
consider
to
cooperate
with
some
show
organizers
about
holding
a
gaming
championship
during
a
game
exposition
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Ritchie
</hi>
:
Lots
of
expositions
have
their
regulations
for
participated
companies
so
that
some
expos
may
not
arrange
the
cyber-gaming
competition
during
the
expo
.
If
we
[
the
NBA
]
also
consider
factors
on
sponsoring
,
market
share
,
background
and
the
nature
of
gaming
companies
,
it
must
be
complexed
.
But
this
marketing
style
is
a
good
idea
for
us
to
improve
notabilities
for
companies
from
sporting
,
exposition
,
and
gaming
industries
.
We
may
consider
to
try
this
style
in
the
future
.

Nice
,
thanks
.
It
's
really
rare
and
special
for
the
public
because
the
NBA
often
held
activity
on
sports
but
sometimes
on
gaming
competitions
especially
in
Taiwan
.
