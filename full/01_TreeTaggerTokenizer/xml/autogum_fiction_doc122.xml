CHAPTER
SIXTEEN
</head>
<p>
The
two
girls
let
themselves
into
the
house
noiselessly
,
and
,
turning
out
the
hall-light
,
left
for
them
by
their
mother
,
crept
upstairs
on
tiptoe
;
and
went
through
the
upper
hall
directly
to
Laura
's
room
--
Cora
's
being
nearer
the
sick-room
.
At
their
age
it
is
proper
that
a
gayety
be
used
three
times
:
in
anticipation
,
and
actually
,
and
in
after-rehearsal
.
The
last
was
of
course
now
in
order
:
they
went
to
Laura
's
room
to
&quot;
talk
it
over
.
&quot;
There
was
no
gas-fixture
in
this
small
chamber
;
but
they
found
Laura
's
oil-lamp
burning
brightly
upon
her
writing-table
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
How
queer
!
&quot;
said
Laura
with
some
surprise
,
as
she
closed
the
door
.
&quot;
Mother
never
leaves
the
lamp
lit
for
me
;
she
's
always
so
afraid
of
lamps
exploding
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Perhaps
Miss
Peirce
came
in
here
to
read
,
and
forgot
to
turn
it
out
,
&quot;
suggested
Cora
,
seating
herself
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
letting
her
silk
wrap
fall
from
her
shoulders
.
&quot;
Oh
,
Laura
,
was
n't
he
gorgeous
.
.
.
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
She
referred
to
the
gallant
defender
of
our
seas
,
it
appeared
,
and
while
Laura
undressed
and
got
into
a
wrapper
,
Cora
recounted
in
detail
the
history
of
the
impetuous
sailor
's
enthrallment
;
--
a
resume
predicted
three
hours
earlier
by
a
gleeful
whisper
hissed
across
the
maritime
shoulder
as
the
sisters
swung
near
each
other
during
a
waltz
:
&quot;
<hi rend="italic">
proposed
</hi>
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
've
always
heard
they
're
horribly
inconstant
,
&quot;
she
said
,
regretfully
.
&quot;
But
,
oh
,
Laura
,
was
n't
he
beautiful
to
look
at
!
Do
you
think
he
's
more
beautiful
than
Val
?
No
--
do
n't
tell
me
if
you
do
.
I
do
n't
want
to
hear
it
!
Val
was
so
provoking
:
he
did
n't
seem
to
mind
it
at
all
.
He
's
nothing
but
a
big
brute
sometimes
:
he
would
n't
even
admit
that
he
minded
,
when
I
asked
him
.
I
was
idiot
enough
to
ask
;
I
could
n't
help
it
;
he
was
so
tantalizing
and
exasperating
--
laughing
at
me
.
I
never
knew
anybody
like
him
;
he
's
so
sure
of
himself
and
he
can
be
so
cold
.
Sometimes
I
wonder
if
he
really
cares
about
anything
,
deep
down
in
his
heart
--
anything
except
himself
.
He
seems
so
selfish
:
there
are
times
when
he
almost
makes
me
hate
him
;
but
just
when
I
get
to
thinking
I
do
,
I
find
I
don't
--
he
's
so
deliciously
strong
,
and
there
's
such
a
<hi rend="italic">
big
</hi>
luxury
in
being
understood
:
I
always
feel
he
<hi rend="italic">
knows
</hi>
me
clear
to
the
bone
,
somehow
!
But
,
oh
,
&quot;
she
sighed
regretfully
,
&quot;
does
n't
a
uniform
become
a
man
?
They
ought
to
all
wear
'
em
.
It
would
look
silly
on
such
a
little
goat
as
that
Wade
Trumble
,
though
:
nothing
could
make
him
look
like
a
whole
man
.
Did
you
see
him
glaring
at
me
?
Beast
!
I
was
going
to
be
so
nice
and
kittenish
and
do
all
my
prettiest
tricks
for
him
,
to
help
Val
with
his
oil
company
.
Val
thinks
Wade
would
come
in
yet
,
if
I'D
only
get
him
in
the
mood
to
have
another
talk
with
Val
about
it
;
but
the
spiteful
little
rat
would
n't
come
near
me
.
I
believe
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
Val
laughed
at
me
and
pretended
not
to
mind
my
getting
proposed
to
.
He
<hi rend="italic">
must
</hi>
have
minded
;
he
could
n't
have
helped
minding
it
,
really
.
That
's
his
way
;
he
's
so
<hi rend="italic">
mean
</hi>
--
he
wo
n't
show
things
.
He
knows
<hi rend="italic">
me
</hi>
.
I
ca
n't
keep
anything
from
him
;
he
reads
<hi rend="italic">
me
</hi>
like
a
signboard
;
and
then
about
himself
he
keeps
me
guessing
,
and
I
ca
n't
tell
when
I
've
guessed
right
.
Ray
Vilas
behaved
disgustingly
,
of
course
;
he
was
horrid
and
awful
.
I
might
have
expected
it
.
I
suppose
Richard
was
wailing
<hi rend="italic">
his
</hi>
tiresome
sorrows
on
your
poor
shoulder
--
--
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
No
,
&quot;
said
Laura
.
&quot;
He
was
very
cheerful
.
He
seemed
glad
you
were
having
a
good
time
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
He
did
n't
look
particularly
cheerful
at
me
.
I
never
saw
so
slow
a
man
:
I
wonder
when
he
's
going
to
find
out
about
that
pendant
.
Val
would
have
seen
it
the
instant
I
put
it
on
.
And
,
oh
,
Laura
!
is
n't
George
Wattling
funny
?
He
's
just
<hi rend="italic">
soft
</hi>
!
He
's
good-looking
though
,
&quot;
she
continued
pensively
,
adding
,
&quot;
I
promised
to
motor
out
to
the
Country
Club
with
him
to-morrow
for
tea
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Oh
,
Cora
,
&quot;
protested
Laura
,
&quot;
no
!
Please
do
n't
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
've
promised
;
so
I
'll
have
to
,
now
.
&quot;
Cora
laughed
.
&quot;
It
'll
do
Mary
Kane
good
.
Oh
,
I
'm
not
going
to
bother
much
with
<hi rend="italic">
him
</hi>
--
he
makes
me
tired
.
I
never
saw
anything
so
complacent
as
that
girl
when
she
came
in
to-night
,
as
if
her
little
Georgie
was
the
greatest
capture
the
world
had
ever
seen
.
.
.
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
She
chattered
on
.
Laura
,
passive
,
listened
with
a
thoughtful
expression
,
somewhat
preoccupied
.
The
talker
yawned
at
last
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
It
must
be
after
three
,
&quot;
she
said
,
listlessly
,
having
gone
over
her
evening
so
often
that
the
colours
were
beginning
to
fade
.
She
yawned
again
.
&quot;
Laura
,
&quot;
she
remarked
absently
,
&quot;
I
do
n't
see
how
you
can
sleep
in
this
bed
;
it
sags
so
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
've
never
noticed
it
,
&quot;
said
her
sister
.
&quot;
It
's
a
very
comfortable
old
bed
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Cora
went
to
her
to
be
unfastened
,
reverting
to
the
lieutenant
during
the
operation
,
and
kissing
the
tire-woman
warmly
at
its
conclusion
.
&quot;
You
're
always
so
sweet
to
me
,
Laura
,
&quot;
she
said
affectionately
.
&quot;
I
do
n't
know
how
you
manage
it
.
You
're
so
good&quot;
--
she
laughed
--
&quot;sometimes
I
wonder
how
you
stand
me
.
If
I
were
you
,
I
'm
positive
I
could
n't
stand
me
at
all
!
&quot;
Another
kiss
and
a
hearty
embrace
,
and
she
picked
up
her
wrap
and
skurried
silently
through
the
hall
to
her
own
room
.
