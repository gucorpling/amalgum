<p>
Electricity
markets
around
the
world
are
rapidly
changing
with
the
massive
entrance
of
intermittent
renewable
energies
.
However
,
most
of
the
current
market
designs
have
serious
shortcomings
in
terms
of
providing
long-term
investment
for
the
development
of
these
energies
.
Within
this
context
,
auctions
have
become
one
of
the
most
efficient
policy
instruments
for
allocating
risks
while
at
the
same
time
encouraging
competitive
prices
.
In
fact
,
the
number
of
countries
using
auctions
for
contracting
renewable
energy
capacity
increased
significantly
over
the
last
few
years
,
to
over
67
in
2017
,
with
a
total
capacity
of
137
GW
.
</p>
<p>
Chile
was
one
of
the
first
few
countries
where
renewable
energies
competed
directly
with
conventional
sources
in
price-based
auctions
.
The
latest
auctions
resulted
in
record-low
prices
and
represented
a
significant
expansion
of
renewable
energies
.
This
paper
analyzed
the
main
country-specific
factors
influencing
the
expansion
of
renewable
technologies
in
Chilean
auctions
from
the
perspective
of
policy
makers
in
the
energy
market
.
For
this
purpose
,
a
hybrid
MCDM
based
on
an
integrated
AHP-TOPSIS
method
was
used
.
A
total
of
two
criteria
and
16
subcriteria
thought
to
have
potential
influence
on
the
outcomes
were
included
in
the
decision
model
.
The
empirical
results
showed
that
the
most
significant
factors
with
an
important
role
in
the
expansion
of
renewable
technologies
were
all
related
to
changes/reforms
in
the
auction
design
.
The
top
three
factors
were
“
supply
time
blocks
”
,
followed
by
“
longer
contract
duration
”
and
“
longer
lead
time
for
project
construction
”
.
“
Technological
advances
”
was
the
highest
weighted
factor
in
the
other
support
mechanisms
category
,
taking
fifth
place
in
the
general
ranking
.
A
sensitivity
analysis
supported
the
robustness
of
these
results
.
</p>
<p>
Analyzing
the
role
of
auctions
as
the
main
driver
in
the
successful
expansion
of
renewables
in
Chile
is
important
given
that
many
countries
now
strive
to
achieve
higher
shares
of
RES
generation
.
There
has
been
an
extensive
international
debate
about
the
role
played
by
energy
auctions
in
the
context
of
various
countries
.
Identifying
and
analyzing
the
relative
importance
of
various
drivers
that
have
enabled
renewable
technologies
to
gain
ground
in
the
Chilean
auctions
provides
important
lessons
and
policy
guidance
to
other
countries
.
</p>
<p>
Future
research
may
extend
the
scope
of
this
model
by
modifying
the
existing
AHP-TOPSIS
framework
to
incorporate
the
fuzzy
set
theory
and
address
uncertainty
in
the
decision
makers
’
judgments
in
cases
of
subjective
and
incomplete
information
.
In
addition
,
the
scope
of
research
can
be
further
enhanced
by
including
expert
opinions
not
only
from
policy
makers
but
also
from
diverse
actors
such
as
consultants
,
technical
experts
,
and
academics
in
the
field
of
energy
and
the
environment
.
