The
Man
Who
Believed
in
Miracles
</head>
<p>
Once
upon
a
time
a
traveler
arrived
in
a
land
quite
like
our
own
,
full
of
modern
technology
like
cars
and
computers
and
whistling
teapots
,
but
with
these
two
differences
:
there
were
no
television
sets
and
no
airplanes
.
In
fact
,
nothing
at
all
had
ever
been
seen
in
the
sky
,
not
even
a
bird
,
and
the
only
movies
the
people
ever
saw
were
in
the
theaters
.
</p>
<p>
The
traveler
stayed
for
about
a
month
on
the
eastern
shore
where
he
had
arrived
,
and
then
decided
to
visit
the
western
cities
.
He
mentioned
his
decision
one
evening
at
a
meeting
of
the
principal
scientists
and
educators
of
the
region
,
who
had
gathered
to
hear
of
his
travels
.
Someone
mentioned
that
the
west
had
much
to
offer
,
but
that
the
journey
between
the
two
areas
was
unpleasant
,
consisting
of
crossing
a
hot
,
empty
desert
.
&quot;
In
that
case
,
&quot;
said
the
traveler
,
&quot;
I
'll
just
fly
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Is
that
like
sleep
?
&quot;
one
of
the
scientists
asked
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
No
,
no
,
&quot;
the
traveler
replied
.
&quot;
You
know
,
fly
through
the
air
,
like
a
bird
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
And
what
is
a
bird
?
&quot;
someone
asked
.
And
so
the
traveler
began
to
explain
about
flight
and
what
an
airplane
was
and
how
it
flew
from
one
place
to
another
.
The
room
became
very
quiet
,
and
the
expressions
on
the
faces
of
everyone
present
darkened
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Does
he
expect
us
to
believe
this
?
&quot;
one
man
whispered
to
another
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Well
,
you
know
what
liars
travelers
are
,
&quot;
someone
else
added
.
Finally
the
host
spoke
up
,
slightly
embarrassed
and
slightly
indignant
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
If
this
is
your
idea
of
a
joke
,
&quot;
he
began
,
but
was
interrupted
by
the
surprised
traveler
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Why
,
it
's
no
joke
at
all
.
People
fly
all
the
time
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
am
sorry
that
you
so
much
underestimate
the
intelligence
and
learning
of
your
audience
,
&quot;
said
a
professor
across
the
table
.
&quot;
That
a
person
could
enter
some
metal
device
--
like
a
car
with
fins
--
and
rise
into
the
air
,
and
be
sustained
there
,
and
move
forward
,
why
that
clearly
violates
everything
we
know
about
the
law
of
gravity
and
the
laws
of
physics
.
If
we
have
learned
anything
from
a
thousand
years
of
study
of
the
natural
world
,
it
is
that
an
object
heavier
than
air
must
return
immediately
to
earth
when
it
is
tossed
into
the
sky
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Hear
,
hear
,
&quot;
two
or
three
people
muttered
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Now
,
if
you
perhaps
mean
that
these
'
airplanes
,
'
as
you
call
them
,
are
somehow
flung
into
the
air
for
a
short
distance
and
then
fall
to
the
ground
,
well
,
then
perhaps
that
would
be
possible
.
&quot;
The
professor
looked
expectantly
and
a
bit
condescendingly
at
the
traveler
,
hoping
that
the
man
would
take
this
face-saving
opportunity
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
No
,
no
.
You
do
n't
understand
,
&quot;
said
the
traveler
.
&quot;
The
airplanes
have
powerful
motors
and
the
craft
rise
into
the
air
,
and
they
stay
up
as
long
as
they
want
,
as
long
as
the
fuel
holds
out
.
&quot;
There
were
several
audible
&quot;
hmmphs
&quot;
around
the
room
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Tell
us
then
,
&quot;
said
another
scholar
,
in
a
saccharine
voice
,
&quot;
how
this
device
works
.
What
makes
it
fly
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Well
,
I
do
n't
know
exactly
how
it
works
.
It
has
something
to
do
with
air
flowing
over
the
wings
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
You
do
n't
know
--
you
cannot
explain
--
how
it
works
,
this
device
that
runs
counter
to
everything
we
know
about
the
natural
world
,
yet
you
believe
in
it
anyway
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Believe
in
it
?
&quot;
asked
the
traveler
,
a
bit
confused
by
this
turn
of
phrase
.
&quot;
Of
course
I
'
believe
in
it
.
'
I
fly
on
one
all
the
time
at
home
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
And
how
do
you
control
its
motions
?
&quot;
a
man
asked
,
without
removing
his
pipe
.
The
audience
was
clearly
beginning
to
patronize
the
traveler
,
and
he
was
growing
a
little
irritated
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Oh
,
I
do
n't
control
it
.
There
's
a
pilot
for
that
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
see
,
&quot;
the
pipe
smoker
said
.
&quot;
So
this
airplane
contains
both
you
and
the
pilot
.
You
're
telling
us
that
perhaps
four
or
five
hundred
pounds
of
dead
weight
can
travel
through
the
air
as
long
as
it
wants
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
As
long
as
the
fuel
holds
out
,
&quot;
added
one
of
the
hmmphers
,
with
amusement
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
And
all
the
time
sneering
at
the
law
of
gravity
and
laughing
science
in
the
face
,
&quot;
someone
else
noted
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Well
,
actually
,
the
planes
are
much
larger
than
that
,
&quot;
said
the
traveler
.
&quot;
Many
of
them
hold
two
or
three
hundred
people
and
weigh
,
my
,
I
do
n't
know
--
many
thousands
of
pounds
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
think
we
have
heard
enough
,
&quot;
the
now-fully-embarrassed
and
half-angered
host
said
.
&quot;
It
was
amusing
for
awhile
,
but
it
's
time
to
put
an
end
to
this
nonsense
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
It
is
not
nonsense
,
&quot;
the
traveler
protested
.
&quot;
It
is
the
truth
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Then
you
really
believe
this
madman
's
drivel
you
've
been
feeding
us
?
&quot;
the
host
asked
,
rather
hotly
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Of
course
.
How
can
I
not
believe
it
?
I
see
it
and
live
it
every
day
.
And
here
,
&quot;
he
added
,
remembering
something
,
&quot;
I
even
have
a
photograph
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Obviously
faked
,
&quot;
said
the
host
,
dismissing
it
after
a
glance
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Who
invited
this
charlatan
?
&quot;
someone
asked
of
no
one
in
particular
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
thought
science
had
put
an
end
to
all
this
miraculous
event
stuff
long
ago
,
&quot;
said
another
man
,
rising
from
his
chair
and
preparing
to
leave
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Well
,
let
's
not
pursue
this
pointless
discussion
,
&quot;
the
host
said
.
&quot;
Our
guest
apparently
knows
nothing
of
science
,
and
is
impervious
to
logic
and
to
the
considered
opinion
of
the
best
minds
of
our
nation
.
There
's
nothing
left
to
do
but
adjourn
.
&quot;
The
meeting
began
to
break
up
,
and
the
traveler
was
putting
on
his
coat
when
the
man
with
the
pipe
made
one
last
attempt
to
reason
with
him
.
