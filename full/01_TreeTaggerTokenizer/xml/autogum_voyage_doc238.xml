The
Pedestrian
Bridge
and

Riverside
Green
Area
</hi>
</p>
<p>
On
November
15
an
extensive
green
area
on
the
east
side
of
the
Tâmega
River
between
the
Engenheiro
Carmona
Bridge
and
the
Public
Gardens
was
opened
to
the
public
.
It
has
a
playground
,
pedestrian
and
cycling
paths
,
and
a
large
grassy
area
.
An
ultra-modern
pedestrian
bridge
will
soon
be
open
linking
the
park
of
the
hot
springs
and
this
new
recreational
area
.
At
the
same
time
a
cycling
and
walking
path
has
been
built
on
both
banks
of
the
river
extending
north
for
several
kilometers

Forte
São
Francisco
</head>
<p>
Strongly
protected
by
the
defence
of
the
border
with
Galicia
,
by
the
Middle
Ages
the
medieval
town
of
Chaves
,
became
unprotected
.
It
had
to
fortify
itself
,
garrison
the
nearby
hilltops
,
in
order
to
keep
them
from
being
occupied
by
enemy
artillery
.
The
first
to
be
considered
was
the
hill
of
Pedisqueira
,
where
there
was
a
Franciscan
convent
.
Decided
during
the
final
phase
of
the
Portuguese
Restoration
War
(
1640-1668
)
,
to
build
a
fort
according
to
the
modern
concepts
of
military
engineering
.
This
fort
played
an
important
role
in
the
Napoleonic
invasion
of
Portugal
in
1807
when
it
was
captured
by
Marshall
Soult
and
then
retaken
when
a
light
garrison
was
left
to
guard
it
.
It
was
also
the
scene
of
several
pro-royalist
revolts
in
the
early
eighteenth
century
and
later
in
1910
.
</p>
<p>
The
fort
is
standing
in
a
reasonable
state
of
preservation
.
The
recent
acquisition
of
the
site
by
a
hotel
group
directed
by
Comendador
António
Ramos
and
the
construction
of
a
four-star
hotel
using
the
old
buildings
has
given
new
life
to
a
ruined
monument
.
</p>
<p>
The
fort
is
based
on
the
Vauban
system
,
with
a
four-pointed
star
,
each
one
serving
as
a
lookout
tower
.
The
walls
are
all
of
granite
,
with
about
one
meter
of
thickness
.
The
height
varies
according
to
the
slope
of
the
terrain
,
but
the
maximum
point
has
20
m.
The
main
entrance
faces
the
south
,
with
a
drawbridge
over
the
moat
that
no
longer
exists
.
There
are
other
gates
,
to
the
east
and
west
.
To
go
inside
we
follow
a
tunnel
that
leads
to
the
center
of
the
fort
.
Inside
,
besides
the
old
church
of
São
Francisco
,
where
for
three
centuries
lay
the
sarcophagus
of
the
first
Duke
of
Bragança
,
there
are
other
buildings
which
have
been
artistically
converted
into
hotel
rooms
.
These
had
served
the
army
as
barracks
for
many
years
,
and
later
were
used
to
lodge
families
that
had
returned
from
the
Portuguese
colonies
when
these
got
their
independence
in
the
1970s
.
A
visit
to
the
fort
is
well
worth
it
,
if
not
to
stay
in
the
hotel
,
but
only
to
walk
around
the
outside
walls
and
contemplate
the
impressive
view
of
Chaves
.
