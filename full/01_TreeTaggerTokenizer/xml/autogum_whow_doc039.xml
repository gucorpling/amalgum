an
artist

Be
honest
with
yourself
.
</hi>
Before
you
write
a
word
,
take
some
time
to
just
think
about
you
and
your
art
.
You
need
to
understand
what
it
is
that
you
are
trying
to
achieve
,
before
you
attempt
to
explain
it
to
anyone
else
.

Avoid
comparing
yourself
to
other
artists
.
It
can
seem
presumptuous
and
you
may
not
come
out
of
the
comparison
favorably
.
Let
the
critic
's
decide
who
you
're
like
.
</item>
<item>
Not
all
artists
can
write
well
.
If
you
're
in
that
category
,
think
seriously
about
hiring
a
professional
writer
or
editor
,
preferably
one
with
an
art
background
,
to
help
you
convey
what
you
want
your
statement
to
convey
in
language
that
ordinary
everyday
people
can
understand
.
