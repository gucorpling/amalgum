It

perhaps
fitting
commentary
on

he
would
commute
the

has
considered

actions
to
be
wrong

&quot;
Chelsea
Manning
exposed
serious
abuses

director
of
the
U.S.
branch
of
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Amnesty_International">

&quot;
and
as
a
result
her
own
human
rights
have
been
violated
.
&quot;
Huang
went
on
to
call
Obama
's
order
for
Manning
's
release
&quot;
long
overdue
.
&quot;
Despite

Manning

Manning
is
among
more
than
1,500
individuals
whom
President

has
granted
clemency
during

whistleblower
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden">
Edward

also
be
pardoned
.
Ernest
said
no
,
saying
the
information
Snowden
released
was
more
dangerous
to
the
U.S.
public
and
pointed
out
that
while
Manning
had
gone
through
a
formal
trial
and
acknowledged
wrongdoing
,
&quot;
Mr.
Snowden
fled
into
the
arms
of
an
adversary
and
has
sought
refuge
in
a
country
that
most
recently
made
a
concerted

undermine

in
