Impulse

Regression
</head>
<p>
Since
the
time
lengths
of
the
AE
impulse
signal
excited
by
the
fuel
stream
are
variable
,
the
proposed
method
must
adapt
to
predict
boundaries
of
different
sizes
.
This
research
introduces
the
DLFBR
impulse
detection
model
,
which
considers
an
impulse
as
an
object
to
be
analyzed
and
recognized
.
This
model
improves
the
1D-CNN
to
adapt
for
hit
detection
in
the
AE
signal
.
The
research
reframes
hit
detection
as
a
straightforward
regression
issue
,
directly
from
the
AE
signal
vector
to
the
boundary
box
coordinates
.
The
proposed
method
takes
an
AE
signal
as
the
input
,
feeds
it
through
a
neural
network
structure
that
looks
similar
to
a
1D-CNN
to
integrate
the
boundary
regression
layer
,
and
receives
a
vector
of
box
coordinates
around
the
impulse
position
in
the
output
.
The
basic
idea
of
the
detection
algorithm
includes
two
steps
:
preprocessing
the
signal
to
extract
the
shape
signal
and
a
flexible
boundary
detector
.

Preprocessing
to
Extract
the
Shape
Signal
</head>
<p>
The
preprocessing
step
works
to
extract
the
global
shape
of
the
impulse
at
the
macro-level
,
corresponding
to
the
length
of
the
sampled
signal
.
Normally
,
the
concept
of
object
detection
is
used
in
an
image
processing
technique
where
the
object
is
smooth
,
continuous
,
and
mostly
homogenous
inside
the
point
area
of
the
object
.
With
this
condition
,
the
convolution
neural
network
considers
the
boundary
of
an
object
to
be
composed
of
an
edge
and
blob
patterns
,
which
have
a
sudden
change
between
their
different
colors
.
However
,
the
AE
signal
collected
from
the
leak
detection
testbed
always
includes
environmental
noise
and
contains
many
small
troughs
and
peaks
.
If
these
troughs
and
peaks
are
smaller
than
the
grid
size
generated
by
the
deep
learning
detector
,
the
object
detection
algorithm
cannot
give
a
satisfying
result
.
To
mitigate
the
undesired
variations
and
unexpected
instantaneous
frequency
values
produced
by
the
remaining
amount
of
small
noise
,
the
preprocessing
step
helps
obtain
the
overall
shape
of
the
signal
with
little
random
noise
.

presents
the
preprocessing
step
of
the
algorithm

</p>

In
the
first
step
,
the
AE
signal
sample
is
segmented
into
non-overlapping
frames
and
rectified
to
obtain
the
positive
part
.
Then
,
in
each
window
,
the
root
means
square
(
RMS
)
is
calculated
to
form
the
lower
rate
RMS
signal
.
Next
,
the
lower
rate
signal
is
expanded
to
its
original
size
by
scaling
the
time
axis
using
cubic
interpolation
and
antialiasing
.
The
cubic
interpolation
method
performs
piecewise
cubic
Hermite
interpolation
based
on
the
values
at
neighboring
grid
points
.
It
seeks
to
match
only
the
first-order
derivatives
at
the
data
points
with
those
in
the
intervals
before
and
after
.
For
a
set
of
data
points
,
,
the
cubic
Hermite
interpolant
at
any
point
,
with
,
takes
the
form
:

where
</p>
<p>
An
instance
based
on
piecewise
cubic
Hermite
interpolation
is
shape-preserving
piecewise
cubic
,
which
preserves
the
shape
of
the
data
since
the
resulting
interpolated
function
has
a
continuous
derivative
.
Shape-preserving
piecewise
cubic
interpolation
has
a
similar
formula
to
that
of
piecewise
cubic
Hermite
interpolation
,
but
it
differs
in
the
component
of
the
first-order
derivatives
.
The
output
vector
value
is
a
weighted
average
of
points
taken
from
at
least
the
nearest
four
neighborhoods
;
this
interpolation
ensures
that
the
value
of
the
interpolant
is
located
within
a
range
of
local
points
.

In
contrast
to
general
CNNs
,
the
proposed
method
employs
a
one-dimensional
time-domain
signal
as
the
input
data
instead
of
two-dimensional
pixels
.
The
one-dimensional
AE
signal
is
fed
into
the
first
convolution
layer
.
To
detect
an
object
,
the
detector
takes
the
feature
for
that
object
and
assesses
it
at
various
locations
and
scales
in
the
sample
signal
.
DLFBR
observes
the
entire
signal
during
the
training
and
testing
process
to
implicitly
encode
contextual
information
about
the
type
of
object
as
well
as
its
position
.
The
component
object
detector
is
only
unified
into
an
end-to-end
single
neural
network
,
which
utilizes
features
from
the
entire
signal
to
estimate
the
position
for
each
boundary
box
.
To
reason
globally
about
the
full
sample
signal
and
all
of
the
objects
inside
the
signal
,
DLFBR
divides
the
input
signal
into
a
grid
with
a
grid
size
.
If
the
center
of
an
object
drops
into
a
cell
in
the
grid
,
that
cell
responds
to
detecting
that
object
.
From
the
generated
grid
,
each
grid
cell
regresses
the
encircled
box
and
the
confidence
score
for
each
box
.
These
confidence
scores
represent
how
confident
the
network
is
that
the
box
contains
an
object
,
as
well
as
how
accurate
the
network
thinks
the
predicted
box
is
.
The
confidence
is
specified
as
