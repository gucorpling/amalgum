WHEREIN
EDITH
CARR
WAGES
A
BATTLE
,
AND
HART
HENDERSON
STANDS
GUARD
</head>
<p>
Many
people
looked
,
a
few
followed
,
when
Edith
Carr
slowly
came
down
the
main
street
of
Mackinac
,
pausing
here
and
there
to
note
the
glow
of
colour
in
one
small
booth
after
another
,
overflowing
with
gay
curios
.
That
street
of
packed
white
sand
,
winding
with
the
curves
of
the
shore
,
outlined
with
brilliant
shops
,
and
thronged
with
laughing
,
bare-headed
people
in
outing
costumes
was
a
picturesque
and
fascinating
sight
.
Thousands
annually
made
long
journeys
and
paid
exorbitant
prices
to
take
part
in
that
pageant
.
</p>
<p>
As
Edith
Carr
passed
,
she
was
the
most
distinguished
figure
of
the
old
street
.
Her
clinging
black
gown
was
sufficiently
elaborate
for
a
dinner
dress
.
On
her
head
was
a
large
,
wide
,
drooping-brimmed
black
hat
,
with
immense
floating
black
plumes
,
while
on
the
brim
,
and
among
the
laces
on
her
breast
glowed
velvety
,
deep
red
roses
.
Some
way
these
made
up
for
the
lack
of
colour
in
her
cheeks
and
lips
,
and
while
her
eyes
seemed
unnaturally
bright
,
to
a
close
observer
they
appeared
weary
.
Despite
the
effort
she
made
to
move
lightly
she
was
very
tired
,
and
dragged
her
heavy
feet
with
an
effort
.
</p>
<p>
She
turned
at
the
little
street
leading
to
the
dock
,
and
went
to
meet
the
big
lake
steamer
ploughing
up
the
Straits
from
Chicago
.
Past
the
landing
place
,
on
to
the
very
end
of
the
pier
she
went
,
then
sat
down
,
leaned
against
a
dock
support
and
closed
her
tired
eyes
.
When
the
steamer
came
very
close
she
languidly
watched
the
people
lining
the
railing
.
Instantly
she
marked
one
lean
anxious
face
turned
toward
hers
,
and
with
a
throb
of
pity
she
lifted
a
hand
and
waved
to
Hart
Henderson
.
He
was
the
first
man
to
leave
the
boat
,
coming
to
her
instantly
.
She
spread
her
trailing
skirts
and
motioned
him
to
sit
beside
her
.
Silently
they
looked
across
the
softly
lapping
water
.
At
last
she
forced
herself
to
speak
to
him
.
</p>
<p>
“
Did
you
have
a
successful
trip
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
accomplished
my
purpose
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
You
did
n't
lose
any
time
getting
back
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
never
do
when
I
am
coming
to
you
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Do
you
want
to
go
to
the
cottage
for
anything
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
No.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Then
let
us
sit
here
and
wait
until
the
Petoskey
steamer
comes
in
.
I
like
to
watch
the
boats
.
Sometimes
I
study
the
faces
,
if
I
am
not
too
tired
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Have
you
seen
any
new
types
to-day
?
”
</p>
<p>
She
shook
her
head
.
“
This
has
not
been
an
easy
day
,
Hart
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
And
it
's
going
to
be
worse
,
”
said
Henderson
bitterly
.
“
There
's
no
use
putting
it
off
.
Edith
,
I
saw
some
one
to-day
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
You
should
have
seen
thousands
,
”
she
said
lightly
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
did
.
But
of
them
all
,
only
one
will
be
of
interest
to
you
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Man
or
woman
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Man
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Where
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Lake
Shore
private
hospital
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
An
accident
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
No.
Nervous
and
physical
breakdown
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Phil
said
he
was
going
back
to
the
Limberlost
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
He
went
.
He
was
there
three
weeks
,
but
the
strain
broke
him
.
He
has
an
old
letter
in
his
hands
that
he
has
handled
until
it
is
ragged
.
He
held
it
up
to
me
and
said
:
'
You
can
see
for
yourself
that
she
says
she
will
be
well
and
happy
,
but
we
ca
n't
know
until
we
see
her
again
,
and
that
may
never
be
.
She
may
have
gone
too
near
that
place
her
father
went
down
,
some
of
that
Limberlost
gang
may
have
found
her
in
the
forest
,
she
may
lie
dead
in
some
city
morgue
this
instant
,
waiting
for
me
to
find
her
body
.
'
”
</p>
<p>
“
Hart
!
For
pity
sake
stop
!
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
ca
n't
,
”
cried
Henderson
desperately
.
“
I
am
forced
to
tell
you
.
They
are
fighting
brain
fever
.
He
did
go
back
to
the
swamp
and
he
prowled
it
night
and
day
.
The
days
down
there
are
hot
now
,
and
the
nights
wet
with
dew
and
cold
.
He
paid
no
attention
and
forgot
his
food
.
A
fever
started
and
his
uncle
brought
him
home
.
They
've
never
had
a
word
from
her
,
or
found
a
trace
of
her
.
Mrs.
Comstock
thought
she
had
gone
to
O'Mores
'
at
Great
Rapids
,
so
when
Phil
broke
down
she
telegraphed
there
.
They
had
been
gone
all
summer
,
so
her
mother
is
as
anxious
as
Phil
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
The
O'Mores
are
here
,
”
said
Edith
.
“
I
have
n't
seen
any
of
them
,
because
I
have
n't
gone
out
much
in
the
few
days
since
we
came
,
but
this
is
their
summer
home
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Edith
,
they
say
at
the
hospital
that
it
will
take
careful
nursing
to
save
Phil
.
He
is
surrounded
by
stacks
of
maps
and
railroad
guides
.
He
is
trying
to
frame
up
a
plan
to
set
the
entire
detective
agency
of
the
country
to
work
.
He
says
he
will
stay
there
just
two
days
longer
.
The
doctors
say
he
will
kill
himself
when
he
goes
.
He
is
a
sick
man
,
Edith
.
His
hands
are
burning
and
shaky
and
his
breath
was
hot
against
my
face
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Why
are
you
telling
me
?
”
It
was
a
cry
of
acute
anguish
.
</p>
<p>
“
He
thinks
you
know
where
she
is
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
do
not
!
I
have
n't
an
idea
!
I
never
dreamed
she
would
go
away
when
she
had
him
in
her
hand
!
I
should
not
have
done
it
!
”
</p>
<p>
“
He
said
it
was
something
you
said
to
her
that
made
her
go
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
That
may
be
,
but
it
does
n't
prove
that
I
know
where
she
went
.
