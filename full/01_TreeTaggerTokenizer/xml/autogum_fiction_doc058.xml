CHAPTER
XII
</head>
<p>
The
Rev.
Mr.
Ware
found
Levi
Gorringe
's
law-office
readily
enough
,
but
its
owner
was
not
in
.
He
probably
would
be
back
again
,
though
,
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
so
,
the
boy
said
,
and
the
minister
at
once
decided
to
wait
.
</p>
<p>
Theron
was
interested
in
finding
that
this
office-boy
was
no
other
than
Harvey
--
the
lad
who
brought
milk
to
the
parsonage
every
morning
.
He
remembered
now
that
he
had
heard
good
things
of
this
urchin
,
as
to
the
hard
work
he
did
to
help
his
mother
,
the
Widow
Semple
,
in
her
struggle
to
keep
a
roof
over
her
head
;
and
also
bad
things
,
in
that
he
did
not
come
regularly
either
to
church
or
Sunday-school
.
The
clergyman
recalled
,
too
,
that
Harvey
had
impressed
him
as
a
character
.
</p>
<p>
“
Well
,
sonny
,
are
you
going
to
be
a
lawyer
?
”
he
asked
,
as
he
seated
himself
by
the
window
,
and
looked
about
him
,
first
at
the
dusty
litter
of
old
papers
,
pamphlets
,
and
tape-bound
documents
in
bundles
which
crowded
the
stuffy
chamber
,
and
then
at
the
boy
himself
.
</p>
<p>
Harvey
was
busy
at
a
big
box
--
a
rough
pine
dry-goods
box
which
bore
the
flaring
label
of
an
express
company
,
and
also
of
a
well-known
seed
firm
in
a
Western
city
,
and
which
the
boy
had
apparently
just
opened
.
He
was
lifting
from
it
,
and
placing
on
the
table
after
he
had
shaken
off
the
sawdust
and
moss
in
which
they
were
packed
,
small
parcels
of
what
looked
in
the
fading
light
to
be
half-dried
plants
.
</p>
<p>
“
Well
,
I
do
n't
know
--
I
rather
guess
not
,
”
he
made
answer
,
as
he
pursued
his
task
.
“
So
far
as
I
can
make
out
,
this
would
n't
be
the
place
to
start
in
at
,
if
I
WAS
going
to
be
a
lawyer
.
A
boy
can
learn
here
first-rate
how
to
load
cartridges
and
clean
a
gun
,
and
braid
trout-flies
on
to
leaders
,
but
I
do
n't
see
much
law
laying
around
loose
.
Anyway
,
”
he
went
on
,
“
I
could
n't
afford
to
read
law
,
and
not
be
getting
any
wages
.
I
have
to
earn
money
,
you
know
.
”
</p>
<p>
Theron
felt
that
he
liked
the
boy
.
“
Yes
,
”
he
said
,
with
a
kindly
tone
;
“
I
've
heard
that
you
are
a
good
,
industrious
youngster
.
I
daresay
Mr.
Gorringe
will
see
to
it
that
you
get
a
chance
to
read
law
,
and
get
wages
too
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Oh
,
I
can
read
all
there
is
here
and
welcome
,
”
the
boy
explained
,
stepping
toward
the
window
to
decipher
the
label
on
a
bundle
of
roots
in
his
hand
,
“
but
that
's
no
good
unless
there
's
regular
practice
coming
into
the
office
all
the
while
.
THAT'S
how
you
learn
to
be
a
lawyer
.
But
Gorringe
do
n't
have
what
I
call
a
practice
at
all
.
He
just
sees
men
in
the
other
room
there
,
with
the
door
shut
,
and
whatever
there
is
to
do
he
does
it
all
himself
.
”
</p>
<p>
The
minister
remembered
a
stray
hint
somewhere
that
Mr.
Gorringe
was
a
money-lender
--
what
was
colloquially
called
a
“
note-shaver
.
”
To
his
rustic
sense
,
there
was
something
not
quite
nice
about
that
occupation
.
It
would
be
indecorous
,
he
felt
,
to
encourage
further
talk
about
it
from
the
boy
.
</p>
<p>
“
What
are
you
doing
there
?
”
he
inquired
,
to
change
the
subject
.
</p>
<p>
“
Sorting
out
some
plants
,
”
replied
Harvey
.
“
I
do
n't
know
what
's
got
into
Gorringe
lately
.
This
is
the
third
big
box
he
's
had
since
I
've
been
here
--
that
is
,
in
six
weeks
--
besides
two
baskets
full
of
rose-bushes
.
I
do
n't
know
what
he
does
with
them
.
He
carries
them
off
himself
somewhere
.
I
've
had
kind
of
half
a
notion
that
he
's
figurin
'
on
getting
married
.
I
ca
n't
think
of
anything
else
that
would
make
a
man
spend
money
like
water
--
just
for
flowers
and
bushes
.
They
do
get
foolish
,
you
know
,
when
they
've
got
marriage
on
the
brain
.
”
</p>
<p>
Theron
found
himself
only
imperfectly
following
the
theories
of
the
young
philosopher
.
It
was
his
fact
that
monopolized
the
minister
's
attention
.
</p>
<p>
“
But
as
I
understand
it
,
”
he
remarked
hesitatingly
,
“
Brother
Gorringe
--
or
rather
Mr.
Gorringe
--
gets
all
the
plants
he
wants
,
everything
he
likes
,
from
a
big
garden
somewhere
outside
.
I
do
n't
know
that
it
is
exactly
his
;
but
I
remember
hearing
something
to
that
effect
.
”
</p>
<p>
The
boy
slapped
the
last
litter
off
his
hands
,
and
,
as
he
came
to
the
window
,
shook
his
head
.
“
These
do
n't
come
from
no
garden
outside
,
”
he
declared
.
“
They
come
from
the
dealers
'
,
and
he
pays
solid
cash
for
'
em
.
The
invoice
for
this
lot
alone
was
thirty-one
dollars
and
sixty
cents
.
There
it
is
on
the
table
.
You
can
see
it
for
yourself
.
”
</p>
<p>
Mr.
Ware
did
not
offer
to
look
.
“
Very
likely
these
are
for
the
garden
I
was
speaking
of
,
”
he
said
.
“
Of
course
you
ca
n't
go
on
taking
plants
out
of
a
garden
indefinitely
without
putting
others
in
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
do
n't
know
anything
about
any
garden
that
he
takes
plants
out
of
,
”
answered
Harvey
,
and
looked
meditatively
for
a
minute
or
two
out
upon
the
street
below
.
Then
he
turned
to
the
minister
.
“
Your
wife
's
doing
a
good
deal
of
gardening
this
spring
,
I
notice
,
”
he
said
casually
.
“
You
'd
hardly
think
it
was
the
same
place
,
she
's
fixed
it
up
so
.
If
she
wants
any
extra
hoeing
done
,
I
can
always
get
off
Saturday
afternoons
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
will
remember
,
”
said
Theron
.
He
also
looked
out
of
the
window
;
and
nothing
more
was
said
until
,
a
few
moments
later
,
Mr.
Gorringe
himself
came
in
.
