Introduction
</head>
<p>
The
quality
of
interpersonal
work
relationships
determines
the
behaviors
that
employees
engage
in
both
at
work
and
in
their
private
lives
.
As
a
rule
,
high
quality
relationships
translate
beneficially
into
,
among
others
:
commitment
,
performance
,
motivation
,
innovation
,
error
detection
,
OHS
,
employee
green
behaviors
(
EGB
)
,
teamwork
,
helping
others
,
internal
and
external
organizational
communication
,
absenteeism
,
conflict
and
resilience
to
negative
events
.
Conversely
,
low
quality
relationships
between
employees
have
a
detrimental
impact
on
these
aspects
of
an
organization
’s
operation
.
</p>
<p>
Therefore
,
counterproductive
work
behaviors
(
CWB
)
must
also
be
influenced
by
the
quality
of
interpersonal
relationships
at
work
.
This
is
because
these
behaviors
are
influenced
by
the
group
and
are
a
behavioral
(
adaptive
)
response
to
certain
workplace
conditions
.
</p>
<p>
This
interrelationship
is
quite
apparent
,
so
,
if
these
relationships
are
of
a
high
quality
,
employees
will
tend
less
towards
CWB
.
By
the
same
reasoning
,
if
relationship
quality
is
low
,
counterproductive
behaviors
will
be
engaged
in
more
often
.
In
practice
,
however
,
there
are
many
paradoxes
,
which
is
to
say
that
negative
relationships
can
have
beneficial
effects
,
while
positive
relationships
can
have
detrimental
effects
(
for
the
organization
and
its
stakeholders
)
.
One
such
example
is
the
case
in
which
high-quality
work
relationships
increase
the
propensity
for
counterproductive
behavior
directed
against
a
person
.
This
can
be
explained
by
the
fact
that
such
relationships
are
characterized
by
more
frequent
interaction
and
higher
trust
,
which
provides
more
opportunities
for
abuse
.
The
research
issue
is
thus
very
complex
and
is
strongly
influenced
by
situational
conditions
and
the
features
of
the
employees
themselves
.
</p>
<p>
Thus
far
,
the
understanding
of
this
relationship
has
tended
to
be
based
on
intuition
,
and
on
research
results
that
are
scant
at
best
,
and
that
have
been
later
cited
by
other
authors
as
empirically
confirmed
paradigms
.
The
empirical
studies
on
this
topic
are
not
comprehensive
and
focus
on
selected
aspects
of
the
impact
of
QIRW
on
CWB
.
For
example
:
Skarlicki
and
Folger
investigated
the
impact
of
relationship
quality
on
employee
retaliation
;
Brass
et
al.
analyzed
the
impact
of
relationship
quality
on
conspiracy
;
and
Roberts
focused
on
the
importance
of
relationship
quality
on
,
among
others
,
work
avoidance
,
the
defensive
behavior
of
personnel
or
the
tendency
to
recognize
one
’s
own
mistakes
and
to
accept
criticism
.
In
turn
,
based
on
a
meta-analysis
of
161
articles
,
Chiaburu
and
Harrison
concluded
that
antagonisms
between
employees
correlate
negatively
with
job
satisfaction
,
commitment
and
performance
,
and
positively
with
absenteeism
,
the
desire
to
leave
work
,
staff
turnover
and
CWB
.
Ragins
and
Verbos
also
indicated
a
positive
relationship
between
low
relationship
quality
(
understood
as
the
exploitation
of
one
party
by
another
)
and
dysfunctional
behaviors
.
</p>
<p>
It
is
significant
that
researchers
are
more
keen
to
examine
the
beneficial
aspects
of
the
quality
of
work
relationships
and
the
significance
of
this
quality
for
organizational
citizenship
behavior
(
OCB
)
,
also
in
the
field
of
sustainability
(
see
,
e.
g.
,
)
.
It
is
therefore
no
surprise
that
Colbert
et
al.
indicate
the
need
to
describe
the
effects
of
negative
relationships
at
work
.
In
turn
,
Bowler
and
Brass
recommend
expanding
our
knowledge
on
how
these
relationships
influence
counterproductive
behavior
.
</p>
<p>
There
is
even
sparser
research
on
how
CWB
’s
relationship
with
QIRW
is
moderated
by
such
key
demographic
features
as
employee
sex
,
age
,
education
,
length
of
service
and
type
of
work
.
In
essence
,
the
research
refers
only
to
the
last
of
these
variables
.
For
example
,
Ikola-Norrbacka
found
that
white
collar
workers
are
less
likely
to
engage
in
CWB
than
blue
collar
workers
.
</p>
<p>
However
,
the
topic
is
very
important
,
because
counterproductive
behavior
has
multiple
detrimental
consequences
and
generates
significant
costs
,
and
not
only
for
the
organization
itself
,
but
also
for
its
surroundings
(
the
natural
environment
,
society
,
etc.
)
.
These
costs
can
be
divided
into
economic
costs
(
quantifiable
)
and
non-economic
costs
(
non-quantifiable
or
difficult-to-quantify
,
e.
g.
,
hospitalization
,
earlier
retirement
benefits
,
lower
professional
activity
,
loss
of
reputation
,
lower
employee
morale
,
increased
environmental
pollution
,
wasting
of
limited
natural
resources
)
.
The
economic
costs
in
the
US
alone
are
estimated
at
USD
6
to
200
billion
per
year
.
Violence
at
work
costs
USD
4.2
billion
,
and
cybercrime
USD
7.1
billion
per
year
.
</p>
<p>
Counterproductive
behaviors
and
their
effects
therefore
conflict
with
the
principle
of
sustainable
development
in
the
sense
of
“
development
that
meets
the
needs
of
the
present
generation
without
compromising
the
ability
of
future
generations
to
meet
theirs
”
(
p.
41
)
.
This
applies
not
only
to
environmental
factors
(
e.
g.
,
increased
pollution
,
increased
waste
material
)
,
but
also
to
economic
(
e.
g.
,
increased
costs
,
increased
consumption
of
raw
materials
)
and
social
factors
(
e.
g.
,
deterioration
of
working
conditions
,
threats
to
employee
psychophysical
health
,
unequal
treatment
,
damage
to
the
sense
of
community
)
.
These
unsustainable
behaviors
are
often
a
consequence
of
inappropriate
interpersonal
relationships
at
work
.
They
can
be
a
form
of
revenge
on
an
organization
or
other
people
in
the
organization
(
e.
g.
,
if
the
manager
does
not
treat
employees
fairly
,
they
may
deliberately
carry
out
their
tasks
incorrectly
or
steal
in
the
workplace
)
.
A
solid
understanding
of
this
is
essential
at
all
stages
of
sustainable
human
resource
management
.
Consequently
,
the
knowledge
of
how
to
limit
CWB
(
including
those
that
impede
sustainability
)
through
traditional
HR
practices
(
e.
g.
,
employee
selection
)
is
limited
.
