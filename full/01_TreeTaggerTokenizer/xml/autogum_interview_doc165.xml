Q
:
</hi>
List
the
three
most
important
issues
in
your
campaign
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
A
:
</hi>
The
residents
of
Wards
1
and
5
have
told
me
that
traffic
congestion
,
public
safety
and
taxes
are
the
most
important
to
them
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Q
:
</hi>
What
one
election
issue
do
you
feel
is
most
relevant
to
your
ward
in
this
election
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
A
:
</hi>
All
of
the
above-mentioned
are
very
important
to
myself
and
the
residents
in
these
wards
.
The
revitalization
of
the
downtown
core
is
also
a
key
issue
that
will
directly
affect
the
residents
of
Wards
1
and
5
.
We
must
carefully
plan
to
simultaneously
improve
downtown
Brampton
while
proactively
controlling
traffic
congestion
,
pollution
,
and
public
safety
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Q
:
</hi>
What
qualities
or
experiences
do
you
possess
,
that
make
you
more
desirable
than
the
incumbent
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
A
:
</hi>
For
me
,
it
's
all
about
people
.
I
have
a
proven
track
record
of
working
for
and
with
people
.
I
have
worked
for
Goodwill
Industries
,
The
Credit
Valley
Hospital
Foundation
,
The
United
Way
and
Big
Brothers
Big
Sisters
of
Peel
.
Working
on
behalf
on
the
less
fortunate
has
instilled
in
me
a
willingness
to
fight
for
what
is
right
.
I
will
be
accessible
and
responsive
.
I
will
approach
this
position
with
integrity
and
with
passion

<hi rend="bold">
Q
:
</hi>
Why
do
you
want
to
represent
your
ward
on
council
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
A
:
</hi>
Representing
the
residents
of
Wards
1
and
5
is
a
natural
progression
in
my
career
.
I
feel
that
my
experiences
working
with
people
can
be
brought
together
to
make
a
stronger
difference
in
this
community
on
a
larger
scale
.
I
moved
to
Ward
1
in
1975
and
have
been
living
in
Ward
5
for
over
13
years
.
I
have
personally
witnessed
the
growth
of
Brampton
and
the
challenges
that
come
with
it
.
I
will
represent
a
City
Council
that
is
based
on
person-to-person
communications
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Q
:
</hi>
How
are
you
currently
involved
in
the
community
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
A
:
</hi>
For
over
two
years
,
I
have
worked
with
a
team
that
has
raised
over
$
1
Million
for
children
,
youth
and
their
families
in
Brampton
.
I
have
initiated
partnerships
with
service
clubs
and
The
City
of
Brampton
for
this
cause
.
This
has
been
my
full
time
occupation
.
I
currently
volunteer
with
The
Brampton
Canadettes
Girls
Hockey
League
and
organize
community
events
to
benefit
various
charities
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Q
:
</hi>
Much
of
Brampton
's
existing
council
is
quite
seasoned
in
the
civic
political
process
.
What
could
you
bring
to
the
table
as
a
&quot;
rookie
&quot;
,
above
and
beyond
the
current
roster
of
councilors
?
