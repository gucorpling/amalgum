Figure

shows
the
framework
for
pedestrians
’
crossing
behavior
at
marked
crosswalks
located
on
a
channelized
right-turn
lane
.
In
many
cases
,
while
approaching
the
marked
crosswalk
,
a
pedestrian
analyzes
the
situation
and
if
they
do
not
see
any
oncoming
vehicle/s
,
they
start
crossing
without
waiting
at
the
sidewalk
.
If
they
see
any
oncoming
vehicle
while
crossing
,
they
accelerate
or
run
to
complete
the
crossing
.
This
can
be
dangerous
if
the
driver
does
not
yield
and
continues
at
the
same
speed
.
However
,
if
a
pedestrian
sees
a
vehicle
or
a
series
of
oncoming
vehicles
,
they
wait
at
the
sidewalk
until
they
can
cross
safely
.
If
the
oncoming
vehicle
gives
the
right
of
way
to
the
pedestrian
by
yielding
,
then
the
pedestrian
starts
crossing
and
completes
the
crossing
maneuver
safely
;
this
is
the
safest
crossing
scenario
.
If
the
oncoming
vehicle
or
series
of
vehicles
do
not
stop
,
then
the
pedestrian
must
wait
for
a
sufficient
gap
in
the
traffic
stream
before
they
can
start
crossing
.
The
longer
the
pedestrian
has
to
wait
,
the
greater
the
chances
that
they
will
take
risks
when
they
cross
.
Drivers
yielding
and
respecting
the
pedestrians
’
right
of
way
are
essential
for
pedestrian
’s
safety
at
these
crosswalks
.
</p>
<p>
Some
special
cases
,
which
impact
pedestrian
safety
,
are
summarized
below
:
</p>
<list>
<item>
Some
pedestrians
step
down
from
the
sidewalk
onto
the
crosswalk
and
wait
for
a
gap
in
the
traffic
stream
.
This
sometimes
compels
drivers
to
yield
;
</item>
<item>
Sometimes
,
the
pedestrian
makes
more
than
one
attempt
for
initiating
crossing
.
This
occurs
when
drivers
do
not
acknowledge
the
pedestrian
’s
right
of
way
;
</item>
<item>
Some
pedestrians
start
crossing
as
soon
as
the
approaching
vehicle
is
seen
and
cross
the
crosswalk
just
after
a
vehicle
has
passed
and
before
the
next
one
arrives
.
This
is
rolling
gap
acceptance
;
</item>
<item>
Some
pedestrians
,
who
arrive
running
,
maintain
the
same
speed
when
on
the
crosswalk
.
This
behavior
can
be
risky
,
as
the
pedestrian
might
not
have
made
accurate
judgments
about
the
speed
or
distance
of
oncoming
vehicles
;
and
</item>
<item>
Some
pedestrians
appear
distracted
when
they
cross
.
Examples
include
talking
with
companions
while
crossing
in
groups
,
using
a
mobile
phone
,
carrying
luggage
,
grooming
,
drinking
or
eating
,
reading
,
looking
at
the
surrounding
instead
of
oncoming
traffic
,
searching
their
bags
,
carrying
a
bicycle
or
umbrella
,
holding
a
child
’s
hand
,
or
pushing
a
stroller
.
</item>
</list>
<p>
From
the
above
observed
special
cases
,
only
the
effect
of
pedestrians
crossing
without
waiting
and
distraction
were
considered
in
the
analysis
and
pedestrians
who
waited
on
the
road
,
rolling
gap
acceptance
,
and
number
of
attempts
were
not
considered
.
