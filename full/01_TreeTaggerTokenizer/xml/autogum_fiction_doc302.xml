<head>
Hilarius
spoke
gently
:
—
</head>
<p>
“
It
is
indeed
a
grievous
sin
against
God
and
His
Church
to
live
together
out
of
holy
wedlock
,
and
perchance
’
tis
true
that
for
this
very
thing
thou
hast
been
afflicted
,
even
as
David
the
great
King
.
But
since
thou
didst
sin
ignorantly
the
Lord
in
His
mercy
sent
me
to
serve
thee
in
thy
sore
need
;
ay
,
and
in
very
truth
,
Our
Lady
herself
showed
me
where
the
coney
lay
snared
.
Let
us
pray
God
by
His
dear
Mother
to
forgive
us
our
sins
and
to
have
mercy
on
these
little
ones
.
”
</p>
<p>
And
kneeling
there
in
the
firelight
he
besought
the
great
Father
for
his
new-found
family
.
</p>
<p>
Five
days
passed
,
and
despite
extreme
care
victuals
were
short
.
Hilarius
dug
up
roots
from
the
hedgerows
,
and
went
hungry
,
but
at
last
the
pinch
came
;
the
woman
was
too
weak
and
ill
to
walk
,
the
babe
scarce
in
life
—
there
could
be
no
thought
of
flight
—
and
the
little
maid
grew
white
,
and
wan
and
silent
.
Then
it
came
to
Hilarius
that
he
would
once
again
beg
food
in
the
village
where
he
had
sought
help
before
.
</p>
<p>
He
went
slowly
,
for
he
had
eaten
little
that
his
maid
might
be
the
better
fed
,
and
he
was
very
sad
.
When
he
reached
the
village
he
found
his
errand
like
to
be
vain
.
News
of
the
Plague
was
coming
from
many
parts
,
and
each
man
feared
for
his
own
skin
.
At
every
house
they
questioned
him
:
“
Art
thou
from
a
hamlet
where
the
Plague
hath
been
?
”
and
when
he
answered
“
Yea
,
”
the
door
was
shut
.
</p>
<p>
Very
soon
men
,
angry
and
afraid
,
came
to
drive
him
from
the
place
.
He
gained
the
village
cross
,
and
prayed
them
for
love
of
the
Saviour
and
His
holy
Rood
to
give
him
bread
for
his
little
maid
and
her
mother
.
Let
them
set
it
in
the
street
,
he
would
take
it
and
cross
no
man
’s
threshold
.
Surely
they
could
not
;
for
shame
,
let
a
little
child
die
of
want
?
</p>
<p>
“
Nay
,
’
tis
better
they
die
,
so
are
we
safe
,
”
cried
a
voice
;
then
they
fell
upon
him
and
beat
him
,
and
drove
him
from
the
village
with
blows
and
curses
.
</p>
<p>
Bruised
and
panting
,
he
ran
from
them
,
and
at
last
the
chase
ceased
;
breathless
and
exhausted
he
flung
himself
under
a
hedge
.
</p>
<p>
A
hawk
swooped
,
struck
near
him
,
and
rose
again
with
its
prey
.
Hilarius
shuddered
;
but
perhaps
the
hawk
had
nestlings
waiting
open-mouthed
for
food
?
His
little
maid
!
His
eyes
filled
with
tears
as
he
thought
of
those
who
awaited
him
.
He
picked
up
a
stone
,
and
watched
if
perchance
a
coney
might
show
itself
.
He
had
never
killed
,
but
were
not
his
nestlings
agape
?
</p>
<p>
Nothing
stirred
,
but
along
the
road
came
a
waggon
of
strange
shape
and
gaily
painted
.
</p>
<p>
He
rose
to
his
feet
,
praying
the
great
Mother
to
send
him
help
in
his
awful
need
.
</p>
<p>
The
waggon
drew
near
;
the
driver
sat
asleep
upon
the
shaft
,
the
horse
took
his
own
pace
.
It
passed
him
before
he
could
pluck
up
heart
to
ask
an
alms
,
and
from
the
back
dangled
a
small
sack
and
a
hen
.
If
he
begged
and
was
refused
his
little
maid
must
die
.
A
minute
later
the
sack
and
the
hen
had
changed
owners
—
but
not
unobserved
;
a
clear
voice
called
a
halt
;
the
waggon
stood
fast
;
two
figures
sprang
out
,
a
girl
and
a
boy
:
and
Hilarius
stood
before
them
on
the
white
highway
—
a
thief
.
</p>
<p>
“
Seize
the
knave
!
”
cried
the
girl
sharply
.
</p>
<p>
Hilarius
stared
at
her
and
she
at
him
.
It
was
his
dancer
,
and
she
knew
him
,
ay
,
despite
the
change
of
dress
and
scene
,
she
knew
him
.
</p>
<p>
“
What
!
The
worthy
novice
turned
worldling
and
thief
!
Nay
,
’
tis
a
rare
jest
.
What
of
thy
fine
sermons
now
,
good
preacher
?
”
</p>
<p>
But
Hilarius
answered
never
a
word
;
overcome
by
shame
,
grief
,
and
hunger
,
sudden
darkness
fell
upon
him
.
</p>
<p>
When
he
came
to
himself
he
was
sitting
propped
against
the
hedge
;
the
waggon
was
drawn
up
by
the
roadside
,
and
the
dancer
and
her
brother
stood
watching
him
.
</p>
<p>
“
Fetch
bread
and
wine
,
”
said
the
girl
,
and
to
Hilarius
who
tried
to
speak
,
“
Peace
,
’
til
thou
hast
eaten
.
”
</p>
<head>
Hilarius
ate
eagerly
,
and
when
he
had
made
an
end
the
dancer
said
:
—
</head>
<p>
“
Now
tell
thy
tale
.
Prithee
,
since
when
didst
thou
leave
thy
Saints
and
thy
nursery
for
such
an
ill
trade
as
this
?
”
</p>
<p>
Hilarius
told
her
all
,
and
when
he
had
finished
he
wept
because
of
his
little
maid
,
and
his
were
not
the
only
tears
.
</p>
<p>
The
dancer
went
to
the
waggon
and
came
back
with
much
food
taken
from
her
store
,
to
which
she
added
the
hen
;
the
sack
held
but
fodder
.
</p>
<p>
“
But
,
Gia
,
”
grumbled
her
brother
,
“
there
will
be
naught
for
us
to-night
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Thou
canst
eat
bread
,
or
else
go
hungry
,
”
she
retorted
,
and
filled
a
small
sack
with
the
victuals
.
</p>
<p>
Hilarius
watched
her
,
hardly
daring
to
hope
.
She
held
it
out
to
him
:
“
Now
up
and
off
to
thy
little
maid
.
”
</p>
<p>
Hilarius
took
the
sack
,
but
only
to
lay
it
down
again
.
Kneeling
,
he
took
both
her
little
brown
hands
,
and
his
tears
fell
fast
as
he
kissed
them
.
</p>
<p>
“
Maid
,
maid
,
canst
forgive
my
theft
,
ay
,
and
my
hard
words
in
the
forest
?
God
help
me
for
a
poor
,
blind
fool
!
”
