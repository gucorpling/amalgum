The
first
search
engine
was
built
by
the
&quot;
Centre
Universitaire
d'Informatique
&quot;
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University%20of%20Geneva">
University
of

</ref>
.
</p>
<p>
I
predicted
that
search
engines
would
not
cope
in
the
long
term
.
Maybe
the
existence
of
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Google">
Google
</ref>
is
only
an
indication
that
there
is
still
only
little
available
on
the
web
.

You
were
at
the
inception
of
the
WWW
together
with
Tim
Berners-Lee
;
what
aspects
are
you
responsible
for
exactly
?
You
've
convinced
CERN
to
release
the
basic
code
library
into
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/public%20domain">
public
domain

?

Robert
Cailliau
</hi>
:
In
1990
I
had
already
left
programming
for
ten
years
and
was
doing
management
.
I
'm
also
8
years
older
than
Tim
,
who
himself
was
no
longer
a
young
programmer
.
It
was
evident
that
I
could
not
compete
with
twenty
year
old
Unix
hackers
and
soon
I
stopped
meddling
with
the
writing
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%20(programming%20language)">
C
code
</ref>
.
Anyway
I
know
only
one
programming
language
worse
than
C
and
that
is
Javascript
.
</p>
<p>
I
did
influence
the
shapes
of
the
web
and
the
directions
of
development
,
but
I
mainly
occupied
myself
with
obtaining
the
resources
necessary
to
keep
the
project
going
.
I
had
a
(
meager
)
budget
and
so
I
got
computers
,
offices
,
and
above
all
people
:
young
programmers
who
can
spend
a
year
working
at
CERN
in
the
framework
of
its
Technical
Student
Programme
.
To
get
all
that
done
I
had
to
plead
often
with
the
management
.
</p>
<p>
I
also
understood
that
CERN
,
as
a
lab
for
physics
,
would
never
devote
a
division
to
the
web
.
Therefore
I
began
to
contact
true
informatics
institutes
such
as
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institut%20national%20de%20recherche%20en%20informatique%20et%20en%20automatique">
INRIA
</ref>
(
<hi rend="italic">
Institut
national
de
recherche
en
informatique
et
en
automatique
,
red
.
</hi>
)
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraunhofer%20Society">
FhG
</ref>
(
<hi rend="italic">
Fraunhofer
Society
,
red
.
</hi>
)
,
as
well
as
contacting
the
European
Commission
.
In
this
I
was
fortunately
supported
by
Mike
Sendall
.
Mike
,
who
was
seen
as
neutral
by
CERN
management
,
has
done
more
than
anyone
else
to
help
the
development
of
the
web
inside
CERN
.
</p>
<p>
On
the
technical
side
it
was
not
always
the
best
of
understanding
between
me
and
the
team
.
For
example
,
I
was
convinced
that
we
needed
to
build-in
a
programming
language
,
but
the
developers
,
Tim
first
,
were
very
much
opposed
.
It
had
to
remain
completely
declarative
.
Maybe
,
but
the
net
result
is
that
the
programming-vacuum
filled
itself
with
the
most
horrible
kluge
in
the
history
of
computing
:
Javascript
.
</p>
<p>
I
also
remember
a
big
resistance
against
PostScript
,
but
what
do
we
see
now
?
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable%20Document%20Format">
PDF
</ref>
everywhere
.
Fortunately
PDF
is
an
open
standard
and
it
's
fairly
elegant
,
but
it
could
have
turned
out
much
worse
.
SVG
did
not
make
it
.
</p>
<hi rend="bold">
Tim
,
who
had
a
longer
experience
with
the
internet
world
,
convinced
me
that
the
web
could
only
survive
if
all
the
code
was
freely
available
for
everyone
,
[
...
]
put
into
the
public
domain
.

The
document
was
signed
on
30
April
1993
that
gave
the
WWW
technology
to
the
world
.
