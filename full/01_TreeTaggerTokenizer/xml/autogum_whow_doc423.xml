Choose
the
Right
Festival
Outfit
</head>
<p>
When
leading
up
to
the
festival
season
,
one
of
the
main
things
on
almost
everybody
's
mind
is
choosing
the
perfect
festival
outfit
.
Festivals
can
hold
up
to
anywhere
between
1
thousand
and
100
thousand
people
,
so
there
is
a
large
feeling
of
pressure
to
look
good
and
have
no
wardrobe
malfunctions
.
However
it
can
be
a
bit
hard
to
find
the
&quot;
perfect
&quot;
outfit
so
we
've
compiled
this
easy
5
step
process
to
help
you
choose
the
right
outfit
for
you
!

PLANNING
.
You
must
plan
ahead
if
you
want
your
outfit
to
stand
out
from
the
crowd
!
This
involves
asking
yourself
a
few
questions
about
the
festival
,
such
as
-
&quot;
Is
there
a
certain
style
associated
with
this
festival
?
&quot;
&quot;
what
is
the
weather
going
to
be
like
?
&quot;
&quot;
What
am
I
most
comfortable
in
?
&quot;
and
so
forth
.
Knowing
the
answers
to
these
type
of
questions
BEFORE
planning
an
outfit
is
extremely
important
,
as
you
do
n't
want
your
mind
and
heart
set
on
an
outfit
,
only
to
realise
that
it
's
going
to
be
far
too
cold
to
wear
it
,
resulting
in
pure
disappointment
.

INSPIRATION
.
Once
you
've
answered
all
those
important
questions
,
it
's
always
extremely
helpful
to
scour
the
internet
,
magazines
and
television
in
search
for
some
inspiration
.
One
great
way
to
find
some
inspiration
is
to
look
on
YouTube
to
see
if
there
is
an
'
after
movie
'
from
the
previous
year
of
that
festival
.
This
can
help
you
to
get
an
idea
of
what
kind
of
outfits
are
acceptable
in
the
environment
and
also
help
you
see
what
kind
of
things
you
personally
would
like
to
wear
.

<item>
SHOPPING
.
When
you
've
finally
found
an
outfit
that
inspires
your
's
,
you
're
ready
to
shop
for
it
.
This
could
mean
heading
out
to
your
local
shopping
centre
,
showing
all
the
festival
wear
sales
assistants
your
inspiring
photos
with
the
hopes
that
they
can
locate
something
for
you
,
or
it
could
mean
digging
through
your
friend
's
wardrobe
hell
bent
on
finding
that
one
shirt
you
remember
from
her
most
recent
profile
pic
.
Whatever
the
case
,
I
discourage
you
from
spending
too
much
money
!
You
will
most
likely
be
surrounded
by
many
,
many
drunk
people(you
included
)
and
your
clothes
have
the
potential
to
be
trashed
.
Once
you
've
succeeded
in
finding
the
clothing
for
your
festival
outfit
,
It
's
time
to
move
to
the
next
step.

<item>
ACCESSORISE
AND
COSMETICISE
.
An
outfit
without
hair
,
makeup
and
accessories
can
look
quite
plain
,
so
once
you
've
sorted
out
the
outfit
you
're
going
to
wear
,
it
's
time
to
spice
it
up
a
little
with
jewellery
,
shoes
,
hair
styles
and
makeup
looks
.
Once
again
the
internet
(
specifically
YouTube
)
is
a
great
place
to
look
for
inspiration
and
tutorials
for
hair
and
makeup
.
Choose
a
hair
style
and
makeup
look
that
can
compliment
your
outfit
,
(
e.
g.
if
your
outfit
has
a
little
bit
of
red
on
it
,
match
it
up
with
some
red
lipstick
to
make
it
stand
out
)
.
Also
taking
into
consideration
the
answers
to
the
questions
from
step
1
(
such
as
weather
,
theming
etc
)
,
as
you
do
n't
want
your
hair
and
makeup
potentially
ruined
by
the
weather
.

<item>
EVALUATION
.
Now
that
you
've
got
your
whole
outfit
together
,
and
you
've
planned
your
makeup
,
hair
and
accessories
,
its
time
to
try
it
all
on
together
and
see
how
it
all
works
together
.
Have
a
walk
around
and
see
if
you
're
comfortable
and
like
the
look
of
it
,
and
if
you
're
unsure
,
seek
a
second
opinion
from
a
friend
,
family
member
or
the
internet
.
If
you
find
something
wrong
with
your
outfit
,
take
a
moment
to
evaluate
what
's
gone
wrong
and
see
what
you
can
do
to
change
it
up
.
Once
you
've
completed
these
5
steps
you
're
all
set
and
ready
to
go
to
the
festival
in
your
perfect
outfit
!

Simply
put
,
cultural
appropriation
is
NOTâ€‹
cool
.
Instead
of
arguing
about
what
is
wrong
,
and
what
is
right
,
and
what
is
considered
as
appropriation
,
it
's
better
to
simply
not
grind
anyone
's
gears
,
and
just
not
do
it
.
What
is
appropriate
?
Anything
that
is
n't
a
modern
day
'
spin
off
'
of
a
traditional
,
cultural
,
or
ethnic
garment
or
clothing
,
even
if
you
think
it
's
just
a
prop
.
These
kinds
of
items
usually
have
great
sacred
and
symbolic
meaning
that
many
are
unaware
of
,
but
to
those
that
are
aware
,
usually
,
wearing
it
is
a
great
insult
.
At
the
end
of
the
day
,
rendition-ing
a
culture
's
sacred
ways
is
just
simply
not
cool
,
it
's
2016
people
.
You
're
going
to
a
festival
,
not
to
some
dodgy
1950
's
movie
set
.
