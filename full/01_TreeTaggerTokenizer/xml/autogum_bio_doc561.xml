His

To
make
an
example

,
he
ordered

Belalcázar
successfully
defended
his
lands
,

took
over
some
of

's
.
He
then
intervened
in
a
disagreement
between
supporters
of
the
families
of
Pizarro
and
Almagro
in
Perú
.
In
1546
,
he
ordered
the
execution

<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Robledo_(conquistador)">
Jorge

who

death

other
offenses
pertaining
to

constant
involvement

victim
of
his
own
ambition

he
died
in

begin

voyage
