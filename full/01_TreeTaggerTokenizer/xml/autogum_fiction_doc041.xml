IN
WHICH
PASSEPARTOUT'S
NOSE
BECOMES
OUTRAGEOUSLY
LONG
</head>
<p>
The
next
morning
poor
,
jaded
,
famished
Passepartout
said
to
himself
that
he
must
get
something
to
eat
at
all
hazards
,
and
the
sooner
he
did
so
the
better
.
He
might
,
indeed
,
sell
his
watch
;
but
he
would
have
starved
first
.
Now
or
never
he
must
use
the
strong
,
if
not
melodious
voice
which
nature
had
bestowed
upon
him
.
He
knew
several
French
and
English
songs
,
and
resolved
to
try
them
upon
the
Japanese
,
who
must
be
lovers
of
music
,
since
they
were
for
ever
pounding
on
their
cymbals
,
tam-tams
,
and
tambourines
,
and
could
not
but
appreciate
European
talent
.
</p>
<p>
It
was
,
perhaps
,
rather
early
in
the
morning
to
get
up
a
concert
,
and
the
audience
prematurely
aroused
from
their
slumbers
,
might
not
possibly
pay
their
entertainer
with
coin
bearing
the
Mikado
's
features
.
Passepartout
therefore
decided
to
wait
several
hours
;
and
,
as
he
was
sauntering
along
,
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
would
seem
rather
too
well
dressed
for
a
wandering
artist
.
The
idea
struck
him
to
change
his
garments
for
clothes
more
in
harmony
with
his
project
;
by
which
he
might
also
get
a
little
money
to
satisfy
the
immediate
cravings
of
hunger
.
The
resolution
taken
,
it
remained
to
carry
it
out
.
</p>
<p>
It
was
only
after
a
long
search
that
Passepartout
discovered
a
native
dealer
in
old
clothes
,
to
whom
he
applied
for
an
exchange
.
The
man
liked
the
European
costume
,
and
ere
long
Passepartout
issued
from
his
shop
accoutred
in
an
old
Japanese
coat
,
and
a
sort
of
one-sided
turban
,
faded
with
long
use
.
A
few
small
pieces
of
silver
,
moreover
,
jingled
in
his
pocket
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Good
!
&quot;
thought
he
.
&quot;
I
will
imagine
I
am
at
the
Carnival
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
His
first
care
,
after
being
thus
&quot;
Japanesed
,
&quot;
was
to
enter
a
tea-house
of
modest
appearance
,
and
,
upon
half
a
bird
and
a
little
rice
,
to
breakfast
like
a
man
for
whom
dinner
was
as
yet
a
problem
to
be
solved
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Now
,
&quot;
thought
he
,
when
he
had
eaten
heartily
,
&quot;
I
must
n't
lose
my
head
.
I
ca
n't
sell
this
costume
again
for
one
still
more
Japanese
.
I
must
consider
how
to
leave
this
country
of
the
Sun
,
of
which
I
shall
not
retain
the
most
delightful
of
memories
,
as
quickly
as
possible
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
It
occurred
to
him
to
visit
the
steamers
which
were
about
to
leave
for
America
.
He
would
offer
himself
as
a
cook
or
servant
,
in
payment
of
his
passage
and
meals
.
Once
at
San
Francisco
,
he
would
find
some
means
of
going
on
.
The
difficulty
was
,
how
to
traverse
the
four
thousand
seven
hundred
miles
of
the
Pacific
which
lay
between
Japan
and
the
New
World
.
</p>
<p>
Passepartout
was
not
the
man
to
let
an
idea
go
begging
,
and
directed
his
steps
towards
the
docks
.
But
,
as
he
approached
them
,
his
project
,
which
at
first
had
seemed
so
simple
,
began
to
grow
more
and
more
formidable
to
his
mind
.
What
need
would
they
have
of
a
cook
or
servant
on
an
American
steamer
,
and
what
confidence
would
they
put
in
him
,
dressed
as
he
was
?
What
references
could
he
give
?
</p>
<p>
As
he
was
reflecting
in
this
wise
,
his
eyes
fell
upon
an
immense
placard
which
a
sort
of
clown
was
carrying
through
the
streets
.
This
placard
,
which
was
in
English
,
read
as
follows
:
</p>
<p>
ACROBATIC
JAPANESE
TROUPE
,
HONOURABLE
WILLIAM
BATULCAR
,
PROPRIETOR
,
LAST
REPRESENTATIONS
,
PRIOR
TO
THEIR
DEPARTURE
TO
THE
UNITED
STATES
,
OF
THE
LONG
NOSES
!
LONG
NOSES
!
UNDER
THE
DIRECT
PATRONAGE
OF
THE
GOD
TINGOU
!
GREAT
ATTRACTION
!
</p>
<p>
&quot;
The
United
States
!
&quot;
said
Passepartout
;
&quot;
that
's
just
what
I
want
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
He
followed
the
clown
,
and
soon
found
himself
once
more
in
the
Japanese
quarter
.
A
quarter
of
an
hour
later
he
stopped
before
a
large
cabin
,
adorned
with
several
clusters
of
streamers
,
the
exterior
walls
of
which
were
designed
to
represent
,
in
violent
colours
and
without
perspective
,
a
company
of
jugglers
.
</p>
<p>
This
was
the
Honourable
William
Batulcar
's
establishment
.
That
gentleman
was
a
sort
of
Barnum
,
the
director
of
a
troupe
of
mountebanks
,
jugglers
,
clowns
,
acrobats
,
equilibrists
,
and
gymnasts
,
who
,
according
to
the
placard
,
was
giving
his
last
performances
before
leaving
the
Empire
of
the
Sun
for
the
States
of
the
Union
.
</p>
<p>
Passepartout
entered
and
asked
for
Mr.
Batulcar
,
who
straightway
appeared
in
person
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
What
do
you
want
?
&quot;
said
he
to
Passepartout
,
whom
he
at
first
took
for
a
native
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Would
you
like
a
servant
,
sir
?
&quot;
asked
Passepartout
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
A
servant
!
&quot;
cried
Mr.
Batulcar
,
caressing
the
thick
grey
beard
which
hung
from
his
chin
.
&quot;
I
already
have
two
who
are
obedient
and
faithful
,
have
never
left
me
,
and
serve
me
for
their
nourishment
and
here
they
are
,
&quot;
added
he
,
holding
out
his
two
robust
arms
,
furrowed
with
veins
as
large
as
the
strings
of
a
bass-viol
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
So
I
can
be
of
no
use
to
you
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
None
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
The
devil
!
I
should
so
like
to
cross
the
Pacific
with
you
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Ah
!
&quot;
said
the
Honourable
Mr.
Batulcar
.
&quot;
You
are
no
more
a
Japanese
than
I
am
a
monkey
!
Who
are
you
dressed
up
in
that
way
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
A
man
dresses
as
he
can
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
That
's
true
.
You
are
a
Frenchman
,
are
n't
you
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Yes
;
a
Parisian
of
Paris
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Then
you
ought
to
know
how
to
make
grimaces
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Why
,
&quot;
replied
Passepartout
,
a
little
vexed
that
his
nationality
should
cause
this
question
,
&quot;
we
Frenchmen
know
how
to
make
grimaces
,
it
is
true
but
not
any
better
than
the
Americans
do
.
