Have
an
idea
what
to
expect
.
Obviously
as
time
goes
by
you
will
as
a
human
feel
the
effects
of
aging
so
that
's
why
you
should
at
all
times
,
be
trying
to
help
your
body
.
As
time
goes
on
especially
at
the
age
of
60
you
lose
10-15
%
of
muscle
mass
.
This
is
why
you
should
try
to
do
some
very
light
exercise
so
as
not
to
strain
yourself
,
maybe
swimming
,
walking
etc.
Also
try
taking
supplements
make
sure
they
go
in
accordance
with
your
diet
and
any
medication
you
may
be
taking
.

Mentally
you
need
to
take
care
of
your
mind
;
reading
newspapers
and
keeping
up
to
date
with
current
affairs
is
a
brilliant
way
to
keep
your
mind
sharp
;
sudoku
is
also
brilliant
as
well
.
A
big
thing
is
not
to
isolate
yourself
because
this
can
really
desolate
your
mind
.
You
must
be
very
sociable
;
it
helps
also
in
later
life
.
You
will
be
incredibly
pleased
that
you
did
this
.
If
you
start
to
need
glasses
to
read
,
do
sudoku
or
crossword
etc
,
wear
them
!
They
do
n't
make
you
look
old
,
they
stop
you
getting
headaches
.

Consider
revising
your
skin
care
routine
.
You
may
find
that
what
you
have
been
doing
for
the
last
ten
years
,
is
not
as
effective
now
.
Try
using
simple
but
effective
creams
,
cleansers
etc.
Or
,
splash
out
and
treat
yourself
to
some
of
the
fancy
deluxe
skin
products
that
are
available
.
Find
something
that
suits
your
skin
and
stick
with
it
.
<figure rend="Turn Sixty Gracefully Step 4 Version 2.jpg">

Find
a
haircut
that
suits
your
face
.
It
is
often
the
case
that
shorter
hair
suits
older
ladies
.
Sometimes
a
bob
or
a
sweeping
chop
takes
years
off
.
At
this
age
you
can
really
pull
off
brilliant
colour
too
,
if
you
want
to
.
Only
go
down
the
blue
rinse
route
if
you
are
sure
it
's
right
for
you
.
Do
n't
do
anything
because
you
think
you
should
.
Do
your
hair
how
you
want
,
not
how
you
think
a
sixty-year-old
's
hair
should
be
.
What
you
had
at
fifty
,
or
even
forty
or
thirty
,
may
still
look
gorgeous
.

Try
not
to
let
your
hair
frizz
.
This
is
an
incredibly
aging
effect
on
anyone
.
Try
using
serum
or
blow
your
hair
daily
.
<figure rend="Turn Sixty Gracefully Step 6 Version 2.jpg">

Try
finding
a
good
foundation
.
At
this
age
you
must
have
one
that
will
give
you
a
glow
;
otherwise
,
your
skin
can
really
lack
luster
.

When
applying
makeup
try
not
to
put
any
mascara
on
your
bottom
lashes
.
This
is
because
at
60
you
will
may
have
darker
circles
and
bags
under
your
eyes
.
Dark
mascara
on
the
bottom
lashes
will
worsen
this
effect
.
If
you
really
want
added
length
on
your
bottom
lashes
,
use
a
small
amount
.
It
is
recommended
that
you
use
brown
mascara
,
or
even
grey
.
It
really
will
soften
your
features
compared
with
black
mascara
.

Try
penciling
your
eyebrows
.
Try
to
make
it
look
natural
if
you
wish
.
At
this
age
they
will
thin
and
fade
.
This
can
leave
you
with
a
haggard
,
gaunt
look
.
Soft
eyebrows
that
complement
your
skin
tone
will
really
help
.

Cleanse
,
tone
and
moisturize
,
as
you
hopefully
have
been
for
the
last
43
years
or
so
.
This
will
do
wonders
for
your
skin
.
Also
,
try
investing
in
a
rich
,
heavy
body
cream
to
keep
your
body
in
tip-top
shape
<figure rend="Turn Sixty Gracefully Step 10 Version 2.jpg">

Dress
well
.
With
your
clothes
,
it
is
recommended
you
wear
classic
pieces
with
modern
twists
.
Also
,
tailor
your
style
to
your
skin
tone
and
hair
.
If
you
have
pale
/
normal
skin
and
blonde
or
white
hair
,
try
channeling
your
inner
Channel
;
wear
classic
tweed
suits
,
etc.
Very
chic
.
This
also
works
for
darker-skinned
ladies
if
you
want
that
Sophia
Loren
look
!

Also
,
if
it
suits
you
,
try
the
exotic
look
-
bright
colours
and
flowing
chiffons
really
are
incredibly
flattering
.
