Do
you

Do

Jada
:
</hi>
Sometimes
,
yeah
.
I
actually
realized
I
am
more
of
a
Dom
than
a
Sub
,
but
the
way
I
started
out
is
that
you
have
to
try
both
aspects
of
it
to
really
get
yourself
inside
the
slave
’s
head
during
the
session
.
It
helps
you
understand
more
what
they
are
going
through
,
what
they
are
feeling
,
whether
it
is
physical
,
emotional
,
psychological
.
You
understand
more
,
and
you
are
able
to
go
through
a
session
perfectly
having
subbed
before
.

There
is
never
sex
involved

No.

But
almost
always
masturbation
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Jada
:
</hi>
Some
,
but
then
you
get
individuals
who
are
just
about
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphilia">
fetish
</ref>
,
it
is
all
they
want
.
They
just
want
the
woman
towering
over
them
and
telling
them
what
to
do
.
People
who
are
tired
of
always
being
in
control

everything

DS
:
Have
you
ever
felt
threatened
during
a
session
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Jada
:
</hi>
I
personally
have
n’t
.
I
’m
not
going
to
say
it
would
n’t
be
an
issue
in
the
industry
because
I
am
not
sure
if
anyone
else
has
experienced
that
.
I
’ve
worked
at
two
other
dungeons
,
the
Den
of
Inequity
when
I
first
started
Domming
.
They
relocated
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los%20Angeles,%20California">
Los
Angeles
</ref>
.
I
also
started
working
at
Pandora
’s
Box
.
I
did
n’t
really
like
it
there
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
Any
particular
reason
why
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Jada
:
</hi>
It
was
just
a
feeling
.
I
decided
to
come
here
,
and
I
’ve
been
here
only
a
few
months
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
Have
you
noticed
a
difference
here
at
Rebecca
’s
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Jada
:
</hi>
Oh
yeah
,
no
dungeon
is
the
same
.
No
matter
what
dungeon
you
go
to
,
from
staff
to
the
way
they
treat
you
to
the
type
of
dungeon
they
are
.
Some
dungeons
go
for
that
German
hostile-looking
place
like
you
see
in
the
horror
movies
,
with
black
walls
and
chains
everywhere
.
Whereas
here
we
tend
to
cater
to
people
just
coming
into
the
fetish
who
are
afraid
of
things
like
that
because
they
get
nervous
if
the
first
thing
they
see
is
Mistress
in
a
hole
in
leather
and
a
whip
.
It
’s
like
,
“
Ahh
!
She
wants
to
hurt
me
and
rip
me
apart
,
”
or
something
like
that
.

If
you
were

give
advice
to
a
woman
who
was
looking

becoming
a
Mistress
,
what
would
you
say
?

<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Jada

</hi>
I
would
say
they
should
be
open-minded
and
that
they
ca
n’t
be
judgmental
in
this
profession
