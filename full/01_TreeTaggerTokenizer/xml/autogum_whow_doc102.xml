Think
about
the
reasons
you
want
to
upgrade
.
Did
you
see
a
game
like
Crysis
,
and
you
were
drooling
over
the
quality
of
the
visuals
?
If
so
,
try
games
known
for
their
storyline
or
multiplayer
gameplay
,
not
their
graphics
.
Some
good
examples
would
be

Thief
:
The
Dark

Thief
2
,
both
are
very
old
3D
games
,
do
n't
expect
good
visuals
,
but
they
too
have
an
amazing
storyline
,
set
in
a
Victorian-Steampunk
world
in
which
you
are
a
thief
.

Age

<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Overclock_a_CPU">
Overclocking
is
another
way
</ref>
,
albeit
risky
,
to
improve
your
computer
's
performance
.
It
involves
forcing
components
(
usually
the
CPU
,
but
video
cards
can
be
overclocked
as
well
)
to
perform
calculations
at
higher
speeds
than
their
factory
defaults
.
This
can
put
your
computer
at
risk
though
,
especially
if
you
mess
around
with
voltages
.

Whatever
you
do
,
do
n't
attempt
to
overclock
a
laptop
CPU
as
your
computer
will
overheat
quickly

If
you
do
end
up
upgrading
,
do
n't
bother
upgrading
components
that
wo
n't
show
a
significant
improvement
in
performance
.
An
example
of
a
component
that
wo
n't
drastically
improve
speed
is
the
motherboard
.
Unless
your
existing
motherboard
is
the
lowest
of
low-end
hardware
,
it
should
have
good
performance
.

hobby

high-performance
computer

<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Become_a_Programmer">
A
good
example
is
computer
programming
</ref>
,
not
only
will
it
provide
huge
job
opportunities
if
you
become
good
at
it
,
it
will
also
provide
a
constructive
use
of
your
time

When
you
make
a
decision
to
buy
a
computer
component
(
i.
e
Video
card
)
,
make
sure
that
it
is
what
you
want
and
will
be
good
enough
to
last
at
least
a
year
.
Sometimes
when
you
find
a
deal
on
a
computer
component
,
you
rush
to
buy
it
and
in
your
excitement
,
you
do
n't
realize
that
maybe
it
does
n't
have
a
DVI
port
,
and
you
were
planning
on
buying
a
new
monitor
this
year
.
Now
,
when
you
go
to
buy
the
monitor
,
and
it
needs
a
DVI
connection
,
you
will
have
to
buy
a
new
video
card
.
