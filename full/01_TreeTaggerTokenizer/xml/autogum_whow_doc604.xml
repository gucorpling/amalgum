Cope
in
the
World
of
Ego
</head>
<p>
Ego
is
Latin
for
'
Self
'
.
Everyone
has
an
ego
,
it
is
how
they
want
to
project
themselves
to
others
,
how
people
expect
others
to
treat
them
,
ego
is
our
expectation
of
our
own
self
.
It
is
n't
even
a
bit
simple
as
it
sounds
and
it
tends
to
get
extremely
annoying
when
people
impose
their
ego
on
us
.

Acknowledge
.
People
impose
their
ego
or
are
&quot;
egoistic
&quot;
due
to
want
of
acknowledgement
and/or
acceptance
from
others
.
They
may
not
seem
like
your
average
attention
seekers
but
they
do
crave
for
it
-
unconsciously
.

Understand
.
Understand
that
ego
is
the
image
that
a
person
associates
with
himself
and
it
is
natural
to
be
present

It
by
understanding
that
everyone
is
different
and
unique
in
their
own
way
that
we
can
cope
in
the
world
of
ego
.

Lose
to
win
.
When
its
the
war
of
egos
,
the
first
one
to
lose
is
actually
the
winner
.
If
a
heated
argument
is
one
,
lose
it
.
As
the
argument
ends
-
you
win
.
Though
know
when
you
can
afford
to
lose
and
when
it
is
required
to
win
.

curve

Always
be
ahead

the
matters

escape
the
trap

ego
conflict

no
longer
in
their
league
,
you
will
never
be
bothered
.

Learn
.
Learning
how
others
exert
their
ego
on
us
,
how
we
exert/impose
our
ego
on
others
,
what
is
the
cause
for
it
,
why
we
do
it
are
some
questions
worth
contemplating
over
.
When
we
tend
to
find
answers
to
these
questions
,
coping
with
ego
will
seem
a
lot
more
easier
.

Trade
fairly
.
All
egoistic
people
tend
to
expect
something
in
return
from
us
,
either
in
form
of
appreciation
or
favour
or
applause
or
flatter
or
respect
or
acknowledgement
.
Knowing
this
demand
and
catering
to
it
in
our
bounds
&amp;
comfort
zone
is
the
right
way
to
tackle
and
cope
with
the
world
of
ego
.

Become
a
pacifist
.
Being
a
pacifist
,
not
being
too
aggressive
or
offensive
in
your
opinions
or
views
or
speech
can
be
quite
helpful
in
coping
with
ego
.
People
tend
to
use
their
ego
as
a
defense
mechanism
to
protect
themselves
or
their
beliefs
from
what
they
find
to
be
threatening
or
offensive
.

to
assert
thy
ego
on
others
-
unnecessarily
