Decide
what
skill
or
area
of
expertise
you
wish
to
market
.
The
private
lesson
business
is
most
certainly
not
limited
to
teaching
just
a
few
subjects
.
There
are
hundreds
of
different
skills
which
may
be
marketed
for
private
lessons
.
Whether
you
know
how
to
perform
martial
arts
,
cook
gourmet
meals
,
embroidery
,
day
trade
,
understand
currency
exchange
,
or
know
yoga
,
someone
else
is
bound
to
want
to
learn
from
you
.
One
teacher
started
her
private
lesson
business
by
offering
lessons
in
the
Japanese
language
,
while
a
musician
used
his
skills
and
talents
to
teach
private
music
lessons
.
Focus
on
some
talent
or
skill
you
enjoy
.
If
you
are
passionate
about
the
subject
you
teach
,
you
will
enjoy
giving
private
lessons
and
your
enthusiasm
will
inspire
your
students
.

the

get
students
into
your
classes

mail
,
promotions
,
online
presence
,
and
word
of
mouth
)
,
and
set
your
marketing
budget
.
Consider
using
flyers
or
offering
free
seminars

groups
where
you
might
encounter
prospective
students

This
can
be
very
helpful
if

Deciding

market
research

that

be
your
guide
through
the
everyday
details
of
your
business
,
and
finally
,
marketing
yourself
to
prospective
students
,
may
seem
like
a
lot
of
work
to
do
before
you
ever
begin
teaching
,
but
once
you
have
mastered
the
basics
,
you
can
relax
and
enjoy
sharing
your
knowledge
and
,
even
better
,
get
paid
for
it
!
