Conclusions

<p>
This
work
investigates
the
physical
mechanisms
controlling
the
performance
of
textile
pressure
sensors
directly
fabricated
onto
different
fabrics
realized
with
natural
and
synthetic
fibers
.
It
presents
a
detailed
study
of
how
the
fabric
type
,
weaving
and
structure
influences
the
pressure
sensors
performance
in
dynamic
operation
mode
.
It
demonstrates
how
the
mechanical
properties
of
the
fabric
substrates
affect
the
textile
pressure
sensor
fabricated
onto
them
.
</p>
<p>
We
studied
the
mechanical
and
sensing
features
of
textile
based
pressure
sensors
directly
fabricated
onto
four
different
types
of
textile
substrates
such
as
polyamide
(
A
and
B
)
,
polyester
(
C
)
and
cotton
(
D
)
,
and
with
different
structures
.
</p>
<p>
The
elastic
properties
of
the
fabric
used
to
realize
the
textile
pressure
sensor
resulted
in
having
a
relevant
impact
on
the
sensor
performance
.
Fabrics
with
good
elastic
properties
and
wide
dynamic
strain
range
during
compression
result
in
a
highly
sensitive
sensor
(
fabric
A
and
B
)
.
</p>
<p>
However
,
also
fabrics
with
poor
elastic
features
can
be
used
to
realize
good
textile
pressure
sensors
that
,
indeed
under
compression
respond
with
a
lower
strain
dynamic
range
and
thus
have
a
limited
sensitivity
,
but
guarantee
a
high
reliability
and
stability
in
dynamic
operation
mode
(
fabric
C
)
.
</p>
<p>
Textile
pressure
sensor
A
,
based
on
a
three-knitted
layer
of
polyamide
,
shows
good
performance
and
high
sensitivity
in
an
high
dynamic
range
(
30
%
)
due
to
its
elastic
behavior
.
Sensors
based
on
fabric
B
show
a
lower
reproducibility
for
each
cycle
due
to
the
intermediate
elastic
properties
of
the
pristine
fabric
.
In
this
case
,
the
macroscopic
geometrical
change
during
compression
and
decompression
affects
the
sensor
performance
in
terms
of
reliability
even
if
it
presents
the
highest
sensitivity
value
.
Sensor
C
,
based
on
polyester
,
is
the
fabric
with
the
worst
elastic
properties
and
it
shows
a
very
good
stability
,
except
for
the
first
compression
cycle
.
After
the
first
compression
,
the
thickness
of
fabric
C
varies
under
stress
with
a
very
low
dynamic
strain
range
(
10
%
)
that
,
however
,
results
in
a
reasonable
electrical
output
signal
.
Its
sensitivity
is
lower
with
respect
to
sensor
A
,
but
it
can
still
be
very
useful
for
real
life
applications
.
Fabric
D
,
the
elastic
cotton
fabric
,
shows
similar
mechanical
properties
along
the
vertical
direction
to
fabric
C
but
sensors
D
and
C
exhibit
a
very
different
behavior
.
In
the
case
of
sensor
D
,
it
may
be
the
microscopic
level
which
affects
the
performance
and
,
as
suggested
from
the
conductance
plots
in
<figure>
Figure
7
</figure>
,
after
each
cycle
delamination
or
cracks
occurring
in
the
coating
may
lead
to
a
deterioration
of
the
PEDOT
:
PSS
on
the
surface
.
We
thus
conclude
that
textile
sensors
,
fabricated
onto
fabrics
with
good
elastic
properties
in
the
vertical
direction
,
indeed
show
a
greater
sensitivity
but
could
be
less
reliable
if
compared
to
similar
sensors
deposited
onto
a
stiffer
fabric
.
</p>
<p>
We
also
assessed
the
effects
of
varying
the
conductive
polymer
formulation
.
Textile
pressure
sensors
realized
onto
four
fabric
substrates
(
A
,
B
,
C
and
D
)
with
a
PEDOT
:
PSS
formulation
containing
ethylene
glycol
show
on
average
a
higher
sensitivity
,
associated
with
a
lower
stability
and
lower
reliability
with
respect
to
comparable
pressure
sensors
fabricated
onto
identical
fabric
substrates
but
with
a
pristine
PEDOT
:
PSS
formulation
.
</p>
<p>
In
summary
,
the
results
we
report
in
this
work
underline
how
to
understand
and
validate
the
performance
of
textile
pressure
sensors
in
a
dynamic
operation
mode
.
The
sensitivity
is
not
the
only
parameter
that
must
be
taken
into
account
and
the
sensor
â€™s
response
after
multiple
,
repetitive
compression
cycles
should
also
be
considered
.
Fully
textile
pressure
sensors
are
complex
systems
and
in
order
to
optimize
them
for
real
life
applications
it
is
important
to
consider
several
aspects
,
from
the
macroscopic
to
the
microscopic
scale
.
Reliability
is
an
important
and
fundamental
issue
that
should
drive
and
guide
the
research
and
development
of
textile
pressure
sensors
towards
actual
needs
.
We
believe
the
results
reported
here
open
the
way
to
a
full
optimization
of
textile
pressure
sensors
in
terms
of
most
suitable
fabrics
,
the
range
of
linear
pressure
responses
,
sensitivity
and
dynamic
operation
behaviors
to
better
fit
the
requirements
of
a
large
variety
of
dedicated
real-life
applications
.
