Enrique
Estay
has
generated
some
controversy
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
[
The
government
is
]
worried
about
the
queers
and
not
about
the
swarm
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concert%20of%20Parties%20for%20Democracy">

bureaucrats
who
obstruct
everything
,
so
that
the
benefits
do
not
reach
to
the
poorest
and
middle
class
,
&quot;
said
Estay
on
his
Facebook
profile
on

.
&quot;
I
will
not
be
quiet
,
until
I
see
changes
!
[
...
]
It
is
frustrating
to
me
.
A
government
that
is
thought
to
be
right-winged
,
yet
it
governs
with
the
left-winged
ideas
and
people

&quot;
Well
done
,
deputy
!
Simply
speak
out
loud
,
well
spoken
,
we
are
only
making
a
country
full
of
queers
and
lesbians
,
that
's
the
only
thing
they

politicians

care
about
,
instead
of
leaving
them
alone
and
dedicate
themselves
to
work
for
the
poorest
,
&quot;
said
one
of
the
comments

Estay
's

&quot;
It
seems
like
these
energumens
do
n't
live
in
Chile
;
it
seems
like
these
persons
,
so
sons-of-bitches
,
do
n't
understand
the
reality
;
it
seems
like
these
fucking
mummies
[
<hi rend="italic">
momio
</hi>
,
pejorative
word
to
call
a
right-winged
person
]
have
their
brains
connected
to
their
asses
,
because
every
thinking
,
every
word
[
they
say
]
is
worth
like
that
,
a
royal
shit
(
with
all
the
due
respect
shit
deserves
)

Estay
's
comment
was
denounced
before
the
Committees
of
Human
Rights
(
of
which
Estay
is
a
member
)
and
Ethics
of
the
Chamber
of
Deputies
by
the
Movement
for
Homosexual
Integration
and
Liberation
(
<hi rend="italic">
Movimiento
de
Integración
y
Liberación
Homosexual
</hi>
,
MOVILH
)
on
Monday
.
In
a
press
release
,
the
MOVILH
said
that
&quot;
Estay
's
statements
clearly
seek
to
denigrate
people
because
of
their
sexual
orientation
and
gender
identity
,
which
implies
a
violation
of
human
rights
,
as
well
as
inciting
social
,
cultural
,
and
political
odiousness
,
which
is
not
at
the
level
of
his
investiture
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Enrique
Estay
responded
to
MOVILH
's
comments
by
saying
that
&quot;
[
f]or
queers
we
are
referring
to
homosexuals
.
The
term
'
gay
'
is
a
new
expression
which
means
'
similar
'
and
is
unrelated
to
homosexuality
.
&quot;
He
also
said
that
when
calling
homosexuals
&quot;
queers
&quot;
(
<hi rend="italic">
maricones
</hi>
)
,
he
&quot;
did
n't
mean
it
to
be
offensive
,
though
I
often
say
things
by
their
name
,
as
they
are
,
and
I
have
always
understood
that
in
Chile
homosexuals
are
the
queers
.
&quot;
He
concluded
,
saying
,
&quot;
It
is
my
Facebook
,
and
that
's
the
way
I
used
it
to
specifically
mention
the
homosexuals
.
