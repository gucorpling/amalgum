This
park
has
perhaps
the
largest
rock
landscape
in
the
world
.
Its
Ambition
Masterpiece
rock
landscape
runs
a
full
300
m
long
and
is
roughly
5
stories
high
.
The
rock
landscape
consists
of
a
variety
of
standing
and
flat
rocks
that
form
three
particular
layers
.
</p>
<head>
History
</head>
<p>
Construction
of
the
Wolmyeongdong
Park
began
in
the
early
1990s
.
It
was
a
barren
land
with
no
water
and
the
current
mountains
were
so
close
to
each
other
that
they
were
almost
touching
.
In
order
to
develop
the
ambitious
masterpiece
,
most
of
the
Front
Mountain
was
cut
and
reshaped
so
that
the
rock
landscape
could
be
developed
.
The
Back
Mountain
was
later
developed
accordingly
.
The
rock
landscape
construction
is
reaching
its
final
stages
with
a
new
courtyard
being
developed
next
to
the
Holy
Son
's
House
of
Love
.
</p>
<p>
In
1995
,
after
Pastor
Jung
Myeong
Seok
discovered
that
there
were
natural
water
springs
under
particular
parts
of
Wolmyeongdong
,
he
led
a
team
to
develop
the
current
lake
and
octagonal
pavilion
,
which
is
in
the
middle
of
the
lake
.
During
spring
or
summer
,
one
can
row
around
the
lake
in
a
boat
.
There
is
even
a
tunnel
that
goes
under
the
octagonal
pavilion
.
During
winter
,
the
water
in
the
lake
freezes
over
,
and
the
park
is
covered
in
snow
.
</p>
<head>
Landscape
</head>
<p>
The
temperate
,
mountain
,
climate
gives
Wolmyeongdong
a
landscape
with
pine
trees
and
other
green
trees
and
flowing
spring
waters
.
Wolmyeongdong
is
surrounded
by
12
mountains/hills
,
and
Wolmyeongdong
itself
is
also
hilly
in
terrain
.
The
middle
of
wolmyeongdong
where
the
sports
field
,
lake
and
lawn
are
situated
is
relatively
flat
.
Numerous
rocks
,
large
and
small
,
were
also
made
into
a
rock
landscape
that
is
more
than
300
m
long
and
5
stories
high
,
perhaps
the
world
's
largest
rock
landscape
.
The
rock
landscape
is
the
most
famous
portion
of
Wolmyeongdong
.
</p>
<head>
Flora
and
fauna
</head>
<p>
There
are
a
multitude
of
different
types
of
flora
and
fauna
in
Wolmyeongdong
.
Many
of
the
different
flowers
are
showcased
during
the
spring
flower
festivals
when
they
are
in
full
bloom
.
</p>
<head>
Climate
</head>
<p>
Since
Wolmyeongdong
is
well
above
sea
level
,
the
temperature
changes
drastically
depending
on
the
season
.
In
the
summer
,
the
temperature
can
reach
up
to
35°C
while
in
the
winter
,
the
temperature
can
drop
to
-15°C
.
There
are
also
summer
monsoons
between
June
and
September
.
The
best
time
to
go
is
during
autumn
when
leaves
turn
red
(
coincides
with
the
annual
Rock
festival
)
or
in
spring
when
the
flowers
are
blooming
(
coincides
with
the
annual
Flower
Festival
)
.
If
you
like
snow
,
Wolmyeongdong
has
a
deep
winter
with
abundant
snowfall
.
</p>
<head>
By
car
</head>
<p>
From
Incheon
Airport
,
you
have
to
drive
down
to
Daejeon
and
then
to
Geumsan
.
If
you
search
for
월명동
수련원
in
Google
Maps
or
Naver
Maps
,
then
you
will
be
able
to
find
a
route
that
leads
directly
there
.
There
is
a
parking
lot
before
the
guard
house
that
is
free
.
Once
you
park
,
you
will
have
to
hike
a
bit
up
past
the
guard
house
before
reaching
the
entrance
where
the
lake
is
,
but
the
path
up
is
great
if
you
go
during
spring
or
autumn
.
Along
the
path
are
various
trees
and
flowers
.
One
path
is
for
pedestrians
and
the
other
path
is
for
cars
that
have
special
permits
.
</p>
<p>
From
Daejeon
to
Wolmyeongdong
,
it
takes
about
an
hour
drive
.
</p>
<head>
By
bus
</head>
<p>
You
can
take
the
express
bus
from
Incheon
Airport
to
the
intercity
bus
terminal
in
Daejeon
.
From
there
,
you
can
take
the
105
intercity
bus
to
Geumsan
but
get
off
at
Majeon
.
From
Majeon
,
there
is
a
regular
shuttle
that
runs
from
the
front
of
a
nearby
church
that
CGM
owns
to
Wolmyeongdong
.
You
will
be
dropped
off
in
front
of
the
guard
house
.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively
,
you
can
also
take
the
public
transit
from
Daejeon
city
to
Jinsan
and
hike
up
to
Wolmyeongdong
through
Apseob
Valley
.
From
Daejeon
,
you
'll
need
to
get
to
the
34
intercity
bus
that
goes
directly
to
Jinsan
.
The
time
it
takes
using
this
route
is
a
little
longer
(
an
hour
and
a
half
to
two
hours
)
than
if
you
went
by
express
bus
or
car
,
but
it
is
much
cheaper
(
₩5000
round
trip
if
you
have
an
public
transit
card
)
.

<head>

,
every
area
can
be
reached
by

through
,
but
for
the
best
experience
,
going
by

is
recommended
.
There
are
hiking
trails
and
walking
trails
of
varying
difficulties
that
lead
to
great
viewpoints
.
Within
the

of
Wolmyeongdong
,
which
extends
