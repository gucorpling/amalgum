PIERRE
GRASSOU
</head>
<p>
Whenever
you
have
gone
to
take
a
serious
look
at
the
exhibition
of
works
of
sculpture
and
painting
,
such
as
it
has
been
since
the
revolution
of
1830
,
have
you
not
been
seized
by
a
sense
of
uneasiness
,
weariness
,
sadness
,
at
the
sight
of
those
long
and
over-crowded
galleries
?
Since
1830
,
the
true
Salon
no
longer
exists
.
The
Louvre
has
again
been
taken
by
assault
,
--
this
time
by
a
populace
of
artists
who
have
maintained
themselves
in
it
.
</p>
<p>
In
other
days
,
when
the
Salon
presented
only
the
choicest
works
of
art
,
it
conferred
the
highest
honor
on
the
creations
there
exhibited
.
Among
the
two
hundred
selected
paintings
,
the
public
could
still
choose
:
a
crown
was
awarded
to
the
masterpiece
by
hands
unseen
.
Eager
,
impassioned
discussions
arose
about
some
picture
.
The
abuse
showered
on
Delacroix
,
on
Ingres
,
contributed
no
less
to
their
fame
than
the
praises
and
fanaticism
of
their
adherents
.
To-day
,
neither
the
crowd
nor
the
criticism
grows
impassioned
about
the
products
of
that
bazaar
.
Forced
to
make
the
selection
for
itself
,
which
in
former
days
the
examining
jury
made
for
it
,
the
attention
of
the
public
is
soon
wearied
and
the
exhibition
closes
.
Before
the
year
1817
the
pictures
admitted
never
went
beyond
the
first
two
columns
of
the
long
gallery
of
the
old
masters
;
but
in
that
year
,
to
the
great
astonishment
of
the
public
,
they
filled
the
whole
space
.
Historical
,
high-art
,
genre
paintings
,
easel
pictures
,
landscapes
,
flowers
,
animals
,
and
water-colors
,
--
these
eight
specialties
could
surely
not
offer
more
than
twenty
pictures
in
one
year
worthy
of
the
eyes
of
the
public
,
which
,
indeed
,
cannot
give
its
attention
to
a
greater
number
of
such
works
.
The
more
the
number
of
artists
increases
,
the
more
careful
and
exacting
the
jury
of
admission
ought
to
be
.
</p>
<p>
The
true
character
of
the
Salon
was
lost
as
soon
as
it
spread
along
the
galleries
.
The
Salon
should
have
remained
within
fixed
limits
of
inflexible
proportions
,
where
each
distinct
specialty
could
show
its
masterpieces
only
.
An
experience
of
ten
years
has
shown
the
excellence
of
the
former
institution
.
Now
,
instead
of
a
tournament
,
we
have
a
mob
;
instead
of
a
noble
exhibition
,
we
have
a
tumultuous
bazaar
;
instead
of
a
choice
selection
we
have
a
chaotic
mass
.
What
is
the
result
?
A
great
artist
is
swamped
.
Decamps
'
&quot;
Turkish
Cafe
,
&quot;
&quot;
Children
at
a
Fountain
,
&quot;
&quot;
Joseph
,
&quot;
and
&quot;
The
Torture
,
&quot;
would
have
redounded
far
more
to
his
credit
if
the
four
pictures
had
been
exhibited
in
the
great
Salon
with
the
hundred
good
pictures
of
that
year
,
than
his
twenty
pictures
could
,
among
three
thousand
others
,
jumbled
together
in
six
galleries
.
</p>
<p>
By
some
strange
contradiction
,
ever
since
the
doors
are
open
to
every
one
there
has
been
much
talk
of
unknown
and
unrecognized
genius
.
When
,
twelve
years
earlier
,
Ingres
'
&quot;
Courtesan
,
&quot;
and
that
of
Sigalon
,
the
&quot;
Medusa
&quot;
of
Gericault
,
the
&quot;
Massacre
of
Scio
&quot;
by
Delacroix
,
the
&quot;
Baptism
of
Henri
IV
.
&quot;
by
Eugene
Deveria
,
admitted
by
celebrated
artists
accused
of
jealousy
,
showed
the
world
,
in
spite
of
the
denials
of
criticism
,
that
young
and
vigorous
palettes
existed
,
no
such
complaint
was
made
.
Now
,
when
the
veriest
dauber
of
canvas
can
send
in
his
work
,
the
whole
talk
is
of
genius
neglected
!
Where
judgment
no
longer
exists
,
there
is
no
longer
anything
judged
.
But
whatever
artists
may
be
doing
now
,
they
will
come
back
in
time
to
the
examination
and
selection
which
presents
their
works
to
the
admiration
of
the
crowd
for
whom
they
work
.
Without
selection
by
the
Academy
there
will
be
no
Salon
,
and
without
the
Salon
art
may
perish
.
</p>
<p>
Ever
since
the
catalogue
has
grown
into
a
book
,
many
names
have
appeared
in
it
which
still
remain
in
their
native
obscurity
,
in
spite
of
the
ten
or
a
dozen
pictures
attached
to
them
.
Among
these
names
perhaps
the
most
unknown
to
fame
is
that
of
an
artist
named
Pierre
Grassou
,
coming
from
Fougeres
,
and
called
simply
&quot;
Fougeres
&quot;
among
his
brother-artists
,
who
,
at
the
present
moment
holds
a
place
,
as
the
saying
is
,
&quot;
in
the
sun
,
&quot;
and
who
suggested
the
rather
bitter
reflections
by
which
this
sketch
of
his
life
is
introduced
,
--
reflections
that
are
applicable
to
many
other
individuals
of
the
tribe
of
artists
.
</p>
<p>
In
1832
,
Fougeres
lived
in
the
rue
de
Navarin
,
on
the
fourth
floor
of
one
of
those
tall
,
narrow
houses
which
resemble
the
obelisk
of
Luxor
,
and
possess
an
alley
,
a
dark
little
stairway
with
dangerous
turnings
,
three
windows
only
on
each
floor
,
and
,
within
the
building
,
a
courtyard
,
or
,
to
speak
more
correctly
,
a
square
pit
or
well
.
Above
the
three
or
four
rooms
occupied
by
Grassou
of
Fougeres
was
his
studio
,
looking
over
to
Montmartre
.
This
studio
was
painted
in
brick-color
,
for
a
background
;
the
floor
was
tinted
brown
and
well
frotted
;
each
chair
was
furnished
with
a
bit
of
carpet
bound
round
the
edges
;
the
sofa
,
simple
enough
,
was
clean
as
that
in
the
bedroom
of
some
worthy
bourgeoise
.
All
these
things
denoted
the
tidy
ways
of
a
small
mind
and
the
thrift
of
a
poor
man
.
A
bureau
was
there
,
in
which
to
put
away
the
studio
implements
,
a
table
for
breakfast
,
a
sideboard
,
a
secretary
;
in
short
,
all
the
articles
necessary
to
a
painter
,
neatly
arranged
and
very
clean
.
The
stove
participated
in
this
Dutch
cleanliness
,
which
was
all
the
more
visible
because
the
pure
and
little
changing
light
from
the
north
flooded
with
its
cold
clear
beams
the
vast
apartment
.
Fougeres
,
being
merely
a
genre
painter
,
does
not
need
the
immense
machinery
and
outfit
which
ruin
historical
painters
;
he
has
never
recognized
within
himself
sufficient
faculty
to
attempt
high-art
,
and
he
therefore
clings
to
easel
painting
.
