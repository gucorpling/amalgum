Security
in
and
around
the

is
very
heavy
,
as
it
was
the
scene
of
a
terrorist
attack
in

that
killed
three
people

Allow
for
3-4
hr
in
your
schedule
in
case
of
long
weekends
and
national
holidays
as
lot
of
tourists
flock
around
then
.
The
most
scenic
way
of
reaching
the
fort
is
to
take
the
Metro
to
Chawri
Bazaar
and
then
a
cycle-rickshaw
through
the
incredibly
packed
bazaar
to
the
Fort
(
price
negotiable
,
aim
for
₹
20
)

The

Be
careful
buying
tickets
at
the
booth
,
as
the
ticket
sellers
will
attempt

shortchange
you
.
Try
to
have
a
small
bill
.
Due
to
enhanced
security
the
parking
can
be
a
bit
tricky
as
the
walk
from
the
now
distanced
away
parking
at
nearby
alternative
slots
is
quite
a
bit
.
The
congested
traffic
makes
crossing
the
road
even
trickier
.
