Polling
stations
opened
at
7.00
a.
m
on
the
18th

queues
outside

the
&quot;

,
with
the

for
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fife">

the
&quot;
No

campaign
attained
an
unassailable
lead
.
With
the
final
declaration

the
Highland

When
the
referendum
was
announced
in
March
of
2013
Australia
's
ABC
reported
that
opinion
polls
showed
only
30
%
of
the
Scottish
population
supported
independence
,
with
50
%
favouring
the
preservation
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acts%20of%20Union%201707">
Union
</ref>
.
On
the
eve
of
the
referendum
this
had
narrowed
to
&quot;
No
&quot;
45
%
,
&quot;
Yes
&quot;
41
%
with
14
%
remaining
undecided
.
With
a
greater
margin
than
recent
polls
had
suggested
the
majority
of
these
undecided
voters
ultimately
voted
&quot;
No
&quot;
to
win
it
for
the
pro-union
camp
.

The

it

On

promised
late
in

We
will
ensure

those
commitments
are
honoured
in
full

that
&quot;
We
have

on
devolution

we
will
do
so
in

David

must

convince
them

especially
some
within
