</p>
<p>
The

where
several
hundred
protesters
gathered
at
different
locations
for
peaceful
protests
.
</p>
<p>
In
a
global
speech
,
the
Internet
protest
movement
said
Scientology
&quot;
betrayed
the
trust
of
its
members
,
[
had
]
taken
their
money
,
their
rights
,
and
at
times
their
very
lives
.
&quot;
The
protesters
welcomed
the
public
interest
their
protests
have
led
to
,
and
claimed
they
witnessed
&quot;
an
unprecedented
flood
of
Scientologists
[
joining
]
us
across
the
world
to
testify
about
these
abuses
.
&quot;
The
group
said
it
would
continue
with
monthly
actions
.
</p>
<p>
In
a
press
statement
from
its
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Europe">
European
</ref>
headquarters
,
Scientology
accused
the
anonymous
protesters
of
&quot;
hate
speech
and
hate
crimes
&quot;
,
alleging
that
security
measures
were
necessary
because
of
death
threats
and
bomb
threats
.
This
also
makes
the
Church
want
to
&quot;
identify
members
&quot;
of
the
group
it
brands
as
&quot;
cyber-terrorists
&quot;
.

<p>
<hi rend="italic">

Anonymous
states
that
the

At

four

In

police
arrested
two

confirm
that

The

The
anonymous
protesters
reacted
by
shouting
that
they
have
no

,
but
they
made
no
attempts
to
free
those
arrested
.
The
police
also
pulled
over
cars

the
protesters

causing
them
to

signs
&quot;
Do

Almost
135
protesters
protested
outside
of
the
Church
of
Scientology
location
in
Austin
,
Texas
.
Protesters
received
a
permit
to
protest
from
11AM
to
4PM
and
stayed
the
full
time
allowed
.
Law
enforcement
officers
were
stationed
outside
the
doors
of
the
Church
.
These
officers
were
very
kind
and
open
to
conversation
with
Anonymous
members
.
Protesters
gathered
across
the
street
from
the
building
as
well
as
directly
in
front
of
it
,
waving
signs
and
chanting
.
A
UHaul
van
was
converted
to
a
Party
Van
which
was
eventually
parked
directly
in
front
of
the
Church
building
for
most
of
the
day
.
Reports
of
Scientologists
calling
the
UHaul
company
office
,
illegally
claiming
to
be
police
officers
,
reached
protesters
soon
after
the
van
was
parked
.
The
protesters
responded
with
a
loud
speaker
saying
&quot;
Impersonating
a
police
officer
is
illegal
,
even
on
the
phone
!
