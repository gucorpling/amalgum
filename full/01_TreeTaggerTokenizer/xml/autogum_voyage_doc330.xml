General
aviation
flying
can
be
more
flexible
than
commercial
airlines
,
provide
an
astounding

,
and
are
often
the
most
practical
way

,
news
and
traffic

all
employ
some
form
of
general
aviation
.
Mining
,
resource
and
offshore
oil
exploration
firms
rely
on
helicopters
and
light
aircraft
to
reach
remote
points
entirely
inaccessible

<ref target="Hunting">

and
<ref target="fishing">

use
small
aircraft
to
go
far
off
the
beaten
path
;
a
few
remote
<ref target="national%20parks">

</ref>
are
unreachable
overland
.
A
few
niche
applications
(
such
as
airlifting
stray
<ref target="Manitoba">
Manitoba
</ref>
polar
bears
out
of
<ref target="Churchill">

village
)
might
not
be
practical
by
any
other
method
.
</p>
<p>
Even
where
alternatives
exist
,
it
can
be
the
quickest
way
between
two
points
that
do
n't
have
a
direct
commercial
airline
service
,
or
fast
rail
connection
.
</p>
<p>
A
light
aircraft
can
actually
use
the
same
or
less
fuel
as
a
normal
passenger
car
over
a
similar
distance
.
And
it
does
n't
require
asphalting
or
causing
erosion
for
the
entire
distance
from
point
A
to
point
B.
You
do
n't
have
to
think
of
a
light
aircraft
as
poor
environmental
choice
.
An
off-the-grid
location
may
incur
far
less
environmental
impact
from
the
occasional
bush
plane
than
from
construction
of
a
permanent
road
or
rail
connection
through
hundreds
of
miles
of
virgin
wilderness
.
Of
course
,
that
is
foremost
about
true
light
aircraft
.
If
you
're
a
CEO
or
a
rock
band
looking
at
hiring
your
own
Learjet
or
flying
your
own
747
then
you
have
to
do
the
calculation
yourself
–
all
bets
are
off
.
</p>
<p>
Light
aircraft
and
helicopters
do
n't
have
a
safety
record
that
's
up
there
with
jet
aircraft
,
but
you
can
expect
safety
more
or
less
on
par
with
road
travel
over
the
same
distance
.
It
still
pays
to
check
the
record
and
practices
of
who
you
're
flying
with
.
Statistically
–
as
with
traffic
accidents
–
safety
incidents
are
usually
caused
by
the
pilot
rather
than
the
aircraft
.
If
you
're
flying
with
a
private
(
non-commercial
)
pilot
,
you
want
to
be
comfortable
that
they
have
the
experience
and
attitude
that
you
're
comfortable
with
.

Types

<p>
Common
applications
for
general
aviation
in
travel
include
:
</p>
<list type="unordered">
<item>
<hi rend="bold">
Sightseeing
flights
</hi>
.
Commercial
organisations
operating
flights
to
give
visitors
a
great
view
from
above
.
These
can
be
operated
by
either
be
fixed
wing
or
Helicopters
.
Normally
priced
per
person
,
but
may
need
minimum
volumes
.
</item>
<item>
<hi rend="bold">
Charter
flights
</hi>
.
Commercial
point
to
point
operations
.
You
decide
the
route
and
time
,
and
these
operators
will
fly
you
there
(
usually
for
a
fixed
price
per
aircraft
)
.
At
the
low
end
,
you
can
charter
a
two
seater
light
aircraft
and
sit
next
to
the
pilot
,
or
at
the
high
end
you
can
charter
a
jet
that
's
out
of
the
reach
of
most
everyday
travellers
.
Charter
aircraft
are
also
used
by
travel
agencies
for
resort
flights
.
</item>
<item>
<hi rend="bold">
Private
aircraft
</hi>
are
small
planes
owned
and
operated
by
individuals
.
You
can
rent
aircraft
from
most
mid-size
regional
airports
,
or
you
can
own
your
own
for
touring
.
Or
you
can
tag-along
with
a
private
pilot
.
</item>
</list>
<p>
In
addition
to
these
,
you
may
find
yourself
on
a
general
aviation
aircraft
if
your
trip
involves
skydiving
or
other
<ref target="air%20sport">
aerial
sports
</ref>
,
like
aerobatics
.
Or
,
if
you
're
flying
to
a
remote
location
not
serviced
by
regular
passenger
transit
.
Like
a
<hi rend="bold">

Air
charter
</head>
<p>
Air
charter
companies
fly
where
you
want
them
and
the
time
you
want
them
to
.
Usually
there
is
no
need
to
wait
in
line
to
board
or
go
through
security
queues
,
unless
seats
on
the
chartered
flight
are
being
offered
for
public
resale
.
</p>
<p>
If
you
're
paying
the
bills
,
you
get
to
choose
the
aircraft
that
meets
your
requirements
.
As
a
general
rule
,
the
smaller
and
cheaper
the
aircraft
you
are
chartering
,
the
more
likely
it
will
be
subject
to
delays
due
to
weather
.
</p>
<p>
Charter
flights
appeal
to
various
groups
:
</p>
<list type="unordered">
<item>
A
<hi rend="bold">
single-entity
charter
</hi>
is
a
private
charter
where
one
individual
or
company
charters
a
plane
and
bears
the
entire
cost
of
the
flight
.
Most
often
,
these
will
be
booked
by
corporations
looking
to
transport
a
group
of
their
own
workers
or
directors
for
business
purposes
.
</item>
<item>
An
<hi rend="bold">
affinity
charter
</hi>
is
a
private
charter
where
all
passengers
are
affiliated
with
a
specific
business
,
group
or
organization
,
but
each
pays
their
own
air
fare
.
These
flights
may
appeal
to
seniors
'
organisations
or
groups
of
<ref target="sport">
sport
</ref>
or
<ref target="music">
music
</ref>
fans
looking
to
travel
to
a
specific
event
.
As
with
other
private
charters
,
none
of
the
seats
can
be
sold
to
members
of
public
.
</item>
<item>
In
a
<hi rend="bold">
public
charter
</hi>
,
a
tour
operator
rents
an
aircraft
and
sells
seats
to
the
public
,
directly
or
through
<ref target="travel%20agencies">
travel
agencies
</ref>
.
These
often
operate
seasonally
(
often
to
<ref target="resorts">
resorts
</ref>
)
,
in
competition
with
other
<ref target="discount%20airlines">
discount
airlines
</ref>
,
or
as
part
of
<ref target="package%20tours">
package
tours
</ref>
.
Often
these
are
no-frills
transport
to
keep
costs
low
;
they
are
strictly
regulated
(
in
the
USA
,
by
the
federal
Department
of
Transportation
)
and
subject
to
many
of
the
same
requirements
as
regular
scheduled
airline
flights
-
including
airport
security
measures
on
boarding
the
flight
and
legal
responsibilities
for
the
protection
of
the
clients
'
money
if
the
charter
operator
goes
broke
.
</item>
</list>
<p>
As
with
other
general
aviation
flights
,
departures
are
often
from
secondary
&quot;
reliever
airports
&quot;
or
&quot;
executive
airports
&quot;
as
the
main
airport
for
a
large
city
is
often
filled
to
capacity
with
scheduled
airline
flights
.
The
firms
which
supply
the
pilots
and
aircraft
vary
in
size
from
small
general
aviation
firms
with
one
or
two
small
planes
to
the
same
major
lines
which
provide
the
mainline
scheduled
commercial
airline
service
.
Prices
vary
widely
and
travel
arrangements
may
need
to
be
made
well
in
advance
.
</p>
<p>
Occasionally
,
a
group
can
get
a
better
price
if
they
are
fortunate
enough
to
spot
an
available
<hi rend="bold">
empty
leg
charter
flight
</hi>
where
someone
else
has
chartered
an
aircraft
one-way
from
another
city
well
in
advance
;
space
on
the
(
otherwise
unused
)
return
,
deadhead
or
repositioning
flight
(
which
returns
the
plane
to
its
home
base
)
may
be
had
at
a
discount
as
the
aircraft
would
otherwise
fly
empty
.
Finding
empty
legs
usually
takes
a
bit
of
planning
and
leaves
less
flexibility
in
choice
of
departure
times
,
but
a
web
search
for
&quot;
empty
leg
charter
&quot;
will
usually
find
multiple
operators
which
list
available
city
pairs
and
departure
times
online
.
</p>
<p>
National
aviation
regulators
enforce
high
standards
for
maintenance
for
charter
flights
.
Pilot
qualifications
can
vary
dramatically
between
countries
and
areas
,
and
your
charter
pilot
may
be
a
freshly
minted
pilot
looking
for
a
career
in
flying
,
or
a
experienced
pilot
happy
to
fly
the
local
area
.
