It
was
transcribed
into
modern
notation
and
arranged
for
the
six-string
guitar
by
Oscar
Chilesotti
in
1881
.
The
work
consists
of
nine
complete
suites
,
each
comprising
a
preludio
and
alemanda
followed
by
some
of
the
other
seventeenth-century
dance
forms
such
as
corrente

sarabanda

gigue

minuet

The

Roncalli

is
a

movements

did

probably
used
