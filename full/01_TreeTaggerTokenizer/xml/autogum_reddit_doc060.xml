After
roughly
27
hours
of
polling
,
I
’ve
managed
to
collect
a
total
of
3,997
responses
.
Of
those
,
I
invalidated
290
for
various
reasons
(
see

for
further
information
)
,
leaving
3,707
valid
responses
.

I
received
a
number
of
responses
that
were
either
obviously
fraudulent/malicious
,
blatantly
falsified
,
or
irrelevant
to
the
dataset
.
Responses
were
considered
invalid
based
on
the
following
criteria
:

Self-explanatory
,
but
if
you
have
n’t
caught
any
Wailmer
,
you
are
certainly
not
going
to
have
gotten
a
shiny
and
I
did
n’t
want
those
to
affect

Entering
zero
after
selecting
that
the
player
had
found
a
shiny
wailmer
,
or
other
“

”
entries
was
classified
as
invalid
,
as
I
preferred
not
to
alter
the
data
and
felt
it
best
to
just
remove
the
result
from

I
had
a

responses
indicating
from
8,754
to
2
trillion
Wailmers
caught
with
no
shiny
.
While
8,000
Wailmer
could
theoretically(
?
)
be
possible
,
i
considered
it
unlikely
and
outside
of
the
valid
dataset
.
I
also
had
a
few
responses
with
high
catches
and
no
shiny
(
high
1,678
)
and
some
responses
indicating
1
shiny
with
low
total
catches
(
lowest
was
1
for
3
)
.
These
results
could
n’t
be
ruled
out
as
statistically
impossible
,
so
were
left
in
.
As
well
,
the
results
for
3-4
shiny
with
suitably
low
total
catches
did
not

I
instead
chose
to
include
an

with

Analysis
</hi>
As
you
can
see
above
,
a
total
of
941
Shiny
Wailmer
have
been
caught
from
479,376
catches
,
with
an
average
of
21.36
%
of
players
finding
a
shiny
.
Players
,
on
average
,
caught
129
Wailmer
.
Based
on
the
above
data
,
the
drop
rate
can
be
calculated
to
1:509
,
which
is
close
to
the
predicted
1:512
,
as
opposed
to
the
other
predicted
value
of
1:256
.
The
percentage
of
players
finding
a
shiny
seems
to
support
this
figure
as
well
.
A
drop
rate
of
1:256
would
have
resulted
in
average
of
39.64
%
of
players
.
A
drop
rate
of
1:512
(
or
1:500
)
would
also
explain
the
number
of
players
,
myself
included
,
that
have
not
found
one
yet
,
despite
having
caught/seen
200+
Wailmer
.
I
also
calculated
the
Average
Drop
Rate
including
just
the
previous
“
Caught
:
”
group
to
see
how
much
of
a
change
the
3
&amp;
4
Shiny
catches
changed
the
overall
drop
rate
.
Ignoring
the
players
reporting
4
Shiny
,
the
Drop
Rate
decreases
to
1:515
.
Ignoring
the
responses
of
3
Shiny
lowers
the
drop
rate
to
1:540
,
but
I
have
no
justification
to
ignore
those
responses
,
as
it
is
not
statistically
impossible
to
get
3
Shiny
,
though
highly
unlikely
on
as
few
as
60
catches
.
Either
way
,
the
drop
rate
appears
to
be
much
closer
to
1:500
or
1:512
than
1:200
or
1:256
.
If
I
were
to
do
anything
differently
,
I
would
have
asked
for
total
number
of
Wailmer
seen/checked
instead
of
caught
,
but
I
’m
unsure
if
it
would
have
made
a
significant
difference
.
(
If
anything
,
it
would
have
made
the
Ratio
larger
,
but
percentage
of
players
with
a
shiny
seem
to
correspond
well
to
the
overall
catch
rate
.
)

<sp who="#Jshea1">
<p>
No
shiny
wailmer
after
807
checked
but
did
get
my
first
shiny
Murkrow
and
Mawile
(
raid
attempt
#46
)
plus
another
Magikarp
during
the
event
.
So
not
a
total
loss
.
