Selection
and
Construction
of
Indicators
</head>
<p>
Secondary
data
was
obtained
from
documentary
research
in
public
institutions
and
bibliographical
reviews
about
the
theme
.
Indicators
were
selected
from
governmental
open-access
databases
such
as
the
Brazilian
Institute
of
Geography
and
Statistics
(
IBGE
)
,
the
Department
of
the
Brazilian
Unified
Health
System
(
DATASUS
)
,
and
the
São
Paulo
State
Foundation
of
Data
Analysis
(
SEADE
)
.
</p>
<p>
The
framework
for
selection
and
arrangement
of
the
indicators
was
based
on
the
matrix
of
environmental
health
indicators
developed
in
partnership
with
the
United
Nations
Environment
Program
(
UNEP
)
,
the
World
Health
Organization
(
WHO
)
,
and
the
USA
Environment
Program
(
USEPA
)
,
known
as
the
DPSEEA
framework
.
The
matrix
establishes
a
demand
flow
and
pressure
for
natural
resources
and
changes
in
the
ecosystem
,
enabling
a
broad
observation
of
the
factors
that
influence
human
health
and
well-being
.
Its
multiple
dimensions
allow
the
analysis
of
the
driving
forces
(
D
)
,
the
environmental
pressure
(
P
)
that
influence
the
state/situation
of
the
environment
(
S
)
,
modulating
the
exposures
(
E
)
to
diseases
,
which
are
considered
the
effect
(
EF
)
in
the
cycle
.
Thus
,
this
systemic
and
ranked
set
of
indicators
focuses
on
health
and
environmental
issues
,
bringing
options
for
different
and
strategic
actions
(
A
)
that
can
be
executed
at
different
levels
and
in
different
ways
of
prevention
and
control
.
</p>
<p>
According
to
the
environmental
indicators
,
the
manual
of
the
Brazilian
Ministry
of
Health
,
the
model
proposed
by
the
WHO
,
appeared
to
be
suitable
for
the
rational
basis
exhibited
in
an
integrated
matrix
of
indicators
conjoining
socioenvironmental
and
health
issues
(

)
.
</p>
<p>
For
this
project
,
four
categories
of
indicators
were
selected
:
sanitation
,
land
use
,
air
quality
,
and
forest
coverage
.
These
categories
were
chosen
based
on
human
pressure
and
their
influence
on
urban
environmental
quality
such
as
infrastructure
,
air
and
water
quality
,
solid
waste
management
,
and
prevalence
of
areas
covered
by
natural
vegetation
.
Each
selected
indicator
expresses
different
socioenvironmental
conditions
in
MRSP
that
aim
at
specific
demands
when
quality
and
sustainability
were
considered
.
</p>
<p>
In
addition
to
the
DPSEEA
Matrix
,
for
the
selection
of
relevant
indicators
that
fit
the
MRSP
metropolitan
context
,
the
priority
metropolitan
themes
expressed
in
the
MRSP
IUDP
(
Integrated
Urban
Development
Plan
)
were
considered
.
The
Plan
considers
metropolitan
issues
that
go
beyond
municipal
boundaries
.
Examples
are
the
use
of
water
resources
considering
the
possibilities
of
integrating
the
production
systems
and
the
projections
of
demand
,
availability
of
electricity
,
infrastructure
barriers
to
serve
the
population
and
support
economic
activity
.
With
regard
to
sanitation
and
the
environment
,
issues
such
as
sanitary
sewage
,
macrodrainage
,
solid
waste
disposal
,
and
environmental
damage
were
highlighted
.

<p>
The
DPSEEA
approach
,
adopted
by
World
Health
Organization
,
has
been
applied
in
Brazil
by
the
General
Coordination
of
Environmental
Health
Surveillance
of
the
Health
Surveillance
Secretariat
of
the
Ministry
of
Health
(
CGVAM
/
SVS
/
MS
)
since
the
late
1990s
.
The
construction
of
indicators
that
point
to
the
interrelationships
of
environmental
changes
and
health
situation
are
at
the
origin
of
the
process
of
institutionalization
of
environmental
health
surveillance
within
the
Health
Sector
,
from
the
20th
to
the
21st
century
,
initially
by
Decree
No.
3.450/2000
of
the
Presidency
of
the
Republic
,
establishing
in
the
former
National
Center
for
Epidemiology
(
Cenepi
)
the
management
of
the
national
system
of
epidemiological
and
environmental
surveillance
and
,
subsequently
,
through
Normative
Instruction
SVS
No.
1
of
2005
,
which
regulated
the
National
Environmental
Health
Surveillance
Subsystem
(
SINVSA
)
.
Brazil
was
a
pioneer
in
adapting
this
conceptual
framework
and
in
the
systematic
and
validated
use
of
indicators
that
help
manage
environmental
health
problems
.
</p>
<p>
Table
1
presents
a
set
of
indicators
used
by
environmental
health
,
organized
according
to
the
DPSEEA
model
:
</p>
<p>
This
model
allows
the
integrated
analysis
of
environmental
health
within
an
economic
and
social
context
and
can
be
applied
to
subsidize
the
monitoring
of
sustainability
conditions
at
the
regional
and
municipal
levels
.
Stauber
et
al.
2018
points
out
that
applying
the
DPSEEA
matrix
structure
can
allow
to
make
more
focused
decisions
around
key
socioenvironmental
issues
by
identifying
areas
for
intervention
.
Thus
,
achieving
improvements
in
the
health
and
well-being
of
the
cities
requires
better
tracking
and
understanding
of
the
role
of
indicators
,
especially
in
urban
environments
.
Inserted
in
the
logic
presented
,
the
application
of
the
DPSEEA
matrix
was
the
basis
of
this
study
to
select
indicators
that
operationalize
the
concept
of
environmental
health
.
</p>
<p>
According
to
Sobral
and
Freitas
(
2010
)
,
it
is
important
to
highlight
that
the
DPSEEA
model
of
indicators
should
be
used
as
an
auxiliary
tool
of
the
social
determination
model
of
health
,
because
although
it
allows
an
integrated
view
of
the
indicators
,
by
itself
it
cannot
contemplate
all
the
complexity
of
interrelations
of
the
dimensions
that
determine
the
process
of
social
production
of
health-disease
and
its
inequalities
between
social
groups
.
