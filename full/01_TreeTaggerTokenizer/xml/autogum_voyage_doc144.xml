One
special
thing
about
the
Okeechobee
Road
area
between
I-95
and
the
Turnpike
is
that
it
is
considered
to
be
a
crossroads
,
where
two
highways
are
within
a
driving
range
of
less
than
a
mile
.
Businesses
,
from
hotels
to
restaurants
,
are
abundant
in
this
State
Road
70
corridor

Businesses

n't
just
exist
at
the
cross

also
run

runs
along
the

The

There
has
been
much
talk

controversy
about
the
Florida
East
Coast
Railroad
and
Amtrak
giving
the
<ref target="Port%20St.%20Lucie">
Port

,
possibly
Fort
Pierce
,
a
train
station
that
serves
passengers

If
these
plans
go
through
,
they
will
be
serving
the
Florida
East

Railway

rails

not

touched

the

trains
