The
most
important
tourist
destinations
in
the
Eastern
Region
of
the
Dominican
Republic
are
the
beaches
of
<ref target="Punta%20Cana">
Punta
Cana
</ref>
and
<ref target="Bavaro">
Bavaro
</ref>
.
These
two
beaches
are
filled
with
all-inclusive
hotels
,
very
popular
among
Europeans
and
North
Americans
.
All
these
hotels
are
very
safe
and
are
a
showcase
of
Dominican
hospitality
.
For
those
seeking
to
escape
the
rather
artificial
paradise
of
Punta
Cana
and
Bavaro
,
the
closest
town
where
tourists
can
witness
the
Dominican
reality
is
that
of
<ref target="Hig%C3%BCey">
Hig체ey
</ref>
,
the
religious
center
of
the
country
.
The
&quot;
Basilica
de
Hig체ey
&quot;
is
the
scene
of
intense
local
pilgrimage
every
January
.
</p>
<p>
To
the
South
,
you
will
find
the
city
of
La
Romana
,
contiguous
to
the
world-famous
resort
of
<ref target="Casa%20de%20Campo">
Casa
de
Campo
</ref>
,
where
the
rich
and
wealthy
of
the
Dominican
Republic
and
the
world
have
their
beach
residences
.
Casa
de
Campo
has
the
country
's
best
golf
courses
,
as
well
as
a
beautiful
and
fancy
Marina
,
smaller
than
that
of
Cap
Cana
.
Tourists
should
not
miss
the
tourist
town
of
<ref target="Altos%20de%20Chav%C3%B3n">
Altos
de
Chav처n
</ref>
,
the
replica
of
a
Renaissance
Italian
village
,
home
to
one
of
the
Caribbean
's
most
important
art
schools
,
overlooking
a
cliff
and
the
Chav처n
River
.
Its
replica
of
a
Roman
Amphitheater
is
the
scene
of
multiple
shows
and
concerts
.
Close
to
La
Romana
is
the
beach
of
<ref target="Bayahibe">
Bayahibe
</ref>
,
another
alternative
to
Punta
Cana
.
Also
,
those
who
are
looking
for
infinite
white-sand
beaches
but
hate
huge
hotels
and
resorts
can
explore
the
Saona
Island
off
the
southeastern
coast
,
offering
the
same
natural
beauty
of
Punta
Cana
,
but
undefiled
by
mass
tourism
.
</p>
<p>
Destinations
off
the
beaten
path
include
first
the
chaotic
town
of
<ref target="San%20Pedro%20de%20Macoris">
San
Pedro
de
Macoris
</ref>
,
home
to
the
most
famous
Dominican
baseball
players
such
as
Sammy
Sosa
and
Pedro
Martinez
.
The
town
is
surrounded
by
&quot;
Bateys
&quot;
or
sugar-cane
plantations
,
offering
a
stark
contrast
with
the
resorts
.
To
the
North
,
you
will
find
the
beach
of
<ref target="Miches">
Miches
</ref>
,
which
the
locals
have
made
impressive
efforts
to
develop
on
their
own
,
providing
for
an
alternative
more
authentic
tourist
destination
without
any
of
the
fancy
all-inclusive
resorts
that
plague
the
East
Coast
.
Miches
is
close
to
<ref target="Los%20Haitises%20National%20Park">
Los
Haitises
National
Park
</ref>
.
The
park
has
an
outstanding
natural
beauty
,
displaying
a
beautiful
tropical
rain-forest
,
and
an
unending
chains
archipelagos
that
are
readily
explorable
by
boat
.
