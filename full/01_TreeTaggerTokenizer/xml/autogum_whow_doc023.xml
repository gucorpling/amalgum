Steps

<list type="ordered">
<item>
Gather
your
ingredients
.
Make
sure
that
you
have
all
of
them
before
you
start
making
Marble
Art
.
</item>
<item>
Cut
the
piece
of
poster
paper
.
According
to
the
size
you
want
it
to
be
.
You
'll
need
the
piece
of
paper
for
the
art
part
later
so
make
sure
it
is
the
size
you
want
it
to
be
(
not
bigger
than
the
dish
though
)
.
</item>
<item>
Fill
the
dish/bowl
with
a
thin
layer
of
shaving
foam
.
About
a
centimeter
will
do
.
This
step
is
important
so
make
sure
the
shaving
foam
covers
the
bottom
of
the
dish
and
you
ca
n't
see
the
bottom
any
more
or
it
might
not
show
the
pattern
after
you
have
finished
.
(
But
again
not
too
much
)
.
</item>
<item>
Add
the
food
coloring
to
the
shaving
foam
.
One
drop
at
a
time
,
make
sure
that
you
have
a
nice
mixture
of
colors
.
Red
,
yellow
and
blue
works
best
as
they
will
mix
together
to
form
orange
,
purple
and
green
.
The
colors
need
to
be
equal
or
the
pattern
might
come
out
slightly
uneven
(
but
if
you
want
,
you
can
also
make
it
more
reddish
,
blueish
or
yellowish
)
.
</item>
<item>
Use
a
tooth
pick
(
or
a
chopstick
)
to
draw
some
patterns
.
For
example
:
swirls
,
loops
,
stripes
and
lots
more
!
You
can
even
mix
the
patterns
that
you
like
together
to
make
your
own
funny
unique
patterns
!
</item>
<item>
Put
the
paper
flat
onto
the
dish
and
press
it
lightly
.
About
half
a
centimeter
into
the
shaving
foam
.
This
will
make
the
pattern
stick
to
the
paper
so
make
sure
you
like
your
pattern
before
doing
this
step
!
(
Be
careful
not
to
press
too
hard
here
)
.
</item>
<item>
Lift
the
paper
up
from
the
dish
.
You
should
see
that
a
layer
of
shaving
foam
has
stuck
to
the
paper
.
Use
the
plastic
lid
to
scrape
the
foam
off
,
if
the
pattern
comes
out
smudgy
,
scrape
it
once
more
until
you
see
the
pattern
.
(
You
should
still
scrape
it
off
once
more
even
though
you
see
the
pattern
just
to
make
sure
)
.
</item>
<item>
Repeat
the
process
until
you
have
used
up
all
your
paper
.
If
your
shaving
foam
gets
a
bit
mixed
up
,
dirty
or
grayish
,
you
can
make
a
new
layer
of
shaving
foam
but
this
time
,
you
can
make
it
a
little
bit
thinner
.
</item>
<item>
You
should
see
that
Marble
Art
comes
out
really
nice
and
also
easy
to
make
.
The
patterns
that
you
make
can
vary
from
curls
to
zigzags
so
if
you
want
a
different
pattern
,
just
draw
your
patterns
differently
or
even
mix
up
your
patterns
!
After
you
've
finished
,
go
ahead
and
make
it
into
a
card
or
use
it
to
decorate
your
room
!

messy
