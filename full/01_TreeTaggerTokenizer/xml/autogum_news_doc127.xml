(

says
he
will
not

in

with

Robert

,
who
was
widely
accused
of
using
violence
and
intimidation
to
win
Sunday
's
run-off
election
.
</p>
<p>
The
opposition
leader
,
Mugabe
's
only
rival
in
the
election
before
dropping
out
due
to
fears
of
violence
,
cited

<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thabo%20Mbeki">
Thabo

'
s
role
as
mediator
in
the
conflict
,
as
appointed
by
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern%20African%20Development%20Community">

African
Development
Community
</ref>
(
SADC
)
.
Tsvangirai
has
often
criticized
Mbeki
for
failing
to
publicly
condemn
Robert
Mugabe
,
and
has
repeatedly
called
for
him
to
step
down
.
</p>
<p>
Tsvangirai
says
that
&quot;
no
meaningful
progress
can
be
made
toward
resolving
the
Zimbabwe
crisis
&quot;
if
the
SADC
or
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African%20Union">
African
Union
</ref>
does
not
appoint
at
least
one
other
mediator
.
&quot;
If
this
does
not
happen
,
&quot;
he
says
,
&quot;
then
the
MDC
will
not
be
part
of
the
mediation
process
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
He
added
,
&quot;
If
dialogue
is
to
be
initiated
,
it
is
essential
that
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZANU-PF">
ZANU-PF
</ref>
stops
the
violence
,
halts
the
persecution
of
MDC
leaders
and
supporters
.
&quot;
The
MDC
says
that
9
of
its
supporters
have
been
killed
by
the
state
since
the
run-off
,
bringing
the
death
toll
up
to
at
least
95
.
</p>
<p>
Earlier
on
Tuesday
,
leaders
at
an
African
Union
summit
voiced
their
support
for
dialogue
aimed
at
the
creation
of
a
unity
government
in
Zimbabwe
.
&quot;
We
encourage
President
Mugabe
and
opposition
leader
Morgan
Tsvangirai
to
honour
their
commitment
to
initiate
dialogue
with
a
view
to
promote
peace
,
stability
,
democracy
and
reconciliation
in
Zimbabwe
,
&quot;
the
AU
said
in
a
statement
.
</p>
<p>
While
the
opposition
rejected
the
idea
of
discussion
,
the
Zimbabwe
government
called
it
a
&quot;
welcome
resolution
&quot;
,
as
stated
by
Information
Minister
Sikhanyiso
Ndlovu
.
&quot;
Government
is
ready
for
dialogue
with
anyone
,
&quot;
he
said
,
&quot;
so
long
as
it
is
n't
dialogue
concocted
by
the
West
.
&quot;
In
his
inauguration
speech
,
Mugabe
had
said
he
was
open
to
negotiations
.
</p>
<p>
Tsvangirai
believes
that
if
a
unified
government
were
to
be
created
,
it
should
be
based
on
the
results
of
the
original
March
29
election
,
in
which
he
received
more
votes
but
not
enough
to
avoid
a
run-off
.
&quot;
We
remain
committed
to
negotiations
or
talks
,
call
them
what
you
will
,
but
they
should
be
based
on
the
fact
that
we
won
the
last
credible
election
on
March
29
,
&quot;
Tsvangirai
said
.
&quot;
Then
we
can
move
towards
some
transitional
arrangement
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/European_Union">
European
Union
</ref>
agrees
with
Tsvangirai
on
this
point
.
Taking
into
account
the
March
29
vote
,
EU
spokesman
John
Clancy
says
,
&quot;
it
's
clear
that
[
Tsvangirai
]
should
be
a
leading
member
of
that
government
as
its
potential
prime
minister
or
the
head
of
government
to
ensure
that
certain
reforms
can
take
place
.
&quot;
The
EU
had
been
placing
pressure
on
the
African
Union
to
take
strong
measures
against
Mugabe
's
government
.
