Medicinal
Sesquiterpenes
</head>
<p>
Sesquiterpene
biosynthesis
normally
begins
in
the
cytosol
via
the
C15
prenyl
diphosphate
FDP
,
which
itself
is
derived
from
mevalonic
acid
and
the
MVA
pathway
.
Sesquiterpene
synthases
act
on
FDP
to
yield
hundreds
of
sesquiterpene
hydrocarbons
and
alcohols
based
on
dozens
of
carbon
skeletons
.
They
are
frequently
responsible
for
familiar
scents
and
flavors
,
for
instance
ginger
(
gingerol
)
,
clove
,
cannabis
,
rosemary
(
β-caryophyllene
)
,
patchouli
(
patchoulol
)
,
sandalwood
(
α-santalene
)
,
and
rain
(
geosmin
,
a
bacterial
sesquiterpene
)
.
They
are
the
heaviest
of
the
volatile
terpenes
under
standard
conditions
(
diterpene
hydrocarbons
ordinarily
require
heating
to
form
gases
)
.
Plant
families
known
to
be
principal
producers
of
sesquiterpene
volatiles
include
the
Lamiaceae
,
Geraniaceae
,
Rutaceae
,
Myrtaceae
,
Cannabaceae
,
and
Gingeraceae
.
The
use
of
these
essential
oils
in
traditional
herbal
medicine
such
as
aromatherapy
and
Ayurvedic
medicine
is
well
documented
.
There
is
currently
little
evidence
their
use
confers
actual
medical
benefits
,
yet
their
use
remains
widespread
due
to
their
aesthetic
,
historical
,
and
cultural
significance
.
On
the
other
hand
,
a
number
of
highly
functionalized
,
non-volatile
sesquiterpenes
of
plant
origin
have
demonstrated
highly
specific
biological
activity
and
have
therefore
been
investigated
for
their
clinical
potential
.
A
selection
of
these
medically
useful
plant
sesquiterpenoids
follows

Artemisinin

<p>
Wormwood
(
<hi rend="italic">
Artemisia
annua
</hi>
L.
,
or
qinghaosu
,
Asteraceae
)
is
native
to
China
and
is
the
source
of
the
sesquiterpene
endoperoxide
artemisinin
,
shown
to
be
highly
effective
at
treating
malaria
.
In
the
early
1970s
,
phytochemists
such
as
Youyou
Tu
investigated
plants
used
in
traditional
Chinese
herbal
medicine
and
identified
the
usefulness
of
the
traditional
remedy
qinghaosu
in
eradicating
<hi rend="italic">
Plasmodium
spp
</hi>
.
infections
,
the
causative
agent
of
malaria
,
for
which
she
received
a
Nobel
Prize
in
Medicine
in
2015
.
It
is
more
effective
against
a
broader
range
of
life
cycle
stages
of
the
apicomplexan
parasite
than
traditional
anti-malarials
such
as
quinine
.
</p>
<p>
Artemisinin
is
a
sesquiterpene
lactone
with
an
unusual
endoperoxide
ring
which
imparts
its
anti-malarial
properties
(
<figure>
Figure

)
.
The
mechanism
of
action
is
still
unclear
,
and
several
possibilities
have
been
proposed
.
Most
involve
the
degradation
of
the
endoperoxide
bridge
in
a
heme-dependent
process
to
form
carbon
centered
radicals
which
then
alkylate
multiple
targets
including
heme
and
proteins
.
The
involvement
of
heme
is
consistent
with
the
specificity
of
artemisinin
towards
<hi rend="italic">
Plasmodium
spp
</hi>
.
.
The
direct
cause
of
toxicity
to
the
parasite
is
unclear
but
may
involve
interference
with
the
conversion
of
heme
to
hemozoin
,
although
this
hypothesis
has
been
disputed
(
and
reviewed
in
reference
)
.
</p>
<p>
The
early
stages
of
artemisinin
biosynthesis
in
glandular
trichomes
of
<hi rend="italic">
A.
annua
</hi>
are
now
understood
at
the
biochemical
and
molecular
levels
,
although
the
exact
mechanism
of
the
later
stages
remains
unclear
.
Current
efforts
now
focus
on
the
regulation
of
this
pathway
in
an
effort
to
improve
artemisinin
production
directly
in
plants
.
The
pathway
begins
with
the
conversion
of
FDP
to
amorpha-4,11-diene
by
amorpha-4,11-diene
synthase
(
<figure>
Figure
6
</figure>
)
.
Biochemical
characterization
and
metabolite
profiling
of
plant
tissue
indicated
the
presence
of
this
olefin
as
well
as
its
oxygenated
derivatives
artemisinic
alcohol
and
aldehyde
,
dihydroartemisinic
alcohol
and
aldehyde
,
and
dihydroartemisinic
acid
.
Following
the
cloning
and
expression
of
CYP71AV1
,
which
converts
amorpha-4,11-diene
to
artemisinic
alcohol
and
aldehyde
,
Zhang
et
al.
characterized
the
artemisinic
aldehyde
Δ11(13
)
reductase
(
Double
bond
reductase
2
,
Dbr2
)
,
which
preferentially
reduces
artemisinic
aldehyde
to
dihydroartemisinic
aldehyde
.
This
substrate
is
then
converted
to
dihydroartemisinic
acid
by
aldehyde
dehydrogenase
1
(
Aldh1
)
.
From
dihydroartemisinic
acid
,
the
remaining
steps
involve
the
photooxidative
formation
of
the
endoperoxide
ring
.
However
,
the
details
of
this
process
,
such
as
the
potential
involvement
of
additional
enzyme
activities
,
are
currently
unclear
.
