<p>
Joanne
Dennehy
laughed
,
talked
,
and
smiled
during
proceedings
but
stood
silent
and
emotionless
with
her
eyes
closed
when
the
sentence
was
announced
.
The
judge
said
she
had
a
&quot;
sadistic
lust
for
blood
&quot;
.
</p>
<p>
Dennehy
had
admitted
her
crimes
;
Stretch
and
Layton
went
to
trial
.
She
killed
Lukasz
Slaboszewski
,
31
,
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peterborough">
Peterborough
</ref>
after
leading
him
to
believe
they
were
lovers
;
he
texted
a
friend
&quot;
life
is
beautiful
&quot;
about
the
supposed
relationship
.
Within
two
weeks
she
had
gone
on
to
kill
housemate
John
Chapman
,
56
,
and
Kevin
Lee
,
48
.
All
were
stabbed
in
March
last
year
.
</p>
<p>
Lee
's
body
was
found
dumped
in
a
ditch
clad
in
a
black
sequinned
dress
.
His
buttocks
were
visible
.
Lee
and
Dennehy
had
been
having
an
affair
.
</p>
<p>
She
told
a
psychiatrist
&quot;
I
killed
to
see
how
I
would
feel
,
to
see
if
I
was
as
cold
as
I
thought
I
was
,
then
it
got

.
&quot;
Mr
Justice
Spencer
noted
Dennehy
held
a
&quot;
strange
fascination
&quot;
to
the
men
in
the
case
.
Lee
's
family
said
in
a
statement
yesterday
&quot;
We
feel
Joanne
Dennehy
brainwashed
Kevin
,
causing
him
to
make
a
bad
decision
,
and
he
has
paid
for
that
with
his
life
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Following
the
Peterborough
murders
Dennehy
made
a
140-mile
trip
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hereford">
Hereford
</ref>
where
she
stabbed
dog
walkers
Robin
Bereza
and
John
Rogers
with
a
knife
within
nine
minutes
of
each
other
.
Both
survived
.
</p>
<p>
Mr
Justice
Spencer
identified
Dennehy
as
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/psychopathy">
psychopath
</ref>
with
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paraphilia">

</ref>
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sadomasochism">

</ref>
,
in
which
sexual
pleasure
is
gained
from
the
suffering
of
others
.
She
wrote
him
a
letter
saying
she
had
no
remorse
for
the
murders
.

mother
of
two

as
the
only
women
to
be
given
whole-life
sentences
in
the
UK
,
in
which
convicts
are
told
they
will
never
be
released
.
</p>
<p>
The
sentencing
follows
a
recent
ruling
by
the
court
of
appeal
upholding
the
legality
of
whole
life
terms
.
The
four
defendants
were
jailed
in
Courtroom
2
of
the
Old
Bailey
,
where
on
Wednesday
Michael
Adebolajo
also
received
a
whole
life
term
for
a
terror
attack
