was
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germans">
German

theologian
,
writer
,
and
preacher
who
became
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Reformer">
Protestant

and
spiritualist
.
He
was
one
of
the

<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Reformation">

Reformation
</ref>
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silesia">

.
</p>
<p>
Schwenckfeld
came
to
Reformation
principles
through

and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Karlstadt">

However
,
he
developed
his
own
principles
and
fell
out
with
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther">
Martin
Luther
</ref>
over
the
eucharistic
controversy
(
1524
)
.
He
had
his
own
views
on
the
sacraments
-
the
Heavenly
Flesh
doctrine
-
developed
in
close
association
with
his
humanist
colleague
,

His

sect

forced
to

he

Between

Schwenckfeld
served
the

as
an
adviser
to

.
</p>
<head>
From
Catholic
to
Magisterial
Reformer
to
Radical
Reformer
</head>
<p>
In
1518
or
1519
,
Schwenckfeld
experienced
an
awakening
that
he
called
a
&quot;
visitation
of
God
.
&quot;
Luther
's
writings
had
a
deep
influence
on
Schwenckfeld
,
and
he
embraced
the
&quot;
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutheranism">
Lutheran
</ref>
&quot;
Reformation
and
became
a
student
of
the
Scriptures
.
In
1521
,
Schwenckfeld
began
to
preach
the
gospel
,
and
in
1522
won
Duke
Friedrich
II
over
to
Protestantism
.
He
organized
a
<hi rend="italic">
Brotherhood
</hi>
of
his
converts
for
the
purpose
of
study
and
prayer
in
1523
.
In
1525
,
he
rejected
Luther
's
idea
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Presence">
Real
Presence
</ref>
and
came
to
a
spiritual
interpretation
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucharist">
Lord
's
Supper
</ref>
,
which
was
subsequently
rejected
by
Luther
.
Schwenckfeld
began
to
teach
that
the
true
believer
ate
the
spiritual
body
of
Christ
.
He
pushed
for
reformation
wherever
he
went
,
but
also
criticized
reformers
that
he
thought
went
to
extremes
.
He
emphasized
that
for
one
to
be
a
true
Christian
,
one
must
not
change
only
outwardly
but
inwardly
.
Because
of
the
communion
and
other
controversies
,
Schwenckfeld
broke
with
Luther
and
followed
what
some
describe
as
a
&quot;
middle
way
&quot;
.
Because
of
his
break
from
Luther
and
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magisterial_Reformation">
Magisterial
Reformation
</ref>
,
scholars
typically
categorize
Schwenckfeld
as
a
member
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_Reformation">
Radical
Reformation
</ref>
.
He
voluntarily
exiled
himself
from
Silesia
in
1529
in
order
to
relieve
pressure
on
and
embarrassment
of
his
duke
.
He
lived
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strasbourg">
Strassburg
</ref>
from
1529
–
1534
and
then

Teachings
</head>
<p>
Some
of
the
teachings
of
Schwenckfeld
included
opposition
to
war
,
secret
societies
,
and
oath-taking
,
that
the
government
had
no
right
to
command
one
's
conscience
,
that
regeneration
is
by
grace
through
inner
work
of
the
Spirit
,
that
believers
feed
on
Christ
spiritually
,
and
that
believers
must
give
evidence
of
regeneration
.
He
rejected
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant_baptism">
infant
baptism
</ref>
,
outward
church
forms
,
and
&quot;
denominations
&quot;
.
His
views
on
the
Eucharist
prompted
Luther
to
publish
several
sermons
on
the
subject
in
his
1526

In
1540
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther">
Martin
Luther
</ref>
expelled
Caspar
Schwenckfeld
from
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silesia">
Silesia
</ref>
.
In
1541
,
Schwenckfeld
published
the
<hi rend="italic">
Great
Confession
on
the
Glory
of
Christ
</hi>
.
Many
considered
the
writing
to
be
heretical
.
He
taught
that
Christ
had
two
natures
,
divine
and
human
,
but
that
he
became
progressively
more
divine
.
He
also
published
a
number
of
works
about
interpreting
the
Scriptures
during
the
1550s
,
often
responding
to
the
rebuttals
of
the
Lutheran
Reformer

Death
</head>
<p>
In
1561
,
Schwenckfeld
became
sick
with
dysentery
,
and
gradually
grew
weaker
until
he
died
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulm">
Ulm
</ref>
on
the
morning
of
December
10
,
1561
.
Because
of
his
enemies
,
the
fact
of
his
death
and
the
place
of
his
burial
were
kept
secret
.

<p>
Schwenckfeld
did
not
organize
a
separate
church
during
his
lifetime
,
but
followers
seemed
to
gather
around
his
writings
and
sermons
.
In
1700
there
were
about
1,500
of
them
in
Lower
Silesia
.
Many
fled
Silesia
under
persecution
of
the
Austrian
emperor
,
and
some
found
refuge
on
the
lands
of
Count
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Ludwig_Zinzendorf">
Nicolaus
Ludwig

</ref>
and
his
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herrnhuter_Brüdergemeinde">

</ref>
.
These
followers
became
known
as
Schwenkfelders
.
A
group
arrived
in
Philadelphia
in
1731
,
followed
by
five
more
migrations
up
to
1737
.
In
1782
,
the
Society
of
Schwenkfelders
was
formed
,
and
in
1909
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwenkfelder_Church">

was
organized
.
</p>
<p>
The

remained

,
and
currently
there
are
five
