customer
,
has
had
his
cellular
phone
account
shut
off
,
but
not
because
he
was
n't
paying
the
phone
bill
,
or
even
because
he
was
late
on
payments
,
but
because
a
customer
service
representative
who
assisted
him
,
began
to
call
him
outside
of
her
job
,
and
make
death
threats
to
him
in
September
of
2006
.
She
was
never
fired
for
her
actions
,
Brady
says
.
</p>
<p>
Brady
has
agreed
to
be
interviewed
by
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikinews">
Wikinews
</ref>
to
tell
his
story
.
All
information
and
claims
have
been
logged
with
Brady
's
attorney
and
federal
authorities
.
</p>
<p>
The
representative
from
Sprint
Nextel
,
who
for
safety
reasons
is
only
being
identified
as
Jessica
,
was
working
at
the
company
's
call
center
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario,%20Canada">
Ontario
,
Canada
</ref>
where
Brady
's
call
to
customer
service
was
directed
.
According
to
Brady
,
Jessica
then
began
to
call
him
outside
of
her
job
duties
at
the
call
center
after
their
first
contact
.
</p>
<p>
Brady
called
the
center
around
6:00
p.m.
(
eastern
time
)
on
a
Saturday
and
attempted
to
receive
help
on
a
billing
question
and
to
find
a
way
to
stop
prank
calls
.
Brady
requested
a
&quot;
soc
code
&quot;
,
a
code
placed
into
the
phone
,
that
would
allow
for
the
number
that
was
pranking
him
to
be
blocked
.
Unfortunately
,
Jessica
did
not
know
what
that
was
,
but
tried
unsuccessfully
to
find
it
.
According
to
Brady
,
the
only
thing
she
could
find
was
&quot;
the
ANI
feature
call
centers
have
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Brady
then
described
to
Jessica
the
billing
issue
he
was
having
.
He
was
being
charged
&quot;
for
text
messages
I
was
not
making
&quot;
,
even
though
he
had
unlimited
text
messaging
with
his
billing
plan
.
Meanwhile
,
Jessica
called
for
a
supervisor
to
help
locate
the
code
.
As
this
customer
service
request
over
the
phone
was
taking
quite
a
bit
of
time
,
the
two
of
them
then
started
to
discuss
what
two
people
would
normally
discuss
if
just
chatting
;
sports
,
the
weather
,
movies
and
music
and
if
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Virginia">
Virginia
</ref>
was
a
nice
place
to
go
on
vacation
.
The
supervisor
then
came
by
Jessica
's
station
with
no
luck
on
finding
a
code
.
</p>
<p>
Later
that
night
,
around
10:30
p.
m.
,
Brady
received
a
call
.
He
answered
it
and
much
to
his
surprise
,
it
was
Jessica
.
He
answered
the
phone
with
the
usual
&quot;
hello
&quot;
and
the
voice
on
the
other
end
answered
with
&quot;
hello
Josh
.
&quot;
Brady
was
&quot;
surprised
&quot;
that
she
had
not
said
&quot;
hello
Mr.
Brady
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
then
asked
who
it
was
,
and
she
said
Jessica
.
She
told
me
about
her
day
,
and
hoped
that
I
did
not
mind
her
calling
.
&quot;
Then
according
to
Brady
,
she
started
to
describe
how
much
she
hated
working
in
a
call
center
,
and
how
the
job
&quot;
pays
the
bills
&quot;
,
and
asked
if
she
could
&quot;
come
visit
me
sometime
&quot;
.
Brady
said
that
he
&quot;
immediately
started
to
record
&quot;
the
call
.
Brady
also
stated
that
Jessica
was
not
aware
she
was
being
recorded
,
and
that
further
conversations
were
recorded
without
her
knowing
.
</p>
<p>
The
call
lasted
about
15
minutes
,
but
Brady
said
she
&quot;
spoke
so
fast
and
moved
along
through
things
&quot;
that
he
&quot;
did
n't
have
a
chance
to
talk
if
I
wanted
to
.
It
[
the
call
]
ended
with
me
interrupting
her
and
telling
her
I
had
to
go
to
dinner
with
a
friend
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Brady
immediately
called
customer
care
back
and
reported
Jessica
's
actions
to
a
supervisor
(
Jason
)
,
and
the
Floor
Manager
(
Also
named
Jessica
)
at
the
Coos
Bay
call
center
,
which
is
where
his
call
happened
to
be
directed
.
The
advice
he
received
was
to
&quot;
play
along
&quot;
and
continue
to
report
her
actions
until
they
could
locate
someone
&quot;
better
equipped
&quot;
to
handle
the
situation
.
</p>
<p>
Jessica
then
began
to
call
&quot;
about
every
other
day
or
so
&quot;
which
turned
out
to
be
almost
30
calls
,
according
to
Brady
who
reported
each
call
she
made
to
Sprint
Nextel
.
</p>
<p>
Sprint
Nextel
then
told
Jessica
to
cease
and
desist
all
contact
with
Brady
,
but
that
did
n't
stop
Jessica
from
contacting
him
.
She
somehow
found
out
the
screen-name
of
his
AOL
Instant
Messenger
account
,
and
left
messages
threatening
to
kill
him
.
Brady
logged
the
messages
and
faxed
them
to
Sprint
,
who
about
a
week
later
sent
Brady
a
letter
,
saying
that
his
accounts
have
been
terminated
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">
&quot;
The
purpose
of
this
letter
is
to
inform
our
that
our
office
has
received
a
complaint
regarding
your
recent
questionable
interactions
with
our
customer

group
.
Recent

to
formally

and
conditions

that
&quot;
termination
of

.
consistent
with
this
agreement
...
&quot;
</hi>
,
said
the
letter
from
Sprint
Nextel
.
</p>
<p>
Brady
states
that
Jessica
is
still
employed
with
Sprint
Nextel
,
despite
the
fact
that
all
instant
messages
left
by
Jessica
were
forwarded
to
Sprint
Nextel
.
</p>
<p>
As
recently
as
July
10
,
2007
,
as
many
as
1,000
accounts
were
terminated
by
Sprint
Nextel
because
customers
were
complaining
too
much
and
asking
too
many
questions
about
billing
.

&quot;
While
we
have
worked

to
the
best
of

the
number

inquiries
you
have
made

led

to
determine
that

are
unable

&quot;
</hi>
said
one
letter
to
a
sprint
customer
as
recent
as
June
29
,
2007
.
The
letter
states
that
the
service
will
be
terminated
just
one
day
after
the
letter
was
written
despite
saying
they
&quot;
understand
switching
to
a
new
carrier
causes
an
inconvenience
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Two
weeks
ago
,
Sprint
addressed
the
media
about
the
mass-cancellations
.
&quot;
These
accounts
have
been
researched
very
carefully
,
&quot;
Sprint
spokeswoman
Roni
Singleton
said
.
&quot;
We
feel
strongly
that
the
decisions
we
made
,
we
stand
by
them
.
These
decisions
were
n't
made
lightly
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
If
the
average
person
is
calling
less
than
once
per
month
and
these
people
are
calling
40
or
50
times
more
,
that
takes
away
from
customer
service
,
&quot;
Singleton
said
.
&quot;
Our
priority
is
to
improve
the
customer
experience
.
