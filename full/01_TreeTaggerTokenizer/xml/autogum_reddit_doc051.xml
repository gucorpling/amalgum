Here
’s
some
advice
.
Free
of
charge
.
I
’m
going
to
help
you
save
your
game
.
Granted
ultimate
team
is
just
a
mode
in
the
game
but
I
do
n’t
see
people
spending
real
cash
money
on
EASHL
.
So
HUT
is
your
meal
ticket
when
it
comes
to
the
NHL
franchise
.
I
’ve
thought
long
and
hard
about
this
post
,
mainly
while
I
’m
at
work
bored
out
of
my
mind
,
and
figured
this
needed
to
be
said
.
Probably
a
week
or
so
too
late
.
Maybe
a
month
or
so
too
late
.
But
here
it
is
.
Some
small
tips
and
some
larger
tips
but
tips
nonetheless
.
Here
’s
your
solution

<hi rend="bold">
Saving
18
</hi>
Well
it
’s
no
secret
this
year
is
a
mess
.
On
our
end
and
their
end
.
They
BS
’d
us
about
lowering
overalls
so
there
would
n’t
be
so
many
99s
and
here
we
are
.
Every
card
is
a
99
and
if
not
“
iT
’s
uSeLeSs
”
.
We
abused
the
slider
glitch
.
It
takes
two
.
So
now
let
’s
work
to
fix
it
.
I
think
18
is
salvageable
.
Maybe
the
gameplay
(
puck
pickups
etc
)
ca
n’t
be
saved
or
fixed
but
I
’m
willing
to
bet
EA
has
taken
quite
the
hit
in
the
pocketbook
in
the
latter
months
of
this
game
cycle
with
all
the
players
calling
it
quits
for
the
year
.
I
’m
a
“
lifer
”
.
I
play
the
game
the
whole
length
of
the
year
.
Good
or
bad
.
Sucks
for
me
right
?
But
I
’m
EA
’s
target
demographic
.
18-34
male
with
a
couple
bucks
to
spare
on
packs
from
time
to
time
.
So
listen
up
.
Allegedly
there
’s
supposed
to
be
“
500
new
legends
”
in
the
game
next
year
.
According
to
speculation
based
on
the
pre
game
survey
sent
out
by
EA
.
Well
why
not
dip
into
the
pot
and
release
1
or
2
of
these
new
legends
this
year
.
Bet
your
ass
if
they
decided
to
release
two
MSP
99s
such
as
Peter
Forsberg
and
Teemu
Selänne
there
would
be
plenty
of
“
retired
”
players
coming
back
.
At
least
for
a
bit
.
Maybe
1
or
2
more
a
month
later
.
It
’s
not
that
difficult
.
<hi rend="bold">
Fixing
19
</hi>
<hi rend="bold">
SETS
</hi>
The
sets
this
year
have
been
weak
.
Let
’s
be
honest
.
Why
do
we
need
a
Getzlaf
and
Malkin
MSP
when
they
’re
both
already
99s
.
And
the
Duncan
Keith
shit
.
Cmon
.
To
me
,
personally
,
sets
are
the
funnest
part
of
the
game
.
Because
the
players
in
the
sets
are
generally
retired
older
players
and
players
that
do
n’t
have
cards
.
If
it
were
up
to
me
I
would
have
some
kind
of
trade
in
set
like
the
flashback
master
that
runs
like
an
upgrade
set
.
Constantly
having
new
players
added
and
currently
players
having
adjusted
overalls
.
For
example
.
92
legend
Bure
to
upgrade
to
a
93
you
need
X
amount
of
carbons
to
upgrade
to
a
94
you
need
to
complete
X
amount
of
upgrade
challenges
plus
X
amount
of
carbons
and
so
on
.
I
mean
seriously
just
let
us
have
attainable
useful
versions
of
cards
throughout
the
year
because
I
would
really
love
a
Cam
Neely
that
’s
not
a
god
damn
90
.
Especially
since
90
overall
cards
were
obsolete
a
month
into
the
game
.
<hi rend="bold">
DRAFT
CHAMPIONS
</hi>
For
the
love
of
god
can
we
make
draft
champions
great
again
?
Ok
maybe
it
never
was
but
you
get
the
drift
.
Who
even
plays
DC
?
Maybe
people
do
but
I
do
n’t
.
Because
I
think
it
’s
a
waste
of
my
time
.
Now
if
there
was
a
way
upgrade
my
players
or
earn
USEFUL
players
I
’d
play
.
It
’s
not
a
hard
concept
to
grasp
.
Nix
the
challenges
(
or
maybe
release
a
few
basic
ones
to
get
you
started
)
and
make
DC
a
mode
that
is
utilized
.
Better
rewards
.
More
coins
per
win/loss
.
Ability
to
win
cards
with
say
100
wins
or
something
along
those
lines
.
And
then
that
card
be
upgraded
every
100
more
wins
or
such
.
We
’re
8
months
into
18
and
the
reward
is
still
an
85
overall
card
.
I
could
be
wrong
but
that
’s
because
I
DONT
PLAY
DC
.
Why
?
Why
play
?
Give
me
a
legitimate
reason
to
play
DC
.
It
could
be
sooo
cool
and
fun
but
nope
.
It
’s
useless
.
You
have
a
gem
here
.
DO
SOMETHING
WITH
IT
!

<hi rend="bold">
SMALL
BUT
HELPFUL
FIXES
</hi>
I
’ll
keep
this
short
because
I
’ve
rambled
enough
.
-
Positional
captions
in
the
team
interface
.
Just
show
me
who
the
freakin
center
is
and
who
the
winger/forward
is
.
Do
n’t
make
me
guess
anymore
.
Simplify
that
shit
.
Cmon
-
For
the
love
of
god
if
I
have
99
Getzlaf
out
there
on
the
PK
or
4
on
4
with
another
forward
who
is
a
LW
or
RW
WHY
ISNT
HE
TAKING
THE
DRAW
?
!
OMFG
that
’s
the
simplest
shit
ever
.
It
’s
almost
disrespectful
to
the
players
that
you
do
that
crap
to
use
.
How
hard
is
it
to
have
the
center
take
the
faceoffs
?
!
?
He
’s
the
center
ffs
!
-
If
I
buy
a
jersey
or
logo
,
under
the
item
options
tab
,
why
the
hell
cant
I
make
it
active
?
Why
do
I
have
to
go
through
all
these
other
menus
and
steps
to
make
the
jersey
my
main
jersey
.
THATS
WHY
I
BOUGHT
IT
!
To
use
it
!
!
-
the
ability
to
deactivate
a
player
from
my
roster
when
I
want
to
sell
him
or
offer
in
a
trade
.
It
’s
just
annoying
to
have
to
go
back
and
take
him
out
of
my
lineup
and
then
go
back
to
the
post
to
AH
screen
or
go
back
and
offer
the
trade
.
It
’s
another
simple
small
thing
that
would
make
our
lives
just
the
slightest
bit
easier
on
this
game
.
I
’m
sure
I
’m
missing
things
but
the
main
points
have
gotten
across
.
The
game
is
salvageable
there
just
need
to
be
some
EFFORT
put
in
.
EA
is
losing
their
hardcore
player
base
and
that
’s
a
problem
.
For
all
of
us
.
No
players
means
no
game
in
the
future
.
I
’m
hopeful
19
turns
out
better
than
18
but
I
guess
only
time
will
tell
.
Any
other
thoughts
?
I
know
EA
is
lurking
👀
(
no
names
but
we
know
you
’re
here
)
