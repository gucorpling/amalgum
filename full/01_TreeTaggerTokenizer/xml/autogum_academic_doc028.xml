Introduction
</head>
<p>
Agriculture
is
one
of
the
largest
water
consumers
on
the
planet
.
In
many
semi-arid
areas
,
dryland
viticulture
is
becoming
increasingly
more
challenging
and
sometimes
is
reconverted
into
irrigated
crops
,
thus
there
is
concern
about
the
water
scarcity
increase
linked
to
climatic
change
.
Intergovernmental
Panel
on
Climate
Change
(
IPCC
)
predicts
an
increase
of
average
temperatures
and
the
frequency
of
extreme
drought
and/or
warm
events
.
So
,
for
most
viticulture
areas
,
improving
the
water
use
efficiency
(
WUE
)
of
the
grape
is
becoming
more
and
more
important
to
secure
the
sustainability
of
vineyards
.
There
are
different
ways
to
improve
grape
WUE
,
and
the
most
immediate
way
is
to
adjust
irrigation
dosage
and
schedule
.
However
,
to
explore
the
genetic
variation
inside
grapevine
varieties
and
clones
,
and
to
identify
the
genetic
material
characterised
by
a
better
WUE
,
is
also
a
promising
way
to
improve
the
vineyard
WUE
.
</p>
<p>
The
WUE
can
be
measured
at
different
spatial
and
temporal
scales
.
From
an
agronomic
approach
,
the
crop
WUE
(
WUEcrop
)
refers
to
the
final
yield
and
total
water
consumed
.
At
the
leaf
level
,
intrinsic
WUE
(
WUEi
)
reflects
the
balance
between
carbon
gain
(
An
)
and
stomatal
conductance
(
gs
)
.
Several
studies
on
grapevines
have
intended
to
link
the
different
scales
and
results
are
sometimes
contradictory
,
showing
good
or
bad
correspondences
.
Fortunately
,
for
the
wine
industry
the
main
concern
is
not
only
to
reach
a
high
productivity
,
but
rather
a
higher
quality
of
grapes
.
Grape
quality
components
are
largely
dependent
on
an
efficient
water
deficit
,
which
can
be
achieved
by
adjusting
irrigation
but
also
the
plant
density
or
pruning
management
,
.
</p>
<p>
In
either
case
,
to
classify
genotypes
’
WUE
,
the
measurements
of
leaf
gas
exchange
have
been
recognised
as
a
useful
tool
because
it
is
feasible
to
screen
a
large
quantity
of
genotypes
grown
under
field
conditions
and
to
characterize
their
behaviour
under
different
water
statuses
.
This
allows
the
revealing
of
a
genetic
variability
of
drought
tolerance
and
WUEi
between
several
vine
cultivars
.
In
the
same
way
,
some
progress
has
also
been
made
by
using
other
techniques
such
as
the
δ13C
.
</p>
<p>
In
our
research
group
,
after
having
identified
differences
in
WUEi
at
the
cultivar
scale
,
and
considering
the
narrow
rules
of
wine
regions
to
introduce
new
varieties
,
the
next
step
has
consisted
of
an
intra-cultivar
variability
evaluation
.
First
,
our
study
showed
such
variability
in
a
Tempranillo
clonal
collection
.
With
respect
to
a
wide
cultivar
collection
,
the
intra-cultivar
variability
was
at
least
80
%
of
the
shown
variability
among
cultivars
.
In
more
recent
work
,
it
has
been
shown
that
an
intra-cultivar
genetic
variability
of
WUEi
exists
among
several
clones
of
the
Tempranillo
cultivar
.
</p>
<p>
It
is
important
to
note
that
there
are
several
ways
to
estimate
the
WUE
of
a
given
genotype
under
realistic
field
conditions
.
Most
of
the
studies
showed
average
gas
exchange
values
under
different
water
conditions
.
As
mentioned
above
,
the
WUEi
,
or
photosynthetic
water
use
efficiency
,
is
obtained
from
the
quotient
between
net
photosynthesis
and
stomatal
conductance
,
(
AN/gs
)
and
is
largely
used
to
qualify
drought
resistance
or
water
scarcity
responses
in
plants
.
However
,
there
is
a
strong
mathematical
influence
of
gs
upon
WUEi
,
because
the
soil
water
depletion
is
followed
by
a
progressive
reduction
in
gs
thus
WUE
is
largely
dependent
on
the
soil
water
availability
for
the
plant
.
This
implies
that
the
comparison
of
the
WUEi
should
be
done
under
a
similar
range
of
gs
.
To
overcome
this
dependency
and
compare
under
the
whole
range
of
gs
samples
,
we
have
used
a
method
proposed
by
Tortosa
et
al.
.
This
consists
of
establishing
a
general
WUEi-gs
relationship
(
log
transformed
for
linearity
)
based
on
the
data
of
all
genotypes
that
,
in
general
,
presents
a
high
correlation
coefficient
.
Then
,
an
average
of
the
residuals
of
each
genotype
(
observed-predicted
value
)
is
calculated
(
and
expressed
in
percentage
)
,
to
rank
the
given
genotype
among
the
rest
.
</p>
<p>
As
part
of
a
wide
program
to
identify
Tempranillo
clones
with
enhanced
WUE
,
the
main
objective
of
the
present
study
was
to
evaluate
whether
,
under
realistic
field
conditions
,
the
previously
observed
clonal
differences
in
WUEi
within
Tempranillo
cultivars
were
affected
by
environmental
complex
variations
such
as
the
“
year
effect
,
”
commonly
reported
for
grapevine
harvest
and
quality
.
