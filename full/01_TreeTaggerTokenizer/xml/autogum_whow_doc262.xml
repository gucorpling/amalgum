Predict
an
Organizational
Crisis
</head>
<p>
An
organizational
crisis
is
a
significant
occurrence
or
event
that
brings
damage
or
harm
to
employees
,
the
public
,
or
other
invested
individuals
or
organizations
.
Examples
of
an
organizational
crisis
include
product
malfunction
and
recall
,
employee
layoffs
,
government
investigations
,
bankruptcy
and
environmental
disasters
.
Predicting
and
addressing
the
signs
of
an
organizational
crisis
are
important
steps
for
minimizing
its
severity
and
long-term
effects
.
Financial
distress
,
product
inadequacies
and
environmental
weaknesses
can
often
be
identified
in
their
early
stages
.
Here
are
ways
to
predict
an
organizational
crisis
.

Steps
</head>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Review
crisis
management
plans
.
If
an
organization
does
not
have
a
crisis
management
plan
in
place
,
the
risks
of
an
organizational
crisis
are
greater
.

Examine
the
planning
and
availability
of
contingency
funds
.
If
an
organization
experiences
unexpected
loss
of
revenue
,
it
will
need
backup
funds
to
meet
organizational
expenses
.
The
absence
of
a
contingency
fund
increases
the
acceleration
of
an
organizational
crisis
.
</item>
<item>
Assess
emergency
plans
.
Determine
if
the
organization
has
addressed
worst
case
scenario
and
established
plans
for
addressing
emergencies
.
For
example
,
if
an
organization
is
responsible
for
protecting
the
public
in
the
event
of
a
natural
disaster
,
examine
its
evacuation
plans
and
public
communication
systems
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Analyze
the
diversification
of
assets
and
income
generation
strategies
.
An
investment
in
only
one
financial
instrument
or
reliance
on
a
sole
product
or
service
for
generating
revenue
can
potentially
lead
to
crisis
in
the
event
of
a
market
crash
or
the
emergence
of
a
strong
market
competitor
.

<item>
Observe
disruptions
in
intra-organizational
processes
.
Taking
longer
to
pay
bills
,
complete
projects
and
deliver
products
or
services
are
potential
signs
of
future
crisis
in
a
generally
smooth
running
organization
.
<figure rend="Predict an Organizational Crisis Step 3.jpg">

</item>
<item>
Examine
conflict
resolution
patterns
and
procedures
.
Situations
in
which
pressing
organizational
conflicts
and
problems
are
continually
glossed
over
,
ignored
or
placed
unresolved
on
the
back
burner
may
be
signs
of
an
organizational
crisis
.
<figure rend="Predict an Organizational Crisis Step 4.jpg">

<list type="unordered">
<item>
Pay
attention
to
intra
organizational
conflicts
.
For
example
,
several
organizational
leaders
may
be
in
conflict
over
an
important
decision
or
situation
.
If
unresolved
issues
result
in
long-term
silence
,
procrastination
,
indecision
and/or
persistent
disagreement
,
the
chances
of
an
organizational
crisis
are
greater
.
</item>
<item>
Evaluate
the
organization
's
relationships
with
other
organizations
and/or
the
public
.
If
the
organization
deals
with
public
grievances
by
ignoring
complaints
,
falsifying
information
or
deflecting
blame
,
these
may
be
signs
of
an
impending
organizational
crisis
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Read
and
listen
to
product
or
process
complaints
from
reliable
sources
.
Evaluate
the
validity
of
the
complaints
.
<figure rend="Predict an Organizational Crisis Step 5.jpg">
</figure>
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Consider
the
complaints
of
employees
within
the
organization
.
Discern
the
expertise
and
reliability
of
the
complaining
individual
or
group
.
For
example
,
concerns
about
a
potential
product
malfunction
are
more
predictive
of
future
organizational
crisis
when
coming
from
a
seasoned
and
credible
product
developer
and
manager
,
rather
than
someone
new
to
the
field
.
</item>
<item>
Determine
whether
public
complaints
are
justified
.
For
example
,
if
the
public
complains
about
potential
harm
caused
by
your
company
's
placement
of
nuclear
power
plants
near
residential
areas
,
consider
both
the
current
and
historical
evidence
about
potential
health
risks
.
