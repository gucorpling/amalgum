The
day
I
unintentionally
declared
war
on
my
MIL
</head>
<sp who="#MILWTF">
<p>
My
husband
and
I
have
been
together
for
5
years
and
married
for
2
.
From
the
beginning
,
he
was
very
excited
to
introduce
me
to
his
'
perfect
'
mom
(
his
words
)
.
Now
,
we
got
together
when
I
was
19
and
I
should
have
immediately
seen
how
he
worshipped
his
mom
as
a
red
flag
.
Now
imagine
my
surprise
,
when
I
walk
into
dinner
and
the
most
opposite
woman
appears
before
me
.
They
are
super
conservative
and
judgemental
.
I
am
,
well
,
not
.
The
dinner
starts
with
her
embracing
my
boyfriend
(
at
the
time
)
for
a
solid
10
seconds
and
does
n't
let
go
until
tears
are
coming
from
her
eyes
stating
that
she
missed
her
baby
so
much
.
She
does
a
nod
at
me
and
asks
him
to
show
me
around
the
house
.
Confused
,
I
asked
him
how
long
has
it
been
since
you
have
seen
her
?
?
He
told
me
one
week
but
she
always
gets
so
upset
when
she
does
n't
have
her
children
constantly
around
(
He
was
22
at
the
time
and
living
in
his
own
house
)
.
Finally
dinner
is
served
,
and
again
to
my
surprise
his
mother
pulls
him
towards
her
and
in
a
sweet
voice
says
,
&quot;
Sit
next
to
me
!
I
am
the
one
that
loves
you
the
most
afterall
!
&quot;
Realizing
that
she
set
my
placement
opposite
of
everybody
else
isolated
from
the
parents
and
my
boyfriend
,
told
him
that
I
would
like
for
him
to
sit
next
to
me
since
we
did
come
here
as
a
couple
.
He
nodded
to
me
said
of
course
and
quickly
gave
me
a
peck
on
the
head
before
sitting
down
beside
me
.
And
that
reddit
,
was
the
day
that
my
MIL
realized
that
her
position
in
his
life
as
number
1
was
in
danger
and
gave
me
hell
for
years
before
all
hell
broke
loose
.
I
will
hopefully
be
writing
more
of
the
stories
leading
her
to
having
full
down
melt
downs
outside
my
house
!
The
thing
that
worked
to
my
advantage
was
my
husband
at
the
time
thought
his
mom
was
PERFECT
.
He
thought
she
was
never
being
malicious
and
would
be
understanding
and
loving
to
a
fault
.
So
he
thought
that
she
would
be
understanding
and
fully
supportive
when
he
chose
me
over
her
.
When
she
was
n't
and
did
n't
it
was
pretty
sad
to
see
her
single
handedly
crumble
the
image
my
husband
had
of
her
.
