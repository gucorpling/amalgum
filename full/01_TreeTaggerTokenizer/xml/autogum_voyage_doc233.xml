Eshowe
</head>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Eshowe
</hi>
is
the
oldest
town
of
British
settlement
in
<ref target="Zululand">
Zululand
</ref>
in
<ref target="South%20Africa">
South
Africa
</ref>
and
is
a
good
base
to
see
the
Zulu
culture
.
The
town
itself
is
enmeshed
with
the
Dlinza
forest
,
one
of
five
remaining
coastal
scarp
forests
in
Kwazulu-Natal
.
</p>
<head>
Understand
</head>
<p>
In
1861
,
Reverend
Hans
Schrueder
of
the
Norwegian
Mission
Society
was
given
permission
by
King
Mpande
to
start
a
mission
station
nearby
.
</p>
<p>
During
the
Anglo-Zulu
War
,
in
1879
,
British
forces
occupied
the
mission
but
the
fort
was
besieged
by
Zulu
forces
for
10
weeks
.
The
Zulu
forces
razed
the
fort
to
the
ground
,
much
as
it
is
today
near
the
town
of
Gezinsila
.
</p>
<p>
Fort
Nongqayi
was
built
by
the
British
in
1883
,
and
the
town
served
as
the
administrative
headquarters
of
Zululand
.
</p>
<p>
The
Eshowe
area
has
been
home
or
base
at
one
time
or
another
to
four
Zulu
kings
:
Shaka
,
Mpande
,
Cetshwayo
,
and
Dinizulu
.
</p>
<p>
Eshowe
is
inland
and
set
on
an
elevation
,
and
is
cooler
than
Durban
in
summer
.
During
the
wet
season
,
it
is
often
misty
,
and
is
reputed
to
have
the
third
highest
rainfall
in
South
Africa
.
South
Africa
has
awarded
Eshowe
its
most
picturesque
town
award
at
least
once
,
to
which
a
drive
through
its
suburbs
will
attest
.
</p>
<p>
While
levels
of
crime
affecting
tourists
is
generally
safe
,
caution
and
sensibility
is
advised
,
especially
for
female
travellers
.
