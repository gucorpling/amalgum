celebration
.

your
happiness

party
</ref>
if
you
have
a
lot
of
mutual
friends

It
might
keep
down
the
costs
for
both
of
you

on
a
budget
.

Schedule
your
celebrations
so
they
do
n't
clash
.
If
you
and
the
other
person
are
both
planing
parties
and
you
are
worried
about
who
will
attend
which
party
,
do
n't
have
your
parties
on
the
same
day
.
If
you
are
friends
,
you
get
to
celebrate
twice
!
One
of
you
can
have
your
party
the
day
or
week
after
,
or
on
the
closest
Friday
or
Saturday
night
if
your
shared
birthday
is
a
week
day
.

Try

not
to
be
jealous
</ref>
about
anything
to
do
with
the
other
person
's
birthday
.
Being
jealous
they
are
older
than
you
,
for
example
,
is
just
silly
!
Understand
that
they
might
get
more
presents
,
more
attention
,
a
bigger
party
,
better
presents
,
a
huge
birthday
cake
or
more
birthday
cards
.
Remember
that
how
much
people
care
about
you
is
n't
shown
by
how
much
you
get
on
your
birthday
.
The
other
person
with
a
lot
of
material
things
,
may
not
have
family
at
home
that
ca
n't
wait
to
celebrate
;
hopefully
,
you
do
!
Their
family
may
be
less
loving
and
try
to
compensate
with
things
,
not
time
,
love
,
attention
and
good
parenting
which
you
will
hopefully
be
enjoying
on
your
birthday
.

If
the
person
you
share
your
birthday
with
makes
a
big
deal
about
their
birthday
,
gently
remind
them
that
it
's
your
birthday
too
.
It
's
not
a
special
and
unique
day
just
for
them
;
you
were
born
on
the
exact
same
day
!

two
are

the

.
They
might
not
even
bother
you
!
Make
sure
to
spend
your
birthday
with
the
people
that
you
care
about
,
and
that
care
about
you
too
.
There
's
no
need
to
fuss
about
someone
else
you
barely
know
having
the
same
date
of
birth
as
you
.
There
are
about
353,000
babies
born
every
day
!
No
one
's
birthday
is
theirs
alone
.

Distance
yourself
as
needed
.
If
you
do
n't
like
the
person
you
share
a
birthday
with
,
try
to
stay
away
with
your
friends
.
If
the
person
tries
bothering
you
,
ignore
them
,
distance
yourself
from
the
situation
,
and
if
necessary
,
try
telling
an
adult
or
supervisor
.
Try
not
to
be
mean
,
but
understand
that
it
's
your
birthday
,
and
you
should
n't
have
to
spend
it
around
people
you
do
n't
like
any
more
than
is
strictly
necessary
.
