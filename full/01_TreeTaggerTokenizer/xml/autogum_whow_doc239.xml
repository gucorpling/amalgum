Buy
Mutual
Funds
for
Children
</head>
<p>
Many
parents
want
to
invest
money
for
their
children
's
futures
that
will
earn
good
interest
.
Mutual
funds
often
earn
a
higher
interest
rate
than
certificates
of
deposit
(
CD
)
or
other
savings
accounts
,
although
they
carry
a
slightly
higher
risk
.
Mutual
funds
are
an
investment
option
where
money
is
pooled
from
different
investors
in
order
to
purchase
securities
.
A
fund
manager
makes
decisions
as
to
how
the
money
is
invested
.
A
diversified
mutual
fund
can
be
a
good
place
to
put
money
for
a
child
's
college
fund
or
nest
egg
.

Decide
the
reason
you
are
investing
the
money
.
For
many
parents
,
they
are
saving
for
college
,
but
for
others
,
it
may
be
for
travel
,
medical
expenses
or
living
expenses
.

Calculate
the
amount
of
time
you
plan
to
invest
the
money
before
your
child
needs
it
.
If
your
child
is
very
young
and
will
not
need
the
money
for
20
years
,
you
will
want
to
choose
different
investments
than
if
the
child
needs
it
in
5
years
.

You
may
be
able
to
choose
a
target-date
mutual
fund
.
These
investment
vehicles
allow
you
to
name
the
year
you
will
need
the
money
.
Only
a
few
dozen
investment
firms
offer
this
,
so
you
will
have
to
look
specifically
for
this
type
of
mutual
fund
.
</item>

Consider
other
types
of
investments
for
children
,
as
well
as
mutual
funds
.
Mutual
funds
often
have
attractive
dividends
;
however
,
other
investments
may
have
tax
advantages
.

If
your
child
is
college-bound
,
you
may
prefer
a
529
college-savings
plan
.
The
interest
from
these
plans
is
not
taxed
by
the
IRS
.
The
options
depend
upon
the
state
you
live
in
,
because
some
states
allow
you
to
choose
a
prepaid
plan
where
you
can
buy
tuition
credits
with
today
's
rates
.
All
states
give
a
second
option
,
the
savings
529
plan
.
These
plans
usually
rely
on
mutual
funds
.

If
your
child
is
already
working
,
they
can
start
saving
for
retirement
with
a
Roth
IRA
.
They
can
make
contributions
to
the
IRA
depending
upon
the
money
they
earn
.
This
money
must
be
used
for
retirement
if
you
want
to
get
the
tax
benefits
.
There
are
penalties
for
early
withdrawal
.

Set
up
a
custodial
account
for
your
child
.
Since
a
child
cannot
open
an
investment
account
on
their
own
until
they
are
18
,
you
will
need
to
open
it
with
both
your
names
on
the
account
.
You
may
choose
to
do
this
at
your
own
investment
firm
,
in
order
to
have
ease
of
use
and
an
investment
broker
you
trust
.

Choose
an
investment
company
and
broker
with
a
long
track
record
.
This
money
may
be
in
the
mutual
fund
for
a
long
period
of
time
,
so
you
should
be
sure
that
the
company
has
a
long
term
plan
with
excellent
management
.
Spend
plenty
of
time
researching
investment
companies
in
your
area
,
and
you
may
see
the
benefit
with
your
own
investments
as
well
.

Look
for
mutual
funds
with
low
expenses
.
Each
investor
in
a
mutual
fund
pays
a
fee
to
take
part
in
the
investment
.
If
these
fees
are
large
,
they
can
add
up
over
a
long
period
of
time
,
so
compare
using
this
metric
as
well
as
its
past
history
.

Choose
a
highly-diversified
mutual
fund
.
Diversified
mutual
funds
carry
less
risk
,
because
they
put
money
in
many
different
types
of
securities
.
If
1
type
of
security
falls
,
another
is
likely
to
compensate
.

Choose
mutual
funds
that
do
n't
need
to
be
watched
constantly
.
Diversified
mutual
funds
are
secure
enough
to
allow
a
hands-off
approach
.
Talk
with
your
broker
about
this
aspect
of
different
options
.

Decide
how
much
capital
you
will
start
with
.
Gift
a
lump
sum
to
your
child
for
use
with
this
initial
investment
.
Unless
you
have
decided
upon
a
Roth
IRA
,
you
can
use
this
initial
amount
to
start
the
investment
and
add
money
to
it
in
other
lump
sums
in
the
future
.

Teach
children
about
their
mutual
fund
when
they
are
old
enough
to
understand
.
By

age
10
,
children
can
start
being
put
in
charge
of
their
own
savings
accounts
,
with
supervision
.
