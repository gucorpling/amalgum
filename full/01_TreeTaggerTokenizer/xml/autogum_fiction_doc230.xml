ON
THE
SAND
BAR
</head>
<p>
Owen
Ford
left
Four
Winds
the
next
morning
.
In
the
evening
Anne
went
over
to
see
Leslie
,
but
found
nobody
.
The
house
was
locked
and
there
was
no
light
in
any
window
.
It
looked
like
a
home
left
soulless
.
Leslie
did
not
run
over
on
the
following
day
--
which
Anne
thought
a
bad
sign
.
</p>
<p>
Gilbert
having
occasion
to
go
in
the
evening
to
the
fishing
cove
,
Anne
drove
with
him
to
the
Point
,
intending
to
stay
awhile
with
Captain
Jim
.
But
the
great
light
,
cutting
its
swathes
through
the
fog
of
the
autumn
evening
,
was
in
care
of
Alec
Boyd
and
Captain
Jim
was
away
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
What
will
you
do
?
&quot;
asked
Gilbert
.
&quot;
Come
with
me
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
do
n't
want
to
go
to
the
cove
--
but
I
'll
go
over
the
channel
with
you
,
and
roam
about
on
the
sand
shore
till
you
come
back
.
The
rock
shore
is
too
slippery
and
grim
tonight
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Alone
on
the
sands
of
the
bar
Anne
gave
herself
up
to
the
eerie
charm
of
the
night
.
It
was
warm
for
September
,
and
the
late
afternoon
had
been
very
foggy
;
but
a
full
moon
had
in
part
lessened
the
fog
and
transformed
the
harbor
and
the
gulf
and
the
surrounding
shores
into
a
strange
,
fantastic
,
unreal
world
of
pale
silver
mist
,
through
which
everything
loomed
phantom-like
.
Captain
Josiah
Crawford
's
black
schooner
sailing
down
the
channel
,
laden
with
potatoes
for
Bluenose
ports
,
was
a
spectral
ship
bound
for
a
far
uncharted
land
,
ever
receding
,
never
to
be
reached
.
The
calls
of
unseen
gulls
overhead
were
the
cries
of
the
souls
of
doomed
seamen
.
The
little
curls
of
foam
that
blew
across
the
sand
were
elfin
things
stealing
up
from
the
sea-caves
.
The
big
,
round-shouldered
sand-dunes
were
the
sleeping
giants
of
some
old
northern
tale
.
The
lights
that
glimmered
palely
across
the
harbor
were
the
delusive
beacons
on
some
coast
of
fairyland
.
Anne
pleased
herself
with
a
hundred
fancies
as
she
wandered
through
the
mist
.
It
was
delightful
--
romantic
--
mysterious
to
be
roaming
here
alone
on
this
enchanted
shore
.
</p>
<p>
But
was
she
alone
?
Something
loomed
in
the
mist
before
her
--
took
shape
and
form
--
suddenly
moved
towards
her
across
the
wave-rippled
sand
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Leslie
!
&quot;
exclaimed
Anne
in
amazement
.
&quot;
Whatever
are
you
doing
--
HERE
--
tonight
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
If
it
comes
to
that
,
whatever
are
YOU
doing
here
?
&quot;
said
Leslie
,
trying
to
laugh
.
The
effort
was
a
failure
.
She
looked
very
pale
and
tired
;
but
the
love
locks
under
her
scarlet
cap
were
curling
about
her
face
and
eyes
like
little
sparkling
rings
of
gold
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
'm
waiting
for
Gilbert
--
he
's
over
at
the
Cove
.
I
intended
to
stay
at
the
light
,
but
Captain
Jim
is
away
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Well
,
<hi rend="italic">
I
</hi>
came
here
because
I
wanted
to
walk
--
and
walk
--
and
WALK
,
&quot;
said
Leslie
restlessly
.
&quot;
I
could
n't
on
the
rock
shore
--
the
tide
was
too
high
and
the
rocks
prisoned
me
.
I
had
to
come
here
--
or
I
should
have
gone
mad
,
I
think
.
I
rowed
myself
over
the
channel
in
Captain
Jim
's
flat
.
I
've
been
here
for
an
hour
.
Come
--
come
--
let
us
walk
.
I
ca
n't
stand
still
.
Oh
,
Anne
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Leslie
,
dearest
,
what
is
the
trouble
?
&quot;
asked
Anne
,
though
she
knew
too
well
already
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
ca
n't
tell
you
--
do
n't
ask
me
.
I
would
n't
mind
your
knowing
--
I
wish
you
did
know
--
but
I
ca
n't
tell
you
--
I
ca
n't
tell
anyone
.
I
've
been
such
a
fool
,
Anne
--
and
oh
,
it
hurts
so
terribly
to
be
a
fool
.
There
's
nothing
so
painful
in
the
world
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
She
laughed
bitterly
.
Anne
slipped
her
arm
around
her
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Leslie
,
is
it
that
you
have
learned
to
care
for
Mr.
Ford
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Leslie
turned
herself
about
passionately
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
How
did
you
know
?
&quot;
she
cried
.
&quot;
Anne
,
how
did
you
know
?
Oh
,
is
it
written
in
my
face
for
everyone
to
see
?
Is
it
as
plain
as
that
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
No
,
no
.
I
--
I
ca
n't
tell
you
how
I
knew
.
It
just
came
into
my
mind
,
somehow
.
Leslie
,
do
n't
look
at
me
like
that
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Do
you
despise
me
?
&quot;
demanded
Leslie
in
a
fierce
,
low
tone
.
&quot;
Do
you
think
I
'm
wicked
--
unwomanly
?
Or
do
you
think
I
'm
just
plain
fool
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
do
n't
think
you
any
of
those
things
.
Come
,
dear
,
let
's
just
talk
it
over
sensibly
,
as
we
might
talk
over
any
other
of
the
great
crises
of
life
.
You
've
been
brooding
over
it
and
let
yourself
drift
into
a
morbid
view
of
it
.
You
know
you
have
a
little
tendency
to
do
that
about
everything
that
goes
wrong
,
and
you
promised
me
that
you
would
fight
against
it
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
But
--
oh
,
it
's
so
--
so
shameful
,
&quot;
murmured
Leslie
.
&quot;
To
love
him
--
unsought
--
and
when
I
'm
not
free
to
love
anybody
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
There
's
nothing
shameful
about
it
.
But
I
'm
very
sorry
that
you
have
learned
to
care
for
Owen
,
because
,
as
things
are
,
it
will
only
make
you
more
unhappy
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
did
n't
LEARN
to
care
,
&quot;
said
Leslie
,
walking
on
and
speaking
passionately
.
&quot;
If
it
had
been
like
that
I
could
have
prevented
it
.
I
never
dreamed
of
such
a
thing
until
that
day
,
a
week
ago
,
when
he
told
me
he
had
finished
his
book
and
must
soon
go
away
.
Then
--
then
I
knew
.
I
felt
as
if
someone
had
struck
me
a
terrible
blow
.
I
did
n't
say
anything
--
I
could
n't
speak
--
but
I
do
n't
know
what
I
looked
like
.
I
'm
so
afraid
my
face
betrayed
me
.
Oh
,
I
would
die
of
shame
if
I
thought
he
knew
--
or
suspected
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Anne
was
miserably
silent
,
hampered
by
her
deductions
from
her
conversation
with
Owen
.
Leslie
went
on
feverishly
,
as
if
she
found
relief
in
speech
.
