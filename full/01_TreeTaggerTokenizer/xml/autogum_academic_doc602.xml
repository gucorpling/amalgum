<p>
One
of
our
primary
objectives
was
to
evaluate
the
effectiveness
of
ORV
as
a
wildlife
rabies
management
strategy
in
northeastern
U.S.
Raccoon
RABV
occupancy
declined
(
corresponding
to
case
reduction
)
over
time
in
areas
within
ORV
management
zones
more
substantially
than
in
raccoon
RABV
enzootic
areas
without
management
.
However
,
occupancy
in
the
raccoon
RABV
enzootic
areas
also
declined
during
our
twelve-year
study
period
.
This
may
suggest
a
natural
waning
of
raccoon
RABV
circulation
in
the
raccoon
populations
of
northeastern
U.S.
in
recent
years
or
a
post-epizootic
rebound
effect
(
lower
susceptible
populations
)
.
It
could
also
possibly
be
an
added
benefit
of
nearby
intensive
ORV
management
.
Raccoons
exposed
to
vaccination
baits
within
management
areas
may
migrate
and
intermix
with
populations
not
being
actively
managed
.
These
individuals
may
be
helping
to
reduce
the
transmission
of
raccoon
RABV
even
in
the
absence
of
direct
management
.
</p>
<p>
Considerable
effort
and
research
have
been
applied
to
developing
strategies
to
manage
raccoon
RABV
.
Previous
studies
have
suggested
that
both
the
duration
of
baiting
and
the
bait
density
influence
the
seroprevalence
in
raccoons
.
Our
results
support
the
importance
of
these
vaccination
strategies
.
Additionally
,
we
found
support
for
differences
in
RABV
occupancy
based
on
the
type
of
oral
rabies
vaccine
distributed
in
our
study
area
.
Consistent
with
comparative
studies
based
on
serology
,
we
found
that
ONRAB
outperformed
V-RG
in
reducing
RABV
occupancy
(
reducing
RABV
occupancy
after
one
year
of
baiting
in
an
unbaited
area
by
0.12
for
ONRAB
compared
to
0.07
for
V-RG
)
.
The
study
area
was
baited
with
V-RG
exclusively
for
over
a
decade
before
ONRAB
was
applied
.
Furthermore
,
as
we
have
determined
,
the
baiting
history
in
an
area
and
the
bait
density
are
also
important
indicators
of
RABV
occurrence
.
However
,
even
when
we
look
at
areas
with
similar
baiting
histories
and
bait
densities
,
we
did
find
that
areas
treated
with
ONRAB
had
lower
occupancy
than
areas
treated
with
V-RG
.
</p>
<p>
Serology
studies
on
raccoons
have
shown
variability
in
seroprevalence
responses
to
baiting
strategies
even
when
using
similar
vaccine
bait
types
and
similar
bait
densities
,
suggesting
that
other
factors
may
influence
the
effectiveness
of
baiting
strategies
.
Potential
complicating
factors
may
include
significant
variation
in
raccoon
densities
,
variation
in
opportunities
for
target
species
to
encounter
vaccine
bait
by
habitat
type
,
and
the
potential
for
bait
competition
by
non-target
species
.
These
variations
in
seroconversion
response
may
help
explain
the
variability
in
occupancy
we
observed
.
For
example
,
we
found
higher
RABV
occupancy
in
areas
with
increased
medium
and
high-density
developed
habitats
.
These
higher
occupancy
rates
might
relate
to
higher
densities
of
raccoons
associated
with
urban
areas
,
despite
rates
of
bait
application
that
are
approximately
doubled
in
urban
areas
compared
to
rural
areas
.
Based
on
the
results
of
our
study
,
the
additional
optimization
of
baiting
strategies
in
suburban
and
urban
areas
appears
warranted
.
</p>
<p>
In
addition
to
ORV
management
,
from
2007
to
2012
several
intensive
TVR
management
actions
were
conducted
within
our
study
area
.
TVR
efforts
have
been
shown
to
be
effective
in
helping
to
reduce
RABV
cases
.
Due
to
the
intense
effort
associated
with
TVR
programs
,
they
are
usually
localized
and
conducted
over
short
periods
of
time
and
thus
TVR
is
often
used
in
conjunction
with
other
approaches
(
e.
g.
,
population
reduction
or
ORV
)
to
help
have
a
broader
impact
.
TVR
programs
in
our
study
area
were
conducted
primarily
along
the
U.S.
–
Canada
border
in
Vermont
,
along
the
Vermont
–
New
York
and
Vermont
–
New
Hampshire
borders
,
and
along
the
St.
Lawrence
River
in
New
York
.
We
found
a
strong
impact
of
TVR
programs
on
RABV
occupancy
,
with
larger
numbers
of
raccoons
vaccinated
corresponding
to
lower
RABV
occupancy
rates
.
These
impacts
were
pronounced
even
though
the
majority
of
TVR
activities
occurred
within
active
ORV
management
zones
.
This
supports
the
idea
that
combined
approaches
can
be
more
effective
at
reducing
RABV
cases
.
</p>
<p>
Our
study
identifies
areas
with
high
probabilities
of
RABV
occupancy
which
may
indicate
potential
risk
corridors
for
raccoon
RABV
transmission
north
into
Canada
.
Using
the
spatial
and
temporal
patterns
we
observed
in
raccoon
RABV
occurrence
(
our
first
two
objectives
)
,
we
identified
two
potential
risk
corridors
,
one
in
northern
Franklin
County
,
NY
,
and
one
on
the
New
York
–
Vermont
border
in
Grand
Isle
County
,
Vermont
.
These
are
paths
from
the
enzootic
area
that
are
in
the
ORV
management
area
and
have
higher
RABV
occupancy
.
The
area
in
Franklin
County
,
New
York
,
had
a
brief
outbreak
of
RABV
in
the
spring
of
2015
,
but
has
not
been
intensively
sampled
since
then
and
thus
remains
an
area
of
concern
.
The
higher
risk
is
related
both
to
the
previous
history
in
the
area
and
to
the
lack
of
sufficient
sampling
to
be
confident
of
RABV
elimination
.
The
risk
corridor
along
the
New
York
–
Vermont
border
is
an
area
of
low
elevation
and
low
elevation
areas
generally
are
associated
with
higher
raccoon
densities
and
RABV
occupancy
.
Raccoon
densities
have
been
reported
to
be
lower
in
areas
with
high
elevation
.
If
RABV
transmission
and
spread
is
principally
influenced
by
raccoon
density
,
this
may
relate
to
the
higher
risk
in
this
area
.
