CHAPTER
VI
.
RED
KERRY
</head>
<p>
Chief
Inspector
Kerry
,
of
the
Criminal
Investigation
Department
,
stood
before
the
empty
grate
of
his
cheerless
office
in
New
Scotland
Yard
,
one
hand
thrust
into
the
pocket
of
his
blue
reefer
jacket
and
the
other
twirling
a
malacca
cane
,
which
was
heavily
silver-mounted
and
which
must
have
excited
the
envy
of
every
sergeant-major
beholding
it
.
Chief
Inspector
Kerry
wore
a
very
narrow-brimmed
bowler
hat
,
having
two
ventilation
holes
conspicuously
placed
immediately
above
the
band
.
He
wore
this
hat
tilted
forward
and
to
the
right
.
</p>
<p>
“
Red
Kerry
”
wholly
merited
his
sobriquet
,
for
the
man
was
as
red
as
fire
.
His
hair
,
which
he
wore
cropped
close
as
a
pugilist
's
,
was
brilliantly
red
,
and
so
was
his
short
,
wiry
,
aggressive
moustache
.
His
complexion
was
red
,
and
from
beneath
his
straight
red
eyebrows
he
surveyed
the
world
with
a
pair
of
unblinking
,
intolerant
steel-blue
eyes
.
He
never
smoked
in
public
,
as
his
taste
inclined
towards
Irish
twist
and
a
short
clay
pipe
;
but
he
was
addicted
to
the
use
of
chewing-gum
,
and
as
he
chewed
--
and
he
chewed
incessantly
--
he
revealed
a
perfect
row
of
large
,
white
,
and
positively
savage-looking
teeth
.
High
cheek
bones
and
prominent
maxillary
muscles
enhanced
the
truculence
indicated
by
his
chin
.
</p>
<p>
But
,
next
to
this
truculence
,
which
was
the
first
and
most
alarming
trait
to
intrude
itself
upon
the
observer
's
attention
,
the
outstanding
characteristic
of
Chief
Inspector
Kerry
was
his
compact
neatness
.
Of
no
more
than
medium
height
but
with
shoulders
like
an
acrobat
,
he
had
slim
,
straight
legs
and
the
feet
of
a
dancing
master
.
His
attire
,
from
the
square-pointed
collar
down
to
the
neat
black
brogues
,
was
spotless
.
His
reefer
jacket
fitted
him
faultlessly
,
but
his
trousers
were
cut
so
unfashionably
narrow
that
the
protuberant
thigh
muscles
and
the
line
of
a
highly
developed
calf
could
quite
easily
be
discerned
.
The
hand
twirling
the
cane
was
small
but
also
muscular
,
freckled
and
covered
with
light
down
.
Red
Kerry
was
built
on
the
lines
of
a
whippet
,
but
carried
the
equipment
of
an
Irish
terrier
.
</p>
<p>
The
telephone
bell
rang
.
Inspector
Kerry
moved
his
square
shoulders
in
a
manner
oddly
suggestive
of
a
wrestler
,
laid
the
malacca
cane
on
the
mantleshelf
,
and
crossed
to
the
table
.
Taking
up
the
telephone
:
</p>
<p>
“
Yes
?
”
he
said
,
and
his
voice
was
high-pitched
and
imperious
.
</p>
<p>
He
listened
for
a
moment
.
</p>
<p>
“
Very
good
,
sir
.
”
</p>
<p>
He
replaced
the
receiver
,
took
up
a
wet
oilskin
overall
from
the
back
of
a
chair
and
the
cane
from
the
mantleshelf
.
Then
rolling
chewing-gum
from
one
corner
of
his
mouth
into
the
other
,
he
snapped
off
the
electric
light
and
walked
from
the
room
.
</p>
<p>
Along
the
corridor
he
went
with
a
lithe
,
silent
step
,
moving
from
the
hips
and
swinging
his
shoulders
.
Before
a
door
marked
“
Private
”
he
paused
.
From
his
waistcoat
pocket
he
took
a
little
silver
convex
mirror
and
surveyed
himself
critically
therein
.
He
adjusted
his
neat
tie
,
replaced
the
mirror
,
knocked
at
the
door
and
entered
the
room
of
the
Assistant
Commissioner
.
</p>
<p>
This
important
official
was
a
man
constructed
on
huge
principles
,
a
man
of
military
bearing
,
having
tired
eyes
and
a
bewildered
manner
.
He
conveyed
the
impression
that
the
collection
of
documents
,
books
,
telephones
,
and
other
paraphernalia
bestrewing
his
table
had
reduced
him
to
a
state
of
stupor
.
He
looked
up
wearily
and
met
the
fierce
gaze
of
the
chief
inspector
with
a
glance
almost
apologetic
.
</p>
<p>
“
Ah
,
Chief
Inspector
Kerry
?
”
he
said
,
with
vague
surprise
.
“
Yes
.
I
told
you
to
come
.
Really
,
I
ought
to
have
been
at
home
hours
ago
.
It
's
most
unfortunate
.
I
have
to
do
the
work
of
three
men
.
This
is
your
department
,
is
it
not
,
Chief
Inspector
?
”
</p>
<p>
He
handed
Kerry
a
slip
of
paper
,
at
which
the
Chief
Inspector
stared
fiercely
.
</p>
<p>
“
Murder
!
”
rapped
Kerry
.
“
Sir
Lucien
Pyne
.
Yes
,
sir
,
I
am
still
on
duty
.
”
</p>
<p>
His
speech
,
in
moments
of
interest
,
must
have
suggested
to
one
overhearing
him
from
an
adjoining
room
,
for
instance
,
the
operation
of
a
telegraphic
instrument
.
He
gave
to
every
syllable
the
value
of
a
rap
and
certain
words
he
terminated
with
an
audible
snap
of
his
teeth
.
</p>
<p>
“
Ah
,
”
murmured
the
Assistant
Commissioner
.
“
Yes
.
Divisional
Inspector
--
Somebody
(
I
cannot
read
the
name
)
has
detained
all
the
parties
.
But
you
had
better
report
at
Vine
Street
.
It
appears
to
be
a
big
case
.
”
</p>
<p>
He
sighed
wearily
.
</p>
<p>
“
Very
good
,
sir
.
With
your
permission
I
will
glance
at
Sir
Lucien
's
pedigree
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Certainly
--
certainly
,
”
said
the
Assistant
Commissioner
,
waving
one
large
hand
in
the
direction
of
a
bookshelf
.
</p>
<p>
Kerry
crossed
the
room
,
laid
his
oilskin
and
cane
upon
a
chair
,
and
from
the
shelf
where
it
reposed
took
a
squat
volume
.
The
Assistant
Commissioner
,
hand
pressed
to
brow
,
began
to
study
a
document
which
lay
before
him
.
</p>
<p>
“
Here
we
are
,
”
said
Kerry
,
sotto
voce
.
“

Lucien

Aubyn

”
</p>
<p>
He
returned
the
book
to
its
place
,
took
up
his
overall
and
cane
,
and
:
</p>
<p>
“
Very
good
,
sir
,
”
he
said
.
“
I
will
proceed
to
Vine
Street
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Certainly
--
certainly
,
”
murmured
the
Assistant
Commissioner
,
glancing
up
absently
.
“
Good
night
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Good
night
,
sir
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Oh
,
Chief
Inspector
!
”
</p>
<p>
Kerry
turned
,
his
hand
on
the
door-knob
.
</p>
<p>
“
Sir
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
--
er
--
what
was
I
going
to
say
?
Oh
,
yes
!
The
social
importance
of
the
murdered
man
raises
the
case
from
the
--
er
--
you
follow
me
?
Public
interest
will
become
acute
,
no
doubt
.
I
have
therefore
selected
you
for
your
well
known
discretion
.
I
met
Sir
Lucien
once
.
Very
sad
.
Good
night
.
