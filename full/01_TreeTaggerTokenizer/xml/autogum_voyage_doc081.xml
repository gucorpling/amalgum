<hi rend="bold">
Saransk
</hi>
is
the
capital
city
of
the
<ref target="Mordovia">
Republic
of
Mordovia
</ref>
,
its
financial
and
economic
center
.
It
is
located
on
the
river
Insar
,
about
southeast
of
<ref target="Moscow">
Moscow
</ref>
.

<p>
Saransk
was
founded
as
a
fortress
in
1641
.
It
was
part
of
a
chain
of
fortifications
,
created
by
Grand
Duchy
of
Moscow
and
later
the
Tsardom
of
Russia
,
to
protect
it
from
the
raids
of
the
Crimean
Tatars
.
The
fortress
was
far
away
from
the
main
trade
routes
,
so
it
could
not
become
a
major
economic
center
and
until
the
1930s
it
was
largely
comprised
of
wooden
one-story
houses
.
It
was
appointed
as
the
capital
of
the
Mordovia
in
1934
which
imposed
grand
urban
redevelopment
;
the
old
center
was
almost
entirely
demolished
and
replaced
by
Stalin-era
architecture
.
The
center
was
then
again
modernised
between
2000
and
2010
;
some
houses
were
restored
using
modern
materials
and
some
were
demolished
and
replaced
by
modern
harmonious
buildings
.
In
2018
Saransk
will
host
World
Cup
football
matches
and
at
least
the
city
center
will
not
lose
face
in
front
of
guests
.
</p>
<p>
There
are
no
architectural
ensembles
in
the
center
of
Saransk
.
Overall
,
the
old
architecture
is
quite
sparse
and
is
not
a
first-class
one
.
In
this
regard
the
city
does
n't
differ
a
lot
from
other
cities
in
central
Russia
.
Also
you
wo
n’t
hear
any
national
languages
other
than
Russian
spoken
here
unless
you
make
some
special
efforts
.
</p>
<p>
There
are
two
main
tourist
sites
which
make
Saransk
worth
visiting
:
a
museum
of
fine
arts
with
a
large
collection
of
sculptures
created
by
Stephen
Erzi
and
18th
century
Makarov
Monastery
-
one
of
the
most
spectacular
ensembles
of
the
Middle
Volga
region
.
Additionally
,
there
is
a
good
museum
of
Mordovian
national
culture
and
some
modern
architecture
partly
stylised
as
a
national
one
.

and

taking
you
to
Saransk
.
The
trains
between
Moscow
and
Saransk
take
around
10
hours
40
mins
to
cover
the
route
.
Saransk
has
a
small
airport
too
and
a
flight
from
the
Russian
capital
takes
just
about
an
hour
.
