Introduction
</head>
<p>
With
aging
,
gait
seems
no
longer
automated
and
walking
becomes
cognitively
demanding
.
This
is
particularly
evident
when
older
individuals
perform
a
concomitant
cognitive
task
while
walking
,
as
indicated
by
the
larger
decrement
in
gait
performance
from
single-task
(
ST
)
to
dual-task
(
DT
)
conditions
compared
to
younger
adults
.
Furthermore
,
the
performance
decrement
from
ST
to
DT
is
proportional
to
the
extent
to
which
DT
walking
is
perceived
as
stressful
.
In
turn
,
acute
stress
seems
detrimental
to
the
ability
to
shield
performance
of
a
primary
task
when
a
secondary
one
must
be
performed
concurrently
.
This
is
attributed
to
reduced
efficiency
of
the
cognitive
control
mechanisms
responsible
for
resource
allocation
needed
for
successful
DT
performance
.
Indeed
,
these
mechanisms
rely
on
frontal-dependent
cognition
—
the
executive
control
network
—
some
of
which
functions
,
as
working
memory
is
impaired
by
stress
.
</p>
<p>
There
is
a
range
of
subjective
and
objective
approaches
and
tools
to
assess
stress-related
responses
,
resource
allocation
and
effort
in
coping
with
physically
and/or
mentally
challenging
tasks
.
Subjective
indexes
of
the
perceptual
and
cognitive
responsiveness
to
task
performance
,
such
as
the
rating
of
perceived
exertion
(
RPE
)
,
may
complement
physiological
measures
for
a
comprehensive
understanding
of
the
responses
to
physical-cognitive
DT
performance
.
</p>
<p>
Among
objective
and
non-invasive
measurement
,
saliva
sampling
provides
biomarkers
relying
on
the
two
main
systems
that
jointly
contribute
to
psycho-physiologic
stress
responses
:
cortisol
and
α-amylase
.
Cortisol
is
secreted
from
the
adrenal
cortex
via
the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
axis
,
whereas
α-amylase
is
secreted
by
the
parotid
gland
in
response
to
adrenergic
activity
.
</p>
<p>
Salivary
α-amylase
(
sAA
)
seems
a
more
sensitive
and
generalizable
stress
response
marker
than
cortisol
,
as
it
reacts
more
pronouncedly
and
rapidly
to
different
types
of
stressors
and
returns
to
baseline
levels
immediately
after
the
end
of
the
stress
bout
without
the
carry-over
effect
observed
for
cortisol
.
Thus
,
sAA
has
been
increasingly
used
as
a
valid
biomarker
of
autonomic
stress
response
within
the
sympathetic
adrenomedullary
system
.
Its
stress
responsiveness
has
been
proven
in
different
age
groups
throughout
the
lifespan
including
older
adulthood
.
Aging
tends
to
heighten
the
sympathetic
tone
,
as
revealed
by
a
higher
sAA
global
output
than
in
younger
adults
,
without
attenuating
the
autonomic
response
to
stress
,
as
revealed
by
similar
stress-related
increases
of
sAA
in
younger
and
older
adults
.
</p>
<p>
Studies
of
sAA
response
to
physical
stressors
have
mainly
investigated
the
impact
of
physical
exercise
bouts
of
long
duration
(
&gt;20
min
)
and
moderate-to-high
intensity
(
&gt;50
%
maximal
oxygen
consumption
)
,
showing
that
they
acutely
elevate
sAA
.
Instead
,
the
few
studies
on
physically
low
demanding
exercise
(
e.
g.
,
light
self-paced
walk
)
did
not
show
any
significant
increase
in
sAA
concentration
.
</p>
<p>
On
the
other
hand
,
sAA
response
to
physical
exercise
tasks
has
been
rarely
studied
in
relation
to
task
difficulty
and
task-related
cognitive
challenges
under
ST
and
DT
conditions
.
This
is
surprising
,
since
there
are
neural
commonalities
between
cognitive
control
in
dual-tasking
and
biological
acute
stress
responses
,
which
become
particularly
relevant
in
aging
.
The
cognitive
control
processes
responsible
for
DT
performance
and
task
prioritization
have
been
located
in
the
prefrontal
cortex
.
Prefrontal
neurons
,
and
particularly
those
engaged
in
working
memory
,
are
influenced
by
the
activation
of
the
two
main
stress
axes
responsible
for
an
increased
release
of
catecholamine
and
cortisol
.
This
is
relevant
to
the
present
study
,
because
working
memory
seems
more
relevant
to
gait
efficiency
and
resource
allocation
during
DT
walking
in
aging
than
the
other
core
components
of
prefrontal-dependent
cognition
.
</p>
<p>
Moreover
,
there
is
evidence
that
habitual
physical
activity
and/or
fitness
may
positively
influence
the
ability
to
cope
with
dual-tasking
.
Habitually
highly
active
and
fit
individuals
also
show
,
in
the
majority
of
studies
,
reduced
physiologic
stress
responses
.
This
is
consistent
with
the
hypothesis
that
regular
physical
activity
may
lead
to
physiological
adaptations
that
buffer
the
effects
of
stressors
in
physical
and
non-physical
domains
(
the
cross-stressor
adaptation
hypothesis
)
.
However
,
the
most
used
bio-physiological
indicators
of
stress
response
were
cortisol
concentration
or
cardiovascular
parameters
of
autonomic
activity
.
The
evidence
on
sAA
is
inconsistent
and
limited
to
young
and
middle-aged
individuals
’
responses
to
social-evaluative
stressors
.
A
recent
study
failed
to
find
moderation
of
the
acute
sAA
response
to
stressors
by
habitual
physical
activity
levels
.
</p>
<p>
Thus
,
in
consideration
of
the
above
lack
or
inconsistency
of
evidence
,
the
aim
of
the
present
study
was
twofold
.
The
first
aim
was
to
investigate
how
aging
individuals
cope
with
locomotor-cognitive
dual-tasking
by
analyzing
complementary
information
on
their
autonomic
response
to
DT
performance
and
cognitive
effort
.
Given
the
relevance
of
working
memory
for
gait
performance
of
older
individuals
,
it
was
hypothesized
that
a
working
memory
task
would
compete
for
shared
resources
with
the
walking
task
.
We
expected
a
higher
objective
response
and
subjective
effort
perception
to
the
locomotor-cognitive
DT
as
compared
to
the
locomotor
or
cognitive
task
performed
in
isolation
.
Most
aging
research
on
locomotor-cognitive
dual-tasking
included
participants
aged
above
60
years
with
comparison
groups
mostly
aged
below
40
,
whereas
middle
age
is
relatively
understudied
.
To
extend
the
evidence
base
to
the
transition
to
older
adulthood
,
we
included
both
late
middle-aged
and
older
adults
.
