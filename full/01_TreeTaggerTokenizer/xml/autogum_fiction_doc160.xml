CHAPTER
VI
.
MADAME
LA
VICOMTESSE
</head>
<p>
Hesitating
on
the
step
,
a
lady
stood
in
the
vine-covered
doorway
,
a
study
in
black
and
white
in
a
frame
of
pink
roses
.
The
sash
at
her
waist
,
the
lace
mantilla
that
clung
about
her
throat
,
the
deftly
coiled
hair
with
its
sheen
of
the
night
waters
--
these
in
black
.
The
simple
gown
--
a
tribute
to
the
art
of
her
countrywomen
--
in
white
.
</p>
<p>
Mrs.
Temple
had
gone
forward
to
meet
her
,
but
I
stood
staring
,
marvelling
,
forgetful
,
in
the
path
.
They
were
talking
,
they
were
coming
towards
me
,
and
I
heard
Mrs.
Temple
pronounce
my
name
and
hers
--
Madame
de
Montméry
.
I
bowed
,
she
courtesied
.
There
was
a
baffling
light
in
the
lady
’s
brown
eyes
when
I
dared
to
glance
at
them
,
and
a
smile
playing
around
her
mouth
.
Was
there
no
word
in
the
two
languages
to
find
its
way
to
my
lips
?
Mrs.
Temple
laid
her
hand
on
my
arm
.
</p>
<p>
“
David
is
not
what
one
might
call
a
ladies
’
man
,
Madame
,
”
she
said
.
</p>
<p>
The
lady
laughed
.
</p>
<p>
“
Is
n’t
he
?
”
she
said
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
am
sure
you
will
frighten
him
with
your
wit
,
”
answered
Mrs.
Temple
,
smiling
.
“
He
is
worth
sparing
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
He
is
worth
frightening
,
then
,
”
said
the
lady
,
in
exquisite
English
,
and
she
looked
at
me
again
.
</p>
<p>
“
You
and
David
should
like
each
other
,
”
said
Mrs.
Temple
;
“
you
are
both
capable
persons
,
friends
of
the
friendless
and
towers
of
strength
to
the
weak
.
”
</p>
<p>
The
lady
’s
face
became
serious
,
but
still
there
was
the
expression
I
could
not
make
out
.
In
an
instant
she
seemed
to
have
scrutinized
me
with
a
precision
from
which
there
could
be
no
appeal
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
seem
to
know
Mr.
Ritchie
,
”
she
said
,
and
added
quickly
:
“
Mrs.
Clive
has
talked
a
great
deal
about
you
.
She
has
made
you
out
a
very
wonderful
person
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
My
dear
,
”
said
Mrs.
Temple
,
“
the
wonderful
people
of
this
world
are
those
who
find
time
to
comfort
and
help
the
unfortunate
.
That
is
why
you
and
David
are
wonderful
.
No
one
knows
better
than
I
how
easy
it
is
to
be
selfish
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
have
brought
you
an
English
novel
,
”
said
Madame
de
Montoméry
,
turning
abruptly
to
Mrs.
Temple
.
“
But
you
must
not
read
it
at
night
.
Lindy
is
not
to
let
you
have
it
until
to-morrow
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
There
,
”
said
Mrs.
Temple
,
gayly
,
to
me
,
“
Madame
is
not
happy
unless
she
is
controlling
some
one
,
and
I
am
a
rebellious
subject
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
You
have
not
been
taking
care
of
yourself
,
”
said
Madame
.
She
glanced
at
me
,
and
bit
her
lips
,
as
though
guessing
the
emotion
which
my
visit
had
caused
.
“
Listen
,
”
she
said
,
“
the
vesper
bells
!
You
must
go
into
the
house
,
and
Mr.
Ritchie
and
I
must
leave
you
.
”
</p>
<p>
She
took
Mrs.
Temple
by
the
arm
and
led
her
,
unresisting
,
along
the
path
.
I
followed
,
a
thousand
thoughts
and
conjectures
spinning
in
my
brain
.
They
reached
the
bench
under
the
little
tree
beside
the
door
,
and
stood
talking
for
a
moment
of
the
routine
of
Mrs.
Temple
’s
life
.
Madame
,
it
seemed
,
had
prescribed
a
regimen
,
and
meant
to
have
it
followed
.
Suddenly
I
saw
Mrs.
Temple
take
the
lady
’s
arm
,
and
sink
down
upon
the
bench
.
Then
we
were
both
beside
her
,
bending
over
her
,
she
sitting
upright
and
smiling
at
us
.
</p>
<p>
“
It
is
nothing
,
”
she
said
;
“
I
am
so
easily
tired
.
”
</p>
<p>
Her
lips
were
ashen
,
and
her
breath
came
quickly
.
Madame
acted
with
that
instant
promptness
which
I
expected
of
her
.
</p>
<p>
“
You
must
carry
her
in
,
Mr.
Ritchie
,
”
she
said
quietly
.
</p>
<p>
“
No
,
it
is
only
momentary
,
David
,
”
said
Mrs.
Temple
.
I
remember
how
pitifully
frail
and
light
she
was
as
I
picked
her
up
and
followed
Madame
through
the
doorway
into
the
little
bedroom
.
I
laid
Mrs.
Temple
on
the
bed
.
</p>
<p>
“
Send
Lindy
here
,
”
said
Madame
.
</p>
<p>
Lindy
was
in
the
front
room
with
the
negress
whom
Madame
had
brought
with
her
.
They
were
not
talking
.
I
supposed
then
this
was
because
Lindy
did
not
speak
French
.
I
did
not
know
that
Madame
de
Montméry
’s
maid
was
a
mute
.
Both
of
them
went
into
the
bedroom
,
and
I
was
left
alone
.
The
door
and
windows
were
closed
,
and
a
green
myrtle-berry
candle
was
burning
on
the
table
.
I
looked
about
me
with
astonishment
.
But
for
the
low
ceiling
and
the
wide
cypress
puncheons
of
the
floor
the
room
might
have
been
a
budoir
in
a
manor-house
.
On
the
slender-legged
,
polished
mahogany
table
lay
books
in
tasteful
bindings
;
a
diamond-paned
bookcase
stood
in
the
corner
;
a
fauteuil
and
various
other
chairs
which
might
have
come
from
the
hands
of
an
Adam
were
ranged
about
.
Tall
silver
candlesticks
graced
each
end
of
the
little
mantel-shelf
,
and
between
them
were
two
Lowestoft
vases
having
the
Temple
coat
of
arms
.
</p>
<p>
It
might
have
been
half
an
hour
that
I
waited
,
now
pacing
the
floor
,
now
throwing
myself
into
the
arm-chair
by
the
fireplace
.
Anxiety
for
Mrs.
Temple
,
problems
that
lost
themselves
in
a
dozen
conjectures
,
all
idle
--
these
agitated
me
almost
beyond
my
power
of
self-control
.
Once
I
felt
for
the
miniature
,
took
it
out
,
and
put
it
back
without
looking
at
it
.
At
last
I
was
startled
to
my
feet
by
the
opening
of
the
door
,
and
Madame
de
Montméry
came
in
.
She
closed
the
door
softly
behind
her
,
with
the
deft
quickness
and
decision
of
movement
which
a
sixth
sense
had
told
me
she
possessed
,
crossed
the
room
swiftly
,
and
stood
confronting
me
.
