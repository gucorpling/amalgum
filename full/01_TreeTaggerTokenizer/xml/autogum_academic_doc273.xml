In
this
paper
,
we
consider
a
multi-class
classification
problem
with
a
training
dataset
,
where
<hi rend="italic">
K
</hi>
is
the
number
of
classes
and
is
the
number
of
the
samples
of
the
<hi rend="italic">
k
</hi>
-th
class
.
The
size
of
training
dataset
is
.
Denote
,
for
convenience
,
by
the
sets
of

of

<p>
The
K-SVCR
multi-classifier
is
based
on
decomposition-reconstruction
strategy
.
binary
SVM
sub-classifiers
are
constructed
,
each
of
which
evaluates
each
sample
into
1-vs-1-vs-rest
structure
.
The
classification
result
of
K-SVCR
is

The
sub-classifier

in
K-SVCR
seeks
an
optimal
hyperplane

normal
vector
and
is

The
optimal
hyperplane
can
be
obtained
by
resolving
the
following
QPP

<p>
Twin-KSVC
is
an
improvement
of
K-SVCR
.
The
Twin-KSVC
constructs
pairs
of
binary
TSVM
sub-classifiers
,
which
evaluates
each
sample
into
1-vs-1-vs-rest
structure
.
The
classification
result

<p>
THKSVM
(
Twin
Hypersphere
Multiclass
Support
Vector
Machine
)
integrates
THSVM
and
1-vs-rest
structure
.
THKSVM
constructs
<hi rend="italic">
K
</hi>
hyperspheres
in
the
training
stage
,
whose
classification
result
is
intuitively
shown
in

c.
</p>
<p>
The
sub-classifier
for
the
focused
classes
<hi rend="italic">
i
</hi>
in
THKSVM
seeks
a
hypersphere
(

)
where
and
are
the
center
and
the
radius
of
the
corresponding
hypersphere
,
respectively
.
The
hypersphere
can
be
constructed
by
resolving
the
following
QPP
:
(

)
where
,
and
are
slack
variables
.
