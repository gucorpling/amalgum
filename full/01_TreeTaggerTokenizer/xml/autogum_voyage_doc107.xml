<p>
The

,

by
bus
links
called
&quot;
Žltý
expres
&quot;
(
Yellow
express
)
.
There
are
several
different
bus
companies
which
travel
from
Bratislava
to
Nitra
(
some
of
which
end
in
Nitra
,
many
of
which
go
further
inland
)
.
</p>
<p>
It
is
also
possible
to
travel
from
Bratislava
to
Nitra
by
train
,
but
this
will
entail
changing
trains
at
least
once
(
e.
g.
in
Nové
Zámky
or
Leopoldov
)
and
will
generally
take
longer
and
be
more
expensive
than
taking
the
bus
.
You
may
also
have
to
wait
quite
a
while
when
you
change
trains
as
the
schedules
from
Bratislava
to
e.g.
Nové
Zámky
are
not
well
synchronised
with
those
of
the
local
train
from
there
to
Nitra
.
