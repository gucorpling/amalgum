appointed

Grupello
then
moved
to

was

With

the
employment
of
the
sculptor

Grupello
was
a
versatile
artist
in
terms
of
the
subject
range
of
his
sculptures
as
well
as
the
materials
in
which
he
worked
.
He
executed
works
in
marble
,
ivory
and
wood
and
was
rare
among
his
contemporary
Flemish
Baroque
sculptors
in
that
he
also
made
bronze
statues
.
A
prime
example
is
the
bronze
equestrian
statue
of
the
Elector
Johann
Wilhelm
.
</p>
<p>
His
early
work
shows
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classicism">
classicist
</ref>
tendency
,
which
may
be
due
to
his
study
period
in
France
.
In
Brussels
,
his
work
was
influenced
by
the
Flemish
Baroque
,
and
in
particular
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Paul_Rubens">
Peter
Paul
Rubens
</ref>
,
and
developed
into
a
full-blown
Baroque
style
.

A
major
work
that
Grupello
created
in
this
style
in
Brussels
is
the
marble
wall
fountain
,
intended
for
the
main
ballroom
of
the
wholesale
fishmongers
guild
.
It
is
this
Baroque
style
that
he
brought
to
Düsseldorf
when
he
moved
there
.
In
his
later
life
,
he
turned
more
to
religious
art
and
produced
crucifixes
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna_(art)">
Madonnas

and
statues
of
