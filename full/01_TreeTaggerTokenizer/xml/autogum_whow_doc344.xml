Prepare
for
Knee
Arthroscopy
Surgery
(
Teens
)
</head>
<p>
When
teens
have
to
have
knee
surgery
,
they
often
need
to
have
an
arthroscopy
.
An
arthroscopy
is
a
surgical
procedure
that
uses
a
small
camera
and
small
instruments
to
see
inside
a
joint
(
the
knee
in
this
case
)
and
fix
any
problems
.
(
It
's
Latin
,
<hi rend="italic">
arthro
</hi>
meaning
&quot;
joint
&quot;
,
and
<hi rend="italic">
scopy
</hi>
meaning
&quot;
see
inside
&quot;
)
.
A
knee
arthroscopy
is
one
of
the
most
common
surgical
procedures
,
even
for
teens
.

<item>
Find
out
what
your
pre-op
instructions
are
.
You
might
have
to
stop
taking
medications
such
as
NSAIDs
up
to
two
weeks
before
your
surgery
.
You
will
also
want
to
know
how
long
before
your
procedure
you
must
fast
.
It
is
often
from
midnight
the
night
before
surgery
on
,
but
there
are
exceptions
,
so
be
sure
to
go
over
this
with
your
surgeon
.

Find
out
what
you
may
need
to
get
ready
for
post-op
.
This
may
include
a
brace/immobilizer
,
an
ice
machine/ice
packs
,
pillows
and
blankets
for
comfort
in
the
car
on
the
way
home
from
the
hospital
,
or
a
prescription
for
pain
meds
(
some
surgeons
will
give
you
the
prescription
ahead
of
time
,
others
will
only
give
it
on
the
day
of
surgery
)
.

Take
time
off
work/school
if
needed
.
If
you
are
in
school
,
try
to
get
your
homework
ahead
of
time
so
you
can
do
it
before
your
surgery
.
If
you
ca
n't
do
this
for
one
reason
or
another
(
such
as
surgery
being
booked
for
the
next
day
,
it
does
happen
)
,
try
to
email
your
teachers
at
least
,
and
this
way
they
will
hopefully
give
you
an
extension
on
the
work
being
done
on
your
surgery
day
,
and
potentially
for
a
few
days
after
your
surgery
(
in
case
you
need
to
stay
out
of
town
overnight
,
or
are
in
too
much
pain
to
go
back
the
day
after
)
.

If
needed
,
book
a
hotel
.
Especially
in
rural
areas
,
there
may
not
be
an
orthopaedic
surgeon
in
your
town/city
,
so
you
may
have
to
stay
in
a
hotel
before
and/or
after
your
surgery
,
especially
if
you
need
to
have
a
drain
removed
the
morning
after
surgery
.
Make
sure
to
ask
for
a
medical
rate
,
as
many
hotels
offer
discounts
for
medical
appointment-related
stays
.

this
is
especially
important
.
You
also
need
to
know

stop
eating
and
drinking
the
night
before
surgery
.

You

Get

night
's
sleep
.
Even
though
you
will
be
&quot;
sleeping
&quot;
with
the
anaesthesia
the
next
day
,
you
do
n't
get
rest
with
anaesthesia
,
so
you
still
need
to
get
a
good
sleep
.

general
anaesthesia

Wear
loose
,
comfy
clothes
.
It
helps
to
wear
short
,
baggy
shorts
,
or
loose
pyjama-type
bottoms
,
as
if
you
need
a
drain
after
surgery
,
this
will
make
it
easy
to
get
your
bottoms
over
the
drain
,
and
also
the
bulky
dressing
that
will
be
on
your
knee
after
surgery
.
You
may
also
have
a
knee
immobilizer
,
which
,
again
,
is
quite
bulky
.

Make

you
show
up
on
time

If
you
do
n't
,
you
will
have
to
wait
even
longer
to
get
your
knee
fixed
.

Be
ready
to
wait
.
Bring
entertainment
such
as
a
phone
or
tablet
,
so
you
have
something
to
do
while
you
wait
.

Prepare
yourself
for
discomfort
.
After
surgery
,
you
will
fell
very
tired
,
hungry
and
thirsty
,
and
maybe
a
bit
nauseous
.
You
will
also
likely
be
in
quite
a
bit
of
pain
,
and
you
may
have
a
drain
in
your
knee
to
drain
excess
blood
and
fluid
from
your
knee
.
This
will
be
removed
about
18-36
hours
after
your
surgery
.

Make
sure
you
follow
any
and
all
post-op
instructions
,
such
a
as
physiotherapy
,
weight-bearing
restrictions
and
bracing/wrapping
.
Your
surgeon
should
tell
you
or
your
parents
all
of
this
information
.

<list type="unordered">
<item>
You
may
not
sleep
much
the
night
after
your
surgery
,
as
you
may
be
in
quite
a
bit
of
pain
.
This
is
a
good
night
to
stay
up
and
watch
TV
!
</item>
<item>
If
possible
,
ice
your
knee
after
surgery
.
Not
only
will
the
cold
help
with
swelling
,
but
also
with
pain
.
An
automatic
icing
machine
,
or
&quot;
cryocuff
&quot;
,
while
expensive
,
can
be
a
worthwhile
investment
to
simplify
the
post-op
icing
process
.
</item>
<item>
If
you
're
prescribed
pain
medication
,
take
it
on
schedule
,
even
if
you
are
not
in
pain
.
It
is
better
to
be
“
ahead
”
of
the
pain
than
try
to
“
catch
up
”
.
After
a
few
days
,
you
will
want
to
start
weaning
off
the
prescription
medication
and
onto
an
over
the
counter
drug
,
such
as
Advil
or
Tylenol
.
