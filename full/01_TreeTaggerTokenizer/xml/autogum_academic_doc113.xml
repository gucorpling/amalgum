The
study
reported
in
this
paper
was
conducted
within
a
broader
sequential
mixed
method
study
focused
on
linking
data
from
two
separate
,
but
interlinked
stages
.
The
first
stage
(
quantitative
approach
)
included
the
inventory
of
nearly
200
FCD
and
sought
to
understand
the
impact
of
internships
on
graduates′
employment
(
access
to
work
)
while
controlling
for
other
institutional
and
contextual
variables
.
This
stage
of
research
informed
the
second
stage
,
namely
regarding
the
selection
of
cases
,
as
well
as
the
within-case
analysis
strategy
.
It
preceded
the
in-depth
study
of
some
cases
that
digged
deeper
into
the
processes
of
organizing
and
managing
internships
,
including
its
associated
liabilities
and
tensions
.
</p>
<p>
In
order
to
ensure
the
comparability
of
the
data
to
be
collected
from
each
case
,
it
was
decided
to
confine
the
FCD
to
interrelated
areas
.
The
areas
chosen
were
Marketing
and
Management
and
Accounting
since
these
FCD
revealed
to
be
the
ones
where
internships
are
more
common
.
Four
HEIs
were
chosen
based
on
the
effort
in
maintaining
some
diversity
regarding
:

(

)
the
type
of
institution
,
namely
university
vs.
polytechnic
.
While
polytechnic
institutions
tend
to
provide
a
more
practical
and
professionally
oriented
training
—
hence
,
theoretically
,
more
prone
to
the
establishment
of
internships
,
the
university
system
tends
to
be
associated
with
a
stronger
theoretical
basis
and
tends
to
be
more
research
oriented
.
This
once
sharp
distinction
seems
,
however
,
to
have
become
increasingly
blurred
over
time
.

<item>
(

)
the
geographical
localization
(
costal
vs.
inland
)
,
since
Portugal′s
inland
is
characterized
by
depopulation
,
stagnation
,
and
delay
,
being
the
levels
of
social
and
economic
maladjustment
difficult
to
reverse
,
thus
contributing
to
lower
levels
of
development
.

(

)
nature
(
mandatory
vs.
facultative
)
of
internships
,
since
previous
research
indicated
that
compulsory
internships
significantly
impact
on
graduate
employment
.
</item>
</list>
<p>
Overall
,
this
sequential
combination
of
a
mixed
methods
approach
derived
from
the
abundant
research
on
the
potential
variables
impacting
on
graduates′
employment
,
though
the
independent
impact
of
internships
had
been
scarcely
demonstrated
.

This
article
presents
a
within-case
analysis
,
reporting
the
use
of
internships
in
seven
FCD
offered
by
four
Portuguese
HEIs
.
A
focus
group
was
conducted
in
each
institution
in
2014
,
in
a
context
when
Portugal
was
embarking
on
a
narrative
of
austerity
,
implementing
wide-ranging
fiscal
consolidation
measures
to
reduce
public
spending
.
The
economic
downturn
amplified
the
demand
for
local
public
services
in
the
face
of
high
unemployment
,
a
pressure
to
which
HEIs
were
surely
not
immune
to
.
</p>
<p>
The
first
case
(
CASE
A
)
corresponds
to
a
polytechnic
school
and
involved
stakeholders
from
the
‘
Marketing
Degree
’
.
The
second
case
(
CASE
B
)
,
corresponds
to
a
public
university
and
involved
stakeholders
from
two
FCD
:
‘
Management
’
and
‘
Accounting
’
.
The
third
and
fourth
cases
(
CASE
C
and
CASE
D
)
,
correspond
to
two
polytechnic
schools
.
Concerning
CASE
C
,
three
degrees
were
considered
:
‘
Management
’
,
‘
Marketing
’
,
and
‘
Tourism
’
.
To
note
,
that
the
inclusion
of
the
Tourism
degree
resulted
from
the
suggestion
of
the
participants
.
Once
explained
the
research
main
goals
,
the
Head
of
Department
,
asked
if
it
would
be
possible
to
include
supervisors
and
students
from
Tourism
.
He
argued
it
would
be
an
excellent
opportunity
for
collaborative
reflection
,
and
institutional
innovation
.
Considering
that
the
researchers
’
aim
is
also
to
inform
institutional
practices
(
‘
applied
research
’
)
it
was
decided
to
include
these
participants
also
.
)
CASE
D
involved
the
‘
Management
Degree
’
.
Table
1
presents
a
brief
outline
of
the
institutional
policy
regarding
internships
in
each
of
the
involved
institutions
.
As
depicted
,
the
diversity
of
cases
,
along
with
the
wide
spectrum
of
internship
strategies
used
by
each
institution
,
enables
a
deep
understanding
of
the
organization
and
functioning
of
internships
in
Portuguese
HEIs
,
thus
enhancing
the
accuracy
of
the
findings
.
The
geographical
localization
of
each
HEI
is
also
identified
.
</p>
<p>
As
stated
above
,
data
gathering
of
the
qualitative
study
included
focus-group
with
different
stakeholders
in
each
institution
(
deans
,
departmental
directors
,
degree
directors
,
and
former
students
)
to
access
a
truly
pluralist
perspective
.
It
was
assumed
that
the
use
of
mixed
groups
enhanced
the
emergence
of
different
and
even
opposite
perspectives
while
increasing
the
opportunity
of
a
broader
understanding
of
institutional
internship
policies
.
This
strategy
allowed
for
circumventing
the
traditional
single
interview
format
,
with
classical
questions
that
could
elicit
politically
correct
answers
or
rehearsed
speeches
.
Extensive
literature
review
on
curricular
internships
did
not
reveal
any
study
where
stakeholders
from
the
same
institution
,
and
therefore
sharing
the
same
or
similar
internship
experiences
,
talked
to
each
other
about
internships
.
In
fact
,
the
majority
of
studies
tend
to
be
single
voiced
.
Furthermore
,
the
opportunity
to
give
voice
to
all
participants
involved
converges
to
institutional
sustainability
(

)
,
enhancing
the
aspects
of
equity
and
justice
.

groups
