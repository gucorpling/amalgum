THE
TELESCOPE
OF
THE
ROCKY
MOUNTAINS
</head>
<p>
On
the
20th
of
October
in
the
preceding
year
,
after
the
close
of
the
subscription
,
the
president
of
the
Gun
Club
had
credited
the
Observatory
of
Cambridge
with
the
necessary
sums
for
the
construction
of
a
gigantic
optical
instrument
.
This
instrument
was
designed
for
the
purpose
of
rendering
visible
on
the
surface
of
the
moon
any
object
exceeding
nine
feet
in
diameter
.
</p>
<p>
At
the
period
when
the
Gun
Club
essayed
their
great
experiment
,
such
instruments
had
reached
a
high
degree
of
perfection
,
and
produced
some
magnificent
results
.
Two
telescopes
in
particular
,
at
this
time
,
were
possessed
of
remarkable
power
and
of
gigantic
dimensions
.
The
first
,
constructed
by
Herschel
,
was
thirty-six
feet
in
length
,
and
had
an
object-glass
of
four
feet
six
inches
;
it
possessed
a
magnifying
power
of
6,000
.
The
second
was
raised
in
Ireland
,
in
Parsonstown
Park
,
and
belongs
to
Lord
Rosse
.
The
length
of
this
tube
is
forty-eight
feet
,
and
the
diameter
of
its
object-glass
six
feet
;
it
magnifies
6,400
times
,
and
required
an
immense
erection
of
brick
work
and
masonry
for
the
purpose
of
working
it
,
its
weight
being
twelve
and
a
half
tons
.
</p>
<p>
Still
,
despite
these
colossal
dimensions
,
the
actual
enlargements
scarcely
exceeded
6,000
times
in
round
numbers
;
consequently
,
the
moon
was
brought
within
no
nearer
an
apparent
distance
than
thirty-nine
miles
;
and
objects
of
less
than
sixty
feet
in
diameter
,
unless
they
were
of
very
considerable
length
,
were
still
imperceptible
.
</p>
<p>
In
the
present
case
,
dealing
with
a
projectile
nine
feet
in
diameter
and
fifteen
feet
long
,
it
became
necessary
to
bring
the
moon
within
an
apparent
distance
of
five
miles
at
most
;
and
for
that
purpose
to
establish
a
magnifying
power
of
48,000
times
.
</p>
<p>
Such
was
the
question
proposed
to
the
Observatory
of
Cambridge
,
There
was
no
lack
of
funds
;
the
difficulty
was
purely
one
of
construction
.
</p>
<p>
After
considerable
discussion
as
to
the
best
form
and
principle
of
the
proposed
instrument
the
work
was
finally
commenced
.
According
to
the
calculations
of
the
Observatory
of
Cambridge
,
the
tube
of
the
new
reflector
would
require
to
be
280
feet
in
length
,
and
the
object-glass
sixteen
feet
in
diameter
.
Colossal
as
these
dimensions
may
appear
,
they
were
diminutive
in
comparison
with
the
10,000
foot
telescope
proposed
by
the
astronomer
Hooke
only
a
few
years
ago
!
</p>
<p>
Regarding
the
choice
of
locality
,
that
matter
was
promptly
determined
.
The
object
was
to
select
some
lofty
mountain
,
and
there
are
not
many
of
these
in
the
United
States
.
In
fact
there
are
but
two
chains
of
moderate
elevation
,
between
which
runs
the
magnificent
Mississippi
,
the
&quot;
king
of
rivers
&quot;
as
these
Republican
Yankees
delight
to
call
it
.
</p>
<p>
Eastwards
rise
the
Appalachians
,
the
very
highest
point
of
which
,
in
New
Hampshire
,
does
not
exceed
the
very
moderate
altitude
of
5,600
feet
.
</p>
<p>
On
the
west
,
however
,
rise
the
Rocky
Mountains
,
that
immense
range
which
,
commencing
at
the
Straights
of
Magellan
,
follows
the
western
coast
of
Southern
America
under
the
name
of
the
Andes
or
the
Cordilleras
,
until
it
crosses
the
Isthmus
of
Panama
,
and
runs
up
the
whole
of
North
America
to
the
very
borders
of
the
Polar
Sea
.
The
highest
elevation
of
this
range
still
does
not
exceed
10,700
feet
.
With
this
elevation
,
nevertheless
,
the
Gun
Club
were
compelled
to
be
content
,
inasmuch
as
they
had
determined
that
both
telescope
and
Columbiad
should
be
erected
within
the
limits
of
the
Union
.
All
the
necessary
apparatus
was
consequently
sent
on
to
the
summit
of
Long
's
Peak
,
in
the
territory
of
Missouri
.
</p>
<p>
Neither
pen
nor
language
can
describe
the
difficulties
of
all
kinds
which
the
American
engineers
had
to
surmount
,
of
the
prodigies
of
daring
and
skill
which
they
accomplished
.
They
had
to
raise
enormous
stones
,
massive
pieces
of
wrought
iron
,
heavy
corner-clamps
and
huge
portions
of
cylinder
,
with
an
object-glass
weighing
nearly
30,000
pounds
,
above
the
line
of
perpetual
snow
for
more
than
10,000
feet
in
height
,
after
crossing
desert
prairies
,
impenetrable
forests
,
fearful
rapids
,
far
from
all
centers
of
population
,
and
in
the
midst
of
savage
regions
,
in
which
every
detail
of
life
becomes
an
almost
insoluble
problem
.
And
yet
,
notwithstanding
these
innumerable
obstacles
,
American
genius
triumphed
.
In
less
than
a
year
after
the
commencement
of
the
works
,
toward
the
close
of
September
,
the
gigantic
reflector
rose
into
the
air
to
a
height
of
280
feet
.
It
was
raised
by
means
of
an
enormous
iron
crane
;
an
ingenious
mechanism
allowed
it
to
be
easily
worked
toward
all
the
points
of
the
heavens
,
and
to
follow
the
stars
from
the
one
horizon
to
the
other
during
their
journey
through
the
heavens
.
</p>
<p>
It
had
cost
$
400,000
.
The
first
time
it
was
directed
toward
the
moon
the
observers
evinced
both
curiosity
and
anxiety
.
What
were
they
about
to
discover
in
the
field
of
this
telescope
which
magnified
objects
48,000
times
?
Would
they
perceive
peoples
,
herds
of
lunar
animals
,
towns
,
lakes
,
seas
?
No
!
there
was
nothing
which
science
had
not
already
discovered
!
and
on
all
the
points
of
its
disc
the
volcanic
nature
of
the
moon
became
determinable
with
the
utmost
precision
.
</p>
<p>
But
the
telescope
of
the
Rocky
Mountains
,
before
doing
its
duty
to
the
Gun
Club
,
rendered
immense
services
to
astronomy
.
Thanks
to
its
penetrative
power
,
the
depths
of
the
heavens
were
sounded
to
the
utmost
extent
;
the
apparent
diameter
of
a
great
number
of
stars
was
accurately
measured
;
and
Mr.
Clark
,
of
the
Cambridge
staff
,
resolved
the
Crab
nebula
in
Taurus
,
which
the
reflector
of
Lord
Rosse
had
never
been
able
to
decompose
.
