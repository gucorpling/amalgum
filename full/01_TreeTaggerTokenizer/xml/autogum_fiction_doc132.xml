THE
AURICULAR
TALENT
OF
THE
HON
.
SAMUEL
BUDD
</head>
<p>
Behind
us
came
the
Hon.
Samuel
Budd
.
Just
when
the
sun
was
slitting
the
east
with
a
long
streak
of
fire
,
the
Hon.
Samuel
was
,
with
the
jocund
day
,
standing
tiptoe
in
his
stirrups
on
the
misty
mountain
top
and
peering
into
the
ravine
down
which
we
had
slid
the
night
before
,
and
he
grumbled
no
little
when
he
saw
that
he
,
too
,
must
get
off
his
horse
and
slide
down
.
The
Hon.
Samuel
was
ambitious
,
Southern
,
and
a
lawyer
.
Without
saying
,
it
goes
that
he
was
also
a
politician
.
He
was
not
a
native
of
the
mountains
,
but
he
had
cast
his
fortunes
in
the
highlands
,
and
he
was
taking
the
first
step
that
he
hoped
would
,
before
many
years
,
land
him
in
the
National
Capitol
.
He
really
knew
little
about
the
mountaineers
,
even
now
,
and
he
had
never
been
among
his
constituents
on
Devil
's
Fork
,
where
he
was
bound
now
.
The
campaign
had
so
far
been
full
of
humor
and
full
of
trials
--
not
the
least
of
which
sprang
from
the
fact
that
it
was
sorghum
time
.
Everybody
through
the
mountains
was
making
sorghum
,
and
every
mountain
child
was
eating
molasses
.
</p>
<p>
Now
,
as
the
world
knows
,
the
straightest
way
to
the
heart
of
the
honest
voter
is
through
the
women
of
the
land
,
and
the
straightest
way
to
the
heart
of
the
women
is
through
the
children
of
the
land
;
and
one
method
of
winning
both
,
with
rural
politicians
,
is
to
kiss
the
babies
wide
and
far
.
So
as
each
infant
,
at
sorghum
time
,
has
a
circle
of
green-brown
stickiness
about
his
chubby
lips
,
and
as
the
Hon.
Sam
was
averse
to
“
long
sweetenin
'
”
even
in
his
coffee
,
this
particular
political
device
just
now
was
no
small
trial
to
the
Hon.
Samuel
Budd
.
But
in
the
language
of
one
of
his
firmest
supporters
Uncle
Tommie
Hendricks
:
</p>
<p>
“
The
Hon.
Sam
done
his
duty
,
and
he
done
it
damn
well
.
”
</p>
<p>
The
issue
at
stake
was
the
site
of
the
new
Court-House
--
two
localities
claiming
the
right
undisputed
,
because
they
were
the
only
two
places
in
the
county
where
there
was
enough
level
land
for
the
Court-House
to
stand
on
.
Let
no
man
think
this
a
trivial
issue
.
There
had
been
a
similar
one
over
on
the
Virginia
side
once
,
and
the
opposing
factions
agreed
to
decide
the
question
by
the
ancient
wager
of
battle
,
fist
and
skull
--
two
hundred
men
on
each
side
--
and
the
women
of
the
county
with
difficulty
prevented
the
fight
.
Just
now
,
Mr.
Budd
was
on
his
way
to
“
The
Pocket”
--
the
voting
place
of
one
faction
--
where
he
had
never
been
,
where
the
hostility
against
him
was
most
bitter
,
and
,
that
day
,
he
knew
he
was
“
up
against
”
Waterloo
,
the
crossing
of
the
Rubicon
,
holding
the
pass
at
Thermopylae
,
or
any
other
historical
crisis
in
the
history
of
man
.
I
was
saddling
the
mules
when
the
cackling
of
geese
in
the
creek
announced
the
coming
of
the
Hon.
Samuel
Budd
,
coming
with
his
chin
on
his
breast-deep
in
thought
.
Still
his
eyes
beamed
cheerily
,
he
lifted
his
slouched
hat
gallantly
to
the
Blight
and
the
little
sister
,
and
he
would
wait
for
us
to
jog
along
with
him
.
I
told
him
of
our
troubles
,
meanwhile
.
The
Wild
Dog
had
restored
our
mules
and
the
Hon.
Sam
beamed
:
</p>
<p>
“
He
's
a
wonder
--
where
is
he
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
He
never
waited
--
even
for
thanks
.
”
</p>
<p>
Again
the
Hon.
Sam
beamed
:
</p>
<p>
“
Ah
!
just
like
him
.
He
's
gone
ahead
to
help
me
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Well
,
how
did
he
happen
to
be
here
?
”
I
asked
.
</p>
<p>
“
He
's
everywhere
,
”
said
the
Hon.
Sam
.
</p>
<p>
“
How
did
he
know
the
mules
were
ours
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Easy
.
That
boy
knows
everything
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Well
,
why
did
he
bring
them
back
and
then
leave
so
mysteriously
?
”
</p>
<p>
The
Hon.
Sam
silently
pointed
a
finger
at
the
laughing
Blight
ahead
,
and
I
looked
incredulous
.
</p>
<p>
“
Just
the
same
,
that
's
another
reason
I
told
you
to
warn
Marston
.
He
's
already
got
it
in
his
head
that
Marston
is
his
rival
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Pshaw
!
”
I
said
--
for
it
was
too
ridiculous
.
</p>
<p>
“
All
right
,
”
said
the
Hon.
Sam
placidly
.
</p>
<p>
“
Then
why
does
n't
he
want
to
see
her
?
”
“
How
do
you
know
he
ai
n't
watchin
'
her
now
,
for
all
we
know
?
Mark
me
,
”
he
added
,
“
you
wo
n't
see
him
at
the
speakin
'
,
but
I
'll
bet
fruit
cake
agin
gingerbread
he
'll
be
somewhere
around
.
”
</p>
<p>
So
we
went
on
,
the
two
girls
leading
the
way
and
the
Hon.
Sam
now
telling
his
political
troubles
to
me
.
Half
a
mile
down
the
road
,
a
solitary
horseman
stood
waiting
,
and
Mr.
Budd
gave
a
low
whistle
.
</p>
<p>
“
One
o
'
my
rivals
,
”
he
said
,
from
the
corner
of
his
mouth
.
</p>
<p>
“
Mornin
'
,
”
said
the
horseman
;
“
lemme
see
you
a
minute
.
”
</p>
<p>
He
made
a
movement
to
draw
aside
,
but
the
Hon.
Samuel
made
a
counter-gesture
of
dissent
.
</p>
<p>
“
This
gentleman
is
a
friend
of
mine
,
”
he
said
firmly
,
but
with
great
courtesy
,
“
and
he
can
hear
what
you
have
to
say
to
me
.
”
</p>
<p>
The
mountaineer
rubbed
one
huge
hand
over
his
stubbly
chin
,
threw
one
of
his
long
legs
over
the
pommel
of
his
saddle
,
and
dangled
a
heavy
cowhide
shoe
to
and
fro
.
</p>
<p>
“
Would
you
mind
tellin
'
me
whut
pay
a
member
of
the
House
of
Legislatur
'
gits
a
day
?
”
</p>
<p>
The
Hon.
Sam
looked
surprised
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
think
about
two
dollars
and
a
half
.
”
</p>
