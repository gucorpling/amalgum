The

criminal

is
a
rehabilitative
system

That

Is
that
what

<hi rend="bold">

</hi>
I
think
the
purpose
of
the
criminal
justice
system
should
be
—
yeah
,
that
would
be
great
,
if
it
could
be
done
.
But
its
primary
purpose
is
to
promote
safety
,
to
reduce
crime

How

Believe
me
,
I
’m
not
an
apologist
for
the
criminal
justice
system
.
I
think
it
’s
in
a
terrible
state
,
in
part
because
quite
a
few
years
ago
the
official
policy
,
at
least
at
the
federal
level
,
and
the
states
certainly
seem
to
be
in
the
<hi rend="italic">
avant-garde
</hi>
on
this
,
was
to
not
be
focused
on
rehabilitation
but
to
be
focused
on
retribution
.
The
federal
sentencing
guidelines
,
I
believe
,
explicitly
endorse
a
retributive
purpose
for
the
criminal
justice
system
.
I
disagree
with
that
.

Can

<p>
<hi rend="bold">
NS
:
</hi>
Sure
,
it
’s
official
ACLU
policy
,
which
I
wholeheartedly
endorse
.
I
think
it
was
well
summarized
by
one
of
our
board
members
years
ago
when
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crack%20epidemic">
crack
cocaine
epidemic
</ref>
was
starting
,
and
somebody
said
we
should
re-examine
our
policy
which
opposed
the
criminalization
of
substances
for
adults
.
Maybe
we
should
re-examine
it
in
light
of
this
new
dangerous
drug
.
And
we
did
re-examine
and
unanimously
re-affirmed
.
In
the
course
of
that
debate
,
one
Board
member
said
,
“
We
believe
that
every
consenting
adult
should
have
the
right
to
imbibe
,
ingest
,
inhale
or
insert
whatever
he
or
she
wants
into
his
or
her
own
body
.
It
’s
a
matter
of
individual
freedom
of
choice
.
”
Does
that
mean
they
should
do
it
?
Not
necessarily
,
not
any
more
than
somebody
should
smoke
or
drink
or
eat

</ref>
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
NS
:
</hi>
Absolutely
.
The
idea
of
government
making
determinations
about
how
you
end
your
life
,
forcing
you
,
which
could
be
considered
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
in
certain
circumstances
,
and
Justice
Stevens
in
a
very
interesting
opinion
in
a
right-to-die
raised
the
analogy
.
But
you
said
before
you
turned
on
the
tape
that
you
typically
ask
people
how
they
would
want
to
die
,
which
is
<hi rend="italic">
very
</hi>
interesting
.
I
mean
,
of
the
zillions
of
questions
I
have
been
asked
,
nobody
has
ever
asked
me
that
!
It
’s
very
rare
I
am
asked
a
question
that
I
have
never
been
asked
before

So
how
would
you
like

die

</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
NS
:
</hi>
Well
,
the
first
thing
that
occurred
to
me
was
:
I
want
to
have
the
choice
.
That
was
the
very
first
thing
that
occurred
to
me
,
because
I
know
how
through
personal
experiences
,
through
vicarious
experiences
,
through
reading
the
complaints
in
our
law
suits
where
we
have
challenged
the
absolute
restrictions
on
compassion
and
dying
,
people
are
essentially
tortured
.
And
I
do
n’t
want
that
to
happen
.
And
I
do
n’t
want
my
loved
ones
tortured
by
watching
that
happen
.
