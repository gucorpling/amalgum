At
his
trial
the
events
were
reconstructed
.
Forster
's
mother-in-law
recounted
that
her
daughter
and
grandchild
had
left
her
house
to
see
Forster
at
4
p.m.
on
Saturday
,
4
December
1802
.
Joseph
Bradfield
,
in
whose
house
Forster
lodged
,
reported
that
they
had
stayed
together
that
night
and
gone
out
at
10
a.m.
on
the
Sunday
morning
.
He
also
stated
that
Forster
and
his
wife
had
not
been
on
good
terms
because
she
wished
to
live
with
him
.
Various
witnesses
saw
Forster
with
his
wife
and
child
in
public
houses
near
Paddington
Canal
during
the
day
on
the
Sunday
.
The
body
of
his
child
was
found
on
the
Monday
morning
;
after
the
canal
was
dragged
for
three
days
,
his
wife
's
body
was
also
found
.

Forster
claimed
that
upon
leaving
The
Mitre
he
set
out
alone
for
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipping_Barnet">
Barnet
</ref>
in
order
to
see
his
other
two
children
who
were
in
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workhouse">
workhouse
</ref>
there
,
though
he
was
forced
to
turn
back
at
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whetstone,_London">
Whetstone
</ref>
due
to
the
failing
light
.
This
was
contradicted
by
a
waiter
at
The
Mitre
who
said
the
three
left
the
inn
together
.
Scepticism
was
also
expressed
that
he
could
have
walked
to
Whetstone
in
the
time
he
claimed
.
The
jury
found
him
guilty
.
He
was
sentenced
to
death
and
also
to
be
dissected
thereafter
.
This
sentence
was
designed
not
only
to
provide
medicine
with
corpses
on
which
to
experiment
,
but
also
to
ensure
that
the
condemned
could
not
rise
on
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgement_Day">
Judgement
Day
</ref>
,
their
bodies
having
been
cut
into
pieces
and
selectively
discarded
.
Forster
was
hanged
on
18
January
,
shortly
before
which
he
made
a
full
confession
.
He
said
he
had
come
to
hate
his
wife
and
had
twice
before
taken
his
wife
to
the
canal
but
his
nerve
had
both
times
failed
him
.

)
questions
the
fairness
of
the
trial
.
It
notes
that
friends
of
George
Forster
's
wife
later
claimed
that
she
was
extremely
suicidal
and
had
often
talked
about
killing
herself
and
her
daughter
.
According
to
this
documentary
,
Forster
attempted
suicide
by
stabbing
himself
with
a
crudely
fashioned
knife
.
This
was
to
avoid
awakening
during
the
dissection
of
his
body
,
should
he
not
have
died
when
hanged
.
This
was
a
real
possibility
owing
to
the
crude
methods
of
execution
at
the
time
.
The
same
reference
suggests
that
his
'
confession
'
was
obtained
under
duress
.
In
fact
,
it
alleges
that
Pass
,
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beadle">
Beadle
</ref>
on
Aldini
's
payroll
,
fast-tracked
the
whole
trial
and
legal
procedure
in
order
to
obtain
the
freshest
corpse
possible
for
his
benefactor
.

Forster

body
was
given
to

Aldini
was

The

was
a

Several
of
those

believed
that
Forster
was
being
brought
back
to
life
(

that
even
if
this
had

so

he

and
one
man
,
Mr

the

was
so
shocked
that
he
died

The

dead
