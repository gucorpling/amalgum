Make
sure
the
boat
is
in
neutral
.
Generally
,
this
will
be
with
the
shift
lever
in
the
up
position
,
or
the
middle
position
between
reverse
and
forward
.

Advance
the
throttle
to
the
&quot;
start
&quot;
position
.
This
may
be

,
or
can
be
approximated
by

It
may
help
to
stand
up
straddling
the
seat
during
this
part
.
Pull
the
handle
out
until
it
stops
,
then
give
it
a
quick
,
long
yank
on
the
rope
.
It
probably
wo
n't
start
the
first

To
steer
the
boat
,
pull
the
handle
with
your
hand
to
turn
.
Twisting
it
toward
you
will
make
the
boat
go
faster
,
and
twisting
it
away
from
you
will
make
it
go
slower
.
Pushing
the
motor
away
will
turn
it
right
,
and
vice

Tips

<list type="unordered">
<item>
It
is
a
very
good
idea
to
have
an
experienced
driver
in
the
boat
with
you
.
</item>
<item>
Take
a
boating
course
and
get
a
license
if
you
are
going
to
be
boating
.
Different
States
of
Australia
have
differing
requirements
for
licensing
.
In
Queensland
you
need
a
licence
even
if
boating
on
private
property
in
a
boat
with
a
motor
over
6hp
.
These
courses
are
very
informative

All
outboard
fuel
tanks
have
a
breather
valve
,
or
on
top
of
the
outboard
(
if
it
has
an
integral
fuel
tank
)
This
must
be
opened
(
anti
clockwise
)
to
allow
air
to
replace
the
spent
fuel
in
the
tank
,
if
you
do
not
do
this
the
engine
wo
n't
start
or
it
will
stall
after
a
short
distance
.
</item>
<item>
Make
sure
you
have
enough
fuel
for
your
trip
.
A
good
practice
is
the
&quot;
three-thirds
&quot;
rule
,
one-third
of
your
fuel
for
the
trip
out
,
one
third
back
and
one-third
as
a
reserve
.
Ensure
your
fuel
line
(
from
a
tote
tank
)
in
FIRMLY
fitted
and
'
snaps
'
in
to
motor
connection
.
</item>
<item>
Untie
the
stern
first
from
the
dock
(
motor
running
and
in
neutral
)
then
the
bow
last
.
turn
away
from
the
dock
and
reverse
out
(
this
minimizes
scraping
side
of
hull
against
dock
)
.
