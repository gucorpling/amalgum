AS
</hi>
:
The
control
and
handling
of
personnel
within
the
Sea
Org
was
very
unpredictable
.
There
were
always
huge
demands
and
needs
for
people
on
various
projects
or
positions
that
had
to
be
filled
&quot;
at
once
&quot;
.
So
one
could
expect
rapid
changes
.
It
was
also
considered
that
after
one
messes
up
,
they
can
be
corrected
using
the
&quot;
ethics
technology
&quot;
of
Scientology
and
confessionals
so
they
can
carry
on
after
their
level
of
ethics
are
once
again
acceptable
.

AS
</hi>
:
I
was
in
the
Watchdog
Committee
(
WDC
)
which
is
the
highest
ecclesiastical
body
in
Scientology
,
with
a
WDC
member
appointed
over
each
of
the
numerous
&quot;
sectors
&quot;
or
areas
of
Scientology
to
see
to
their
proper
management
.
My
boss
as
a
WDC
member
is
the
WDC
Chairman
.
This
is
the
highest
management
position
in
the
organization
.
I
was
in
WDC
for
about
a
decade
and
held
about
six
different
sectors
over
the
years
,
including
the
Association
for
Better
Living
and
Education
(
ABLE
)
sector
,
which
is
responsible
for
the
secular
aspects
of
the
organization
–
drug
rehabilitation
,
criminal
reform
,
Applied
Scholastics
study
technology
and
The
Way
To
Happiness
Foundation
–
and
the
Celebrity
Center
sector
.
Anything
that
goes
on
inside
your
sector
or
sphere
of
responsibility
as
a
WDC
member
,
is
your
responsibility
and
you
're
held
accountable
.
This
could
be
very
stressful
,
particularly
when
the
current
head
of
Scientology
–
David
Miscavige
–
is
so
abusive
.
For
example
,
Miscavige
learned
that
the
Tampa
Scientology
organization
was
not
paying
their
rent
in
2003
.
As
I
had
previously
been
the
WDC
member
for
all
Scientology
churches
(
approx
175
of
them
around
the
world
)
and
should
have
noticed
and
handled
it
then
,
Miscavige
demanded
that
I
personally
pay
the
rent
of
$
5,000
(
which
I
did
not
have
)
.
This
order
was
enforced
by
his
personal
staff
–
I
had
to
borrow
the
money
from
several
other
staff
members
and
turn
it
into
the
Finance
Office
,
who
then
wrote
a
check
to
the
Tampa
organization
to
pay
their
back
rent
as
a
&quot;
gift
&quot;
to
them
from
management
.
