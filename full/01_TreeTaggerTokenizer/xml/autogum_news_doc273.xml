a

Following

made
on

of
Mehdi
Kazemi
,
and
in
the
light
of
new
circumstances
since
the
original
decision
was

I
have
decided

Eighty

allow

have

said
:
&quot;
We
are
obviously
delighted
that
the
home
secretary
has
listened
to
the
representations
that
were
made
in
this
case
...
There
are
overwhelming
reasons
why
people
should
not
be
deported
to
Iran
in
the
current
circumstances
,
and
it
is
important
that
Britain
is
seen
as
a
safe
haven
.

<p>
Borg
Palm
,
Kazemi
's
solicitor
,
stated
Kazemi
was
pleased
with
the
news
but
would
have
an
unstable
future
in
Britain
without
asylum
:
&quot;
He
is
very
much
afraid
of
being
allowed
to
stay
in
Britain
but
without
being
granted
official
permission
.
That
would
then
put
him
in
a
no
man
’s
land
.
He
would
be
very
unhappy
in
the
long
term
.

Kazemi
came
to
Britain
in
2005
to
study

His

spoke
with
<hi rend="italic">
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN">
CNN
</ref>
</hi>
on
condition
of
anonymity
,
and
said
that
his
nephew
was
studying
in
Britain
in
2006
when
his
partner
in
Iran
was
arrested
and
hanged
after
being
charged
with
sodomy
.
Kazemi
's
uncle
told
<hi rend="italic">
CNN
</hi>
:
&quot;
Under
torture
and
pressure
,
(
the
partner
)
revealed
Mehdi
's
name
as
his
boyfriend
.
&quot;
Gay
sex
is
considered
a
crime
in
Iran
,
and
is
punishable
by
death
.
Kazemi
told
British
authorities
in
his
asylum
application
that
Iranian
police
were
after
him
,
and
that
he
could
face
execution
if
he
returned
to
Iran
.
Kazemi
stated
in
his
asylum
request
:
&quot;
I
cannot
stop
my
attraction
to
men
...
If
I
return
to
Iran
I
will
be
arrested
and
executed
like
[
my
boyfriend
]
.
Since
this
incident
...
I
have
been
so
scared
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
After
Britain
's
Home
Office
initially
denied
Kazemi
's
asylum
application
,
he
fled
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada">
Canada
</ref>
and
then
the
Netherlands
,
where
he
was
detained
.
Kazemi
faces
deportation
from
the
Netherlands
to
Britain
,
after
their
highest
court
rejected
his
plea
on
Tuesday
.
The
Netherlands
'
highest
court
rejected
the
case
,
citing
EU
law
that
Kazemi
's
case
was
the
responsibility
of
the
country
where
he
first
requested
asylum
.
</p>
<p>
A
resolution
passed
by
the
European
Parliament
Thursday
asked
EU
states
&quot;
to
find
a
common
solution
to
ensure
that
Mehdi
Kazemi
is
granted
asylum
or
protection
on
EU
soil
and
not
sent
back
to
Iran
.
&quot;
The
resolution
also
stated
that
Iranian
authorities
&quot;
routinely
detain
,
torture
and
execute
persons
,
notably
homosexuals
&quot;
and
that
&quot;
Mehdi
's
partner
has
already
been
executed
,
while
his
father
has
threatened
him
with
death
.
