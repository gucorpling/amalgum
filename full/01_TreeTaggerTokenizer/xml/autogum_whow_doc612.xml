Create
yourself
!
You
may
not
know
who
you
are
,
what
you
like
,
what
you
want
to
do
in
life
,
but
this
is
okay
.
Create
yourself
,
do
n't
find
yourself
,
create
yourself
.
Create
your
own
personality
,
but
be
yourself
.
Creating
your
personality
does
n't
mean
copying
others
,
but
you
can
always
get
influence
.
Have
confidence
,
a
good
sense
of
style
and
a
contagious
smile
.

Dress
to
impress
.
Bring
out
who
you
are
in
your
own
fashion
sense
.
Do
n't
throw
on
an
outfit
everyday
--
spend
time
on
how
you
want
to
bring
out
yourself
in
each
outfit
.

Remain
who
you
are
.
You
may
change
,
and
always
will
,
but
you
will
always
be
yourself
.
Know
that
if
you
are
being
yourself
,
and
someone
does
n't
like
you
,
they
're
not
right
.
Ignore
them
and
know
that
there
are
many
other
people
you
can
impress
,
you
do
n't
need
to
impress
anyone
.
Be
yourself
,
everyone
's
going
to
get
judged
anyway
,
sometime
in
their
life
.

Find
the
real
friends
.
Do
n't
use
someone
as
a
friend
just
to
act
popular
.
This
is
very
common
.
Find
the
real
friends
,
the
ones
that
you
think
will
really
be
there
for
you
,
and
not
your
popularity
.

<item>
Try
making
as
many
friends
as
possible
.
Smile
at
everyone
,
compliment
them
,
and
start
talking
to
them
more
.
Once
this
happens
,
you
may
have
a
sleepover
or
hang
out
sometime
,
this
can
lead
to
a
whole
new
friendship
.

Do
what
you
like
,
and
only
you
.
Do
n't
do
drugs
to
be
cool
and
do
n't
be
someone
you
're
not
to
fit
in
.
Nobody
can
make
you
do
anything
,
and
you
are
your
own
person
.
Nobody
can
own
you
,
and
never
let
them
.

Never
be
shy
.
This
will
make
some
people
think
you
're
sad
,
and
others
may
think
you
have
a
low
self
esteem
.
Smile
at
people
,
keep
your
chin
up
and
be
friendly
.

and
do
what
you
want

be
shy
and
never
bully
someone

You
are
finished
!
Remember
that
if
you
do
have
more
friends
,
or
impressed
more
people
,
know
to
stay
who
you
are
.
Never
judge
people
and
know
that
even
if
you
are
trying
to
impress
everyone
,
not
everyone
may
be
impressed
,
they
're
not
worth
it
.
You
are
.
So
,
have
confidence
,
keep
your
head
up
and
smile
.
