PART
II

<p>
“
She
never
even
asked
who
it
was
,
”
Amelia
reported
to
her
sisters
,
when
she
had
returned
to
the
house
.
“
Because
she
knew
,
”
replied
Sophia
,
sagely
;
“
there
has
never
been
any
old
friend
but
that
one
old
friend
to
come
back
into
Eudora
Yates
’s
life
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Has
he
come
back
into
her
life
,
I
wonder
?
”
said
Amelia
.
</p>
<p>
“
What
did
he
return
to
Wellwood
for
if
he
did
n’t
come
for
that
?
All
his
relatives
are
gone
.
He
never
married
.
Yes
,
he
has
come
back
to
see
Eudora
and
marry
her
,
if
she
will
have
him
.
No
man
who
ever
loved
Eudora
would
ever
get
over
loving
her
.
And
he
will
not
be
shocked
when
he
sees
her
.
She
is
no
more
changed
than
a
beautiful
old
statue
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
HE
is
changed
,
though
,
”
said
Amelia
.
“
I
saw
him
the
other
day
.
He
did
n’t
see
me
,
and
I
would
hardly
have
known
him
.
He
has
grown
stout
,
and
his
hair
is
gray
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Eudora
’s
hair
is
gray
,
”
said
Sophia
.
</p>
<p>
“
Yes
,
but
you
can
see
the
gold
through
Eudora
’s
gray
.
It
just
looks
as
if
a
shadow
was
thrown
over
it
.
It
does
n’t
change
her
.
Harry
Lawton
’s
gray
hair
does
change
him
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
If
,
”
said
Anna
,
sentimentally
,
“
Eudora
thinks
Harry
’s
hair
turned
gray
for
love
of
her
,
you
can
trust
her
or
any
woman
to
see
the
gold
through
it
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Harry
’s
hair
was
never
gold
--
just
an
ordinary
brown
,
”
said
Amelia
.
“
Anyway
,
the
Lawtons
turned
gray
young
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
She
wo
n’t
think
of
that
at
all
,
”
said
Sophia
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
wonder
why
Eudora
always
avoided
him
so
,
years
ago
,
”
said
Amelia
.
</p>
<p>
“
Why
does
n’t
a
girl
in
a
field
of
daisies
stop
to
pick
one
,
which
she
never
forgets
?
”
said
Sophia
.
“
Eudora
had
so
many
chances
,
and
I
do
n’t
think
her
heart
was
fixed
when
she
was
very
young
;
at
least
,
I
do
n’t
think
it
was
fixed
so
she
knew
it
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
wonder
,
”
said
Amelia
,
“
if
he
will
go
and
call
on
her
.
”
</p>
<p>
Amelia
privately
wished
that
she
lived
near
enough
to
know
if
Harry
Lawton
did
call
.
She
,
as
well
as
Mrs.
Joseph
Glynn
,
would
have
enjoyed
watching
out
and
knowing
something
of
the
village
happenings
,
but
the
Lancaster
house
was
situated
so
far
from
the
road
,
behind
its
grove
of
trees
,
that
nothing
whatever
could
be
seen
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
doubt
if
Eudora
tells
,
if
he
does
call
--
that
is
,
not
unless
something
definite
happens
,
”
said
Anna
.
</p>
<p>
“
No
,
”
remarked
Amelia
,
sadly
.
“
Eudora
is
a
dear
,
but
she
is
very
silent
with
regard
to
her
own
affairs
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
She
ought
to
be
,
”
said
Sophia
,
with
her
married
authority
.
She
was
,
to
her
sisters
,
as
one
who
had
passed
within
the
shrine
and
was
dignifiedly
silent
with
regard
to
its
intimate
mysteries
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
suppose
so
,
”
assented
Anna
,
with
a
soft
sigh
.
Amelia
sighed
also
.
Then
she
took
the
tea-tray
out
of
the
room
.
She
had
to
make
some
biscuits
for
supper
.
</p>
<p>
Meantime
Eudora
was
pacing
homeward
with
the
baby-carriage
.
Her
serene
face
was
a
little
perturbed
.
Her
oval
cheeks
were
flushed
,
and
her
mouth
now
and
then
trembled
.
She
had
,
if
she
followed
her
usual
course
,
to
pass
the
Wellwood
Inn
,
but
she
could
diverge
,
and
by
taking
a
side
street
and
walking
a
half-mile
farther
reach
home
without
coming
in
sight
of
the
inn
.
She
did
so
to-day
.
</p>
<p>
When
she
reached
the
side
street
she
turned
rather
swiftly
and
gave
a
little
sigh
of
relief
.
She
was
afraid
that
she
might
meet
Harry
Lawton
.
It
was
a
lonely
way
.
There
was
a
brook
on
one
side
,
bordered
thickly
with
bushy
willows
which
were
turning
gold-green
.
On
the
other
side
were
undulating
pasture-lands
on
which
grazed
a
few
sheep
.
There
were
no
houses
until
she
reached
the
turn
which
would
lead
back
to
the
main
street
,
on
which
her
home
was
located
.
</p>
<p>
Eudora
was
about
midway
of
this
street
when
she
saw
a
man
approaching
.
He
was
a
large
man
clad
in
gray
,
and
he
was
swinging
an
umbrella
.
Somehow
the
swing
of
that
umbrella
,
even
from
a
distance
,
gave
an
impression
of
embarrassment
and
boyish
hesitation
.
Eudora
did
not
know
him
at
first
.
She
had
expected
to
see
the
same
Harry
Lawton
who
had
gone
away
.
She
did
not
expect
to
see
a
stout
,
middle-aged
man
,
but
a
slim
youth
.
</p>
<p>
However
,
as
they
drew
nearer
each
other
,
she
knew
;
and
curiously
enough
it
was
that
swing
of
the
tightly
furled
umbrella
which
gave
her
the
clue
.
She
knew
Harry
because
of
that
.
It
was
a
little
boyish
trick
which
had
survived
time
.
It
was
too
late
for
her
to
draw
back
,
for
he
had
seen
her
,
and
Eudora
was
keenly
alive
to
the
indignity
of
abruptly
turning
and
scuttling
away
with
the
tail
of
her
black
silk
swishing
,
her
India
shawl
trailing
,
and
the
baby-carriage
bumping
over
the
furrows
.
She
continued
,
and
Harry
Lawton
continued
,
and
they
met
.
</p>
<p>
Harry
Lawton
had
known
Eudora
at
once
.
She
looked
the
same
to
him
as
when
she
had
been
a
girl
,
and
he
looked
the
same
to
her
when
he
spoke
.
</p>
<p>
“
Hullo
,
Eudora
,
”
said
Harry
Lawton
,
in
a
ludicrously
boyish
fashion
.
His
face
flushed
,
too
,
like
a
boy
.
He
extended
his
hand
like
a
boy
.
The
man
,
seen
near
at
hand
,
was
a
boy
.
In
reality
he
himself
had
not
changed
.
A
few
layers
of
flesh
and
a
change
of
color-cells
do
not
make
another
man
.
He
had
always
been
a
simple
,
sincere
,
friendly
soul
,
beloved
of
men
and
women
alike
,
and
he
was
that
now
.
Eudora
held
out
her
hand
,
and
her
eyes
fell
before
the
eyes
of
the
man
,
in
an
absurd
fashion
for
such
a
stately
creature
as
she
.
But
the
man
himself
acted
like
a
great
happy
overgrown
school-boy
.
