Introduction

<p>
Obesity
and
vitamin-D
deficiency
are
two
major
global
public
health
concerns
that
affect
over
one-third
of
the
population
.
A
body
mass
index
of
more
than
30
kg/m2
is
associated
with
lower
serum
vitamin-D
levels
compared
with
non-obese
individuals
.
Several
mechanisms
that
contribute
to
the
high
incidence
of
vitamin-D
deficiency
in
obese
people
were
suggested
.
Ultraviolet
radiation
from
sunlight
exposure
is
required
for
cutaneous
production
of
vitamin
D.
It
was
proposed
that
obese
individuals
,
overall
,
have
suboptimal
levels
of
vitamin
D
because
they
tend
to
participate
in
fewer
outdoor
activities
and
,
accordingly
,
have
less
exposure
to
sunlight
.
Vitamin
D
is
a
lipid-soluble
vitamin
,
and
it
is
thought
that
the
lower
bioavailability
of
vitamin
D
in
obese
individuals
,
compared
to
lean
individuals
,
is
due
to
vitamin-D
sequestration
within
the
adipose
tissues
.
Lastly
,
vitamin-D
deficiency
may
also
be
due
to
inadequate
dietary
intake
or
malabsorption
of
vitamin
D.
Obesity
is
a
well-established
risk
factor
for
the
development
of
cardiovascular
disease
(
CVD
)
,
and
several
mechanisms
may
contribute
to
this
link
.
However
,
a
role
of
vitamin-D
deficiency
in
obesity-associated
cardiovascular
(
CV
)
risk
is
yet
to
be
established
.
</p>
<p>
Epidemiological
data
reported
associations
between
vitamin
D
deficiency
and
left
ventricular
hypertrophy
,
hypertension
,
increased
arterial
stiffness
,
and
endothelial
dysfunction
.
The
pathophysiological
underpinnings
of
these
associations
remain
mostly
unexplained
.
The
most
reliable
and
convincing
evidence
for
the
involvement
of
vitamin
D
in
the
pathogenesis
of
CVD
comes
from
studies
demonstrating
an
association
between
vitamin-D
deficiency
and
hypertension
.
Vitamin-D
deficiency
is
associated
with
a
higher
risk
for
preeclampsia
,
a
condition
that
is
characterized
by
hypertension
.
Also
,
a
significant
inverse
association
was
reported
between
vitamin-D
serum
levels
and
arterial
blood
pressure
in
the
elderly
.
An
interventional
study
demonstrated
that
one
month
of
vitamin-D
intake
(
1,5000
IU/day
)
reduced
tissue
sensitivity
to
the
stimulation
of
the
renin
–
angiotensin
system
manifested
by
improved
renal
blood
flow
and
reduced
mean
arterial
pressure
during
an
infusion
of
angiotensin
II
.
Moreover
,
vitamin-D
intake
(
2000
IU/day
)
for
14
days
in
healthy
adults
reduced
augmentation
index
,
a
measure
of
arterial
stiffness
that
contributes
to
the
development
of
hypertension
.
</p>
<p>
The
discovery
of
vitamin-D
receptor
(
VDR
)
widened
the
scope
of
biological
effects
that
vitamin
D
plays
in
human
health
.
VDR
is
a
transcription
factor
that
enters
the
nucleus
upon
binding
to
vitamin
D
,
where
it
attaches
to
specific
DNA
regions
and
activates
the
transcription
of
a
myriad
of
genes
that
coordinate
several
biological
responses
.
VDR
is
widely
expressed
throughout
the
human
body
in
almost
all
cells
and
tissues
,
including
vascular
smooth
muscle
cells
,
cardiomyocytes
,
and
endothelial
cells
.
Animal
studies
found
that
loss
of
VDR
signaling
increased
arterial
stiffness
and
elevated
systolic
and
diastolic
blood
pressure
,
independent
of
the
renin
–
angiotensin
–
aldosterone
system
.
Another
study
found
that
VDR
knockout
mice
have
increased
arterial
stiffness
through
decreased
bioavailability
of
nitric
oxide
(
NO
)
.
These
and
other
studies
proposed
that
the
leading
mechanism
for
the
association
between
vitamin-D
deficiency
and
CVD
is
related
to
endothelial
dysfunction
and
impaired
endothelial-dependent
NO
production
.
</p>
<p>
Despite
this
accumulating
evidence
of
the
role
of
vitamin
D
in
vascular
function
,
direct
mechanistic
evidence
of
this
role
in
the
microvasculature
of
morbidly
obese
population
and
how
it
might
be
modified
following
massive
weight
loss
are
largely
unexplored
.
The
purpose
of
the
current
study
is
to
investigate
the
effects
of
vitamin
D
on
the
microvasculature
isolated
from
both
subcutaneous
(
SAT
)
and
visceral
adipose
tissue
(
VAT
)
in
morbidly
obese
adults
before
and
after
bariatric
surgery-induced
weight
loss
.
The
central
hypothesis
is
that
vitamin
D
would
improve
microvascular
function
in
obese
adults
via
improving
flow-mediated
NO
production
,
and
this
effect
would
be
of
a
greater
magnitude
before
compared
to
after
weight
loss
.
In
our
previous
work
,
we
found
that
flow-induced
dilation
(
FID
)
is
impaired
in
morbidly
obese
individuals
due
to
an
imbalance
of
NO
and
H2O2
.
H2O2
may
serve
as
a
compensatory
mechanism
for
vasodilation
during
pathological
conditions
such
as
obesity
.
Using
the
proposed
ex
vivo
system
in
this
study
,
we
are
able
to
explore
the
contributing
vasoactive
mediators
of
vitamin-D
effects
on
microvascular
function
,
mainly
NO
and
H2O2
.
