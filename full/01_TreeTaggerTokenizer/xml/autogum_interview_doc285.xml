Jonty
Haywood
is
responsible
for
the
entire
site
Lose
The
Game
at
losethegame.com
;
a
site
dedicated
to
informing
the
masses
about
a
game
called
&quot;
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Game%20(mind%20game)">
The
Game
</ref>
&quot;
which
Haywood
says
is
widely
spreading
and
popular
game
.

talked
to
Haywood
via
email
while
constantly
losing
The
Game
.
</p>
<p>
The
rules
of
The
Game
are
simple
and
easy
enough
to
remember
with
only
three
basic
rules
.
While
there
are
variations
of
the
rules
spread
across
Internet
just
as
The
Game
itself
has
spread
,
Haywood
plays
by
these
rules
:
</p>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
Rule
1
:
You
are
playing
The
Game
.
</item>
<item>
Rule
2
:
Whenever
you
think
about
The
Game
,
you
lose
.
</item>
<item>
Rule
3
:
Loss
must
be
announced
.
</item>
</list>
<p>
One
variation
of
the
rules
is
including
a
grace
period
where
a
player
has
a
certain
amount
of
time
in
which
to
forget
about
The
Game
ranging
from
mere
minutes
to
half
an
hour
.
However
,
Haywood
says
that
a
grace
period
is
unnecessary
.
</p>
<p>
Haywood
says
many
people
are
playing
The
Game
which
takes
advantage
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White%20Bear%20Phenomenon">
White
Bear
Phenomenon
</ref>
.
The
Cornwall
,
United
Kingdom-resident
has
experienced
people
playing
The
Game
on
his
worldwide
travels
,
he
has
even
experienced
an
American
announcing
loss
at
a
cinema
in
Bangkok
,
Thailand
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
When
I
first
went
to
university
in
Cambridge
,
a
year
after
hearing
about
The
Game
in
Cornwall
,
many
people
already
knew
about
The
Game
,
especially
people
from
London
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
The
number
of
active
players
is
certainly
in
the
millions
,
if
not
tens
of
millions
,
&quot;
Haywood
says
,
based
on
the
fact
that
he
has
had
500,000
unique
hits
to
his
website
,
&quot;
50,000
members
of
the
biggest
Game
Facebook
group
.
&quot;
Newspaper
articles
,
radio
mentions
and
webcomics
featuring
The
Game
are
more
reasons
for
the
assertions
of
its
popularity
Haywood
says
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
In
my
experience
The
Game
spreads
among
a
group
of
friends
,
eventually
reaching
the
Internet
and
makes
it
to
a
new
group
of
friends
,
etc.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
In
addition
,
many
people
play
actively
by
trying
to
make
lots
of
other
people
lose
The
Game
,
often
by
initiating
new
players
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Even
though
many
people
play
The
Game
,
its
history
cannot
be
accurately
retold
.
Haywood
first
heard
of
the
game
in
2001
and
while
there
are
some
Internet
posts
relating
to
The
Game
that
date
back
to
2002
,
one
person
from
London
with
claims
to
being
the
maker
of
The
Game
says
he
made
it
in
1996
with
the
&quot;
aim
of
annoying
as
many
people
as
possible
.
&quot;
Haywood
says
this
London-origin
story
is
the
only
claim
that
has
&quot;
any
kind
of
evidence
&quot;
.
But
he
does
say
that
he
prefers
to
think
that
someone
&quot;
discovered
&quot;
The
Game
,
and
not
invented
it
.
&quot;
It
’s
always
been
there
,
just
waiting
for
someone
to
realise
that
they
are
playing
,
and
hence
lose
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Despite
running
a
popular
site
about
The
Game
-
which
has
something
&quot;
big
&quot;
coming
up
and
will
be
announced
in
the
next
few
weeks
-
Haywood
himself
gets
annoyed
and
irritated
at
The
Game
&quot;
all
the
time
&quot;
and
his
losses
range
anywhere
from
days
at
a
time
to
mere
hours
in
between
losses
depending
on
the
social
situation
.
The
Game
is
still
fun
to
play
however
,
he
says
,
because
of
the
distress
you
can
cause
on
other
people
.
&quot;
Although
you
ca
n’t
be
aware
that
you
are
winning
The
Game
,
it
is
still
fun
when
your
friends
lose
before
you
,
or
more
than
you
.
Even
more
fun
is
when
they
lose
because
of
something
you
previously
set-up
,
or
an
association
you
tried
to
make
them
make
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
think
it
’s
a
much
more
interesting
game
than
it
may
first
appear
.
It
’s
also
very
abstract
and
a
little
thought-provoking
,
and
it
’s
good
to
see
lots
of
young
people
enjoying
it
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
And
for
those
who
wish
to
lose
less
often
,
Haywood
has
some
&quot;
strategies
&quot;
.
&quot;
One
involves
trying
to
feel
very
annoyed
after
losing
,
with
the
hope
that
you
will
subconsciously
learn
not
to
lose
like
this
.
The
other
is
to
hit
yourself
when
you
lose
,
with
a
similar
purpose
,
&quot;
he
says
.
&quot;
Unfortunately
,
almost
every
strategy
we
have
tried
so
far
has
backfired
spectacularly
.
