Eat
Bread
at
a
Dinner
Party
</head>
<p>
The
bread
!
Often
it
's
the
first
source
of
sustenance
for
a
starving
dinner
guest
but
wait
!
Not
so
fast
!
Is
it
rude
to
start
breaking
it
open
and
chowing
down
before
you
're
even
seated
?
!
There
is
basic
etiquette
attached
to
eating
bread
at
the
dinner
table
.
This
article
only
deals
with
etiquette
relevant
to
some
anglophone
cultures
.
It
is
possible
other
cultural
requirements
exist
for
eating
bread
in
other
parts
of
the
world
-
asking
first
is
a
good
idea
if
you
do
n't
know
!

Wait
before
breaking
bread
.
It
is
quite
possible
that
you
're
starving
,
but
it
is
ill-mannered
to
eat
the
bread
without
respite
before
the
first
course
arrives
at
the
table
.
If
bread
is
sitting
on
the
table
already
,
wait
until
the
first
course
is
served
before
helping
yourself
to
it
.
If
bread
is
handed
out
by
a
waiter
,
allow
the
waiter
to
use
bread
tongs
to
place
it
on
the
plate
.
Do
not
be
tempted
to
stick
your
hand
into
the
waiter
's
basket
and
grab
more
!
Ask
instead
.
And
again
,
wait
until
everyone
has
started
eating
.

Eat
the
bread
carefully
.
A
dinner
party
is
not
the
time
to
display
breakfast
table
bread
habits
.
Instead
,
break
apart
the
bread
into
small
pieces
using
your
fingers
.
Do
not
cut
the
bread
or
bite
into
the
large
part
of
the
bread
.
If
you
wish
to
add
butter
to
your
bread
,
add
it
to
each
small
piece
after
you
have
broken
it
.

Place
the
broken
bread
onto
the
bread
and
butter
plate
.
This
small
plate
is
found
just
above
the
dinner
plate
and
is
used
to
hold
the
bread
and
butter
.
Using
your
bread
,
place
a
small
bit
of
butter
onto
the
bread
and
butter
plate
next
to
your
bread
.
Do
not
&quot;
double
dip
&quot;
into
the
butter
dish
.
Take
only
what
you
need
from
the
butter
dish
and
place
that
onto
the
plate
.
Carefully
add
neatly
spread
butter
onto
your
hand
broken
pieces
of
bread
with
your
hands
.

Beware
the
bread
bloat
.
While
some
people
are
very
careful
not
to
overdo
the
bread
,
others
consume
too
much
at
the
dinner
table
and
cannot
eat
all
of
their
meal
.
Avoid
this
by
remembering
that
bread
is
the
support
cast
and
not
the
star
.
If
you
're
still
starving
later
,
you
can
raid
the
fridge
at
home
,
out
of
sight
.

Tips
</head>
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Note
that
many
functions
such
as
weddings
,
conferences
,
etc.
,
will
only
cater
for
enough
bread
to
go
around
per
person
once
.
If
you
ask
for
additional
bread
and
it
is
refused
for
this
reason
,
do
n't
despair
(
and
equally
,
do
n't
take
it
out
on
the
poor
waiter
)
.
The
best
thing
to
do
is
to
ask
if
the
waiter
can
return
to
you
with
more
bread
if
any
is
left
over
.
There
are
always
people
on
low-carb
diets
,
etc.
,
who
refuse
their
share
of
bread
.
</item>
<item>
If
you
have
special
dietary
needs
,
allergies
,
etc.
,
such
as
not
consuming
dairy
or
gluten
,
ask
the
waiter
quietly
at
an
opportune
moment
if
the
bread
ingredients
are
known
;
be
clear
that
you
have
an
allergy
or
dietary
issue
with
certain
ingredients
.
If
it
cannot
be
ascertained
with
certainty
or
ease
,
simply
refuse
the
bread
politely
.
