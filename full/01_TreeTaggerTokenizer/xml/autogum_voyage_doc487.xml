Swindon
</ref>
</hi>
is
a
large
town
in
<ref target="Wiltshire">
Wiltshire
</ref>
,
in
southern
England
,
with
a
population
of
approximately
200,000
people
.
It
does
n't
have
very
much
to
offer
from
a
historical
perspective
,
although
it
does
have
a
great
deal
of
heritage
from
the
British
railway
system
in
which
it
played
a
central
part
during
the
19th
and
20th
centuries
.
</p>
<head>
Understand
</head>
<p>
The
town
began
its
existence
as
a
Saxon
village
,
and
it
is
likely
that
its
name
is
derived
from
the
Saxon
words
'
swine
dun
'
or
'
swines
down
'
meaning
'
pig
hill
'
.
The
small
hilltop
village
subsequently
expanded
around
the
site
of
a
quarry
,
with
a
19th-century
canal
facilitating
trade
.
</p>
<p>
During
the
mid-19th
century
,
the
introduction
of
the
Great
Western
Railway
and
the
associated
railway
works
fully
transformed
Swindon
from
a
village
into
a
thriving
industrial
town
,
which
drew
workers
from
across
the
United
Kingdom
.
</p>
<p>
Swindon
experienced
a
population
boom
after
World
War
II
.
New
housing
areas
were
built
due
to
a
shortage
of
housing
in
London
following
the
mass
destruction
caused
by
the
war
.
This
population
growth
has
continued
and
the
town
remains
one
of
the
fastest
growing
urban
areas
in
the
United
Kingdom
and
Europe
.

Although
it

it
is
advisable
to
travel

The
road
network
in
Swindon
is
comprehensively
signposted
.
To
get
from
one
side
of
Swindon
to
the
other
,
locals
have
the
option
of
driving
through
town
,
or
jumping
on
the
motorway
from
junction
15
to
16
.
This
method
of
getting
across
Swindon
has
been
somewhat
superseded
by
the
almost
unused
link
between
Drove
Road/Wroughton
and
the
Rushy
Platt
junction
.
</p>
<p>
One
of
the
major
attractions
when
driving
around
Swindon
is
the
<hi rend="italic">
Magic
Roundabout
</hi>
,
named
after
the
1960s
television
show
.
This
sprawling
junction
contains
five
mini-roundabouts
,
each
situated
around
a
bigger
,
but
less
obvious
,
central
counter-clockwise
roundabout
(
which
houses
a
very
bright
street
light
for
night
driving
)
.
Each
mini-roundabout
has
three
junctions
,
two
leading
on
to
the
next
and
previous
mini-roundabout
,
and
one
acting
as
an
entry/exit
junction
.
Many
visitors
are
immediately
intimidated
by
local
drivers
who
use
it
proficiently
,
but
the
local
secret
is
to
treat
each
mini-roundabout
as
normal
,
rather
than
looking
at
the
daunting
mass
of
concrete
and
cars
.
