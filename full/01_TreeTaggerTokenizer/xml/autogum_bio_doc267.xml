temple
,
called

.
Right
from
his
childhood
,
Subramaniya
Iyer
was
drawn
to
the
temple
and
the
Goddess
.
</p>
<p>
One
day
,
the
King
visited
the
temple
to
pay
homage
to
Lord
Shiva
.
On
noticing
the
peculiar
behaviour
of
Subramaniya
Iyer
who
was
a
temple
priest
,
he
inquired
the
other
priests
about
the
individual
.
One
of
them
remarked
that
he
was
a
madman
while
another
rejected
this
categorization
explaining
to
the
king
that
Subramaniya
Iyer
was
only
an
ardent
devotee
of
Goddess
Abhirami
.
Seeking
to
know
the
truth
himself
,
Serfoji
approached
the
priest
and
asked
him
what
day
of
the
month
it
was
i.e.
whether
it
was
a
full-moon
day
or
a
new-moon
day
.
Subramaniya
Iyer
who
could
see
nothing
else
but
the
shining
luminant
form
of
the
Goddess
before
him
wrongly
answered
that
it
was
a
full-moon
day
while
it
was
in
fact
a
new-moon
day
.
The
king
rode
off
informing
the
former
that
he
would
have
his
head
cut
off
if
the
moon
did
not
appear
on
the
sky
by
six
in
the
night
.
</p>
<p>
Immediately
realizing
his
mistake
,
Subramaniya
Iyer
supposedly
lit
a
huge
fire
and
erected
a
platform
over
it
supported
by
a
hundred
ropes
.
He
sat
upon
the
platform
and
prayed
to
the
Goddess
Abhirami
to
save
him
.
He
cut
off
one
rope
after
another
in
succession
on
completion
of
each
verse
of
his
prayer
.
These
hymns
form
the
Abhirami
Anthadhi
.
On
completion
of
the
79th
hymn
,
the
Goddess
Abhirami
manifested
herself
before
him
and
threw
her
earring
over
the
sky
such
that
it
shone
with
bright
light
upon
the
horizon
.
The
area
around
the
temple
sparkled
with
bright
light
.
Overcome
with
ecstasy
,
Subramaniya
Iyer
composed
21
more
verses
in
praise
of
the
Goddess
.
</p>
<p>
The
king
repented
his
mistake
and
immediately
cancelled
the
punishment
he
had
awarded
Subramaniya
Iyer
.
He
also
bestowed
upon
the
latter
the
title
of
<hi rend="bold">
Abirami
Pattar
</hi>
or
&quot;
priest
of
Goddess
Abhirami
&quot;
</p>
<head>
Devotion
to
Goddess
Abirami
</head>
<p>
As
he
grew
,
Iyer
developed
a
fanatical
devotion
to
the
goddess
Abirami
.
He
would
sit
in
a
corner
of
the
temple
meditating
upon
the
Goddess
and
singing
her
praises
.
As
time
passed
,
he
was
forever
immersed
in
meditation
upon
the
Goddess
that
he
began
to
observe
the
supposed
likeliness
of
the
Goddess
in
the
persona
of
the
women
around
him
and
often
showered
them
with
flowers
.
According
to
sources
,
soon
,
a
particular
section
of
the
populace
began
to
regard
him
as
a
madman
.
