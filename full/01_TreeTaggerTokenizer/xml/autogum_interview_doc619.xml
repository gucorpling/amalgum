I
just
recently
read
a
<hi rend="italic">
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek">
Newsweek
</ref>
</hi>
article
about
the
Tea
Party
.
An
excerpt
that
particularly
caught
my
eye
was
:
The
Tea
Party
rejects
the
idea
that
“
...
a
government
of
brainy
people
can
solve
thorny
problems
through
complex
legislation
.
&quot;
The
Tea
Party
finds
its
strongest
spirit
among
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism%20in%20the%20United%20States">
conservative
</ref>
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican%20Party%20(United%20States">
Republicans
</ref>
.
Yet
a
powerful
current
of
'
blame
both
sides
'
also
pulses
through
the
movement
.
”
Lynne
Roberts
,
a
volunteer
organizer
of
a
Tea
Party
gathering
in
Albany
,
New
York
said
:
“
We
're
equally
disgusted
with
Republican
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democrat">
Democrat
</ref>
Congressmen
.
”
...
The
day
I
was
answering
this
question
for
this
article
,
I
was
also
interviewed
by
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americus,%20Georgia">
Americus
(
GA
)
</ref>
Enterprise
newspaper
.
I
said
when
you
objectively
step
back
from
society
and
take
a
look
—
we
have
a
mess
.
We
have
a
$
13
trillion
National
Debt
and
we
are
mired
in
a
deep
recession
.
We
have
just
crossed
the
50
million
abortion
threshold
.
Global
warming
looms
as
a
scary
doomsday
scenario
.
Violence
and
poverty
are
almost
off
the
charts
in
many
of
our
big
city
urban
cores
.
Our
prisons
are
bursting
at
the
seams
.
Children
are
being
shot
in
schools
and
abducted
from
the
streets
…
And
one
of
the
main
common
denominators
in
this
:
For
the
last
couple
decades
,
we
've
had
'
brainy
'
presidents
who
have
come
out
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale">
Yale
</ref>
or
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard">
Harvard
</ref>
.
So
what
does
this
say
?
I
believe
it
says
that
,
apparently
,
the
education
one
receives
at
Yale
or
Harvard
(
while
impressive
to
many
)
,
is
n't
the
type
of
education
that
equips
people
to
,
well
,
solve
many
of
the
societal
problems
I
just
mentioned
.
I
mean
if
it
was
...
I
told
the
reporter
in
Georgia
that
to
solve
the
National
Debt
problem
,
for
instance
,
we
need
a
common
sense
president
–
“
with
a
calculator
that
works
.
”
I
’m
serious
.
But
it
's
not
just
the
presidents
(
Congress
people
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall%20Street">
Wall
Street
</ref>
bankers
,
corporate
CEOs
...
)
,
it
's
us
,
the
American
people
.
We
have
gotten
ourselves
into
this
mess
.
We
're
in
this
global
warming
crisis
,
as
an
example
,
not
because
the
politicians
failed
to
come
up
with
tangible
measures
at
carbon
dioxide
reduction
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen">
Copenhagen
</ref>
;
but
rather
because
many
of
us
are
failing
here
.
We
drive
too
much
,
use
too
much
air
conditioning
,
heat
too
much
,
buy
too
much
(
it
takes
the
burning
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fossil%20fuels">
fossil
fuels
</ref>
to
make
the
products
)
...
We
're
a
society
addicted
to
comfort
and
immediate
gratification
.
And
what
's
more
,
just
like
an
alcoholic
,
we
do
n't
want
our
politicians
confronting
us
about
it
.
So
we
elect
people
who
do
n't
confront
us
–
and
the
dysfunction
(
read
:
destruction
)
continues
.
For
a
candid
look
at
what
we
propose
for
global
warming
,
