Once
you
can
envision
it
,
the
technology
will
follow
,
though
.
Once
you
can
start
seeing
it
.
</hi>

<hi rend="bold">
JR
:
</hi>
Yeah
,
there
are
sites
that
are
sort
of
attempting
it
,
and
if
you
look
right
now
,
there
are
all
these
new
multiplatform
shows
,
that
are
beginning
to
do
it
.
And
there
wo
n't
be
just
networking
capabilities
in
these
shows
;
they
'll
be
much
different
than
the
shows
that
we
see
today
.
But
on
another
level
,
they
'll
still
be
narrative
shows
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
A
very
common
thing
for
a
writer
is
to
be
riddled
with
self-doubt
,
and
that
can
often
ruin
a
lot
of
inspiration
and
creativity
and
make
you
lose
your
way
in
what
you
're
doing
.
How
do
you
handle
a
challenge
like
that
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
JR
:
</hi>
Unfortunately
,
I
ca
n't
stop
myself
,
whether
I
'm
having
self-doubt
or
not
.
This
new
project
of
mine
is
a
new
play
by
William
Shakespeare
;
I
've
taken
lines
from
all
the
plays
and
put
them
together
into
a
new
play
,
essentially
.
I
liked
the
idea
;
I
thought
it
was
a
cool
concept
.
But
I
did
n't
know
if
it
was
a
publishable
idea
.
I
did
n't
want
to
waste
my
time
doing
a
non-publishable
thing
,
but
then
I
ended
up
doing
it
anyway
.
And
when
I
saw
it
,
it
was
a
complete
surprise
.

Do
you
have
a
memory
that
has
stuck
with
you
that
--
where
you
continually
turn
back
to
it
to
learn
new
lessons
?

<p>
<hi rend="bold">
JR

</hi>
I
feel
like
I
have
a
lot
of
memories
that
I
turn
back
to
all
the
time

</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS

Is
there
one
that
stands
out
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
JR

</hi>
Right
now
,
there
's
not
.
Although
there
is
a
dream
I
had
that
's
been
sticking
with
me
.
Memories
that
I
'm
inundated
with
right
now
have
to
do
with
my
childhood
,
and
remembering
--
actually
,
I
have
a
picture
of
me
standing
on
the
West
Side
Highway
when
I
was
a
little
kid
.
I
was
just
a
street
urchin
,
and
now
my
daughter
smells
like
that
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS

She
smells
like
a
street
urchin
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
JR
:
</hi>
She
smells
like
a
little
kid
who
runs
around
in
the
park
,
you
know
?
Is
a
dream
too
off-base
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
And
that
brings
back
a
lot
--
the
olfactory
memories
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
JR
:
</hi>
Yeah
,
yeah
.
Is
a
dream
too
off-base
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
No
,
I
'd
love
to
hear
your
dream
.

<hi rend="bold">
JR

</hi>
So
,
I
was
standing
in
this
field
--
I
think
it
was
a
polo
ground
kind
of
thing
.
And
there
were
a
lot
of
sort
of
petite
bourgeoisie/intellectuals/professors
--
these
sorts
of
people
.
It
was
late
afternoon
after
some
kind
of
sporting
event
;
I
think
it
was
polo
.
I
do
n't
really
know
.
And
everyone
's
standing
around
;
it
's
the
first
cooling
off
of
a
hot
day
.
It
did
n't
really
have
a
time
period
.
Sort
of
recent
distant
past
.
