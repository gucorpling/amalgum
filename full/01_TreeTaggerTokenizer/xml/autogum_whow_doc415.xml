Choose
a
site
in
nature
.
For
making
your
birthday
a
memorable
one
,
you
need
to
do
something
different
.
Start
with
a
perfect
place
where
you
can
celebrate
!
Try
choosing
a
beautiful
hill
station
,
or
a
station
by
the
side
of
the
waterfalls
,
which
will
completely
change
and
cheer
up
your
mood
,
and
a
place
where
you
can
enjoy
the
eternal
beauty
of
nature
.
By
celebrating
your
birthday
there
,
you
will
get
the
completely
awesome
experience
that
you
want
to
have
!

Throwing
a
party
at
a
restaurant
is
another
common
way
that
we
choose
to
celebrate
our
birthdays
.
Thus
,
we
get
the
same
experience
.
By
having
a
change
in
the
way
of
celebration
,
you
get
a
different
experience
and
perhaps
a
memorable
one
!
<figure rend="Have a Memorable Birthday Step 2.jpg">

<item>
Decide
on
the
place
at
least
20
days
before
your
birthday
event
,
so
that
you
get
enough
time
for
other
preparations
.

Avoid
party
halls
.
Maybe
you
have
decided
on
the
place
(
say
a
hill
station
)
and
you
are
celebrating
there
at
a
restaurant
.
Do
n't
celebrate
there
in
the
party
hall
!
Choose
a
place
from
where
you
can
see
the
picturesque
scenes
of
nature
.
Remember
that
fun
and
enjoyment
,
in
your
unique
celebration
,
is
linked
with
nature
,
so
make
sure
you
are
n't
celebrating
away
from
it
.

Many
restaurants
have
such
arrangements
where
you
can
enjoy
the
nature
too
,
along
with
your
celebration
.

Although
you
will
go
at
a
perfect
natural
destination
,
celebrating
at
a
party
hall
wo
n't
give
you
the
different
experience
that
you
want
to
have
.
Keep
this
in
mind
when
deciding
on
a
destination
.

Decide
on
the
right
time
.
If
you
like
to
celebrate
at
night
,
you
may
go
with
that
.
Usually
,
people
like
to
celebrate
their
birthday
at
night
,
but
if
you
want
to
have
something
different
,
go
with
a
party
in
the
daytime
.

Decide
whom
to
invite
.
Usually
,
we
prefer
to
invite
our
friends
and
family
.
In
order
to
have
a
good
and
quality
time
with
everybody
,
choose
to
invite
only
the
people
who
can
make
you
happy
and
comfortable
.

Inviting
someone
just
for
the
sake
of
formality
does
n't
work
.
The
only
person
who
is
concerned
about
your
birthday
is
you
,
so
invite
only
those
whom
you
really
want
to
have
with
you
on
your
birthday
.
Inviting
people
unwillingly
will
just
spoil
your
mood
and
you
wo
n't
be
able
to
enjoy
anything
.

Create
a
card
.
By
using
a
card
rather
than
inviting
people
via
the
phone
or
email
,
you
can
have
beautifully
illustrated
cards
that
will
entice
people
to
join
you
in
your
celebration
.

Set
up
a
daytime
party
.
Since
you
are
celebrating
at
a
natural
destination
,
you
do
n't
need
much
decoration
.
Your
background
should
already
be
full
of
beauties
of
nature
!
If
you
want
to
give
off
a
birthday
feeling
,
you
can
use
balloons
of
your
favorite
colors
,
but
do
n't
just
stick
them
anywhere
.
You
can
just
fly
them
in
the
sky
(
use
balloons
that
fly
high
in
the
sky
)
.
You
will
really
enjoy
it
,
and
your
party
guests
will
also
love
the
scenes
and
will
ultimately
enjoy
it
.

Set
up
a
nighttime
party

You
can
use
beautiful
night
lamps
,
lanterns
,
or
balloons
that
light
up

Again
,
do
n't
stick
them
in
the
sky
;
let
them
fly
in
the
sky
and
enjoy
the
lovely
scene

Choose
a

Choose
a
dish
that
is
new
,
and
something
that
everybody
will
love
to
have

If

to
have
some
games
for
fun
,
then
do
n't
plan
a
heavy
dish
.
If
you
do
,
nobody
will
want
to
play
the
games
after
having
food
.
In
that
case
,
you
can
have
light
snacks
.

Add
a
cake
and
candles

A
birthday
is
incomplete
without
cake
and
candles
!
Have
a
printed
cake
that
would
attract
everybody
's
attention
to
the
cake
.
Have
a
flavor
that
everybody
will
certainly
enjoy
.
Have
different
candles
that
will
probably
catch
everybody
's
attention
.

Do
a
good
deed

Try
distributing
your
old
toys
and
clothes
among
the
children
of
an
orphanage
,
or
any
other
random
act
of
kindness
.
By
doing
this

you
will
really
get
that
satisfaction

peace
that
one
gets
after
doing
an
act
like
this
