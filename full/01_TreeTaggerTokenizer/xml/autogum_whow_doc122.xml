general
groups
,
everyone
on

.
</item>
<item>
Choose
semi-popular
groups
with
a
few
hundred
members
;
it
they
're
too
unpopular
,
no
one
will
ever
check
the
page
.
Equally
though
,
if
they
're
too
popular
,
your
set
will
be
knocked
off
the
'
recent
sets
'
section
too
quickly
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Change
the
groups
that
your

Change
it
perhaps
every
two-four
weeks

Make
your
sets
visually
appealing
and
unique
.

For
example
,
do
n't
make
an
outfit
with
a
bland
t-shirt
and
skinny
jeans
.
Polyvore
is
used
to
be
creative
,
not
show
what
you
wear
every
day
.
</item>
<item>
Let
's
be
honest
,
those
sets
with
items
far
apart
,
photographs
that
are
n't
incorporated
well
,
and
overused
(
and
ugly
)
fonts
and
background
colors
are
eyesores
.
Use
only
photographs
with
muted
colors
in
the
background
to
make
it
visually
appealing
but
not
distracting
,
and
try
using
newspaper
articles
and
quotes
to
make
it
look
cool
.
When
you
are
n't
putting
anything
in
the
background
,
try
to
organize
your
items
so
that
they
fit
well
together
,
like
pieces
of
a
puzzle
.

Do
n't
comment
only

If

wo
n't
bother
looking
at
every
one
.
