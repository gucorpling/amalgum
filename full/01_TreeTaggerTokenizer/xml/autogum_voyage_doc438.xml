Aral
is
a
former
fishing
village
located
in
Western
Kazakhstan
near
the
<ref target="Aral%20Sea">
Aral
Sea
</ref>
.
In
1920
,
Soviet
leader
Vladimir
Lenin
asked
the
people
of
Aral
to
give
fish
to
feed
starving
Russians
,
which
they
did
.
The
story
is
commemorated
by
a
mural
in
the
Aral
train
station
.
Aral
has
suffered
in
recent
years
due
to
the
retreating
Aral
Sea
.
Many
tourists
come
to
Aral
in
order
visit
ship
cemeteries
,
which
,
like
the
Aral
Sea
itself
,
are
quickly
disappearing
.
Many
locals
use
the
metal
from
the
abandoned
ships
to
build
fences
and
walls
,
and
in
many
ship
cemeteries
all
that
is
left
are
skeletons
of
ships
.

Get
around
</head>
<p>
Aral
is
a
very
small
city
to
walk
around
in
;
there
are
taxis
but
they
are
basically
unnecessary
.
The
train
station
is
about
a
15-minute
walk
from
the
main
hotel
.
There
are
two
main
streets
:
Makhataeva
,
on
which
you
will
find
the
hotel
and
Aral
Tenizi
office
,
and
Abilhayir
Han
(
Абилхайыр
хан
)
,
on
which
you
can
find
some
small
shops
and
internet
,
this
is
also
the
road
to
follow
north
to
get
to
the
train
station
.
Абилхайыр
хан
used
to
be
called
Gorky
and
may
still
be
called
as
such
in
some
travel
guides
.

<p>
Aral
does
not
have
many
attractions
and
most
tourists
are
not
interested
in
the
town
itself
.
The
old
harbor
is
located
just
outside
the
hotel
and
it
is
possible
to
walk
out
to
abandoned
ships
on
the
dry
seabed
from
there
.
</p>
<p>
Jeep
tours
can
be
booked
,
and
in
a
half
an
hour
you
can
reach
a
ship
cemetery
or
the
Aral
Sea
.
For
information
on
sights
and
tours
contact
Aral
Tenizi
.
The
Aral
Tenizi
office
is
located
a
few
houses
down
from
the
hotel
on
10-12
Makhataeva
.

There
are
very
few
shops
in
Aral
.
A
main
market
is
housed
west
of
the
main
square
and
past
the
train
tracks
.
Here
you
can
find
fresh
fruit
and
vegetables
.
Other
smaller
shops
can
be
found
near
the
center
of
town
by
the
hotel
.
These
shops
sell
bread
,
jam
,
candy
,
soda
,
noodles
,
etc.

Eat
</head>
<p>
Aral
does
not
offer
much
diversity
in
dining
.
One
restaurant
is
located
across
the
street
from
the
hotel
and
serves
a
variety
of
Kazakh
dishes
.
This
is
the
largest
restaurant
in
town
and
able
to
make
a
wide
variety
of
dishes
.
Other
restaurants
can
be
found
around
town
(
many
of
them
with
the
name
Chin
Son
)
that
offer
less
options
,
so
be
prepared
to
eat
manty
and
shashlyk
here
.
All
menus
will
be
in
Russian
.

There
is
one
hotel
in
Aral
,
called
simply
&quot;
Aral
&quot;
at
4
Makhateava
St.
It
has
two
floors
of
rooms
and
one
restaurant
.
The
rooms
are
quite
simple
and
many
have
small
tubs
but
no
showers
.
Expect
to
pay
about
4,000
tenge
per
night
.
Homestays
are
available
and
for
this
you
should
ask
around
.
If
you
do
not
speak
Russian
,
try
looking
lost
and
asking
for
<hi rend="italic">
komnaty
</hi>
(
комнаты
,
&quot;
rooms
&quot;
)
.

To
leave
Aral
,
buy
tickets
at
the
train
station
for
your
desired
destination
.
Be
sure
to
include
what
class
you
would
like
to
travel
in
.
Kupeyny
is
second
class
and
has
four
berths
and
a
closing
door
.
Third
class
has
six
berths
and
no
doors
,
for
a
long
train
ride
it
is
not
the
most
comfortable
but
is
good
for
meeting
locals
,
who
will
most
likely
be
very
curious
about
you
.
