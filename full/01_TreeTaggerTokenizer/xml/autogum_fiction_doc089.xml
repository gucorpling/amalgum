Marie
was
busy
,
turning
over
the
contents
of
a
drawer
,
as
she
answered
,
</head>
<p>
“
Well
,
of
course
,
by
and
by
,
Eva
,
you
will
have
other
things
to
think
of
besides
reading
the
Bible
round
to
servants
.
Not
but
that
is
very
proper
;
I
’ve
done
it
myself
,
when
I
had
health
.
But
when
you
come
to
be
dressing
and
going
into
company
,
you
wo
n’t
have
time
.
See
here
!
”
she
added
,
“
these
jewels
I
’m
going
to
give
you
when
you
come
out
.
I
wore
them
to
my
first
ball
.
I
can
tell
you
,
Eva
,
I
made
a
sensation
.
”
</p>
<p>
Eva
took
the
jewel-case
,
and
lifted
from
it
a
diamond
necklace
.
Her
large
,
thoughtful
eyes
rested
on
them
,
but
it
was
plain
her
thoughts
were
elsewhere
.
</p>
<p>
“
How
sober
you
look
child
!
”
said
Marie
.
</p>
<p>
“
Are
these
worth
a
great
deal
of
money
,
mamma
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
To
be
sure
,
they
are
.
Father
sent
to
France
for
them
.
They
are
worth
a
small
fortune
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
wish
I
had
them
,
”
said
Eva
,
“
to
do
what
I
pleased
with
!
”
</p>
<p>
“
What
would
you
do
with
them
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
’d
sell
them
,
and
buy
a
place
in
the
free
states
,
and
take
all
our
people
there
,
and
hire
teachers
,
to
teach
them
to
read
and
write
.
”
</p>
<p>
Eva
was
cut
short
by
her
mother
’s
laughing
.
</p>
<p>
“
Set
up
a
boarding-school
!
Would
n’t
you
teach
them
to
play
on
the
piano
,
and
paint
on
velvet
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
’d
teach
them
to
read
their
own
Bible
,
and
write
their
own
letters
,
and
read
letters
that
are
written
to
them
,
”
said
Eva
,
steadily
.
“
I
know
,
mamma
,
it
does
come
very
hard
on
them
that
they
ca
n’t
do
these
things
.
Tom
feels
it
--
Mammy
does
,
--
a
great
many
of
them
do
.
I
think
it
’s
wrong
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Come
,
come
,
Eva
;
you
are
only
a
child
!
You
do
n’t
know
anything
about
these
things
,
”
said
Marie
;
“
besides
,
your
talking
makes
my
head
ache
.
”
</p>
<p>
Marie
always
had
a
headache
on
hand
for
any
conversation
that
did
not
exactly
suit
her
.
</p>
<p>
Eva
stole
away
;
but
after
that
,
she
assiduously
gave
Mammy
reading
lessons
.

CHAPTER
XXIII
</head>
<head>
Henrique
</head>
<p>
About
this
time
,
St.
Clare
’s
brother
Alfred
,
with
his
eldest
son
,
a
boy
of
twelve
,
spent
a
day
or
two
with
the
family
at
the
lake
.
</p>
<p>
No
sight
could
be
more
singular
and
beautiful
than
that
of
these
twin
brothers
.
Nature
,
instead
of
instituting
resemblances
between
them
,
had
made
them
opposites
on
every
point
;
yet
a
mysterious
tie
seemed
to
unite
them
in
a
closer
friendship
than
ordinary
.
</p>
<p>
They
used
to
saunter
,
arm
in
arm
,
up
and
down
the
alleys
and
walks
of
the
garden
.
Augustine
,
with
his
blue
eyes
and
golden
hair
,
his
ethereally
flexible
form
and
vivacious
features
;
and
Alfred
,
dark-eyed
,
with
haughty
Roman
profile
,
firmly-knit
limbs
,
and
decided
bearing
.
They
were
always
abusing
each
other
’s
opinions
and
practices
,
and
yet
never
a
whit
the
less
absorbed
in
each
other
’s
society
;
in
fact
,
the
very
contrariety
seemed
to
unite
them
,
like
the
attraction
between
opposite
poles
of
the
magnet
.
</p>
<p>
Henrique
,
the
eldest
son
of
Alfred
,
was
a
noble
,
dark-eyed
,
princely
boy
,
full
of
vivacity
and
spirit
;
and
,
from
the
first
moment
of
introduction
,
seemed
to
be
perfectly
fascinated
by
the
spirituelle
graces
of
his
cousin
Evangeline
.
</p>
<p>
Eva
had
a
little
pet
pony
,
of
a
snowy
whiteness
.
It
was
easy
as
a
cradle
,
and
as
gentle
as
its
little
mistress
;
and
this
pony
was
now
brought
up
to
the
back
verandah
by
Tom
,
while
a
little
mulatto
boy
of
about
thirteen
led
along
a
small
black
Arabian
,
which
had
just
been
imported
,
at
a
great
expense
,
for
Henrique
.
</p>
<p>
Henrique
had
a
boy
’s
pride
in
his
new
possession
;
and
,
as
he
advanced
and
took
the
reins
out
of
the
hands
of
his
little
groom
,
he
looked
carefully
over
him
,
and
his
brow
darkened
.
</p>
<p>
“
What
’s
this
,
Dodo
,
you
little
lazy
dog
!
you
have
n’t
rubbed
my
horse
down
,
this
morning
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Yes
,
Mas’r
,
”
said
Dodo
,
submissively
;
“
he
got
that
dust
on
his
own
self
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
You
rascal
,
shut
your
mouth
!
”
said
Henrique
,
violently
raising
his
riding-whip
.
“
How
dare
you
speak
?
”
</p>
<p>
The
boy
was
a
handsome
,
bright-eyed
mulatto
,
of
just
Henrique
’s
size
,
and
his
curling
hair
hung
round
a
high
,
bold
forehead
.
He
had
white
blood
in
his
veins
,
as
could
be
seen
by
the
quick
flush
in
his
cheek
,
and
the
sparkle
of
his
eye
,
as
he
eagerly
tried
to
speak
.
</p>
<p>
“
Mas’r
Henrique
!
--
”
he
began
.
</p>
<p>
Henrique
struck
him
across
the
face
with
his
riding-whip
,
and
,
seizing
one
of
his
arms
,
forced
him
on
to
his
knees
,
and
beat
him
till
he
was
out
of
breath
.
</p>
<p>
“
There
,
you
impudent
dog
!
Now
will
you
learn
not
to
answer
back
when
I
speak
to
you
?
Take
the
horse
back
,
and
clean
him
properly
.
I
’ll
teach
you
your
place
!
”
</p>
<p>
“
Young
Mas’r
,
”
said
Tom
,
“
I
specs
what
he
was
gwine
to
say
was
,
that
the
horse
would
roll
when
he
was
bringing
him
up
from
the
stable
;
he
’s
so
full
of
spirits
,
--
that
’s
the
way
he
got
that
dirt
on
him
;
I
looked
to
his
cleaning
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
You
hold
your
tongue
till
you
’re
asked
to
speak
!
”
said
Henrique
,
turning
on
his
heel
,
and
walking
up
the
steps
to
speak
to
Eva
,
who
stood
in
her
riding-dress
.
</p>
<p>
“
Dear
Cousin
,
I
’m
sorry
this
stupid
fellow
has
kept
you
waiting
,
”
he
said
.
“
Let
’s
sit
down
here
,
on
this
seat
till
they
come
.
What
’s
the
matter
,
Cousin
?
--
you
look
sober
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
How
could
you
be
so
cruel
and
wicked
to
poor
Dodo
?
”
asked
Eva
.
