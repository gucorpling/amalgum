Work
Out
the
Payback
Period
</head>
<p>
The
&quot;
payback
period
&quot;
is
an
accounting
metric
used
for
investment
decision
making
.
The
metric
is
very
simple
,
and
is
designed
to
estimate
how
quickly
a
company
will
recover
a
cash
investment
.
When
used
alone
,
the
payback
period
can
be
misleading
and
oversimplified
.
However
,
when
analyzed
alongside
other
decision-making
metrics
,
the
payback
period
can
be
clarifying
and
helpful
.
Learning
how
to
work
out
the
payback
period
for
a
particular
investment
or
project
is
a
matter
of
estimating
a
few
cash
flows
and
performing
a
simple
calculation
.

<list type="ordered">
<item>
Familiarize
yourself
with
the
basic
computation
of
the
payback
period
.
The
payback
period
specifies
how
quickly
(
in
years
)
the
cash
invested
in
a
particular
project
will
be
recovered
.
For
example
,
consider
a
project
that
requires
a
$
100,000
cash
outflow
immediately
,
but
is
expected
to
bring
in
an
additional
$
10,000
in
cash
each
year
for
20
years
.
The
payback
period
is
10
years
,
because
after
10
years
the
original
cash
outflow
has
been
recovered
(
$
10,000
*
10
=
$
100,000
)
.

Note
that
the
payback
period
calculation
does
not
take
the
time
value
of
money
into
account
.
Future
cash
flows
are
not
discounted
to
their
present
values
,
but
are
instead
used
at
face
value
.
</item>
<item>
Note
also
that
the
payback
period
only
considers
cash
flows
,
and
does
not
take
into
account
the
effect
of
depreciation
or
other
non-cash
expenses
.
This
,
along
with
the
time
value
exclusion
,
is
a
shortcoming
of
the
payback
calculation
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Assess
the
immediate
cash
outflow
associated
with
the
project
in
question
.
This
is
the
amount
that
must
be
paid
out
in
cash
at
the
start
of
a
project
.

For
example
,
consider
a
company
's
decision
to
buy
a
new
copy
machine
to
replace
an
old
one
.
The
machine
costs
$
10,000
,
and
is
expected
to
save
$
1000
in
toner
and
electricity
each
year
for
8
years
,
and
then
save
$
800
each
year
for
the
next
10
years
.
The
immediate
cash
outflow
associated
with
this
project
is
$
10,000
.
</item>

<item>
Assess
the
future
cash
flows
expected
from
a
project
.
These
cash
flows
should
be
estimated
before
undertaking
any
project
.
Before
calculating
the
payback
period
,
it
helps
to
write
these
cash
flows
down
on
paper
in
timeline
form
.
In
the
example
above
,
there
are
8
cash
flows
of
$
1000
,
followed
by
10
cash
flows
of
$
800
.
<figure rend="Work out the Payback Period Step 3.jpg">

<item>
Sum
together
the
future
cash
flows
until
you
recover
the
initial
cash
investment
.
Begin
adding
the
cash
flows
together
in
chronological
order
.
When
the
sum
is
equal
to
the
initial
outflow
,
you
have
found
the
payback
period
.

In
the
example
above
,
after
1
year
the
company
has
recovered
$
1000
.
After
5
years
,
the
company
has
recovered
$
5000
.
After
8
years
,
$
8000
has
been
recovered
.
After
10
years
,
$
9600
has
been
recovered
.
After
11
years
,
$
10,400
has
been
recovered
;
this
amount
exceeds
the
initial
investment
,
so
the
payback
period
must
be
between
10
and
11
years
.
</item>
<item>
The
cash
flow
in
year
11
was
$
800
.
After
$
400
of
this
cash
was
received
,
the
initial
investment
of
$
10,000
had
been
recovered
.
This
is
exactly
half
of
that
year
's
cash
flow
,
so
the
payback
period
for
this
investment
is
10.5
years
.

The

will
also
work
when
expressed

other

The
payback
period
should
always
be
used
in
conjunction
with
other
decision-making
metrics
,
such
as
return
on
investment
(
ROI
)
and
internal
rate
of
return
(
IRR
)
