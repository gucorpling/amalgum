government
minister
,
has
said
that
an
investigation
found
that
more

90
civilians
were
killed
in

Herat

province
.
&quot;
Most
are
women
and
children
&quot;
She
continued
:
&quot;
They
have
claimed
that
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Taliban">
Taliban
</ref>
were
there
.
They
must
prove
it
,
so
far
,
it
is
not
clear
for
us
why
the
coalition
conducted
the
air
strikes
.

<p>
Lt.
Col.
Rumi
Nielson-Green
,
a
spokeswoman
for
the
U.S.
military
,
said
30
Taliban
insurgents
were
killed
.
The
operation
targeted
a
local
Taliban
commander
,
Mullah
Siddiq
.
&quot;
We
're
confident
that
we
struck
the
right
compound
,
&quot;
she
said
.
</p>
<p>
Brig.
Gen.
Richard
Blanchette
,
a
spokesman
for
NATO
in
Afghanistan
,
said
investigators
verified
the
deaths
of
five
civilians
.
Probably
relatives
of
the
Taliban
commander
but
the
casualty
numbers
released
by
Afghan
officials
has
not
been
confirmed
by
NATO
.
</p>
<p>
Raouf
Ahmedi
,
a
spokesman
for
the
western
regional
command
of
the
Afghan
army
,
said
that
the
bodies
of
60
children
and
19
women
were
among
the
dead
when
Afghan
military
officials
inspected
the
site
on
Saturday
.
&quot;
We
could
n't
and
we
have
n't
found
any
identification
showing
they
are
Taliban
,
&quot;
Ahmedi
said
.
Conflicting
reports
had
earlier
stated
that
a
Taliban
commander
,
Mullah
Siddiq
,
was
among
those
killed
in
the
airstrike
.
</p>
<p>
La'l
Mohammad
Omarzaisaid
,
district
chief
,
said
the
bombed
houses
belonged
to
men
who
worked
as
security
guards
at
an
airstrip
used
by
international
troops
that
is
120km
south
of
the
city
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herat,%20Afghanistan">
Herat
</ref>
.
Many
of
the
dead
had
,
in
accordance
with
Afghan
tradition
,
gathered
to
mark
the
40th
day
since
the
killing
of
a
militia
commander
.
Ahmad
Nader
Nadery
,
an
Afghan
Independent
Human
Rights
Commission
researcher
,
said
15
houses
had
been
destroyed
and
others
were
damaged
.
He
also
confirmed
that
memorial
ceremony
was
being
held
for
Timor
Shah
,
deputy
militia
commander
allied
with
the
Afghan
police
.
The
death
was
related
to
a
personal
dispute
.
The
memorial
had
attracted
relatives
and
friends
from
outside
Azizabad
that
were
staying
overnight
in
the
village
.
</p>
<p>
General
Jalandar
Shah
Behnam
,
the
head
of
the
corps
for
western
Afghanistan
,
and
commando
major
Abdul
Jabar
were
fired
for
&quot;
negligence
and
concealing
facts
,
&quot;
by
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Hamid_Karzai">
Hamid
Karzai
</ref>
,
Afghanistan
's
president
.
The
presidential
decree
also
stated
that
&quot;
[
i]n
the
tragic
air
strike
and
irresponsible
and
imprecise
military
operation
in
Azizabad
village
in
Shindand
district
,
more
than
89
of
our
innocent
countrymen
,
including
women
and
children
,
were
martyred
.
&quot;
Karzai
had
earlier
appealed
to
the
U.S.
led
coalition
to
avoid
civilian
casualties
and
be
careful
.
</p>
<p>
In
a
statement
the
council
of
religious
leaders
for
western
Afghanistan
said
&quot;
Once
again
the
enemies
of
Islam
have
stained
their
hands
with
the
blood
of
innocent
people
...
we
,
the
Muslim
nation
,
will
not
accept
their
apologies
this
time
,
&quot;
and
demanded
a
trial
for
those
involved
.
A
demonstration
on
Saturday
by
villagers
and
relatives
of
the
victims
used
banners
that
read
&quot;
Death
to
America
&quot;
and
a
police
van
was
torched
.
</p>
<p>
Recently
an
Afghan
investigation
found
that
around
47
civilians
,
most
of
them
women
,
were
killed

in
coalition
air
strikes
when
they
gathered
