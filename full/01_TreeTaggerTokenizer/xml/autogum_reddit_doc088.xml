Hi
everyone
!
Today
’s
update
is
for
<hi rend="bold">
Wings

Fates
</hi>
,
but
we
’ll
also
be
looking
at
<hi rend="bold">
the
addition
of
a
new
tier
</hi>
in
the
list
,
which
brings
about
a
few
changes
.

#REMINDER
:
Units
should
be
judged
VERTICALLY
within
their
own
color
,
and
not
HORIZONTALLY
against
other
colors
.
#Also
,
the
tier
list
simming
and
range
criteria
have
changed
recently
.
To
review
the
changes
,

#The
New
Tier
<hi rend="bold">
A
new
empty
tier
between
9.5
and
9.0
has
been
added
,
allowing
us
to
have
more
granularity
between
tiers
.
</hi>
Tiers
for
Swords
,
especially
9.0
,
have
become
rather
bloated
,
and
it
became
difficult
to
differentiate
power
levels
with
the
existing
scale
.
There
were
minor
discrepancies
for
other
colors
as
well
.
<hi rend="bold">
The
old
9.0
is
now
the
new
8.5
;
everything
below
has
basically
fallen
as
well
.
</hi>
Some
units
in
the
old
9.5
and
9.0
have
either
fallen
or
risen
into
the
new
gap
.
*
<hi rend="bold">
Some
units
will
be
shown
as
moving
into
the
same
number
as
they
were
in
before
.
This
basically
means
they
have
risen
,
as
they
have
managed
to
resist
falling
with
their
former
tier-mates
.

</hi>
Warrior
Princess
is
an
interesting
weapon
.
Unfortunately
,
despite
its
effectiveness
against
Armors
,
the
sheer
sturdiness
of
that
class
prevents
her
from
reliably
OHKOing
most
of
them
,
while
DC
Armors
tend
to
have
little
trouble
OHKOing
Hinoka
in
return
due
to
her
low
physical
bulk
.
<hi rend="bold">
Firesweep
Bow
is
the
perfect
weapon
for
Hinoka
,
giving
her
ample
opportunity
to
dish
out
damage
from
multiple
ranges
due
to
her
mobility
,
and
eliminates
the
problem
of
her
poor
bulk
.
</hi>
Hinoka
's
good
Res
makes
her
effective
at
using
Ploys
as
well
to
extend
her

support
her

.
She
benefits
the
most
from

<hi rend="bold">
Overall
,
B

Hinoka
’s
middling
Atk
and
poor
bulk
prevents
her
from
handling
Arena

well
with
Warrior

,
but
her
Speed

make
her
a

Shigure

Shigure

run
several

well

including
the
Firesweep

for
uncounterable

,
combined
with
his
flier

for
safe
engagement

<hi rend="bold">
As
an
offensive
flier
with
access
to

,
Shigure
has
no
glaring
weaknesses

However
,
ratings
for

have
dropped

Kana

<hi rend="bold">
F

Kana
is
a
capable
dragon
unit

with
a
well-rounded

She
functions
similarly
to

as
a
fast
Enemy

specialist
,
with
the
standard
set
of
Lightning
Breath
,
Steady

<hi rend="bold">
Relative
to
Fae

F
!
Kana
has
greater
Speed
and
Defense
,
but
lower
HP
,
Attack

Resistance

Kana
's
greater
Speed
lets
her
avoid
getting
doubled
by
faster
units
.
That
said
,
common
Blue
units
tend
to
be
either
very
slow
or
double
Kana
anyway
,
so
it
is
not
a
particularly
huge
advantage
.
</hi>
F
!
Kana
joins
Fae
in
9.0
,
as
their
overall
performance
is
similar

<hi rend="bold">

<hi rend="bold">
Like
his
female

M

He
resembles
a
+Atk
F

Corrin
with
less
Def

much
more

bulk
,
but
lack
of
nature

gives
him
less

than
his
mother
.
<hi rend="bold">
Very
solid
unit
,
but
his
status
as
a
free
units
limits
his
potential

</hi>
<hi rend="bold">
Kaze
</hi>
placed
at
7.0
<hi rend="bold">
Kaze
’s
high
Speed
and
Resistance
stats
allow
him
to
be
a
solid
mage
killer
.
</hi>
However
,
his
Attack
stat
is
on
the
low
side
at
30
.
In
addition
,
his
HP
is
middling
,
cutting
into
his
magic
bulk
,
and
his
Defense
is
very
poor
,
giving
him
a
bad
matchup
against
Dragons
.
<hi rend="bold">
Kitty
Paddle
meshes
well
with
Kaze
’s
role
,
though
Barb
Shuriken
makes
him
more
effective
against
other
types
of
units
.
</hi>
Once
again
,
Kaze
is
held
back
by
lack
of
nature
tuning

Otherwise

he

be
more
on

<hi rend="bold">
Lyn

placed

Lyn
struggles

since
she
is
green
as
opposed
to
other
colorless
archers
,
who
are
more
flexible
in
picking
their
enemy
team
targets
.
</hi>
She
should
be
compared
to
green
mages
,
where
she
does
not
fare
particularly
well
,
due
to
defense
being
more
abundant
on
enemies
than
resistance

<hi rend="bold">
She
can
run
an
enemy
phase
set
decently
well
,

her
statline
does
not
really
support
Close

relegating
her
to
ranged
enemy
checking

These
and
other
factors
place
her

##Other

<hi rend="bold">
Alm
</hi>
:

<hi rend="bold">
As
impressive
as
Alm
's
combat
is
,
he
is
still
a
single

infantry
melee
unit
who
needs
to
approach
his
opponents
,
but
does
not
have
as
much
mobility
as
Elincia
.
</hi>
He
also
does
not
run
Distant

well
,
unlike
most
of
the
units
in
his
tier
.

<hi rend="bold">
Camilla
(
NY
)
</hi>
:
9.5
-&gt;
9.0
<hi rend="bold">
Camilla
’s
Firesweep
set
has
gotten
worse
over
time
,
due
to
refines
improving
bulk
in
various
ways
,
preventing
Camilla
from
getting
ORKOs
or
doubles
.
</hi>
Myrrh
is
also
a
big
obstacle
to
Camilla
,
as
Camilla
needs
two
attacks
to
defeat
her
.
<hi rend="bold">
Elincia
outperforms
Camilla
’s
Brave
Sword
set
by
far
with
Amiti

Zephiel

Leif
,
Mia
,
Soleil
,
Celica
,
Lucina
</hi>
:

9.0
<hi rend="bold">
These
swords
have
very
impressive
mixed
Phase
combat
and
run
DC
well
,
so
they
moved
back
up
into
the
new
9.0
.
</hi>
<hi rend="bold">
Fir

Karel
,
Vanguard
Ike
,
Ryoma
,
Siegbert
,
Olivia
</hi>
:
9.0
-&gt;
8.5
<hi rend="bold">
With
increased
granularity
these
swords
could
not
quite
compare
with
the
now
9.0
swords
for
different
reasons
.
</hi>
Fir
and
Karel
have
a
very
impressive
new
weapon
,
but
inferior
statlines
to
the
likes
of
Soleil
(
who
can
use
a
refined
Wo
Dao
for
effectively
38
Atk
and
41
Spd
)
,
so
they
are
more
dependent
on
Enemy
Phasing
their
first
opponent
,
while
the
faster
,
stronger
sword
units
rely
on
their
Specials
less
and
can
initiate
their
first
combat
with
much
higher
efficiency
.
<hi rend="bold">
Similarly
,
Vanguard
Ike
does
not
boast
the
mixed
phase
potential
that
the
swords
in
tier
9.0
do
.
</hi>
Ryoma
does
have
a
mixed
phase
,
but
his
statline
is
unfortunately
not
as
strong
as
the
newer
9.0
swords
like
Soleil
,
Mia
or
Celica
.
An
innate
DC
weapon
is
not
necessarily
better
than
using
a
refined
Slaying
Edge
or
Wo
Dao
and
the
DC
skill
,
as
that
most
of
the
time
means
he
uses
Steady/Warding
Breath
for
quicker
charges
.
However
,
with
Slaying
Edge
and
Wrath
,
Specials
will
always
be
available
on
Player
Phase
after
the
first
combat
.
<hi rend="bold">
Siegbert
did
not
move
up
,
as
he
is
mostly
a
Player
Phase
melee
impeded
by
trenches
.
He
does
run
a
DC
set
very
decently
,
but
cannot
compete
with
the
swords
above
him
in
that
regard
.
</hi>
Olivia
like
the
other
dancers
is
not
that
straightforward
to
tier
,
but
even
with
a
gem
weapon
,
her
and
Azura
can
die
to
enemies
they
have
weapon
type
advantage
against
,
so
she
did
not
move
back
up
into
9.0
.
*
<hi rend="bold">
Ike
</hi>
:
8.5

<hi rend="bold">
Original
Ike
has
not
aged
well

<hi rend="bold">
Cain

:

<hi rend="bold">
Cain

a
strictly
worse

than
Male
Corrin
,
but
the
latter
is
too
similar
to
the
other
6.5
swords
to
move
up
,
so
Cain
had
to
move
down
.

These
four
actually
do

because
they
struggle
quite
a
bit
against
very
common

Myrrh
(
and
depending
on
build
,
Fae
)
.
Offensive
statlines
of
32
Atk

a
bonus
can

thus
are
safer
to

more
reliable
than
the
mid-tier
Player

efficiency

With
some
mercy

he

###Lances
</hi>
The
introduction

made
us
look
at
low

mid-tier
lances
with
low

Sully
,
who
only
mildly
benefits
from
Harmonic
Lance
.
</hi>
Berkut
runs
the
aforementioned
sort
of
build
better
than
Clive
and
the
other
6.0
cavalry
,
so
he
deserves
a
bump
.

Lyn
has
absolutely
devastating
combat
results
even
if
she
is
running
Close
Counter
in
her
A
slot
,
for
a
very
impressive
performance
on
both
Phases
due
to
her
bulk
and
Speed
(
which
is
not
wasted
on
Enemy
Phase
)
.
This
puts
her
above
the
other
blue
mages
,
letting
her
jump
up
to
be
on
par
with
Gwendolyn
and
Nowi
.

With

fills
the
gap

the

his

not

Ike

7.5
<hi rend="bold">
It
looks
like
he
dropped
two
tiers
,
but
it
is
really
just
one
.
</hi>
B
!
Ike
does
not
perform
well
in
a
metagame
dominated
by
dragons
-
his
Nowi
matchup
is
extremely
shaky
,
and
his
performance
against
Green
Dragons
is
poor
.
<hi rend="bold">
If
he
runs
Distant
Counter
to
fight
mages
,
his
Res
is
still
poor
for
tanking
,
and
it
prevents
Urvan
’s
effect
from
activating
.
</hi>
Dorcas
has
formidable
mixed
bulk
,
and
can
shrug
those
kinds
of
attacks
off

<hi rend="bold">
B

Ike
is
not
that
much
better
than
the
Enemy
Phase
Axe
units
below
him
,
so
he
drops
.
</hi>
<hi rend="bold">
Arthur
</hi>
:

<hi rend="bold">
Arthur
can
actually
invest
in
his
Res
bulk
and
dump
his
Speed
for
a
Green
infantry
version
of
Florina/Jagen
and
achieve
impressive
results
.
His
performance
easily
rivals
higher
tier
Axes
,
and
thus
he
moves
up
.
</hi>
<hi rend="bold">
Narcian

<hi rend="bold">
Narcian
runs
the
same
set
as
Arthur
,
but
a
bit
worse
.
Being
a
flier
helps
,
so
he
gets
a
slight
bump
.

He

Female
Grima
moved
back
up
into

being
really
solid

flier
across

However
,
her
ranged
matchup
against
common
threats
is
shaky
-
it
is
still
not
straightforward
to
tier
her
.
</hi>
All

moved
down
,
while
B

Hinoka
filled
in
the
gap
between
B

Lyn
(
Sacae
’s
Blessing
still
makes
her
stronger
)
and
Bridelia
(
she
has
more
Atk
,
but
is
infantry
)
.
<hi rend="bold">
Daggers
effectively
all
moved
down
,
because
PA

Olivia
did
not
move
into
the
new
9.0
,

everything
below
her
stayed
.
</hi>
All

look
like
they
have
moved
up
in
