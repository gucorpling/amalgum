<p>
Hooke
grew
up
far
from
impoverished
.
His
great-grandfather
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphrey_Hooke">
Humphrey
Hooke
</ref>
,
was
the
sheriff
of
Bristol
in
1614
and
mayor
in
1629
.
Abraham
’s
grandfather
,
Thomas
,
went
on
to
be
sheriff
in
1634
.
The
merchant
’s
father
,
Sir
Humphrey
,
was
also
a
merchant
,
and
was
mayor
in
1643
.
He
was
elected
by
the
city
along
with
John
Knight
as
Burgess
who
represented
them
in
Parliament
in
1661
,
though
Hooke
requested
Lord
Ossory
be
placed
in
his
stead
.
When
Ossory
was
called
onto
the
King
’s
private
council
,
Humphrey
was
placed
in
his
elected
position
,
and
was
knighted
for
his
courtesy
.
Upon
his
death
in
1677
,
he
donated
680
British
Pounds
to
St.
Stephen
Parish
,
where
8
shillings
in
bread
a
week
was
to
be
distributed
at

Sir
Humphrey
is
noted
as
having
built
Ashley
court
on
Ashley

for
a
residence
,
as
well
as
owning
another
mansion
on

a
country
residence

It
is
likely
that
Abraham
inherited
at
least
one
or
all
three
of
these
locations
and
resided
in
them
,
though
it
is
unlikely
that
they
exist
to

Abraham
Hooke
's
ships
often
sailed
to
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bight_of_Biafra">
Bite
of
Biafra
</ref>
which
is
in
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Guinea">
Gulf
of
Guinea
</ref>
.
The
merchant
and
his
company
sent
the
ships
<hi rend="italic">
Anna
and
Sarah

,
<hi rend="italic">
Rebecca
</hi>
and
the
<hi rend="italic">
Tiverton
</hi>
to
the
Bight
of
Biafra
and
the
Gulf
of
Guinea
Islands
.
Another
popular
place
his
ships
traveled
to
was
Gambia
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gambia">
The
Gambia
</ref>
was
one
of
the
most
popular
places
for
merchants
like
Hooke
to
acquire
their
human
cargo
because
of
its
geographical
locale
and
proximity
to
Bristol
and
the
New
World
.
Shorter
distances
traveled
aboard
these
sailing
vessels
meant
fewer
deaths
among
the
slaves
during
the
middle
passage
.
Because
of
this
,
however
,
Gambian
slaves
were
more
expensive
.
Thus
slave
merchants
such
as
Abraham
Hooke
were
often
willing
to
travel
further
along
the
coast
of
West
Africa
,
places
like
the
Bite
of
Biafra
,
to
purchase
slaves
for
less
money
.

Drop
offs

<p>
Abraham
Hooke
's
slave
ships
dropped
off
most
of
his
human
cargo
in
the
Caribbean
,
in
places
like
Jamaica
.
Hooke
's
merchant
ships
dropped
off
slaves
to
feed
the
islands
demand
for
labor
,
sugar
being
plantation
owner
's
main
cash
crop
.
During
that
time
,
Jamaica
was
under
English
rule
and
Jamaican
elites
were
financially
bound
to
England
.
Because
of
the
ties
between
Jamaica
and
England
,
Hooke
,
as
well
as
other
merchants
,
dropped
off
many
of
their
slaves
in
Jamaica
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-5">
[

</ref>
Hooke
's
captains
also
sold
slaves
in
Barbados
to
owners
of
the
numerous
sugar
plantations
,
helping
to
create
one
of
the
most
profitable
sugar
plantation
systems
in
the
world
.

Personal
ventures
</head>
<p>
Hooke
’s
own
ventures
in
slave-trading
began
in
1703
,
when
the
<hi rend="italic">
Cowslip
</hi>
brought
128
African
slaves
to
Jamaica
.
There
was
a
decade
hiatus
before
he
continued
to
traffic
humans
,
having
regular
ventures
from
1713
all
the
way
to
1729
.
There
,
there
is
another
hiatus
,
ending
in
1736
when
the
<hi rend="italic">
Betty
Snow
</hi>
brought
400
slaves
(
the
largest
haul
in
a
single
voyage
funded
by
Hooke
)
to
be
sold
in
Virginia
.
In
total
,
Hooke
would
engage
in
the
transport
of
5,976
Africans
to
be
sold
into
slavery
over
the
course
of
27
known
voyages
,
4,828
of
whom
would
survive
the
Trans-Atlantic
crossing
.
This
means
the
fatality
rate
aboard
his
ships
was
19.3
%
,
a
fair
amount
greater
than
the
average
of
15
%
during
the
early
eighteenth
century
.
</p>
<p>
Oftentimes
,
once
the
ships
had
unloaded
their
human
cargo
,
they
would
load
up
on
a
product
in
the
New
World
to
be
sold
in
the
Old
.
In
particular
,
Hooke
’s
ships
transported
a
notable
amount
of
redwood
,
with
some
“
Guinea
grains
”
being
imported
in
his
earlier
voyages
.
