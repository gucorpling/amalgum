&quot;
Congratulations
on
winning
a
third
term
.
As
a
three-term
prime
minister
I
can
tell
you
that
's
when
things
get
rough
,
&quot;
Blair
told
Bronconnier
.
</p>
<p>
During
the
speech
he
talked
about
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Canada">
Canada
</ref>
on
the
world
stage
,
the
controversial
military
role
in
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Afghanistan">
Afghanistan
</ref>
,
defending
the
country
in
war-devastated
places
,
as
well
as
other
large
issues
facing
Canada
.
</p>
<p>
Blair
said
it
's
not
about
being
on
the
left
or
right
side
of
politics
,
it
's
about
being
open
or
closed
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
If
we
want
to
win
,
we
ca
n't
just
be
for
democracy
and
freedom
.
We
have
to
be
for
justice
and
fairness
,
&quot;
Blair
said
to
the
audience
that
paid
CA$
400
to
attend
the
event
.
&quot;
It
's
a
battle
of
ideas
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
If
we
're
going
to
fight
this
terrorism
off
,
we
're
going
to
have
to
show
them
we
're
as
tough
as
they
are
...
and
stay
the
course
.
&quot;
Blair
said
even
though
it
'll
be
a
long-road
in
the
war
it
's
important
to
not
give
up
the
fight
against
&quot;
the
forces
of
extremism
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Blair
is
an
Envoy
in
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartet%20on%20the%20Middle%20East">
Quartet
on
the
Middle
East

which

.
He
become
Envoy
the
same
day
he
stepped
down
as
PM
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
This
morning
I
looked
at
your
local
papers
and
saw
'
Premier
Under
Fire
'
.
And
I
thought
,
'
Oh
God
,
why
,
what
have
I
done
now
?
'
before
realising
that
I
was
n't
PM
anymore
.
I
'm
still
adjusting
.
&quot;

<p>
He
also
commented
about

Alberta

'
s

saying
,
&quot;
I
'm
just
glad
it
's
not
my
decision
,
&quot;
and
after
three
terms
of
being
PM
he
's
&quot;
learned
when
to
keep
my
mouth
shut
.
&quot;
Alberta
has
the
second
largest
oil
reserves
in
the
world
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu%20Dhabi%20National%20Energy%20Company">

In
relation
to
that
,
Blair
said
,
&quot;
Calgary
is
not
only
the
new
centre
of
Canada
or
North
America
,
but
a
global
centre
for
the
world
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
often
say
to
people
,
Canada
will
become
one
of
the
most
powerful
nations
in
the
world
.
&quot;
He
also
pointed
out
,
&quot;
As
power
grows
...
so
does
more
responsibility
.
What
you
need
to
do
is
carry
with
it
your
optimistic
spirit
.
You
're
a
country
that
can
easily
play
as
large
a
role
as
anyone
else
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Optimism
is
something
you
get
very
easily
when
you
come
to
Canada
,
&quot;
he
said
relating
to
Canada
's
strong
alliances
with
other
countries
.
He
said
Canada
has
a
&quot;
can-do
&quot;
attitude
.
</p>
<p>
After
,
he
sat
down
with

premier
