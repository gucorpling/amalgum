Ubeda
</head>
<p>
Compact
and
walkable
,
the
small
city
of
<hi rend="bold">
Úbeda
</hi>
can
be
found
just
off
the
main

As
a
refreshing
change
,
Moorish
heritage
is
not
the
main
draw
here
;
it
's
the
fantastic
collection
of
Italian-inspired
Renaissance
era
palaces
and
churches
.
</p>
<head>
Understand
</head>
<p>
These
myriad
graceful
hills
have
likely
settled
since
at
least
Roman
times
,
although
the
town
of
Úbeda
would
n't
come
to
be
known
as
such
until
the
rule
of
the
Emir
<hi rend="italic">
Abd
ar-Rahman
II
</hi>
(
822
–
852
)
.
The
town
would
be
ruled
by
the
Moors
for
centuries
,
until
falling
into
Christian
hands
during
the
<hi rend="italic">
Reconquista
</hi>
,
in
1233
.
</p>
<p>
After
years
of
internecine
squabbling
between
minor
nobles
,
Christian
Monarchs
Isabella
and
Ferdinand
feared
that
they
would
soon
turn
against
one
another
.
The
fortifications
of
the
<hi rend="italic">
Alcázar
</hi>
were
commanded
to
be
pulled
down
in
order
to
stimulate
cooperation
between
the
rival
factions
.
This
—
perhaps
along
with
small
quality
of
life
improvements
for
the
peasants
—
seems
to
have
done
the
trick
.
</p>
<p>
At
the
dawn
of
the
16th
century
,
the
relative
peace
and
Úbeda
's
fortuitous
location
allowed
them
to
prosper
through
trade
.
The
towns
fortunes
improved
again
when
emperor
Charles
V
married
into
a
local
family
,
spurring
a
rash
of
construction
.
Many
of
the
fine
buildings
in
town
today
date
from
this
time
.
</p>
<p>
Eventually
the
political
spotlight
turned
elsewhere
.
Over
the
years
a
series
of
natural
disasters
and
wars
took
their
toll
on
the
local
economy
,
and
the
town
was
brought
to
its
lowest
point
.
As
the
20th
century
rolled
on
,
agricultural
improvements
allowed
more
olives
to
be
grown
.
Today
tourism
and
cultural
events
are
the
newest
additions
to
Úbeda
's
growing
repertoire
.

Considered
to
be
one
of
the
best
examples
of
Renaissance
architecture
in
Spain
,
the
palace
was
built
between
1546
and
1565
.
Architect
<hi rend="italic">
Andrés
de
Vandelvira
</hi>
designed
this
palace
as
a
Roman
house
,
creating
its
entire
structure
around
a
large
courtyard
with
a
fountain
in

center

The

facade
is

One
of
the
oldest
in
Úbeda
,
this
church
is
believed
to
have
been
built
some
time
during
the
13th
century
.
Its
location
in
a
central
square
and
its
proximity

old

,
made
it
the
perfect
choice
for
city
council
meetings
throughout

Initially
conceived

fame
