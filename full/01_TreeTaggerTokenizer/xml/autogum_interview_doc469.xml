Why
have
you
chosen
to
involve
yourself
in
the
political
process
?
Why
did
you
choose
to
run
in
this
constituency
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
I
have
been
conflicted
in
past
elections
because
there
were
no
candidates
I
could
vote
for
with
a
clear
conscience
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
What
prior
political
experience
do
you
have
?
What
skills
and
insight
can
you
bring
to
office
,
from
other
non-political
positions
you
may
have
held
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
I
have
been
an
elected
committee
person
for
the
Canadian
Security
Union
and
an
appointed
Rep
for
the
CAW
.
I
am
experienced
in
responding

I
represent
.

<hi rend="bold">
What
makes
you
the
most
desirable
of
all
candidates
running
in
the
riding
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
My
best
asset
is
that
I
am
not
a
modern
day
politician
.
I
believe
in
saying
straight
out
where
I
stand
on
the
issues
.
I
believe
in
truth
as
opposed
to
the
moral
relativism
that
is
so
prevalent
today
.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">
What
do
you
feel
are
the
three
most
important
issues
to
voters
in
your
riding
?
Are
these
the
same
top
three
issues
that
are
most
important
to
you
?
What
would
you
do
to
address
these
issues
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
Education
</p>
<p>
Economy
</p>
<p>
Agriculture
and
industry
</p>
<p>
I
would
add
fighting
to
end
the
tragedy
of
abortion
and
providing
women
with
choices
they
can
live
with
when
facing
an
unexpected
pregnancy
.

<hi rend="bold">
What
should
be
the
first
order
of
business
in
the
39th
Legislative
Assembly
?

</p>
<p>
Ending
legalized
abortion
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Are
the
property
taxes
in
your
riding
at
a
fair
level

the
amount

received

</hi>
</p>
<p>
No.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
How
can
the
province
lead
the
way
in
stimulating
job
creation
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
Providing
incentives
to
businesses
to
create
jobs
and
encouraging
the
feds
to
reintroduce
good
legislation
like
the
Autopact
.
We
are
reaping
the
rewards
of
bad
agreements
like
FTAA
and
NAFTA
.
Capital
is
flowing
out
of
Canada
to
countries
with
cheap
labour
and
poor
conditions
for
workers
.
In
return
we
get
substandard
products
like
antifreeze
flavoured
toothpaste
.

What
role
,

any

does
“

play
in

and
the
campaign

party

<p>
Any
medium

makes
our

more

is
very
positive

I
am
excited

the
potential

more
youth
