</head>
<p>
In

1781
,
the
Zand
prince
Ali
Murad
Khan
put

Khan
Zand
and
all
his
brothers
to
death
when
he
invaded
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiraz">
Shiraz
</ref>
.
Jafar
Khan
was
the
only
one
who
was
spared
,
because
he
privately
had
reached
an
agreement
with
Ali
Murad
Khan
.
While
Ali
Murad
Khan
was
in
northern
Iran
in
1785
,
Jafar
Khan
took
the
opportunity
to
besiege
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isfahan">
Isfahan
</ref>
.
Ali
Murad
Khan
then
marched
towards
the
city
in
order
to
defend
it
,
but
died
on
11
February
at
Murchakhur
,
a
town

but
they
withdrew
at

Jafar
Khan
then
withdrew
to
Isfahan
.
When
Agha
Mohammad
Khan
heard
about
the
Zand
invasion
of
Isfahan
and
its
surroundings
,
he
quickly
marched
towards
the
city
,
which
made
Jafar
Khan
retreat
back
to
Shiraz
once
again
.
In
1788
,
Agha
Mohammad
advanced
closely
to
Shiraz
,
where
he
hoped
to
bait
Jafar
Khan
out
of
Shiraz
,
which
was
strongly
fortified
,
making
it
very
hard
to
besiege
.
Unfortunately
for
Agha
Mohammad
Khan
,
Jafar
Khan
stayed
in
the
city
,
which
made
Agha
Mohammad
Khan
return
to
Isfahan
,
where
appointed
his
brother
Ali
Qoli
as
its
new
governor
,
thus
succeeding
Jafar
Qoli
Khan
.
He
then
left
for
Tehran
.

With
Agha
Mohammad
once
again
in
the
north
,
Jafar
Khan
began
raising
an
army
to
prepare
another
attack
against
Isfahan
and
its
surroundings
.
When
Ali
Qoli
found
out
about
it
,
he
sent
a
group
of
tribesmen
to
a
city
south
to
Isfahan
,
named
Qumishah
.
However
,
Jafar
Khan
managed
to
easily
defeat
them
.

thereafter
retreated
to
Kashan
.

Agha
Mohammad
Khan
,
learning
of
this
,
rapidly
marched
towards
Isfahan
,
which
made
Jafar
Khan
withdraw
to
Shiraz
once
again
.
Agha
Mohammad
Khan
,
who
was
too
unconfident
to
try
and
capture
Shiraz
,
then
went
back
to
Tehran
.
Jafar
Khan
was
murdered
