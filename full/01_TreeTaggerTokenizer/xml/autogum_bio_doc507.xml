of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Thanet">

</ref>
,
Charnock
spent
most
of
his
life
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combwich">
Combwich
</ref>
,
a
small
village
on
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steart_Peninsula">
Steart
Peninsula
</ref>
,
near
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgwater">
Bridgwater
</ref>
in
the
west
of
England
.
His
unpublished
notebooks
are
useful
,
not
just
for
an
understanding
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabethan_era">
Elizabethan
</ref>
attitudes
towards
alchemy
in
general
,
but
for
the
insight
they
give
to
Charnock
's
life
and
thoughts
.
Apart
from
the
usual
preoccupations
of
his
profession
,
he
also
had
an
amateur
interest
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_colonization_of_the_Americas">
Atlantic
exploration
</ref>
,
and
in
his
study
he
had
an
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrolabe">
astrolabe
</ref>
,
maps
,
a
globe
and
other
navigational
instruments
.
He
rather
quaintly
described
the
difficulties
he
found
in
trying
to
decipher
Medieval
English
texts
on
alchemy
,
which
were
&quot;
as
harde
to
my
understanding
as
yff
I
had
harde
one
rede
a
booke
off
the
language
off
the
natione
which
dwell
in
the
fourth
parte
off
the
worlde
named
America
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
His
uncle
,
also
called
Thomas
Charnock
,
had
been
an
alchemist
,
as
well
as
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confessor">
confessor
</ref>
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VII_of_England">
Henry
VII
</ref>
.
Thomas
'
interest
in
the
subject
appears
to
have
been
stimulated
when
he
inherited
his
uncle
's
books
while
in
his
teens
.
Although
he
married
in
1562
,
and
had
two
children
,
he
preferred
the
life
of
scholarly
solitude
,
made
clear
in
the
preamble
of
the
treatise
he
wrote
for
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England">
Elizabeth
I
</ref>
.
He
says
that
his
pursuit
of
the
Philosopher
's
Stone
has
in
large
measure
been
impeded
by
&quot;
worldly
necessities
&quot;
,
and
that
the
said
Stone
is
reserved
for
men
who
have
the
gift
of
&quot;
solitariness
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Charnock
took
this
seriously
enough
to
vainly
ask
Elizabeth
to
allow
him
to
carry
on
his
experiments
in
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_London">
Tower
of
London
</ref>
,
or
another
&quot;
solitary
place
.
&quot;
This
was
probably
stimulated
by
the
hostility
of
his
neighbours
,
which
forced
him
to
barricade
himself
in
his
cottage
.
It
seems
obvious
from
the
hostility
he
engendered
locally
that
his
neighbours
had
deep
superstitious
fears
,
which
Charnock
did
much
to
encourage
,
describing
himself
as
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magus">
magus
</ref>
as
well
as
a
philosopher
,
who
had
mastery
of
&quot;
dark
and
misty
terms
.
&quot;
After
his
death
,
it
was
reported
that
no-one
would
live
in
his
former
cottage
,
which
was
&quot;
troublesome
and
haunted
by
spirits
and
that
its
owner
had
a
reputation
as
a
troublesome
person
and
a
conjurer
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
His
work
was
tiresome
and
demanding
,
requiring
him
,
amongst
other
things
,
to
keep
a
fire
burning
at
a
constant
temperature
.
Quite
often
he
would
wake
up
in
the
night
,
troubled
that
things
were
not
going
well
.
Concerns
over
servants
,
fires
,
and
the
cost
of
fuel
were
steady
preoccupations
.
He
was
also
pursued
by
fairly
constant
bad
luck
:
&quot;
God
send
me
better
fortune
or
else
I
am
clean
discouraged
and
will
turn
from
philosophy
to
husbandry
and
go
and
get
me
unto
the
plough
.
&quot;
When
England
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_War_of_1551 – 1559">
went
to
war
with
France
</ref>
in
1557
,
the
local
Justice
of
the
Peace
,
who
seems
to
have
been
a
personal
enemy
,
made
sure
that
Thomas
was
forced
into
military
service
.
In
frustration
,
he
took
a
hatchet
to
his
equipment
,
smashing
glasses
and
pots
alike
.
Undaunted
,
Charnock
was
back
at
his
experiments
seven
years
later
.
</p>
<p>
Charnock
himself
was
always
aware
of
the
ambiguity
of
his
art
,
warning
that
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Bacon">
Roger
Bacon
</ref>
,
the
founder
of
English
alchemy
,
had
come
dangerously
close
to
the
occult
,
and
had
ultimately
been
unsuccessful
in
his
quest
for
the
Stone
because
the
Devil
was
his
familiar
.
His
own
search
for
the
Stone
proceeded
in
the
face
of
one
failure
after
another
.
Even
so
,
he
kept
his
fires
burning
for
three
years
constantly
,
which
&quot;
brought
him
more
joy
than
any
worldly
goods
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
He
died
in
April
1581
.
Charnock
was
buried
in
Otterhampton
Church
,
near
Bridgwater
.
