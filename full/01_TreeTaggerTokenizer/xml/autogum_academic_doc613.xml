The
biochemical
and
structural
analyses
of
a
new
haloalkane
dehalogenase
DmxA
from
Antarctic
bacterium
<hi rend="italic">
Marinobacter
</hi>
sp
.
ELB17
revealed
the
paradoxical
stability
of
the
enzyme
.
Despite
its
psychrophilic
origin
,
DmxA
wt
exhibited
the
highest
apparent
melting
temperature
(
<hi rend="italic">
T
</hi>
m
,
app
=
65.9
±
0.1
°C
)
of
all
biochemically
characterized
HLD-II
members
,
and
the
second
highest
of
all
thus
far
characterized
wild-type
HLDs
.
The
only
HLD
exhibiting
higher
apparent
melting
temperature
than
DmxA
was
DhmeA
from
halophilic
archaea
<hi rend="italic">
Haloferax
mediterranei
</hi>
ATCC
33500
,
which
belongs
to
the
subfamily
HLD-III
.
The
enzyme
DhmeA
from
subfamily
HLD-III
is
a
multimeric
protein
with
<hi rend="italic">
T
</hi>
m
,
app
=
70.6
°C
.
The
tertiary
structure
of
DhmeA
is
not
available
at
this
moment
,
preventing
its
direct
comparison
with
DmxA
.
Several
thermostable
enzymes
from
psychrophiles
and
mesophiles
have
been
reported
in
the
literature
;
however
,
their
unexpected
thermostability
remains
poorly
understood
.
Only
two
studies
focused
on
such
paradoxically
thermostable
enzymes
from
psychrophilic
and
mesophilic
origin
have
attempted
so
far
to
explain
the
structural
basis
of
their
stability
,
suggesting
that
either
the
flexibility
of
a
global
structure
or
the
presence
of
extra
disulfide
and
salt
bridges
are
responsible
for
the
unusual
thermal
stability
of
these
enzymes
.
</p>
<p>
In
this
study
,
several
structural
features
of
DmxA
wt
were
analyzed
in
detail
to
explain
its
extraordinary
stability
.
DmxA
wt
was
found
to
form
a
dimer
via
a
cysteine
bridge
,
which
may
be
formed
only
after
heterologous
expression
in
<hi rend="italic">
E.
coli
</hi>
and
purification
,
while
is
less
likely
to
occur
in
the
cytoplasm
of
the
original
host
organism
.
This
is
the
first
observation
ever
of
HLD
oligomerization
mediated
by
the
covalent
bond
.
Thus
far
,
the
reported
dimers
of
DbjA
and
DbeA
were
formed
through
the
hydrophobic
interactions
of
C-terminal
α-helices
.
Although
cysteines
in
protein
structures
often
serve
as
stabilizing
elements
,
the
S-S
bridge
between
DmxA
wt
units
in
its
dimeric
form
did
not
have
any
effect
on
the
stability
or
the
activity
of
the
enzyme
.
Furthermore
,
our
experiments
revealed
that
the
presence
or
absence
of
such
cysteine
bridge
neither
influenced
any
of
the
catalytic
properties
nor
the
storage
stability
of
the
enzyme
.
It
is
also
worth
mentioning
that
the
DmxA
wt
oligomer
equilibrium
varies
in
solution
,
and
only
a
small
part
of
the
enzyme
(
up
to
30
%
)
is
present
as
a
dimer
.
Therefore
,
the
disulfide
bridge
does
not
contribute
to
the
overall
stability
of
the
enzyme
.
</p>
<p>
A
unique
composition
of
the
catalytic
pentad
was
observed
both
in
DmxA
wt
sequence
and
crystal
structure
,
containing
a
glutamine
instead
of
the
typical
asparagine
present
in
other
members
of
the
subfamily
HLD-II
.
Another
HLD
with
an
unusual
halide-stabilizing
residue
(
DatA
containing
tyrosine
instead
of
tryptophan
)
was
described
earlier
.
In
this
case
,
the
unique
halide
stabilizing
residue
decreased
enzyme
stability
(
by
3.5
°C
)
and
only
moderately
affected
enzyme
specificity
.
The
position
of
the
Q40
side
chain
in
DmxA
wt
structure
disables
its
functioning
as
a
halide-stabilizing
residue
.
When
replacing
the
glutamine
with
asparagine
,
the
melting
temperature
of
the
enzyme
decreased
by
2
°C
(
<hi rend="italic">
T
</hi>
m
,
app
=
63.9
±
0.2
°C
)
confirming
a
small
stabilizing
effect
of
glutamine
interactions
in
the
protein
core
.
Moreover
,
an
interesting
shift
in
substrate
specificity
from
SSG-I
to
SSG-IV
was
observed
on
the
variant
DmxA
Q/N
.
Such
changes
in
the
substrate
specificity
in
HLDs
are
normally
only
be
achieved
after
a
sophisticated
protein
engineering
.
In
our
case
,
a
single
mutation
was
sufficient
to
shift
the
enzyme
substrate
specificity
group
.
</p>
<p>
A
deeper
analysis
of
DmxA
wt
structure
revealed
an
unusually
small
hydrophobic
pocket
containing
the
enzyme
active
site
connected
with
the
surrounding
solvent
by
very
narrow
and
closed
tunnels
.
The
presence
of
phenylalanine
and
methionine
as
bottleneck
residues
was
not
overly
surprising
since
they
often
provide
stabilization
of
protein
structures
via
hydrophobic
interactions
.
Replacement
of
bulky
residues
with
alanines
in
the
main
tunnel
opened
the
tunnel
and
suppressed
stabilization
of
the
tunnel
structure
via
interactions
provided
by
the
bottleneck
residues
.
This
led
to
the
destabilization
of
the
protein
core
represented
by
9
°C
decrease
of
the
enzyme
apparent
melting
temperature
.
Engineering
of
the
tunnels
connecting
buried
enzyme
active
site
with
the
surrounding
solvent
has
previously
been
described
as
a
powerful
strategy
for
enzyme
stabilization
.
In
this
study
,
we
proved
that
narrow
tunnels
play
a
crucial
role
in
the
paradoxical
stability
of
DmxA
due
to
multiple
van
der
Waals
and
hydrophobic
interactions
,
although
they
are
not
the
only
factor
responsible
for
the
unique
properties
of
the
enzyme
.
</p>
<p>
To
decipher
the
high
stability
of
the
new
haloalkane
dehalogenase
DmxA
wt
,
we
investigated
three
unique
features
of
the
enzyme
,
corresponding
to
three
possible
sources
of
its
stabilization
.
Both
replacements
of
glutamine
with
asparagine
and
opening
of
the
main
tunnel
brought
desired
outcomes
in
terms
of
decreased
stability
and
improved
activity
.
More
importantly
,
introducing
only
two
mutations
,
we
managed
to
turn
the
thermostable
enzyme
into
a
mesophilic-like
counterpart
,
with
a
melting
temperature
comparable
to
that
of
other
related
HLDs
and
a
significantly
improved
catalytic
performance
.
If
we
combined
the
effects
of
mutations
in
DmxA
Q/N
and
DmxA
MF/AA
variants
,
the
consequent
enzyme
would
result
in
a
highly
active
catalyst
.
