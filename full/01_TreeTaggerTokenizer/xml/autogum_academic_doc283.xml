Self-Similar
Graph
Actions
</head>
<p>
We
review
the
properties
of
self-similar
graph
actions
defined
by
Exel
and
Pardo
.
All
the
material
in
this
section
is
taken
from
works
.
</p>
<p>
Suppose
that
is
a
directed
graph
,
where
is
the
set
of
vertices
,
is
the
set
of
edges
,
<hi rend="italic">
d
</hi>
is
the
domain
map
,
and
<hi rend="italic">
r
</hi>
is
the
range
map
.
A
directed
graph
<hi rend="italic">
E
</hi>
is
called
<hi rend="italic">
finite
</hi>
if
and
are
finite
sets
.
For
a
natural
number
<hi rend="italic">
n
</hi>
,
a
path
of
length
<hi rend="italic">
n
</hi>
in
<hi rend="italic">
E
</hi>
is
a
finite
sequence
of
the
form
where
and
for
every
<hi rend="italic">
i
</hi>
.
The
domain
and
range
of
<hi rend="italic">
a
</hi>
are
defined
by
and
,
respectively
.
A
vertex
is
considered
as
a
path
of
length
0
,
with
.
If
<hi rend="italic">
a
</hi>
and
<hi rend="italic">
b
</hi>
are
paths
such
that
,
then
we
denote
the
path
obtained
by
juxtaposing
<hi rend="italic">
a
</hi>
and
<hi rend="italic">
b
</hi>
by
.
We
use
to
denote
the
length
of
<hi rend="italic">
a
</hi>
.
For
every
non-negative
integer
<hi rend="italic">
n
</hi>
,
we
denote
the
set
of
paths
of
length
<hi rend="italic">
n
</hi>
in
<hi rend="italic">
E
</hi>
by
and
define
.
The
set
of
right-infinite
paths
of
the
form
is
denoted
by
.
</p>
<p>
The
product
topology
of
a
discrete
set
<hi rend="italic">
E
</hi>
is
defined
on
.
The
cylinder
set
for
each
is
defined
by
</p>
<p>
Then
,
the
collection
of
all
such
cylinder
sets
forms
a
basis
for
the
product
topology
on
.
</p>
<p>
An
automorphism
of
a
directed
graph
<hi rend="italic">
E
</hi>
is
a
bijective
map
,
such
that
for
,
,
and
on
.
An
action
of
a
group
<hi rend="italic">
G
</hi>
on
a
directed
graph
<hi rend="italic">
E
</hi>
is
a
group
homomorphism
from
<hi rend="italic">
G
</hi>
to
the
group
of
all
automorphisms
of
<hi rend="italic">
E
</hi>
.
To
simplify
the
notation
,
we
will
adopt
the
shorthand
notation
</p>
<p>
A
<hi rend="italic">
self-similar
graph
action
</hi>
consists
of
a
directed
graph
<hi rend="italic">
E
</hi>
and
an
action
of
a
group
<hi rend="italic">
G
</hi>
on
<hi rend="italic">
E
</hi>
by
automorphisms
,
with
a
<hi rend="italic">
one-cocycle
</hi>
,
such
that
for
all
and
,
</p>
<p>
As
Exel
and
Pardo
showed
in
(
[
6
]
Proposition
2.4
)
,
the
<hi rend="italic">
G
</hi>
action
and
one-cocycle
extend
to
via
the
inductive
formula
for
with
,
so
that
we
have
for
every
with
.
In
addition
,
the
<hi rend="italic">
G
</hi>
action
induces
an
action
of
<hi rend="italic">
G
</hi>
on
given
by
</p>
<p>
It
is
not
difficult
to
obtain
the
following
properties
of
restrictions
.
For
and
with
,
</p>
<p>
A
self-similar
graph
action
is
called
pseudo-free
if
for
any
satisfying
and
,
it
holds
that
.
We
say
that
the
<hi rend="italic">
G
</hi>
action
on
is
topologically
free
if
is
dense
in
for
every
.
A
path
in
is
said
to
have
an
entry
if
there
is
at
least
one
such
that
has
more
than
one
element

Inverse
Semigroups
and
Groupoids
</head>
<p>
Suppose
that
is
a
self-similar
graph
action
.
An
inverse
semigroup
of
is
defined
as
follows
(
[
6
]
§4
)
,
with
the
binary
operation
defined
by
and
the
unitary
adjoint
operation
defined
by
</p>
<p>
Then
,
is
an
inverse
semigroup
containing
zero
,
whose
idempotent
semi-lattice
is
given
by
</p>
<p>
The
inverse
semigroup
has
a
canonical
action
on
in
terms
of
partial
homeomorphisms
:
The
domain
of
is
and
</p>
<p>
We
note
that
is
the
empty
map
.
</p>
<p>
Now
,
we
briefly
describe
groupoids
of
germs
of
inverse
semigroups
and
groups
.
Let
<hi rend="italic">
X
</hi>
be
a
locally
compact
Hausdorff
space
and
<hi rend="italic">
S
</hi>
an
inverse
semigroup
(
or
a
group
)
acting
on
<hi rend="italic">
X
</hi>
.
Then
,
consider
a
set
,
and
define
an
equivalence
relation
on
by
if
and
only
if
and
<hi rend="italic">
s
</hi>
and
<hi rend="italic">
t
</hi>
coincide
on
a
neighborhood
of
<hi rend="italic">
x
</hi>
.
The
equivalence
class
of
every
is
called
the
germ
of
<hi rend="italic">
s
</hi>
at
<hi rend="italic">
x
</hi>
,
denoted
by
.
The
set
of
every
germ
is
a
groupoid
,
called
the
groupoid
of
germs
of
<hi rend="italic">
S
</hi>
on
<hi rend="italic">
X
</hi>
,
whose
operations
are
given
by
</p>
<p>
The
unit
space
is
identified
with
<hi rend="italic">
X
</hi>
.
When
two
germs
and
satisfy
,
their
product
is
defined
as
</p>
<p>
A
basis
for
a
topology
is
given
by
the
collection
of
sets
of
the
form
</p>
<p>
The
groupoid
of
germs
of
the
action
on
is
denoted
by
,
and
called
the
<hi rend="italic">
Cuntz
–
Pimsner
groupoid
</hi>
of
.
</p>
<p>
We
recall
that
an
inverse
semigroup
<hi rend="italic">
S

has
an
order
relation
defined
