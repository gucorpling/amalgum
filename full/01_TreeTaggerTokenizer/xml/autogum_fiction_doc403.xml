CHAPTER
XIV
.
WESSEX
GETS
BUSY
</head>
<p>
Innes
rose
from
the
chair
usually
occupied
by
Paul
Harley
as
Detective
Inspector
Wessex
,
with
a
very
blank
face
,
walked
into
the
office
.
Innes
looked
haggard
and
exhibited
unmistakable
signs
of
anxiety
.
Since
he
had
received
that
dramatic
telephone
message
from
his
chief
he
had
not
spared
himself
for
a
moment
.
The
official
machinery
of
Scotland
Yard
was
at
work
endeavouring
to
trace
the
missing
man
,
but
since
it
had
proved
impossible
to
find
out
from
where
the
message
had
been
sent
,
the
investigation
was
handicapped
at
the
very
outset
.
Close
inquiries
at
the
Savoy
Hotel
had
shown
that
Harley
had
not
been
there
.
Wessex
,
who
was
a
thorough
artist
within
his
limitations
,
had
satisfied
himself
that
none
of
the
callers
who
had
asked
for
Ormuz
Khan
,
and
no
one
who
had
loitered
about
the
lobbies
,
could
possibly
have
been
even
a
disguised
Paul
Harley
.
</p>
<p>
To
Inspector
Wessex
the
lines
along
which
Paul
Harley
was
operating
remained
a
matter
of
profound
amazement
and
mystification
.
His
interview
with
Mr.
Nicol
Brinn
had
only
served
to
baffle
him
more
hopelessly
than
ever
.
The
nature
of
Paul
Harley
’s
inquiries
--
inquiries
which
,
presumably
from
the
death
of
Sir
Charles
Abingdon
,
had
led
him
to
investigate
the
movements
of
two
persons
of
international
repute
,
neither
apparently
having
even
the
most
remote
connection
with
anything
crooked
--
was
a
conundrum
for
the
answer
to
which
the
detective
inspector
sought
in
vain
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
can
see
you
have
no
news
,
”
said
Innes
,
dully
.
</p>
<p>
“
To
be
perfectly
honest
,
”
replied
Wessex
,
“
I
feel
like
a
man
who
is
walking
in
his
sleep
.
Except
for
the
extraordinary
words
uttered
by
the
late
Sir
Charles
Abingdon
,
I
fail
to
see
that
there
is
any
possible
connection
between
his
death
and
Mr.
Nicol
Brinn
.
I
simply
ca
n’t
fathom
what
Mr.
Harley
was
working
upon
.
To
my
mind
there
is
not
the
slightest
evidence
of
foul
play
in
the
case
.
There
is
no
motive
;
apart
from
which
,
there
is
absolutely
no
link
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Nevertheless
,
”
replied
Innes
,
slowly
,
“
you
know
the
chief
,
and
therefore
you
know
as
well
as
I
do
that
he
would
not
have
instructed
me
to
communicate
with
you
unless
he
had
definite
evidence
in
his
possession
.
It
is
perfectly
clear
that
he
was
interrupted
in
the
act
of
telephoning
.
He
was
literally
dragged
away
from
the
instrument
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
agree
,
”
said
Wessex
.
“
He
had
got
into
a
tight
corner
somewhere
right
enough
.
But
where
does
Nicol
Brinn
come
in
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
How
did
he
receive
your
communication
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Oh
,
it
took
him
fairly
between
the
eyes
.
There
is
no
denying
that
.
He
knows
something
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
What
he
knows
,
”
said
Innes
,
slowly
,
“
is
what
Mr.
Harley
learned
last
night
,
and
what
he
fears
is
what
has
actually
befallen
the
chief
.
”
</p>
<p>
Detective
Inspector
Wessex
stood
beside
the
Burmese
cabinet
,
restlessly
drumming
his
fingers
upon
its
lacquered
surface
.
“
I
am
grateful
for
one
thing
,
”
he
said
.
“
The
press
has
not
got
hold
of
this
story
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
They
need
never
get
hold
of
it
if
you
are
moderately
careful
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
For
several
reasons
I
am
going
to
be
more
than
moderately
careful
.
Whatever
Fire-Tongue
may
be
,
its
other
name
is
sudden
death
!
It
’s
a
devil
of
a
business
;
a
perfect
nightmare
.
But
--
”
he
paused
--
</p>
<p>
“
I
am
wondering
what
on
earth
induced
Mr.
Harley
to
send
that
parcel
of
linen
to
the
analyst
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
The
result
of
the
analysis
may
prove
that
the
chief
was
not
engaged
upon
any
wild-goose
chase
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
By
heavens
!
”
Wessex
sprang
up
,
his
eyes
brightened
,
and
he
reached
for
his
hat
,
“
that
gives
me
an
idea
!
”
</p>
<p>
“
The
message
with
the
parcel
was
written
upon
paper
bearing
the
letterhead
of
the
late
Sir
Charles
Abingdon
.
So
Mr.
Harley
evidently
made
his
first
call
there
!
I
’m
off
,
sir
!
The
trail
starts
from
that
house
!
”
</p>
<p>
Leaving
Innes
seated
at
the
big
table
with
an
expression
of
despair
upon
his
face
,
Detective
Inspector
Wessex
set
out
.
He
blamed
himself
for
wasting
time
upon
the
obvious
,
for
concentrating
too
closely
upon
the
clue
given
by
Harley
’s
last
words
to
Innes
before
leaving
the
office
in
Chancery
Lane
.
It
was
poor
workmanship
.
He
had
hoped
to
take
a
short
cut
,
and
it
had
proved
,
as
usual
,
to
be
a
long
one
.
Now
,
as
he
sat
in
a
laggard
cab
feeling
that
every
minute
wasted
might
be
a
matter
of
life
and
death
,
he
suddenly
became
conscious
of
personal
anxiety
.
He
was
a
courageous
,
indeed
a
fearless
,
man
,
and
he
was
subconsciously
surprised
to
find
himself
repeating
the
words
of
Nicol
Brinn
:
“
Be
careful
--
be
very
careful
!
”
With
all
the
ardour
of
the
professional
,
he
longed
to
find
a
clue
which
should
lead
him
to
the
heart
of
the
mystery
.
</p>
<p>
Innes
had
frankly
outlined
the
whole
of
Paul
Harley
’s
case
to
date
,
and
Detective
Inspector
Wessex
,
although
he
had
not
admitted
the
fact
,
had
nevertheless
recognized
that
from
start
to
finish
the
thing
did
not
offer
one
single
line
of
inquiry
which
he
would
have
been
capable
of
following
up
.
That
Paul
Harley
had
found
material
to
work
upon
,
had
somehow
picked
up
a
definite
clue
from
this
cloudy
maze
,
earned
the
envious
admiration
of
the
Scotland
Yard
man
.
</p>
<p>
Arrived
at
his
destination
,
he
asked
to
see
Miss
Abingdon
,
and
was
shown
by
the
butler
into
a
charmingly
furnished
little
sitting
room
which
was
deeply
impressed
with
the
personality
of
its
dainty
owner
.
It
was
essentially
and
delightfully
feminine
.
Yet
in
the
decorations
and
in
the
arrangement
of
the
furniture
there
was
a
note
of
independence
which
was
almost
a
note
of
defiance
.
Phyllis
Abingdon
,
an
appealingly
pathetic
figure
in
her
black
dress
,
rose
to
greet
the
inspector
.
