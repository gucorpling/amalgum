Introduction
</head>
<p>
Information
about
the
position
or
movement
of
a
user
’s
limb
can
be
used
to
monitor
physical
activities
or
for
human-machine-interface
applications
.
Such
information
can
be
extracted
externally
from
the
user
using
camera
technology
or
through
a
wearable
approach
using
sensors
worn
by
the
user
.
Compared
to
the
camera
approach
,
the
wearable
approach
is
not
constrained
to
a
fixed
environment
and
it
offers
greater
freedom
to
the
user
in
terms
of
mobility
.
Among
many
wearable
approaches
,
the
one
that
relies
on
force
myography
(
FMG
)
has
gained
ever-increasing
traction
among
researchers
over
the
past
20
years
.
</p>
<p>
FMG
is
a
non-invasive
technique
to
decipher
the
position
or
movement
of
a
limb
based
on
changes
in
the
stiffness
of
the
corresponding
musculotendinous
complex
(
MC
)
against
a
default
state
.
The
changes
in
stiffness
of
the
targeted
MC
is
often
monitored
by
placing
a
force
transducer
on
the
targeted
location
with
a
preload
force
.
This
preload
force
corresponds
to
the
default
state
,
which
is
usually
chosen
as
a
state
where
the
limb
is
in
a
relaxed
position
.
However
,
depending
on
the
application
,
the
default
state
can
be
arbitrarily
chosen
.
The
basic
principle
of
FMG
is
similar
to
the
palpation
technique
that
a
clinician
uses
for
identifying
different
muscles
of
a
limb
.
For
example
,
while
we
are
squeezing
one
of
our
hands
,
we
can
feel
some
of
the
extensor
muscles
become
stiffer
by
placing
fingers
on
the
bulk
of
the
forearm
.
For
FMG
,
we
replace
the
fingers
with
force
transducers
.
The
stiffer
the
MC
is
,
the
higher
the
pressure
the
transducers
will
detect
.
</p>
<p>
The
term
force
myography
,
a.k.a.
FMG
,
was
first
introduced
in
the
work
of
Wininger
et
al.
,
but
such
a
technique
has
been
exploited
as
early
as
the
1950s
.
Specifically
,
a
device
named
“
French
Electric
Hand
”
could
be
controlled
by
a
pneumatic
force
transducer
located
within
a
transcranial
amputee
socket
.
A
user
could
control
the
opening
or
closing
of
the
gripper
by
contracting
the
residual
limb
muscles
against
the
transducer
.
However
,
such
an
approach
did
not
gain
momentum
due
to
the
limitation
of
the
sensor
and
computer
technologies
in
those
days
.
</p>
<p>
Fast
forward
to
the
late
1990s
,
researchers
once
again
reignited
the
interest
of
using
such
an
approach
for
controlling
prosthetic
devices
.
For
example
,
Abboudi
et
al.
developed
a
soft
socket
that
was
embedded
with
three
pneumatic
pressure
transducers
for
controlling
a
multi-finger
prosthesis
.
The
input
signals
from
the
transducers
were
mapped
to
different
commands
based
on
signal
energy
.
Instead
of
just
opening
and
closing
a
gripper
,
this
multi-sensor
setup
demonstrated
the
feasibility
of
controlling
complex
hand
prosthesis
through
the
FMG
approach
.
Subsequently
,
the
same
research
group
was
able
to
increase
the
number
of
transducers
within
the
socket
to
allow
more
sophisticated
control
of
the
prosthetic
devices
.
</p>
<p>
Other
than
using
pneumatic
pressure
sensors
to
detect
the
changes
in
muscle
stiffness
,
researchers
also
proposed
to
use
the
resistive
polymer
thick
film
(
RPTF
)
sensor
as
the
main
sensing
element
due
to
its
miniature
size
and
high
affordability
.
For
instance
,
in
2006
,
Lukowicz
’s
group
demonstrated
the
potential
use
of
the
RPTF
sensors
to
identify
different
limb
movements
,
including
both
upper
and
lower
limb
actions
.
The
same
group
also
demonstrated
the
potential
use
of
such
a
technique
to
identify
different
activities
of
daily
living
.
Many
of
the
early
works
between
the
late
1990s
and
2000s
focused
on
exploring
the
potential
use
of
FMG
by
examining
the
signal
morphology
in
a
few
limited
scenarios
.
These
works
opened
many
untapped
research
opportunities
in
the
fields
of
human-machine-interface
and
activity
monitoring
applications
.

<p>
Starting
in
the
late
2010s
,
there
was
an
increasing
interest
in
the
development
of
FMG
technology
,
as
shown
by
the
number
of
academic
publications
depicted
in
<figure>

.
A
total
of
76
papers
were
found
between
1999
and
mid-2019
(

list
shown
in
Table
A1

the
Appendix
A
