<p>
It
is
dark
here
in
the
forest
.
The
leaves
rustle
over
our
head
,
black
against
the
last
gold
of
the
sky
.
The
moss
is
soft
and
warm
.
We
shall
sleep
on
this
moss
for
many
nights
,
till
the
beasts
of
the
forest
come
to
tear
our
body
.
We
have
no
bed
now
,
save
the
moss
,
and
no
future
,
save
the
beasts
.
</p>
<p>
We
are
old
now
,
yet
we
were
young
this
morning
,
when
we
carried
our
glass
box
through
the
streets
of
the
City
to
the
Home
of
the
Scholars
.
No
men
stopped
us
,
for
there
were
none
about
[
-from-
]
the
Palace
of
Corrective
Detention
,
and
the
others
knew
nothing
.
No
men
stopped
us
at
the
gate
.
We
walked
through
{
+the+
}
empty
passages
and
into
the
great
hall
where
the
World
Council
of
Scholars
sat
in
solemn
meeting
.
</p>
<p>
We
saw
nothing
as
we
entered
,
save
the
sky
in
the
great
windows
,
blue
and
glowing
.
Then
we
saw
the
Scholars
who
sat
around
a
long
table
;
they
were
as
shapeless
clouds
huddled
at
the
rise
of
[
-the-
]
{
+a+
}
great
sky
.
There
were
{
+the+
}
men
whose
famous
names
we
knew
,
and
others
from
distant
lands
whose
names
we
had
not
heard
.
We
saw
a
great
painting
on
the
wall
over
their
heads
,
of
the
twenty
illustrious
men
who
had
invented
the
candle
.
</p>
<p>
All
the
heads
of
the
Council
turned
to
us
as
we
entered
.
These
great
and
wise
of
the
earth
did
not
know
what
to
think
of
us
,
and
they
looked
upon
us
with
wonder
and
curiosity
,
as
if
we
were
a
miracle
.
It
is
true
that
our
tunic
was
torn
and
stained
with
brown
stains
which
had
been
blood
.
We
raised
our
right
arm
and
we
said
:
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Our
greeting
to
you
,
our
honored
brothers
of
the
World
Council
of
Scholars
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Then
Collective
0-0009
,
the
oldest
and
wisest
of
the
Council
,
spoke
and
asked
:
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Who
are
you
,
our
brother
?
For
you
do
not
look
like
a
Scholar
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Our
name
is
[
-Equality-
]
{
+Equity+
}
7-2521
,
&quot;
we
answered
,
&quot;
and
we
are
a
Street
Sweeper
of
this
City
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Then
[
-is-
]
{
+it+
}
was
[
-as-
]
if
a
great
wind
had
stricken
the
hall
,
for
all
the
Scholars
spoke
at
once
,
and
they
were
angry
and
frightened
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
A
Street
Sweeper
!
A
Street
Sweeper
walking
in
upon
the
World
Council
of
Scholars
!
It
is
not
to
be
believed
!
It
is
against
all
the
rules
and
all
the
laws
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
But
we
knew
how
to
stop
them
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Our
brothers
!
&quot;
we
said
.
&quot;
We
matter
not
,
nor
our
transgression
.
It
is
only
our
brother
men
who
matter
.
Give
no
thought
to
us
,
for
we
are
nothing
,
but
listen
to
our
words
,
for
we
bring
you
a
gift
such
as
[
-had-
]
{
+has+
}
never
been
brought
to
men
.
Listen
to
us
,
for
we
hold
the
future
of
mankind
in
our
hands
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Then
they
listened
.
</p>
<p>
We
placed
our
glass
box
[
-upon-
]
{
+on+
}
the
table
before
them
.
We
spoke
of
it
,
and
of
our
long
quest
,
and
of
our
tunnel
,
and
of
our
escape
from
the
Palace
of
Corrective
Detention
.
Not
a
hand
moved
in
that
hall
,
as
we
spoke
,
nor
an
eye
.
Then
we
put
the
wires
to
the
box
,
and
they
all
bent
forward
and
sat
still
,
watching
.
And
we
stood
still
,
our
eyes
upon
the
wire
.
And
slowly
,
slowly
as
a
flush
of
blood
,
a
red
flame
trembled
in
the
wire
.
Then
the
wire
glowed
.
</p>
<p>
But
terror
struck
the
men
of
the
Council
.
They
leapt
to
their
feet
,
they
ran
from
the
table
,
and
they
stood
pressed
against
the
wall
,
huddled
together
,
seeking
the
warmth
of
one
another
's
bodies
to
give
them
courage
.
</p>
<p>
We
looked
upon
them
and
we
laughed
and
said
:
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Fear
nothing
,
our
brothers
.
There
is
a
great
power
in
these
wires
,
but
this
power
is
tamed
.
It
is
yours
.
We
give
it
to
you
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Still
they
would
not
move
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
We
give
you
the
power
of
the
sky
!
&quot;
we
cried
.
&quot;
We
give
you
the
key
to
the
earth
!
Take
it
,
and
let
us
be
one
of
you
,
the
humblest
among
you
.
Let
us
[
-all-
]
work
together
,
and
harness
this
power
,
and
make
it
ease
the
toil
of
men
.
Let
us
throw
away
our
candles
and
our
torches
.
Let
us
flood
our
cities
with
light
.
Let
us
bring
a
new
light
to
men
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
But
they
looked
upon
us
,
and
suddenly
we
were
afraid
.
For
their
eyes
were
still
,
and
small
,
and
evil
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Our
brothers
!
&quot;
we
cried
.
&quot;
Have
you
nothing
to
say
to
us
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Then
Collective
0-0009
moved
forward
.
They
moved
to
the
table
and
the
others
followed
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Yes
,
&quot;
spoke
Collective
0-0009
,
&quot;
we
have
much
to
say
to
you
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
sound
of
their
[
-voices-
]
{
+voice+
}
brought
silence
to
the
hall
and
to
[
-be-
]
{
+the+
}
beat
of
our
heart
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Yes
,
&quot;
said
Collective
0-0009
,
&quot;
we
have
much
to
say
to
a
wretch
who
have
broken
all
the
laws
and
who
boast
of
their
infamy
!
How
dared
you
think
that
your
mind
held
greater
wisdom
[
-that-
]
{
+than+
}
the
minds
of
your
brothers
?
And
if
the
[
-Councils-
]
{
+Council+
}
had
decreed
that
you
[
-should-
]
be
a
Street
Sweeper
,
how
dared
you
think
that
you
could
be
of
greater
use
to
men
than
in
sweeping
the
streets
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
How
dared
you
,
gutter
cleaner
,
&quot;
spoke
Fraternity
9-3452
,
&quot;
to
hold
yourself
as
one
alone
and
with
the
thoughts
of
[
-the-
]
one
and
not
of
[
-the-
]
many
?
