your

do

want
it
to
stop
because
you
'll
be
late
.
Here
are
some
hacks
to
help
get
you
to
floor
faster
.

In
some
elevators
,
simply
pressing
your
floor
and
holding
it
will
do
the

You

all
the
way
to
your
floor
.

&quot;
button
.
When
you
get
on
the
elevator
,
press
the
&quot;
Close
Door
&quot;
button

Often
,
this
button
will
be
two
triangles
pointing

each
other
.
Continue
holding
the
&quot;
Close
Door
&quot;
button
as
you
push
your

some
elevators

This
combination
often
works
on
Otis
,
Desert
,
and
Dover
elevators
.

<item>
Note
that
sometimes
the
&quot;
Close
Door
&quot;
button
is
just
a
placebo
for
impatient
riders
,
so
this
trick
may
not
work
.

Cancel
other
highlighted
floors
.
In
some
elevators
,
you
can
cancel
floors
that
have
already
been
pressed
.
Of
course
,
if
people
see
you
do
so
,
they
will
probably
not
be
very
happy
.
Or
,
they
may
press
their
floor
button
again
.

The
simplest
method
is
to
double
press
the
button
,
which
works
in
Mitsubishi
Electric
.
In
other
brands
,
such
as
Fujitec
,
pressing
it
five
times
works
.
Another
method
is
to
hold
the
&quot;
Open
Door
&quot;
button
while
pressing
the
floor
button
twice
.

Use
your
foot
.
Some
people
suggest
that
you
can
use
your
foot
to
keep
the
door
from
opening
.
Simply
put
your
foot
on
the
middle
of
the
elevator
door
,
covering
the
edges
of
the
door
.
In
theory
,
the
sole
of
your
shoe
will
keep
the
door
from
opening
on
floors
.

Ask

building
manager

If
you
're
cozy
with

manager

you
may

to
get
the
secret

code

him
or
her
.
However
,
you
may
need
to
promise
to
use
it
only
for
good
.

just
ask

Ask
your
firefighter
friends
.
Firefighters
have
master
keys
that
work
on
most
elevators
,
as
they
need
them
in
case
of
emergency
.
If
you
know
someone
in
the
profession
,
you
may
be
be
able
to
convince
him
or
her
to
give
you
a
copy
of
the
elevator
's
key
.

However
,
understand
that
your
firefighter
friend
is
likely
to
be
reluctant
.
Putting
master
keys
in
the
hands
of
the
public
can
be
dangerous
and
possibly
even
illegal
.
Check
the
legality
of
having
such
a
key
in
your
area
.

Check
eBay
.
If
you
fail
in
your
quest
,
you
can
also
check
eBay
for
master
keys
.
You
can
look
for
all-access
keys
that
should
work
in
a
variety
of
elevators
.
Most
of
these
have
four
sides
to
work
in
multiple
types
of
elevators
.

Buying
keys
is
somewhat
of
a
legal
gray
area
.
Check
to
see
if
it
's
legal
in
your
state
before
purchasing
one
.

However
,
to
make
sure
the
key
you
buy
works
on
your
elevator
,
you
may
need
to
do
a
little
research
.
Look
at
the
make
and
model
of
your
elevator
,
which
is
usually
listed
inside
the
elevator
.
Use
that
information
to
find
out
what
kind
of
key
it
takes
.

Use
the
key
.
To
use
the
key
,
insert
it
in
the
keyhole
when
you
get
in
the
elevator
.
You
may
need
to
try
more
than
one
if
it
's
four-sided
.
Leave
the
key
in
.
Push
the
button
of
your
floor
to
get
an
express
ride
.

Realize
that
these
hacks
will
not
work
on
every
elevator
.
In
fact
,
some
people
contend
that
the
code
hacks
do
not
work
at
all
.
</item>
<item>
Use
these
hacks
sparingly
,
especially
in
large
office
buildings
,
where
there
are
busy
people
with
places
to
be
.
