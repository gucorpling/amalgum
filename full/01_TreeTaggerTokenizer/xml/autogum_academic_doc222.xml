A
high
bypass
twin
spool
mixing-exhaust
turbofan
engine
was
studied
in
this
paper
,
of
which
the
schematic
description
is
shown

.
The
airflow
was
supplied
by
a
single
inlet
.
Airflow
passed
through
the
fan
and
separated
into
two
streams
—
one
passed
through
engine
core
path
,
and
the
other
passed
through
the
bypass
duct
.
Fuel
was
injected
in
the
combustor
and
burned
to
produce
the
hot
gas
to
drive
the
turbines
.
The
fan
and
low
pressure
compressor
(
LPC
)
were
driven
by
a
low
pressure
turbine
(
LPT
)
,
whereas
the
high
pressure
compressor
(
HPC
)
was
driven
by
a
high
pressure
turbine
(
HPT
)
.
The
airflow
left
through
the
nozzle
.
The
notations
used
in
this

and

Mechanical
system
dynamics
due
to
rotating
inertias
constituted
the
most
important
contribution
to
engine
transient
behavior
.
Thus
,
rotating
dynamics
were
the
most
important
dynamics
to
be
considered
.
In
light
of
this
,
the
state
vector
was
chosen
as

Newton

law

rotating
masses

Considering
air

mass
,
power
,
and
momentum
conservation
laws
,
a
general
gas
turbine
simulation
was
designed
using
the
concept
in
.
The
engine
design
operation
data
and
characteristic
maps
of
rotating
components
such
as
fan
,
compressor
,
HPT
,
and
LPT
were
loaded
to
the
general
simulation
for
obtaining
a
certain
turbofan
engine
model
.
The
nonlinear
model
representing
a
turbofan
engine
was
given
by

)
where

the
output

In
the
engine
involved
in
this
paper
,
the
available
sensors
were
The
function
and
are

respectively
,
the
engine
process
and
measurement
expressions

The
engine
was
coded
with
C
language
and
packaged
by
Dynamic
Link
Library

)
for

environment
.
Taylor
approximation
was
applied
to
the
engine
model
Equation
(

)
at
the
equilibrium
point
(

)
,
and
retaining
constant
and
first-order
terms
yielded
the
following
state
variable
model
(
SVM
)
:

Equation
(

can
be
further
depicted
as
(

)
where
,
,
,
and
are
the
system
matrices
with
appropriate
dimensions
,
and
,
,
and
.
For
simplicity
,
the
sign
“
”
in
Equation
(

)
was
omitted
in
the
following
deductions
.
In
addition
,
the
quantities
of
different
variables
in
Equation
(
4
)
were
far
away
from
each
other
.
For
instance
,
the
normal
physical
quantity
of
at
the
design
point
was
about
15,012
r/min
,
whereas
the
normal
physical
value
of
fuel
flow
at
the
design
point
was
around
0.3606
kg/s
.
The
large
difference
in
the
magnitudes
of
various
model
variables
would
lead
to
large
difference
of
matrix
singular
values
in
the
SVM
,
and
it
produced
a
big
condition
number
of
the
system
matrix
.
The
larger
the
condition
number
was
,
the
harder
it
was
to
compute
a
matrix
inverse
.
Hence
,
physical
operating
parameters
in
the
in-flight
model
were
performed
by
parameter
normalization

Hybrid
Fitting
Method
for
Linearization
</head>
<p>
The
system
matrices
played
an
important
role
in
the
steady
and
transient
performance
of
the
SVM
.
There
are
commonly
two
ways
to
compute
the
system
matrices
,
these
being
partial
derivative
method
and
fitting
method
.
In
the
former
method
,
partial
derivative
in
the
element
of
system
matrices
is
computed
by
perturbing
one
state
variable
,
and
other
state
variables
remain
unchanged
.
However
,
in
practice
it
is
merely
impossible
that
only
one
state
changes
while
another
remains
unchanged
by
engine
nature
;
thus
,
models
solved
by
partial
derivative
method
lack
accuracy
,
especially
during
dynamic
process
.
The
fitting
method
generates
the
system
matrices
’
elements
with
the
object
function
of
least
square
errors
between
the
component-level
model
(
CLM
)
and
model
responses
to
step
inputs
.
Choosing
the
perturbing
amplitude
and
direction
relies
on
the
experiences
—
they
closely
affect
to
the
SVM
modeling
accuracy
.
In
addition
,
the
curve
part
of
step
response
data
mainly
depicts
the
system
dynamics
,
and
the
remainder
of
the
data
shows
the
system
steady
behavior
.
Because
the
different
part
is
processed
in
the
same
way
,
it
is
thus
hard
to
address
the
steady
and
transient
performance
of
the
SVM
at
the
same
time
.
</p>
<p>
In
this
paper
,
a
hybrid
fitting
method
was
developed
from
the
combination
of
partial
perturbing
and
fitting
methods
.
The
matrices
and
were
related
to
the
transient
stage
,
whereas
the
matrices
and
related
to
steady
stage
of
step
response
.
The
initials
of
matrices
and
were
obtained
by
the
partial
perturbing
method
,
and
steady-state
component
was
used
to
compute
the
initials
of
matrices
and
.
The
initials
of
matrices
and
were
directly
computed
from
the
steady
terminal
values
of
one-control-variable
step
response
by
algebraic
operation
.
The
initials
of
these
system
matrices
were
acquired
from
the
above
implementations
,
and
then
the
fitting
method
was
employed
to
obtain
the
optimal
system
matrices
,
which
follow
the
least
square
errors
.
The
detailed
procedure
of
the
hybrid
fitting
approach
is
given
as
follows
