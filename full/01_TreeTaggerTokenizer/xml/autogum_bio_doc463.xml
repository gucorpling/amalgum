In
November
1626
,
he
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Prevost">
Claude
Prevost

appeared
before
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_of_Zeeland">
Chamber
of
Zeeland
</ref>
with
a
proposal
to
establish
a
colony
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guyana">
Guyana
</ref>
and
requesting
the
WIC
to
provide
ships
and
30
or
40
men
.
The
WIC
agreed
and
,
at
separate
meetings
from
November
23
–
26
and
December
10
–
24
,
the
members
discussed
where
to
send
them
.
While
it
was
suggested
Prevost
to
be
sent
to
either
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_River">

,

Oyapock
</ref>
or
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essequibo_River">
Essequibo
</ref>
,
it
was
decided
that
van
Ryen
alone
would
colonize
Oyapok
.
</p>
<p>
On
January
22
,
1627
,
Jan
van
Ryen
left
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flushing,_Netherlands">
Flushing
</ref>
with
three
ships
and
184
men
(
including
36
colonists
)
.
The
small
fleet
was
commanded
by
Admiral
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrick_Jacobszoon_Lucifer">
Hendrick
Jacobszoon
Lucifer
</ref>
and
included
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galeyn_van_Stabels">
Galeyn

in
the

and
Jan
Pieterse
in
the
<hi rend="italic">
Leeuwin
</hi>
(
all
three
had
visited
the
area
previously
,
Lucifer
and
van
Stapels
having
carried
Captain
Oudaen
's
expedition
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corupa">
Corupa
</ref>
in
1625
)
.
After
two
months
,
van
Ryen
and
his
expedition
arrived
at
their
destination
on
March
10
.
Shortly
after
landing
,
they
encountered
three
Europeans
living
in
the
area
.
One
of
the
men
,
Jan
Hendricksz
,
had
reportedly
lived
in
the
jungles
for
so
long
a
time
that
he
found
it
nearly
impossible
to
speak
the
Dutch
language
.
These
men
claimed
to
be
the
surviving
members
of
a
Dutch
colony
previously
established
in
the
Amazon
by
a
Captain
Oudaen
some
time
before
.
According
to
Hendricksz
,
the
colony
was
one
of
several
attacked
by
the
Spanish
(
or
possibly
the
Portuguese
)
.
The
Dutch
fought
against
their
attackers
for
half
a
day
and
forced
to
flee
after
7
or
8
men
had
been
killed
fleeing
in
their
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longboats">
longboats
</ref>
to
a
nearby
English
settlement
where
they
took
refuge
.
However
,
the
Spanish
followed
them
and
both
the
Dutch
and
English
were
forced
to
fight
.
All
the
English
were
killed
as
well
as
many
of
the
Dutch
,
including
Oudaen
.
Lieutenant
Pieter
Bruyne
took
command
and
left
for
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oyapok_River">
Oyapok
River
</ref>
with
46
of
the
survivors
,
however
he
was
killed
by
his
sergeant
in
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutiny">
mutiny
</ref>
soon
after
.
Quarreling
amongst
themselves
,
the
men
split
into
several
groups
and
eventually
settled
among
the
local
native
tribes
.
</p>
<p>
There
are
differing
accounts
of
what
happened
to
Jan
van
Ryen
's
colony
.
One
account
claims
Jan
van
Ryen
left
the
colony
for
the
West
Indies
soon
after
their
arrival
and
,
in
his
absence
,
the
Dutch
colonists
began
fighting
with
the
local
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalina_people">
Kalina
</ref>
(
Caribs
)
.
They
were
eventually
forced
to
abandon
the
colony
when
the
situation
became
too
dangerous
for
them
to
stay
,
some
going
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Vincent_(island)">
St.
Vincents
</ref>
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobago">
Tobago
</ref>
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-Rodway-2">

According
to
Dutch
historian
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Jacob_Hartsinck">
Jan
Jacob
Hartsinck
</ref>
,
the
settlement
&quot;
did
not
last
long
&quot;
after
Jan
van
Ryen
was
left
behind
to
govern
the
colony
.
He
apparently
lacked
the
&quot;
tact
and
probably
fair
dealing
&quot;
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessé_de_Forest">
Jessé
de
Forest
</ref>
,
who
had
previously
attempted
to
found
a
settlement
the
previous
year
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-3">
[

</ref>
as
&quot;
the
savages
rose
against
the
new
settlers
,
killed
their
governor
(
Jan
van
Ryen
)
,
and
demolished
their
houses
&quot;
.
The
survivors
built
several
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloops">
sloops
</ref>
with
which
they
left
the
area
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-4">
[

</ref>
however
only
four
or
five
were
said
to
have
survived
the
attack
.

After
the
colonists
departure
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_van_Peere">

obtained
permission
from

Van
Ryen
appears
to
have
found
his
way
back
to
the
Netherlands
.
In
December
1630
he
registered
a
colony
in
&quot;
Quaro
&quot;
with
the
WIC
and
on
July
25
,
1632
,
the
Zeeland
Chamber
settled
with
him
with
respect
to
payment
for
his
Oyapok
expedition
.

After
that
there
seems
to
be
no
record
of
him
.
