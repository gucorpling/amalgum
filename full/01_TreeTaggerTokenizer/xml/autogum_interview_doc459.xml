Adversity
?
!
Absolutely
not
.
I
do
n't
think
people
understand
that
I
am
a
<hi rend="italic">
regular
</hi>
woman
.
I
wear
a
[
size
]
ten
for
God
's
sake
.
It
's
so
funny
because
people
come
up
to
me
and
they
say
,
&quot;
Wow
,
you
're
not
fat
at
all
?
You
must
have
lost
a
lot
of
weight
.
&quot;
I
think
I
just
came
off
looking
heavier
on
TV
...
that
,
or
people
just
had
a
distorted
perception
of
what
I
<hi rend="italic">
should
</hi>
look
like
in
person
.
As
a
matter
of
fact
I
'm
about
10
pounds
heavier
than
I
was
on
the
show
now
and
people
ca
n't
believe
how
&quot;
normal
&quot;
I
look
.
But
that
was
my
aim
in
going
on
the
show
,
that
a
normal
woman
can
actually
have
a
place
in
the
industry
.
She
does
n't
have
to
be
a
size
2
nor
does
she
have
to
be
a
size
18
.

Do
you
feel
like
&quot;
plus
size
&quot;
models
are
treated
fairly
?
(
I
put
&quot;
plus
size
&quot;
in
quotes
because
I
do
n't
believe
you
are
&quot;
plus

No
,
I
do
n't
.
I
do
n't
think
that
plus-sized
models
are
given
enough
respect
and
I
do
n't
think
that
folks
value
the
plus-sized
industry
the
way
it
should
be
valued
.
But
I
think
it
's
because
people
do
n't
know
how
much
the
plus-sized
industry
varies
.
Hell
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim%20Kardashian">
Kim
Kardashian
</ref>
could
be
considered
a
plus-sized
model
!
But
people
automatically
assume
that
plus-sized
means
obese
and
that
no
one
who
is
obese
could
possibly
be
attractive
,
or
sexy
,
or
a
model
.
But
that
's
not
the
case
.

Do
you
believe
the
producers
for
shows
such
as
<hi rend="italic">
Top
Model
</hi>
intentionally
pick
people
who
are
perhaps
unstable
,
for
better
television
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
WC
:
</hi>
Absolutely
.
I
understand
it
,
though
.
When
I
have
my
own
production/entertainment
company
and
I
'm
brainstorming
ideas
for
a
show
,
or
a
book
,
or
a
commercial
,
etc.
,
I
'll
think
of
what
sort
of
concepts
will
accrue
me
the
largest
profit
.
The
producers
of
<hi rend="italic">
Top
Model
</hi>
think
along
the
same
lines
.
Mass
consumers
want
to
see
stuff
that
's
juicy
!
They
do
n't
want
to
watch
boring
characters
every
Wednesday
night
.
They
want
someone
who
's
fun
and
out
of
the
ordinary
.

Can
you
explain
what
types
of
things
the
producers
allow
you
to
say
or
not
say
following
your
departure
from
the
show
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
WC
:
</hi>
Well
,
the
show
is
not
taped
live
,
so
of
course
you
're
sworn
to
secrecy
about
what
's
happened
during
taping
until
the
show
actually
airs
.

Who
selects
your
best
photo
for
each
panel
and
do
you
think
there
are
ulterior
motives
involved
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
WC
:
</hi>
Tyra
says
she
selects
the
photos
,
but
who
knows
.
I
do
n't
know
about
ulterior
motives
,
but
there
were
numerous
times
where
I
knew
that
I
had
taken
a
better
photo
than
the
one
that
appeared
on
the
screen
during
panel
.
Every
season
girls
say
the
same
thing
as
well
.
It
's
interesting
because
in
the
last
photo
shoot
I
had
before
I
was
eliminated
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay%20Manuel">
Mr.
Jay
</ref>
told
me
that
I
had
finally
figured
out
the
art
of
modeling
and
I
have
successfully
pulled
off
my
shoot
.
Needless
to
say
,
I
was
eliminated
and
never
saw
it
coming
.
I
figured
it
was
smooth
sailing
since
the
director
of
the
photo
shoot
told
me
I
looked
like
I
knew
what
I
was
doing
.
It
is
what
it
is
though
.
What
can
I
say
?
