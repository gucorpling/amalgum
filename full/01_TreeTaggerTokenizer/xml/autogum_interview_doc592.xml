On
some
national
competitions
they
have
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B4%20(classification)">
B4
</ref>
class
.
Do
you
think
those
should
be
eligible
?
In
terms
of
the
international
competition
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Jessica
Gallagher
:
</hi>
Which
sports
have
B4s
?

There
's
a
level
down
,
it
's
not
used
internationally
,
I
think
it
's
only
used
for
domestic
competitions
.
I
know
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/UK">
UK
</ref>
uses
it
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Jessica
Gallagher
:
</hi>
I
think
I
...
A
particular
one
.
For
social
reasons
,
that
's
a
great
thing
,
but
I
think
if
it
's
,
yeah
.
I
do
n't
know
if
I
would
...
I
think
socially
to
get
more
Paralympic
athletes
involved
in
the
sport
if
they
've
got
a
degenerative
condition
on
that
border
then
they
should
be
allowed
to
compete
but
obviously
...
I
do
n't
think
they
should
be
able
to
receive
any
medals
at
a
national
competition
or
anything
like
that
.
So
I
was
,
after
Beijing
,
I
was
able
to
fore-run
races
.
I
was
able
to
transition
over
to
skiing
even
though
at
that
stage
I
was
n't
eligible
.
So
that
was
great
for
us
.
The
IPC
knew
that
my
eyesight
was
going
to
get
worse
.
So
I
was
able
to
fore-run
races
.
Which
was
a
really
good
experience
for
us
,
when
we
did
get
to
that
level
.
So
I
think
,
with
the
lack
of
numbers
in
Paralympic
sport
,
more
that
you
should
encourage
athletes
and
give
them
those
opportunities
,
it
's
a
great
thing
.
But
I
guess
it
's
about
the
athletes
realizing
that
you
're
in
it
for
the
participation
,
and
to
grow
as
an
athlete
rather
than
to
win
medals
.
I
do
n't
think
the
system
should
be
changed
.
I
think
three
classes
is
enough
.
Where
the
B3
line
is
compared
with
a
B4
is
legally
blind
.
And
I
think
that
covers
everything
.
I
think
that
's
the
stage
where
you
have
low
enough
vision
to
be
considered
a
Paralympic
sport
as
opposed
to
I
guess
an
able
bodied
athlete
.
And
that
's
with
all
forms
of
like
,
with
government
pensions
,
with
bus
passes
,
all
that
sort
of
stuff
,
that
the
cut
off
line
is
legally
blind
,
so
I
think
that
's
a
good
place
to
keep
it
.

Veering
away
from
this
,
I
remember
watching
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne%20Cup">
Melbourne
Cup
</ref>
stuff
on
television
,
and
there
you
were
,
I
think
you
were
wearing
some
hat
or
something
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Jessica
Gallagher
:
</hi>
Yeah
,
my
friend
's
a
milliner
.
They
were
real
flowers
,
real
orchids
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">

(

<hi rend="bold">

</hi>
<hi rend="bold">

)
</hi>
Are
you
basically
a
professional
athlete
who
has
enough
money
or
sponsorship
to
do
that
sort
of
stuff
?
I
was
saying
,
there
's
Jessica
Gallagher
!
She
was
in
London
!
That
's
so
cool
!
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Jessica
Gallagher
:
</hi>
There
are
two
organizations
that
I
'm
an
ambassador
for
,
and
one
of
them
is
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision%20Australia">
Vision
Australia
</ref>
,
who
were
a
charity
for
the
Melbourne
Cup
Carnival
.
So
as
part
of
my
ambassador
role
I
was
at
the
races
helping
them
raise
money
.
And
that
involves
media
stuff
,
so
that
was
the
reason
I
was
there
.
I
did
n't
get
paid
.
