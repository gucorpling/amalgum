Why
are
you
running
for
political
office
,
why
at
the
federal
level
,
why
this
party
,
and
why
in
this
riding
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
I
decided
to
get
involved
(
again
)
because
I
have
the
time
and
enough
energy
to
do
it
;
because
I
believe
it
is
imperative
to
have
more
women
around
the
decision
making
table
and
because
I
hope
to
make
a
difference
.
The
NDP
is
closest
to
my
views
and
beliefs
regarding
the
environment
,
social
justice
and
gender
equality
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Previous
to
this
campaign
,
have
you
been
politically
involved
?
How
will
you
apply
your
previous
work/volunteer/lifeexperience
to
serving
your
constituents
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
I
ran
provincially
for
NDP
in
1997
(
Edmonton
Manning
)
,
2001
(
Edmonton
Manning
)
,
2008
(
Edmonton
Whitemud
)
,
federally
in
1997
(
Edmonton
East
)
,
as
well
as
in
municipal
elections
in
2007
.
</p>
<p>
My
lengthy
career
as
a
Human
Resources
Consultant
for
the
federal
government
has
provided
her
with
skills
in
communicating
,
mediating
,
team
building
,
negotiating
,
collaboration
,
all
skills
that
will
serve
me
well
in
my
political
career
.

As
you
campaign
around
your
riding
,
it
's
likely
that
some
issues
are
mentioned
more
often
by
voters
,
than
other
issues
.
What
would
you
say
are
the
three
hottest
topics
this
election
,
in
your
riding
?
What
would
you
and
your
party
do
to
address
these
issues
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
The
issue
of
leadership
-
When
the
Harper
’s
conservatives
got
elected
and
formed
the
government
in
2006
,
they
were
supposed
to
be
a
different
,
more
open
and
accountable
government
.
Instead
,
they
are
and
continue
to
cover
up
mistakes
,
avoid
speaking
truth
and
answer
legitimate
questions
from
the
members
of
the
opposition
,
constantly
lay
blame
on
members
of
the
opposition
or
previous
liberal
regime
,
show
little
respect
for
diverse
opinions
or
beliefs
,
mistreat
others
and
abuse
power
.
</p>
<p>
They
demotivate
and
offend
others
through
cynicism
and
aggression
.
Instead
being
more
open
and
accountable
,
Mr.
Harper
’s
government
is
the
most
secretive
and
divisive
that
I
ever
remember
.
And
people
that
I
talk
to
on
the
doorstep
are
voicing
their
disappointment
with
this
government
.
The
are
also
disappointed
in
the
government
’s
handling
of
the
environmental
file
,
war
in
Afghanistan
,
Omar
Khadr
file
and
all
the
other
gaffes
,
either
during
their
reign
(
Maxime
Bernier
,
“
in
and
out
”
scandal
,
Chuck
Cadman
controversy
)
or
during
the
campaign
(
attack
ads
aired
even
before
the
campaign
started
,
pooping
puffin
,
Jerry
Ritz
etc
)
,
well
you
get
the
picture….
.
</p>
<p>
Jack
Layton
and
his
team
(
of
which
I
hope
to
be
a
part
)
,
have
been
the
real
opposition
to
Stephen
Harper
.
And
we
believe
it
is
time
that
we
have
a
Prime
Minister
that
puts
the
needs
of
the
ordinary
Canadians
families
first
.
</p>
<p>
We
will
fight
to
protect
jobs
;
reduce
the
growing
income
gap
between
the
best-off
and
the
rest
of
us
;
and
unlike
Stephen
Harper
,
we
will
protect
Canadian
families
from
rip-offs
and
food
scandals
.
</p>
<p>
We
will
make
sure
health
care
is
there
when
you
need
it
,
reducing
wait
times
by
hiring
more
doctors
and
nurses
</p>
<p>
And
we
will
cut
pollution
with
tough
new
laws
and
firm
targets
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Is
there
any
misconceptions
about
you
,
your
leader
,
or
your
party
and
platform
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
Not
so
much
about
Jack
Layton
or
myself
,
however
people
feel
that
we
are
the
tax
and
spend
party
.
This
is
actually
not
borne
out
.
Most
of
our
platform
commitments
(
in
any
of
the
elections
I
ran
)
were
all
costed
out
,
and
most
of
the
money
for
our
initiatives
would
be
coming
from
shifting
the
enormous
tax
cuts
for
profitable
corporations
that
do
not
need
it
(
given
by
the
previous
governments
both
liberal
and
conservative
)
,
to
areas
where
the
benefits
would
be
to
much
larger
Canadian
population
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
There
are
more
ways
than
ever
to
get
your
message
out
,
from
the
traditional
campaign
fliers
and
lawn
signs
,
to
new
media
like
websites
,
Facebook
,
and
YouTube
.
The
tried-and-true
routes
get
the
message
out
to
the
masses
much
easier
,
but
digital
alternatives
are
much
more
measurable
in
how
many
are
seeing
or
interacting
with
your
campaign
.
What
seems
to
be
the
most
effective
,
from
your
experience
?
