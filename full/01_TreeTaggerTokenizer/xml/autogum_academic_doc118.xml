Conclusions
</head>
<p>
The
father
’s
quota
which
reserves
part
of
the
parental
leave
for
the
fathers
has
played
an
important
role
in
getting
more
fathers
to
use
parental
leave
.
Earlier
research
has
shown
that
there
has
been
a
lower
use
of
leave
among
fathers
in
career
jobs
.
The
lower
use
in
this
group
has
been
explained
by
the
fact
that
these
fathers
are
in
jobs
where
career
logic
indicates
the
need
to
be
always
available
and
to
be
seen
as
irreplaceable
.
We
have
chosen
to
use
the
two-concept
pairs
‘
replaceable
and
irreplaceable
’
and
‘
available
and
unavailable
’
to
analyze
the
fathers
’
use
of
the
father
’s
quota
in
two
different
work
organizations
in
order
to
see
how
different
institutional
logics
impact
the
use
of
the
father
’s
quota
.
</p>
<p>
The
findings
show
that
the
terms
‘
replaceable
and
irreplaceable
’
and
‘
available
and
unavailable
’
work
somewhat
differently
among
male
managers
in
the
engineering
industry
and
male
brokers
in
the
financial
industry
.
The
managers
in
the
engineering
industry
experience
that
it
is
possible
to
be
unavailable
and
replaceable
at
work
,
thus
they
also
choose
to
make
themselves
unavailable
for
work
when
they
use
the
father
’s
quota
.
It
is
important
for
the
male
managers
to
set
a
boundary
concerning
work
when
they
are
on
leave
.
By
making
themselves
unavailable
,
they
become
replaceable
at
work
because
the
organization
has
to
find
solutions
without
them
.
</p>
<p>
The
brokers
in
the
finance
industry
feel
that
they
are
irreplaceable
at
work
and
they
want
to
be
available
for
work
at
all
times
.
The
brokers
have
close
contact
with
clients
and
they
think
being
away
on
leave
for
three
months
is
too
long
a
period
.
Halrynjo
et
al.
(
2019
)
found
that
parental
leave
and
absence
from
work
are
especially
pinpointed
as
risks
in
Front
End
Finance
.
This
is
because
one
has
a
lot
to
lose
in
terms
of
customers
,
salary
development
,
bonuses
,
and
career
opportunities
.
In
their
study
,
the
focus
is
on
mothers
and
that
mothers
are
at
a
greater
risk
of
losing
their
customers
and
“
moving
back
to
start
.
”
The
findings
show
that
this
is
also
the
case
among
fathers
in
our
study
.
In
theory
,
it
is
not
problematic
among
the
fathers
in
this
study
to
give
up
clients
to
colleagues
,
but
then
one
has
to
start
all
over
again
when
one
is
back
from
leave
.
Unlike
the
male
managers
,
they
experience
that
there
is
a
risk
to
using
the
father
’s
quota
when
it
comes
to
work
and
career
.
Thus
,
they
make
themselves
available
for
work
and
they
continue
to
be
seen
as
irreplaceable
.
</p>
<p>
This
shows
that
the
institutional
logics
are
closely
linked
to
the
concepts
‘
available
’
and
‘
unavailable
’
.
To
be
unavailable
during
leave
time
seems
to
be
the
logic
for
the
male
managers
in
the
engineering
industry
.
This
is
the
type
of
culture
and
practice
that
is
encouraged
in
the
financial
industry
.
At
the
same
time
,
the
managers
are
concerned
that
the
father
’s
quota
is
available
for
all
the
male
employees
.
This
sets
the
framework
for
which
practice
and
choices
other
employees
should
use
when
it
comes
to
parental
leave
.
To
be
available
for
work
is
important
for
the
male
brokers
in
the
finance
industry
.
In
spite
of
a
positive
attitude
regarding
the
father
’s
quota
on
the
party
of
the
brokers
,
they
still
hesitate
to
use
it
.
By
not
taking
the
father
’s
quota
or
just
parts
of
it
,
they
make
themselves
more
available
for
work
,
and
this
becomes
the
general
practice
and
the
institutional
logic
within
the
organization
.
</p>
<p>
One
of
the
brokers
stands
out
and
experiences
leave
as
particularly
important
for
creating
a
good
father
and
child
relationship
.
He
does
not
care
what
co-workers
might
think
about
him
taking
long
leave
.
This
informant
is
the
youngest
in
this
study
,
and
it
is
possible
that
a
new
generation
is
joining
the
finance
industry
and
will
contribute
to
a
gradual
change
in
the
institutional
logic
when
it
comes
to
the
use
of
the
father
’s
quota
.
This
is
similar
to
the
use
made
by
one
of
the
managers
of
the
father
’s
quota
as
a
protest
against
the
workplace
and
the
prevailing
‘
old-boys
culture
’
.
</p>
<p>
We
found
that
the
working
logic
is
different
in
the
two
groups
and
organizations
studied
.
The
leaders
in
the
engineering
industry
work
as
a
team
—
as
opposed
to
the
brokers
who
work
more
individually
.
In
other
words
,
organizational
institutional
logics
provide
guidance
on
what
practices
one
can
have
within
the
given
organizations
.
That
is
,
even
if
one
wishes
to
use
the
fathers
’
quota
,
it
is
not
necessarily
the
case
that
the
work
is
experienced
as
compatible
with
practice
.
