Introduction
</head>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">
Aggregatibacter
actinomycetemcomitans
</hi>
is
a
Gram-negative
member
of
the
human
oral
microbiota
and
is
involved
in
human
infections
and
diseases
.
One
of
these
diseases
is
periodontitis
,
characterized
by
destruction
of
tooth-supporting
periodontal
tissues
due
to
an
inflammatory
response
.
<hi rend="italic">
A.
actinomycetemcomitans
</hi>
possesses
several
virulence
factors
,
of
which
the
production
of
the
RTX
(
repeats-in-toxin
)
leukotoxin
(
LtxA
)
has
received
much
attention
.
LtxA
induces
cell
lysis
,
degranulation
and
an
inflammatory
response
in
human
leukocytes
by
interaction
with
the
β2-integrins
in
the
cell
membrane
of
human
immune
cells
.
A
530-bp
deletion
in
the
promoter
region
of
the
LtxA
gene
operon
was
identified
in
the
original
JP2
strain
,
cultured
from
a
young
individual
diagnosed
with
juvenile
periodontitis
.
This
discovery
marked
the
beginning
of
an
era
,
where
the
detection
of
the
530-bp
deletion
categorized
highly
leukotoxic
<hi rend="italic">
A.
actinomycetemcomitans
</hi>
strains
as
a
member
of
the
JP2
clone
of
<hi rend="italic">
A.
actinomycetemcomitans
</hi>
,
possessing
enhanced
virulence
.
Based
on
in
vitro
studies
,
it
was
reported
that
the
JP2
genotype
of
<hi rend="italic">
A.
actinomycetemcomitans
</hi>
has
a
10
–
20
fold
higher
lytic
activity
than
the
non-JP2
genotypes
of
<hi rend="italic">
A.
actinomycetemcomitans
</hi>
.
Furthermore
,
longitudinal
clinical
studies
reported
a
clear
correlation
between
being
carrier
of
the
JP2
genotype
of
<hi rend="italic">
A.
actinomycetemcomitans
</hi>
and
having
an
increased
risk
of
developing
periodontitis
at
a
young
age
.
</p>
<p>
Often
the
leukotoxic
potential
of
<hi rend="italic">
A.
actinomycetemcomitans
</hi>
is
characterized
by
the
leukotoxicity
in
in
vitro
studies
.
This
leukotoxicity
is
determined
by
use
of
cell
lysis
assays
,
where
human
immune
cells
are
exposed
either
to
the
bacteria
or
to
purified
LtxA
,
and
most
often
the
leukotoxicity
is
correlated
with
the
JP2
or
non-JP2
genotype
of
the
<hi rend="italic">
A.
actinomycetemcomitans
</hi>
strain
.
Therefore
,
it
has
been
the
common
believe
that
the
leukotoxicity
of
an
<hi rend="italic">
A.
actinomycetemcomitans
</hi>
strain
could
be
explained
by
the
530-bp
deletion
,
an
explanation
supported
by
recent
results
presented
by
Sampathkumar
and
co-workers
.
However
,
<hi rend="italic">
A.
actinomycetemcomitans
</hi>
strains
without
the
530-bp
deletion
with
high
leukotoxicity
according
to
results
obtained
by
cell
lysis
assay
have
been
reported
on
.
Furthermore
,
the
leukotoxic
potential
of
<hi rend="italic">
A.
actinomycetemcomitans
</hi>
strains
has
been
explained
by
different
mechanisms
.
A
higher
expression
of
the
mRNA
,
encoding
the
<hi rend="italic">
ltxA
,
</hi>
has
been
reported
to
correspond
with
a
higher
leukotoxic
potential
,
but
also
a
variation
in
the
activity
of
LtxA
in
some
<hi rend="italic">
A.
actinomycetemcomitans
</hi>
has
been
reported
.
Only
a
few
studies
have
compared
the
leukotoxicity
of
<hi rend="italic">
A.
actinomycetemcomitans
</hi>
with
the
LtxA
expression
and
production
defined
as
a
quantification
of
the
LtxA
,
e.
g.
,
by
enzyme-linked
immunosorbent
assay
(
ELISA
)
,
or
mRNA
coding
for
LtxA
,
but
it
seems
reasonable
to
assume
that
the
two
factors
are
related
.
</p>
<p>
In
the
present
study
,
we
aimed
to
investigate
if
the
leukotoxicity
of
a
collection
of
Ghanaian
<hi rend="italic">
A.
actinomycetemcomitans
</hi>
,
serotype
b
,
is
related
to
the
LtxA
production
of
the
strains
determined
by
Western
blotting
and
ELISA
,
and
LtxA
expression
as
determined
in
a
mRNA
expression
assay
.
Furthermore
,
we
wanted
to
compare
the
results
obtained
by
ELISA
and
mRNA
expression
assay
to
elucidate
the
relationship
between
the
two
quantification
methods
used
to
determine
leukotoxic
potential
as
the
LtxA
production
and
expression
of
<hi rend="italic">
A.
actinomycetemcomitans
</hi>
,
respectively
.
