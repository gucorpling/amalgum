Introduction
</head>
<p>
Currently
in
industry
,
fault
detection
and
identification
of
causes
and
consequences
of
failures
are
performed
by
operators
.
If
any
of
these
tasks
are
not
performed
correctly
,
adverse
effects
can
occur
,
such
as
:
reduction
of
product
quality
,
process
safety
and
lifetime
of
machinery
.
In
this
scenario
,
condition-based
maintenance
helps
reduce
unplanned
downtime
and
maintenance
costs
.
Since
the
induction
motor
is
widely
used
in
industries
,
fault
detection
in
induction
motors
becomes
an
indispensable
tool
in
condition-based
maintenance
.
According
to
statistical
evidence
,
most
induction
motor
failures
occur
in
bearings
(
40
%
to
90
%
of
large
to
small
machines
)
.
Of
all
the
techniques
for
diagnosis
and
detection
of
roller
bearing
failures
,
the
most
common
is
vibration
analysis
.
Recently
,
stator
current-based
bearing
failure
detection
has
been
shown
to
have
relevant
results
with
the
advantage
of
being
non-invasive
and
without
the
need
for
special
sensors
,
significantly
reducing
maintenance
costs
.
</p>
<p>
The
identification
and
fault
diagnosis
must
be
able
to
provide
alert
signals
when
the
fault
is
still
incipient
.
Thus
,
still
at
an
early
stage
,
a
maintenance
action
should
be
taken
to
avoid
fault
evolution
and
catastrophic
failure
,
avoiding
also
unnecessary
costs
from
unscheduled
repairs
and
shutdowns
.
</p>
<p>
Bearing
failures
are
classified
as
distributed
or
localized
.
In
the
first
kind
,
the
deterioration
occurs
in
a
generalized
way
,
producing
a
vibration
that
,
in
the
frequency
domain
,
does
not
present
a
spectral
component
at
a
certain
frequency
but
an
increase
in
a
broad
frequency
band
.
Consequently
,
its
detection
becomes
more
difficult
.
The
second
kind
,
the
localized
one
,
is
the
one
addressed
in
this
work
and
its
produced
vibration
is
associated
with
certain
frequencies
that
depend
on
the
affected
bearing
element
(
outter
race
,
inner
race
,
ball
and
cage
)
.
It
should
be
noted
that
a
localized
fault
can
spread
to
other
bearing
components
as
the
level
of
degradation
becomes
more
pronounced
.
</p>
<p>
The
traditional
monitoring
method
,
vibration
analysis
,
requires
the
installation
of
accelerometers
or
speed
sensors
that
require
accurate
positioning
,
making
this
analysis
costly
,
complex
,
and
invasive
.
So
,
the
investments
in
the
motor
current
signature
analysis
(
MCSA
)
in
the
detection
of
roller
bearing
failures
are
justified
.
This
technique
has
become
an
attractive
alternative
because
it
is
more
accessible
,
simple
and
it
does
not
even
require
the
physical
access
to
the
motor
itself
.
</p>
<p>
However
,
the
MCSA
technique
presents
a
great
difficulty
in
an
accurate
diagnosis
of
localized
roller
bearing
faults
due
to
issues
such
as
:
the
low
energy
of
the
fault
related
spectral
components
and
the
close
presence
of
high
energy
spectral
components
related
to
the
power
supply
or
to
other
mechanical
sources
.
When
the
localized
fault
is
in
the
early
stage
,
the
energy
associated
to
the
generated
impacts
is
not
strong
enough
to
be
detected
directly
in
the
acquired
vibration
signal
.
Therefore
,
according
to
Salomon
,
the
energy
is
even
lower
in
the
stator
current
,
because
the
effects
of
this
impact
are
obtained
indirectly
as
a
variation
of
torque
.
The
motor
RMS
current
can
be
understood
as
an
image
of
motor
torque
:
more
motor
torque
implies
more
RMS
current
;
less
motor
torque
implies
less
RMS
current
.
So
,
periodic
variations
in
the
motor
torque
due
to
specific
faults
will
cause
periodic
variations
in
RMS
current
and
,
consequently
,
amplitude
modulation
of
the
instantaneous
current
in
specific
frequencies
.
</p>
<p>
Another
challenge
presented
by
localized
bearing
faults
for
both
,
vibration
analysis
and
MCSA
,
is
the
variation
of
the
element
fault
frequencies
.
Roller
bearing
manufacturers
provide
the
nominal
fault
frequencies
for
each
of
the
elements
in
a
roller
bearing
:
<list>
<item>
BPFO
—
Ball
Pass
Frequency
in
the
Outer
Race
;
</item>
<item>
BPFI
—
Ball
Pass
Frequency
in
the
Inner
Race
;
</item>
<item>
BSF
—
Ball
Spin
Frequency
;
</item>
<item>
FTF
—
Frame
Train
Frequency
.
</item>
</list>
</p>
<p>
Those
frequencies
depend
on
the
bearing
geometrical
characteristics
,
and
can
present
an
error
from
external
factors
such
as
:
geometric
variations
imposed
by
the
failure
itself
,
incorrect
bearing
installation
,
cage
locking
,
improper
lubrication
and
ball
slip
,
for
instance
.
Thus
,
care
must
be
taken
to
avoid
the
analysis
of
spectral
components
not
related
to
the
defect
.
In
MCSA
,
this
is
a
more
critical
concern
,
since
it
is
not
uncommon
to
have
high
energy
supply
frequency
harmonics
near
the
bearing
fault
frequencies
,
which
can
demand
a
very
high-resolution
spectrum
to
distinguish
spectral
components
of
diverse
nature
.
</p>
<p>
In
order
to
correctly
identify
,
in
the
current
spectrum
,
the
correct
localized
fault
frequencies
of
roller
bearings
,
this
paper
proposes
the
use
of
the
envelope
analysis
of
vibration
signal
as
a
first
step
.
The
envelope
analysis
is
successfully
used
for
decades
in
the
detection
of
incipient
roller
bearing
faults
.
In
this
technique
,
the
vibration
signal
is
bandpass
filtered
in
a
frequency
range
corresponding
to
the
mechanical
resonance
of
the
system
,
which
tends
to
amplify
the
impacts
produced
by
a
localized
fault
in
any
element
of
the
roller
bearing
.
The
filtered
signal
is
then
amplitude
demodulated
using
the
Hilbert
transform
,
which
results
in
the
amplitude
envelope
of
the
mechanical
resonance
region
.
The
envelope
spectrum
is
then
obtained
by
the
Fourier
transform
.
This
spectrum
presents
the
localized
fault
frequencies
with
great
sensitivity
.
