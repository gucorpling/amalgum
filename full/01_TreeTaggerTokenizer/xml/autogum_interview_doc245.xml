Freud
was
somewhat
of
a
maverick
in
that
regard
,
because
his
position
really
went
against
what
a
lot
of
other
people
were
saying
.
Freud
maintained
that
bisexuality
was
a
normal
part
of
development
.
That
all
of
us
went
through
a
period
of
bisexuality
and
that
,
in
the
end
,
most
of
us
came
out
heterosexual
but
that
the
bisexual
phase
we
traversed
remained
on
some
unconscious
level
,
and
was
dealt
with
in
other
ways
.
For
instance
,
friendship
,
chumships
,
and
'
greater
glory
of
the
love
of
mankind
'
kinds
of
sentiments
.
Freud
felt
these
had
their
basis
in
this
constitutional
bisexuality
that
all
individuals
had
.
He
did
not
consider
it
something
that
should
be
criminalized
,
or
penalized

<p>

—
treated
if
it
presented
a
problem
for
the
individual
.
Freud
felt
there
were
a
number
of
homosexuals
he
encountered
who
did
not
have
a
variety
of
complex
problems
that
homosexuality
was
a
part
of
.
He
found
people
who
were
totally
normal
in
every
other
regard
except
in
terms
of
their
sexual
preference
.
In
fact
,
he
saw
many
of
them
as
having
higher
intellects
,
higher
aesthetic
sensibilities
,
higher
morals
;
those
kinds
of
things
.
He
did
not
see
it
as
something
to
criminalize
or
penalize
,
or
to
keep
from
psychoanalytic
training
.
A
lot
of
the
psychoanalytic
institutes
felt
if
you
were
homosexual
you
should
not
be
accepted
;
that
was
not
Freud
's
position
.

DS
:
How
did
he
discern
whether
a
person
's
homosexuality
was
a
problem
with
the
person
internally
,
or
whether
it
was
an
external
problem
brought
about
by
societal
reaction
to
the
individual
?

Freud
would
use
the
technique
of
analysis
to
figure
that
out
,
and
work
with
that
individual
to
explore
the
cause
.
In
his
later
theories
he
would
look
at
whether
this
is
an
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus%20complex">
oedipal
</ref>
issue
,
whether
he
wanted
to
be
with
the
mother
and
could
n't
have
the
mother
so
he
then
wanted
to
have
men
,
so
that
men
could
would
like
him
,
and
then
he
would
get
the
affection
of
the
mother
object
.
He
would
explore
the
issues
that
way
.
He
would
not
start
from
the
bias
that
this
is
the
individual
's
problem
that
needed
to
be
fixed
.

Is
his
model
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/psychosexual%20development">
psychosexual
development
</ref>
model
outdated
as
to
be
useless
,
or
is
it
still
functioning
?

JM
:
</hi>
I
think
you
used
the
operative
word
.
It
's
a
model
.
What
we
try
to
do
as
therapists
is
come
up
with
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hypothesis">
hypothesis
</ref>
that
works
for
the
individual
that
he
can
use
to
help
him
or
herself
,
as
opposed
to
having
my
theory
inflicted
upon
you
.
If
you
can
use
a
psychosexual
development
kind
of
model
in
helping
to
understand
what
the
situation
is
,
it
can
be
a
language
that
the
two
of
us
can
speak
.
Most
therapists
are
focusing
less
on
even
using
that
as
language
.
It
's
more
of
a
concept
to
structure
something
.
