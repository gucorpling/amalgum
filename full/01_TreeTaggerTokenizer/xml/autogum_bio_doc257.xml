Even
after

,
Koahou
never

if

did

he
did

take

teaching
very
seriously

On
December
25
,
1825
,
Rev.
Artemas
Bishop
complained
how
Koahou
's
behavior
and
continual
practice
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygamy">
polygamy
</ref>
were
discouraging
the
natives
of
Hilo
from
converting
:
</p>
<p>
Preached
morning
and
evening
at
the
usual
place
of
worship
.
The
house
was
filled
,
and
good
attention
paid
in
general
to
the
word
.
But
it
is
to
be
regretted
,
that
no
better
example
is
set
,
and
,
in
general
,
no
more
countenance
given
to
religious
things
,
by
Koahou
,
the
principal
chief
at
this
place
.
He
still
retains
three
wives
,
and
revels
in
all
the
abominations
of
heathenism
,
while
neither
he
,
or
his
people
,
are
often
at
church
.
Such
an
example
,
from
a
principal
chief
,
has
a
pernicious
effect
upon
the
common
people
,
and
accordingly
,
there
are
found
more
open
opposers
among
the
natives
at
this
,
than
at
any
other
station
...

It
is
n't
known
whether
he
left
any
descendants
or
what
happened
to
his
lands

properties
after
his
death

but
they
were
probably
inherited
by
his
sister
Peleuli

her
descendants
