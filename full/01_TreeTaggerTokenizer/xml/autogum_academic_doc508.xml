Discussion
</head>
<p>
This
study
showed
that
the
cotreatment
of
<hi rend="italic">
G.
lucidum
</hi>
extracts
(
GLE
)
and
quercetin
(
QCT
)
exerted
synergistic
antitumor
and
antiviral
activities
against
SNU719
EBVaGC
cells
.
Low
concentrations
of
the
cotreatment
resulted
in
both
the
synergistic
activation
of
cytotoxicity
in
SNU719
cells
and
the
suppression
of
tumor
development
in
MKN1-EBV
xenograft
mice
.
The
addition
of
a
low
concentration
GLE
to
QCT
reinforced
QCT-mediated
cytotoxicity
and
QCT-mediated
apoptosis
in
SNU719
cells
.
Furthermore
,
the
addition
also
activated
the
EBV
lytic
gene
promoter
and
upregulated
EBV
genes
.
Interestingly
,
ganoderic
acid
A
(
GAA
)
,
an
effective
molecule
of
GLE
also
showed
similar
bioactive
features
with
QCT
like
GLE
.
The
low
concentrations
of
the
GAA
and
QCT
cotreatment
reinforced
QCT-mediated
cytotoxicity
and
QCT-mediated
apoptosis
in
SNU719
cells
.
Furthermore
,
the
cotreatment
activated
the
EBV
lytic
gene
promoter
and
upregulated
EBV
genes
,
like

QCT
has
been
shown
to
exhibit
potential
anticancer
properties
owing
to
its
antiproliferative
,
growth
factor
suppressive
and
antioxidant
effects
.
In
addition
,
QCT
can
induce
apoptosis
,
where
it
has
been
shown
to
reduce
the
growth
of
tumors
and
inhibit
the
spread
of
malignant
cells
.
Moreover
,
it
inhibited
chemical
carcinogen-induced
cell
transformation
,
which
was
evident
as
cell
viability
decreased
,
ROS
generation
and
microRNA-21
elevation
occurred
in
cancer
cells
.
Besides
its
antitumor
effects
,
QCT
has
been
shown
to
have
antiviral
activity
through
its
anti-infective
and
anti-replicative
abilities
.
The
replication
of
herpes
viruses
,
including
EBV
,
was
found
to
be
affected
by
QCT
.
EBVaGC
exhibits
mixed
characteristics
of
both
gastric
carcinoma
and
EBV
.
Apoptosis
and
EBV
lytic
reactivation
can
control
the
fate
of
EBVaGC
cells
,
where
antitumor
agents
can
induce
apoptosis
and
antiviral
agents
can
stimulate
EBV
lytic
reactivation
to
further
aggravate
cell
lysis
.
QCT
exhibits
both
antitumor
and
antiviral
activities
against
EBVaGC
.
This
dual
function
of
QCT
is
likely
to
be
synergistic
.
GLE
,
containing
polysaccharides
and
triterpenes
,
is
known
to
suppress
the
proliferation
and
metastatic
potential
of
breast
cancer
cells
by
inhibiting
Akt
,
AP-1
and
NF-κB
.
Moreover
,
GLE
modulated
the
estrogen
receptor
signaling
and
inhibited
oxidative
stress-induced
invasiveness
of
breast
cancer
cells
.
Consistent
with
the
results
of
previous
studies
on
breast
cancer
,
our
study
showed
that
GLE
enhanced
both
QCT-mediated
apoptosis
and
EBV-lytic
reactivation
.
The
effects
of
GLE
were
evident
at
low
concentrations
of
QCT
.
Furthermore
,
QCT
also
enhanced
the
GLE-mediated
upregulation
of
the
EBV
gene
expression
.
Similarly
,
the
effects
of
QCT
were
evident
at
low
concentrations
of
GLE
.
Therefore
,
these
results
suggested
that
GLE
enhanced
QCT-mediated
apoptosis
,
whereas
QCT
increased
GLE-mediated
EBV
lytic
reactivation
.

Mycotherapy
has
several
benefits
,
where
it
improves
the
overall
response
rate
during
cancer
treatment
,
enhances
immunity
owing
to
the
stimulation
of
T
cell
proliferation
and
reduces
some
chemotherapy-associated
adverse
events
,
such
as
nausea
and
insomnia
.
Medicinal
mushrooms
have
mainly
been
used
in
Asian
countries
for
hundreds
of
years
for
the
treatment
of
infectious
diseases
.
More
recently
,
they
have
been
used
for
cancer
treatment
as
adjuncts
.
Importantly
,
they
have
an
extensive
clinical
history
of
safe
use
as
single
agents
or
in
combination
with
chemotherapy
.
GLE
has
been
intensively
combined
with
mycotherapy
for
the
treatment
of
broad-spectrum
cancers
.
GLE
has
shown
antitumor
activities
against
breast
cancer
,
bladder
cancer
,
prostate
cancer
,
colorectal
cancer
and
others
.
These
tumor
inhibitory
effects
of
GLE
were
attributed
to
the
disruption
of
the
proliferation
and
metastasis
of
cancer
cells
.
However
,
the
fact
that
EBV
is
the
initiator
of
gastric
carcinoma
should
be
considered
in
the
treatment
of
EBVaGC
.
EBV
should
be
eliminated
to
reduce
the
risk
of
EBVaGC
relapse
.
In
this
study
,
QCT
strongly
induced
EBV
lytic
reactivation
.
The
synergistic
effects
of
the
GLE
and
QCT
cotreatment
might
enhance
QCT-mediated
apoptosis
and
GLE-mediated
EBV
lytic
reactivation
.
Therefore
,
QCT-supplemented
GLE
might
be
used
as
a
medicinal
food
with
a
dual
function
as
an
antitumor
and
antiviral
agent
for
EBVaGC
treatment
.
</p>
<p>
To
the
author
’s
knowledge
,
this
is
the
first
study
to
report
that
QCT-supplemented
GLE
might
be
effective
in
treating
EBVaGC
.
The
synergistic
antitumor
and
antiviral
effects
were
supported
by
both
in
vivo
and
in
vitro
studies
.
Hence
,
the
combined
use
of
GLE
and
QCT
could
be
beneficial
in
cancer
treatment
by
alleviating
the
toxicity
of
conventional
chemotherapy
and
improving
the
immune
function
.
However
,
more
studies
are
still
needed
to
further
elucidate
the
molecular
mechanisms
of
the
direct
antitumor
and
antiviral
effects
of
QCT-supplemented
GLE
.
