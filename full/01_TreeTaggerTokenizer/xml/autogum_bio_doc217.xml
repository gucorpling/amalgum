Blake
had
no

could
have
retreated
to
relative
safety
below
decks
,
but
he
instead
chose
to
take
over
the

's
duties

He
stripped
to
the
waist
and
began
running
powder
boxes
to
the
gun
loaders

When
Lieutenant
Commander
Mead
asked
him
what
he
was
doing
,
he
replied
&quot;
Went
down
to
the
rocks
to
hide
my
face
,
but
the
rocks
said
there
is
no
hiding
place
here
.
So
here
I
am
