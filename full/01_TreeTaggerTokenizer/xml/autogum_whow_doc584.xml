Know
the
Odds
in
Life
</head>
<p>
Life
is
not
easy
.
Life
does
not
convey
the
same
meaning
to
all
...
To
one
it
may
be
a
book
to
explore
gradually
,
reading
page
by
page
.
To
one
life
may
seem
as
a
beautiful
gift
of
God
for
which
one
is
thankful
.
To
one
life
may
seem
as
a
boxing
champ
catching
one
in
the
corner
of
the
ring
throwing
punch
after
punch
till
seeing
him/her
fall
down
.
To
one
life
may
look
life
a
burden
,
carrying
it
on
one
's
back
...
Each
and
everyone
of
us
,
has
seen
or
will
see
these
phases
of
life
but
more
importantly
,
its
necessary
to
know
the
odds
in
life
and
to
deal
with
them
in
an
efficient
way
.
Below
,
i
would
like
to
share
a
few
tips
to
make
you
take
life
as
a
precious
gift
of
life
and
to
be
thankful
for
it
.

Never
Ever
say
Never
.
Everyone
is
unique
in
some
way
or
the
other
.
What
's
is
important
for
us
is
to
never
give
up
and
never
give
in
.
Life
is
as
simple
as
we
take
it
.
The
more
we
make
it
complicated
,
the
more
it
gets
.

Fight
for
your
right
.
Its
is
mandatory
for
us
to
know
that
we
have
to
fight
for
our
rights
simply
because
its
our
right
.
No
one
has
the
right
to
take
what
is
meant
to
be
for
us
.
Its
is
worth
it
to
fight
for
your
happiness
,
to
fight
for
your
job
,
to
fight
for
your
married
life
and
to
fight
for
everything
which
you
think
is
somehow
connected
to
you
.
Remember
,
I
do
not
mean
to
throw
punches
onto
someone
.
Fighting
spirit
is
what
is
of
my
concern
,
the
confidence
that
you
can
handle
relations
,
communicate
effectively
and
prosper
with
confidence
and
stability
.

Never
compromise
.
As
long
as
you
know
your
capacity
to
deliver
your
best
,
never
ever
give
your
second
best
.

Do
not
procrastinate
.
The
evil
of
procrastination
,
makes
you
lose
everything
you
have
and
meanwhile
take
the
future
opportunities
waiting
for
you
.
When
you
have
decided
to
take
a
bath
,
just
do
it
.

Have
faith
in
God
.
A
religious
bonding
no
matter
whatever
religion
you
follow
,
always
helps
you
keep
your
spirits
and
morality
into
a
higher
level
.
Always
have
faith
in
God
and
know
that
God
is
watching
you
and
will
always
be
there
for
you
no
matter
what
.

Love
yourself
.
You
need
to
love
yourself
if
you
are
to
spread
love
to
others
.
Always
think
of
best
things
for
yourself
,
best
clothing
,
best
shape
,
best
activities
and
best
food
.
But
make
sure
,
in
the
course
of
achieving
your
goals
,
do
not
take
away
the
best
of
others
.
Always
strike
for
a
fair
deal
.

Get
rid
of
your
bad
habits
.
It
s
not
easy
,
but
it
is
not
impossible
.
Bad
habits
are
like
mountains
,
they
are
pretty
huge
in
built
but
they
are
climbable
.
If
you
think
you
have
3
bad
habits
,
neglect
the
two
till
you
get
rid
of
the
first
one
.
and
gradually
,
replace
the
1st
bad
habit
with
a
good
one
and
same
goes
for
the
others
two
.

Its
your
life
.
Know
that
its
your
life
.
Nobody
has
the
right
to
control
your
life
,
to
take
away
your
life
and
to
interfere
into
your
life
.
As
long
as
you
know
that
you
are
YOURSELF
,
you
are
successful
.
Do
not
hesitate
to
say
a
FIRM
NO
or
an
ENCOURAGING
YES
to
yourself
and
to
others
.

Exercise

something
in
this
regard
.
Badminton
,
Basketball
,
Football
or
Gym
,
anything
will
seal
the
deal
.

helps
to
esteem
your
self-image
,
and

physique
.
