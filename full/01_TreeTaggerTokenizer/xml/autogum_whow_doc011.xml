Send
Books
to
Someone
in
Prison
</head>
<p>
If
you
know
someone
who
is
in
prison
,
giving
them
access
to
books
can
immensely
help
them
pass
the
time
,
continue
to
learn
and
think
,
and
just
cheer
them
up
.
Although
many
prisons
only
allow
books
to
come
from
authorized
vendors
such
as
book
stores
or
prisoner
support
organizations
such
as
the
Prisoner
's
Literature
Project
,
some
will
allow
individuals
to
send
books
as
well
.

Know
the

order
for
them
to
get
the
books
.
The
address
label

the
name

the

Check
for
the
prison
regulations
on
sending
things
to
inmates
.
Many
prisons
have
regulations
limiting
number
of
books
that
can
be
sent
,
restricting
books
with
sex
scenes
,
not
allowing
used
books
,
or
not
allowing
hardcover
books
.
These
restrictions
vary
from
place
to
place
and
even
prison
to
prison
,
so
be
sure
to
check
first
.
If
there
are
none
present
,
look
for
a
telephone
number
to
call
or
email
address
to
email
the
prison
.

<list type="unordered">
<item>
Many
prisons
only
allow
books
to
come
from
an
authorized
vendor
such
as
a
book
store
or
organization
.
If
you
are
not
allowed
to
send
books
as
an
individual
,
ask
which
vendors
will
be
allowed
to
bring
books
into
the
prison
and
contact
those
vendors
.
</item>
<item>
Remember
that
prisons
are
worried
about
security
.
For
these
reasons
they
may
require
paperbacks
only
,
new
books
only
,
or
have
a
limit
on
the
number
of
books
that
can
be
sent
at
a
time
.
</item>
<item>
If
you
go
through
a
service
that
specializes
in
books
for
prison
inmates
,
they
will
likely
already
have
a
good
grasp
of
what
titles
are
allowed
and
which
are
not
.
They
will
already
have
in
stock
titles
that
are
sure
to
be
approved
.
</item>
<item>
Be
sure
to
carefully
follow
all
restrictions
that
are
in
place
,
as
well
as
putting
the
prisoner
's
ID
number
on
any
packages
or
letters
.
Even
a
small
mistake
in
following
restrictions
can
cause
all
your
books
to
be
destroyed
or
sent
back
.
