Chicago/Bridgeport-Chinatown
</head>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Bridgeport-Chinatown
</hi>
is
the
South
Side
at
its
most
dynamic
,
as
the
old
South
Side
Irish
neighborhood
of
the
Daleys
increasingly
blends
with
the
old
Chinese
immigrant
community
to
the
north
.
Enormous
cathedrals
now
stand
next
to
Buddhist
temples
,
and
Old
Style
washes
down
<hi rend="italic">
lo
mein
</hi>
.
If
you
are
a
visitor
,
though
,
you
only
need
to
keep
in
mind
two
things
:
<hi rend="bold">
Chinese
food
</hi>
and
<hi rend="bold">
baseball
</hi>
.
</p>
<head>
Understand
</head>
<p>
Chicago
's
<hi rend="bold">
Chinatown
</hi>
is
pleasantly
authentic
.
At
the
many
restaurants
in
the
area
,
local
Chinese
customers
are
joined
by
Chicagoans
from
all
over
the
city
&quot;
going
Chinese
&quot;
for
the
night
.
Chicago
's
Chinatown
is
the
third
largest
in
the
United
States
,
the
Midwestern
business
center
for
Chinese-Americans
,
and
home
to
large
populations
of
Cantonese
and
Taiwanese
.
The
main
street
,
Wentworth
Ave
,
is
a
great
place
for
dining
out
and
rummaging
through
eccentric
stores
,
looking
for
gifts
.
Guaranteed
Rate
Field
,
better
known
as
Comiskey
Park
,
is
several
blocks
south
of
Chinatown
and
is
home
to
the
South
Side
's
favorite
baseball
team
,
the
Chicago
White
Sox
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Bridgeport
</hi>
is
a
large
Irish-American
enclave
that
has
produced
some
of
Chicago
's
most
famous
South
Side
Irish
,
such
as
Finley
Peter
Dunne
and
the
two
mayors
Daley
.
Being
the
birthplace
of
the
city
's
power
brokers
has
been
good
to
Bridgeport
.
The
first
Daley
remembered
playing
in
the
streets
as
a
child
,
dodging
fetid
puddles
filled
with
carcasses
from
the
local
slaughterhouses
.
The
Daleys
in
many
ways
fitted
the
mould
of
the
stereotypical
Chicago
politician
,
being
known
for
their
corruption
and
ties
to
organized
crime
during
their
terms
in
office
.
Bungalows
and
other
single-family
homes
are
more
the
norm
these
days
.
Bridgeport
is
now
seeing
a
large
influx
of
Mexican
immigrants
,
which
means
more
good
food
options
are
springing
up
left
and
right
,
and
has
even
seen
a
wave
of
North
Siders
priced
out
of
hip
neighborhoods
like
<ref target="Chicago/Wicker%20Park">
Wicker
Park
</ref>
and
<ref target="Chicago/Lincoln%20Park-Old%20Town">
Lincoln
Park
</ref>
.
Notable
recent
immigrants
are
international
acclaimed
painters
,
the
Zhou
brothers
,
Da
Huang
and
Shan
Zuo
,
who
purchased
five
large
buildings
along
Morgan
Street
with
the
hopes
to
encourage
more
art
and
artists
in
Bridgeport
.
Regardless
of
what
brings
you
to
the
neighborhood
,
it
is
full
of
gritty
character
(
and
characters
)
and
is
quite
possibly
haunted
—
Bridgeport
is
always
an
interesting
place
for
a
walk
.

<head>
By

<p>
The
main
L
stations
are
on
the
CTA
<hi rend="bold">
Red

</hi>
at
Cermak-Chinatown
and
Sox-35th
for
visiting
Chinatown
and
Guaranteed
Rate
Field
respectively
.
Other
options
include
Halsted
and
Ashland
on
the
<hi rend="bold">
Orange

</hi>
,
which
are
on
the
northern
and
western
outskirts
of
Bridgeport
,
and
35-Bronzeville-IIT
on
the
<hi rend="bold">

which
is
a
block
and
a

of
the

<p>
The
main
routes
into
Bridgeport-Chinatown
from
<ref target="Chicago/Loop">
the
Loop
</ref>
are
#62
,
which
runs
the
length
of
Archer
Ave
from
State
St
,
and
the
#24
,
which
runs
from
Clark
St
to
Wentworth
Ave
through
the
center
of
Chinatown
and
next
to
Guaranteed
Rate
Field
.
Route
#8
is
also
useful
,
as
it
runs
north-south
along
Halsted
St
,
which
runs
through
the
<ref target="Chicago/Near%20West%20Side">
Near
West
Side
</ref>
and
<ref target="Chicago/Near%20North">
Near
North
</ref>
neighborhoods
as
well
as
the
middle
of
Bridgeport
.

By

<p>
Parking
is
always
plentiful
in
Bridgeport
,
and
you
can
usually
find
spaces
right
by
your
destination
,
though
you
should
check
to
make
sure
you
're
not
on
a
permit
parking
only
residential
street
.
On
game
days
,
however
,
watch
out
—
though
no
signs
go
up
,
you
can
be
ticketed
for
parking
in
the
neighborhood
.
Take
the
L
instead
to
avoid
the
bad
game
day
traffic
and
pricey
parking
lots
.
Chinatown
is
more
crowded
,
but
you
should
still
have
little
trouble
finding
on-street
metered
parking
around
Cermak/Archer
on
weekdays
or
on
off-hours
.

and
<hi rend="bold">
Stevenson
Expressway
</hi>
cut
across
the
east
and
north
of
the
district
.
From
the
Dan
Ryan
,
take
either
of
the
31st
or
35th
Street
exits
;
from
the
Stevenson
,
take
the
Cermak
Avenue/Chinatown
exit
for
Chinatown
and
the
Damen
Avenue
exit
via
Archer
or
35th
Street
for
Bridgeport
.
The
main
city
streets
are

Get
around
</head>
<p>
The
easiest
way
to
get
around
Bridgeport
by
public
transport
is
on
the
two
main
east-west
bus
routes
#35
and
#39
,
which
run
along
35th
St
and
Pershing
Rd
,
as
well
as
the
aforementioned
#8
running
north-south
on
Halsted
St.
Bus
routes
are
not
terribly
convenient
between
the
two
neighborhoods
,
but
#62
Archer
does
run
along
the
north
of
Bridgeport
from
the
Chinatown
L
stop
,
from
which
you
can
hop
on
the
Halsted
route
.
Chinatown
itself
is
very
compact
and
easily
covered
on
foot
.
</p>
<head>

</head>
<p>
You
can
cover
Chinatown
's
sites
easily
in
an
hour
or
two
on
foot
,
but
if
you
are
interested
in
art
,
set
aside
some
real
time
to
explore
the
new
Bridgeport
galleries
that
fly
under
the
popular
radar
,
but
are
quite
important
to
the
contemporary
art
world
in
Chicago
.
