So
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eccentricity">
eccentricity
</ref>
would
be
a
form
of
insanity
in
principle
,
relative
to
whatever
society
found
it
eccentric
,
since
it
is
a
violation
of
social
norms
and

?

It
would
bring
the
person
to
the
attention
of
whoever
it
is
in
that
society
that
dictates
what
is
pathology
and
normality

<p>
<hi rend="bold">

Yes
,
it
's
a
value
judgment
.
Insanity
has
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pejorative">
pejorative

connotation
as
opposed
to
saying
someone
is
ill

DS

So
a
woman
who
goes
walking
down
the
street
naked
in
the
middle
of
Manhattan
,
but
fully
cognizant
of
it
and
doing
it
to
elicit
a
reaction
,
she
has
a
pathology
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
JM
:
</hi>
Well
,
she
is
going
to
come
to
the
attention
of
authorities
who
are
going
to
question
whether
she
has
pathology
or
not
.
Certainly
,
she
is
bucking
the
cultural
norm
,
and
chances
are
the
individual
is
going
to
be
picked
up
by
the
police
,
taken
to
the
station
,
and
then
probably
be
brought
to
a
psychiatric
emergency
room
for
an
evaluation
to
determine
whether
or
not
she
is
disordered
.

DS

How
often
are
people
who
are
considered
to
have
a
mental
disorder
or
pathology
aware
that
their
behavior
is
thought
of
as
problematic
by
other
people
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
JM
:
</hi>
It
's
a
challenge
for
them
.
Take
the
most
extreme
,
say
someone
who
is
grossly
psychotic
.
More
often
,
they
are
<hi rend="italic">
not
</hi>
aware
that
their
behavior
is
problematic
to
society
and
that
is
what
gets
them
into
difficulties
.
Other
individuals
who
<hi rend="italic">
are
</hi>
more
aware
usually
are
on
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/personality%20disorder">
personality
disorder
</ref>
realm
of
diagnoses
.
Even
there
,
people
with
personality
disorders
are
comfortable
with
what
they
are
doing
;
the
problem
is
,
what
I
cause
you
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
Such
as
a
person
who
has
an
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anger%20management">
anger
management
</ref>
problem
?
The
problem
is
n't
that
they
are
brought
to
anger
,
it
's
the
external
influences
.
Even
though
that
they
know
anger
is
not
a
preferable
state
to
be
in
,
they
do
n't
see
themselves
as
the
problem
,
even
though
they
know
that
people
get
them
there
is
a
problem
.
In
other
words
,
my
anger
is
not
good
,
but
the
real
problem
is
that
you
made
me
angry
.
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
JM
:
</hi>
The
challenge
is
getting
them
to
realize
how
their
own
behavior
is
a
problem
for
other
people
.
If
somebody
has
an
anger
management
issue
that
they
are
not
aware
of
,
but
they
are
constantly
having
fights
with
their
spouse
,
they
are
getting
fired
from
jobs
,
their
kids
are
n't
talking
to
them
...
this
is
creating
distress
if
not
in
the
individual
,
certainly
in
their
family
.
The
goal
there
is
to
get
the
individual
to
realize
he
or
she
is
creating
a
problem
,
and
get
them
to
identify
what
that
problem
is
and
to
take
steps
to
ameliorate
it
.
