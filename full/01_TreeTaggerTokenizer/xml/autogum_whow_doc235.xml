<list type="ordered">
<item>
Start
with
a
time
frame
.
Like
other
analytical
stock
tools
and
moving
averages
,
the
Bollinger
Bands
are
really
only
meaningful
when
applied
to
a
specific
timeline
.
Choosing
a
window
will
help
the
investor
more
accurately
describe
what
he
or
she
sees
in
the
activity
of
Bollinger
Bands
around
an
equity
.
</item>
<item>
Understand
the
triple
band
setup
of
Bollinger
Bands
.
The
basic
explanation
from
established
sources
is
that
the
middle
band
represents
a
simple
moving
average
that
impacts
the
upper
and
lower
bands
.
What
all
of
this
leads
to
is
a
projection
of
price
probabilities
based
on
established
price
movements
.

Read
about
the
use
of
the
&quot;
envelope
&quot;
for
Bollinger
Bands
.
Traders
often
use
Bollinger
Bands
to
figure
out
relative
highs
and
lows
within
a
specific
price
environment
.
The
envelope
represents
a
region
within
the
parameters
laid
out
by
the
bands
that
can
help
traders
evaluate
various
prices
.
</item>
<item>

a
good
visual
context

daily
candle

wick
design

provides

of
the
dynamic
price
movement
in
a
market
day
(
or
longer
time
period
)
at
a
glance
.
Mixing

Apply
Bollinger
Bands
to
diversified
holdings
.
An
investor
who
fails
to
develop
a
diversified
portfolio
is
playing
with
fire
no
matter
how
analytical
he/she
gets
.
Bollinger
Bands
and
other
tools
will
not
guarantee
you
protection
in
a
volatile
market
environment
.
Be
sure
you
have
correctly
weighted
your
portfolio
among
several
asset
classes
.
</item>
<item>
Use
Bollinger
Bands
with
an
overall
trading
strategy
.
In
addition
to
diversification
,
investors
will
want
to
have
a
specific
trading
philosophy
and
master
plan
in
hand
.
Without
a
desired
goal
,
it
's
hard
to
know
when
to
sell
equities
for
profit
.
Bollinger
Bands
can
help
individuals
get
closer
to
identifying
price
movements
,
but
gaining
from
them
usually
requires
a
good
set
of
strategic
plans
.

Keep
an
international
perspective
.
Bollinger
Bands
can
be
applied
to
equities
regardless
of
where
they
're
traded
.
Learn
to
trade
in
international
markets
,
including
foreign
currency
exchanges
.
</item>
<item>
Keep
reading
the
opinions
of
various
analysts
.
With
Bollinger
Bands
,
it
's
often
how
they
are
interpreted
that
counts
.
Single
investors
should
not
base
all
of
what
they
do
on
the
opinions
of
others
,
but
knowing
how
analysts
view
the
use
of
Bollinger
Bands
in
a
given
instance
can
be
helpful
.
