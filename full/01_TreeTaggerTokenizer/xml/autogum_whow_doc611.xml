Move
forward
.
Have
you
made
mistakes
?
Of
course
you
have
.
Take
a
second
to
close
your
eyes
and
tell
yourself
that
you
're
normal
,
it
's
normal
to
make
mistakes
.
Have
you
ever
done
something
that
you
wish
you
could
take
back
?
Something
that
you
would
n't
tell
anyone
?
That
's
normal
too
.
Today
is
the
day
that
you
become
the
person
that
you
were
always
meant
to
be
.
That
ca
n't
happen
if
you
have
baggage
.
Leave
the
past
in
the
past
.
You
my
friend
,
have
a
chance
to
restart
,
and
all
you
have
to
do
is
forget
all
the
bad
things
that
you
did
,
all
the
things
that
has
happened
to
you
,
and
just
move
forward
.

Accept
yourself
.
We
all
wish
we
could
be
someone
else
,
wish
that
maybe
for
just
one
day
we
would
n't
be
so
insecure
,
have
the
need
to
buy
material
things
,
as
if
that
would
make
us
more
perfect
,
or
more
like
that
one
person
you
wish
you
could
be
.
But
let
me
tell
you
something
;
someone
looks
at
you
every
day
and
thinks
&quot;
Man
,
I
wish
I
was
like
them
.
&quot;
You
may
be
saying
to
yourself
&quot;
yeah
,
right
.
&quot;
But
it
's
so
true
.
When
we
can
accept
ourselves
the
way
we
are
,
and
not
always
try
to
be
better
than
someone
,
we
could
finally
see
that
no
one
can
be
compared
to
us
,
no
one
can
make
you
look
bad
,
because
your
were
made
the
way
you
are
for
a
reason
,
and
no
one
can
take
that
away
from
you
.
When
you
find
self-acceptance
you
will
be
that
much
closer
to
living
a
full
and
happy
life
you
deserve
.

Love
yourself
.
You
ca
n't
change
what
you
did
or
who
you
were
,
but
absolutely
nothing
can
prevent
you
from
being
the
person
you
want
to
be
,
from
shaping
yourself
into
the
human
that
you
want
everyone
to
see
when
they
look
at
you
.
You
're
so
lovable
with
all
your
flaws
,
and
you
do
n't
even
need
someone
to
tell
you
that
.
If
you
ca
n't
love
yourself
,
than
why
should
others
love
you
?

Grow
.
You
're
constantly
growing
.
Physically
,
that
is
.
Today
,
grow
spiritually
.
Accept
yourself
,
try
new
things
,
grow
in
knowledge
of
yourself
.
Inside
all
of
us
,
there
is
a
light
.
A
light
that
burns
brighter
than
any
flame
.
This
light
cannot
and
will
not
be
extinguished
,
only
hidden
.
Why
,
oh
why
,
would
you
hide
such
a
mesmerizing
light
?
Could
it
be
that
some
one
else
may
overpower
yours
?
Perhaps
another
person
told
you
that
yours
is
not
beautiful
?
Friend
,
yours
is
the
most
beautiful
of
anyone
,
none
can
overpower
yours
,
for
yours
is
unique
.
The
hard
part
is
not
keeping
this
light
on
,
but
finding
it
,
yours
has
been
hidden
for
so
long
that
you
may
not
find
it
.
Show
the
world
your
light
,
and
let
them
see
that
your
a
person
of
such
greatness
that
all
will
love
you
and
respect
you
.
