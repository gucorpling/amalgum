quickly
became
very
popular

Brazilians
,
describing

fresh

about

</p>
<p>
Lobo
gets
an
intimate
look
at
the
center
of
Brazilian
politics
by
living
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brasilia">
Brasilia
</ref>
,
near
residences
of
parliamentarians
(
including
Roberto
Jefferson
)
,
public
buildings
and
the
Brazilian
Chamber
of
Deputies
.
Or
,
as
he
says
in

&quot;
near

&quot;
a
reference

the
recent
political
crisis
.
</p>
<p>
At
first
,
Lobo
began
describing
the
daily
activities
of
his
famous
neighbor
deputy
Roberto
Jefferson
.
As
the
crisis
moved
on
,
he
began
to
describe
the
political
events
regarding
it
.
His
writings
evolved
to
not
only
what
is
going
on
with
Jefferson
,
but
what
is
going
on
in
Brazilian
Congress
,
and
has
interviewed
politicians
,
including
Roberto
Jefferson
himself
.
</p>
<p>
The
blog
tries
to
be
informative
,
with
a
lot
of
humour
(
common
with
Brazilians
)
,
and
some
protests
against
the
bad
habits
of
Brazilian
politics
in
general
.

What
was
your
aim
at
starting
a
blog
<p>
Ricardo
Lobo
:
The
blog
was
born
without
any
aim
.
In
fact
it
was
a
joke
with
a
college
friend
of
mine
and
my
cousin
.
They
knew
that
I
lived
next
door
to
the
deputy
[
Roberto
Jefferson
]
and
they
asked
me
every
day
about
the
journalists
staying
out
in
front
of
his
door
at
his
building
.
</p>
<p>
Ricardo
Lobo
:
So
,
I
began
to
write
the
blog
,
it
was
closer
to
the
&quot;
making
of
&quot;
a
journalistic
coverture
,
describing
the
confusion
and
the
changes
of
routine
caused
by
the
journalists
who
staying
under
my
window
,
waiting
for
something
happens
.
