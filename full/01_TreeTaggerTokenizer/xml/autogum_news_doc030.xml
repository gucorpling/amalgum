Adly
Mansour
</ref>
,
the
interim
leader
of
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Egypt">
Egypt
</ref>
,
announced
plans
to
reform
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Egypt">
Egypt
's
constitution

and
hold
a
new
round
of
parliamentary
and
presidential
elections

The

also
announced
a
judicial

</p>
<p>
Mansour
plans
to
form
a
panel
within
fifteen
days
to
review
and
suggest
changes
to
the
now-suspended
constitution
.
Those
amendments
would
be
voted
on
in
a
referendum
within
four
months
.
Parliamentary
elections
would
then
be
held
,
perhaps
in
early
2014
,
followed
by
presidential
elections
upon
the
forming
of
a
new
parliament

Yesterday
in
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Cairo">
Cairo
</ref>
,
protestors
supporting
Mohamed
Morsi
and
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Muslim_Brotherhood">
Muslim
Brotherhood
</ref>
were
shot
outside
the
Presidential
Guard
barracks
,
where
pro-Morsi
supporters
believe
the
former
president
is
being
kept
under
arrest
.
The
Muslim
Brotherhood
claim
53
people
died
,
while
the
health
ministry
claim
51
people
died
and
435
were
injured
.
The
Muslim
Brotherhood
claim
the
attack
was
unprovoked
and
those
gathered
were
praying
.
Colonel
Ahmed
Mohammed
Ali
,
spokesman
for
the
army
,
said
the
group
had
attacked
security
forces
and
were
armed
with
&quot;
large
quantities
of
firearms
,
ammunition
and
Molotov
cocktails
&quot;
.
The
Muslim
Brotherhood
claimed
children
were
killed
in
the
conflict
but
Colonel
Ali
claims
the
photos
being
used
by
the
Muslim
Brotherhood
are
actually
photos
from
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Syria">
Syria
</ref>
in
March
.
Colonel
Ali
also
stated
two
policemen
and
a
soldier
were
killed
.
</p>
<p>
One
of
the
survivors
,
Mohamed
Saber
el-Sebaei
,
told
journalists
he
was
praying
when
the
confrontation
started
:
&quot;
Just
before
we
finished
,
the
shooting
started
.
The
army
units
that
were
standing
in
front
of
the
Republican
Guard
headquarters
first
started
shooting
teargas
,
then
live
ammunition
above
people
's
heads
[
...
]
I
was
taking
cover
with
another
guy
behind
some
rubble
and
I
felt
something
hit
my
head
.
I
held
my
prayer
mat
in
my
hand
and
I
started
to
cover
my
head
with
it
.
But
I
could
n't
stop
the
bleeding
because
there
was
so
much
blood
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
shooting
of
51
people
on
Monday
follows
violence
last
week
which
killed
36
people
in
Cairo
.
The
Muslim
Brotherhood
have
asked
supporters
to
protest
non-violently
and
support
peaceful
vigils
.
Some
within
the
Muslim
Brotherhood
movement
have
suggested
they
may
be
outlawed
,
as
they
were
under
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Hosni_Mubarak">
Hosni
Mubarak
</ref>
.
</p>
<p>
British
Foreign
Sectretary
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/William_Hague">
William
Hague
</ref>
said
:
&quot;
It
is
crucial
that
there
is
a
swift
return
to
democratic
processes
in
Egypt
.
All
sides
of
the
political
spectrum
should
work
together
for
the
sake
of
the
country
's
political
and
economic
future
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Former
British
Prime
Minister
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Tony_Blair">
Tony
Blair
</ref>
said
the
intervention
by
the
army
was
necessary
to
prevent
&quot;
chaos
&quot;
,
and
said
the
protests
that
led
to
the
downfall
of
Morsi
are
due
to
dissatisfaction
with
the
efficacy
of
government
:
&quot;
When
governments
do
n't
deliver
,
people
protest
.
They
do
n't
want
to
wait
for
an
election
.
&quot;
Blair
also
blamed
the
&quot;
ideology
and
intolerance
of
the
Muslim
Brotherhood
&quot;
:
&quot;
People
felt
that
the
Brotherhood
was
steadily
imposing
its
own
doctrines
on
everyday
life
&quot;
.
Blair
advised
Western
governments
to
&quot;
engage
with
the
new
de
facto
power
and
help
the
new
government
make
the
changes
necessary
,
especially
on
the
economy
,
so
they
can
deliver
for
the
people
.
In
that
way
,
we
can
also
help
shape
a
path
back
to
the
ballot
box
that
is
designed
by
and
for
Egyptians
&quot;
.
