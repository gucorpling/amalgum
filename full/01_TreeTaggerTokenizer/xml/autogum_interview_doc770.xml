Why
did
NASA
decide
to
take
the
route
of
distributed
computing
?
Will
they
do
this
again
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
I
would
n't
say
that
NASA
decided
to
do
this
—
the
idea
for
Stardust@home
originated
here
at
U.
C.
Berkeley
.
Part
of
the
idea
of
course
came
…
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
If
I
understand
correctly
it
is
n't
distributed
computing
,
but
distributed
eyeballing
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
…from
the
SETI@home
people
who
are
just
down
the
hall
from
us
.
But
as
Brian
just
pointed
out
.
this
is
not
really
distributed
computing
like
SETI@home
the
computers
are
just
platforms
for
the
VM
and
it
is
human
eyes
and
brains
who
are
doing
the
real
work
which
makes
it
fun
(
IMHO
)
.
</p>
<p>
That
said
…
There
have
been
quite
a
few
people
who
have
expressed
interested
in
developing
automated
algorithms
for
searching
.
Just
because
WE
do
n't
know
how
to
write
such
an
algorithm
does
n't
mean
<hi rend="italic">
nobody
</hi>
does
.
We
're
delighted
at
this
and
are
happy
to
help
make
it
happen
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Is
n't
there
a
catch
22
that
the
data
you
're
going
to
collect
would
be
a
prerequisite
to
automating
the
process
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
That
was
the
conclusion
that
we
came
to
early
on
—
that
we
would
need
some
sort
of
training
set
to
be
able
to
train
an
algorithm
.
Of
course
you
have
to
train
people
too
,
but
we
're
hoping
(
we
'll
see
!
)
that
people
are
more
flexible
in
recognizing
things
that
they
've
never
seen
before
and
pointing
them
out
.
Our
experience
is
that
people
who
have
never
seen
a
track
in
aerogel
can
learn
to
recognize
them
very
quickly
,
even
against
a
big
background
of
cracks
,
dust
and
other
sources
of
confusion
...
Coming
back
to
the
original
question
—
although
NASA
did
n't
originate
the
idea
,
they
are
very
generously
supporting
this
project
.
It
would
n't
have
happened
without
NASA
's
financial
support
(
and
of
course
access
to
the
Stardust
collector
)
.
Did
that
answer
the
question
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Will
a
project
like
this
be
done
again
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
I
do
n't
know
...
There
are
only
a
few
projects
for
which
this
approach
makes
sense
...
In
fact
,
I
frankly
have
n't
run
across
another
at
least
in
Space
Science
.
But
I
am
totally
open
to
the
idea
of
it
.
I
am
not
in
favor
of
just
doing
it
as
&quot;
make-work
&quot;
—
that
is
just
artificially
taking
this
approach
when
another
approach
would
make
more
sense
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
How
did
the
idea
come
up
to
do
this
kind
of
project
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
Really
desperation
.
When
we
first
thought
about
this
we
assumed
that
we
would
use
some
sort
of
automated
image
recognition
technique
.
We
asked
some
experts
around
here
in
CS
and
the
conclusion
was
that
the
problem
was
somewhere
between
trivial
and
impossible
,
and
we
would
n't
know
until
we
had
some
real
examples
to
work
with
.
So
we
talked
with
Dan
Wertheimer
and
Dave
Anderson
(
literally
down
the
hall
from
us
)
about
the
idea
of
a
distributed
project
,
and
they
were
quite
encouraging
.
Dave
proposed
the
VM
machinery
,
and
Josh
Von
Korff
,
a
physics
grad
student
,
implemented
it
.
(
Beautifully
,
I
think
.
I
take
no
credit
!
)
