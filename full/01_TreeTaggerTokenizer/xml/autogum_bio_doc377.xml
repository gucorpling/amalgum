The

a
reference
to
a
certain
Sail-Bulat
in
the
Supplement

the

under

as
being
in
the

Our

evidence
that

was
khan
of

comes
from
a
statement
that

ambassador

In
1575
(
either
September
or
October
)
,
Ivan
IV
appointed
Simeon
as
Grand
Prince
of
All
Rus
'
and
styled
himself
merely
as
&quot;
Ivan
of
Moscow
&quot;
.
Historians
have
a
number
of
opinions
concerning
why
Ivan
did
this
.
According
to
the
most
popular
theory
by
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giles_Fletcher,_the_Elder">
Giles
Fletcher
,
the
Elder
</ref>
,
Ivan
aimed
to
confiscate
the
land
that
belonged
to
monasteries
without
attracting
the
ire
of
the
Church
.
Simeon
issued
the
decrees
of
confiscation
instead
of
Ivan
,
while
Ivan
pretended
to
disagree
.
During
his
one-year
&quot;
rule
&quot;
in
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin">
Moscow
Kremlin
</ref>
,
Simeon
married
Anastasia
Mstislavskaya
,
the
great
great-granddaughter
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_III">
Ivan
III
</ref>
.
</p>
<p>
In
1576
,
Simeon
stepped
down
as
Grand
Prince
of
All
Rus
'
and
was
appointed
Grand
Prince
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tver'">
Tver
'
</ref>
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torzhok">
Torzhok
</ref>
.
In
1585
,
Tsar
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fedor_Ivanovich">
Fedor
Ivanovich
</ref>
removed
his
title
as
Grand
Prince
of
Tver
'
and
Torzhok
and
confined
him
to
his
estate
at
Kushalov
.
In
1595
,
Simeon
went
blind
.
According
to
Jacques
Margeret
,
Simeon
blamed
Spanish
wine
that
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Godunov">
Boris
Godunov
</ref>
sent
him
for
his
birthday
.
When
Boris
was
elected
Tsar
in
1598
,
he
required
those
at
the
court
to
sign
a
loyalty
oath
,
which
prohibited
them
from
recognizing
Simeon
as
tsar
or
corresponding
with
him
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_Dmitry_I">

where

In

,
as
