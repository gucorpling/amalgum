Pack
the
essentials
for
the
trip
.
If
your
child
is
still
in
diapers/nappies
,
make
sure
you
will
have
enough
for
the
whole
journey
,
and
some
spares
.
Consider
taking
a
change
of
clothes
.
If
your
toddler
needs
medicines
,
make
sure
you
can
give
them
their
usual
dose
at
the
usual
time
during
the
road
trip
.

Plan
your
journey
and
make
sure
you
know
of
any
road
closures
,
weather
risks
,
local
events
etc
that
may
cause
you
to
be
delayed
or
detoured
.
Make
sure
someone
know
what
route
you
're
plan
to
take
and
let
them
know
when
you
arrive
safely
.

Be
able
to
navigate
the
journey
.
You
may
know
the
way
,
you
might
use
a
SatNav
device
or
a
good
old
road
atlas
,
just
make
sure
you
can
find
your
way
from
A
to
B
because
being
lost
with
a
fractious
toddler
is
not
fun
.

Give
your
vehicle
a
maintenance
check
before
you
start
.
Do
n't
risk
your
toddler
's
life
because
you
have
faulty
brakes
or
bald
tires
.
Check
the
levels
of
oil
,
windshield
washer
fluid
etc
,
and
of
course
fuel
!
</item>
<item>
Use
appropriate
child
restraints
in
your
vehicle
.
Many
vehicles
with
air
bags
are
very
specific
about
where
in
the
vehicle
car
seats
are
placed
.
Look
at
your
vehicle
manual
if
you
are
unsure
.

Provide

the
age
of
your
toddler

Car
trips
can
be
boring
for
toddlers
.
Pack
a
box
of
toys
and
work
out
some
games
you
can
play
in
the
car
.
Ensure
you
will
not
be
distracted
whilst
driving
.
</item>
<item>
You
can
play
games
like
eye
spy
and
who
am
I
,
a
game
where
you
choose
an
animal
and
tell
your
toddler
three
things
about
them
then
they
have
to
guess
what
animal
it
is
,
if
your
child
has
the
required
vocabulary
.
Children
of
two
have
short
attention
spans
so
do
n't
expect
word
games
to
entertain
for
very
long
.
</item>
<item>
You
can
also
sing
songs
and
nursery
rhymes
,
if
you
know
four
hours
worth
!

Deal
with
your
toddler
getting
car
sick
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Not
every
toddler
gets
car
sick
and
there
is
no
guaranteed
way
of
preventing
car
sickness
so
make
sure
you
always
have
a
bag
handy
if
your
main
concern
is
vomit
.
If
you
know
your
toddler
suffers
from
stomach
upsets
and
gets
distressed
on
long
car
journeys
,
ask
your
doctor
or
paediatrician
for
advice
.
Whilst
vomit
on
your
car
seats
is
very
unpleasant
,
your
child
being
distressed
should
be
your
main
concern
.
</item>
<item>
Keep
a
towel
and
wipes
so
you
can
clean
things
up
if
your
toddler
is
sick
<figure rend="Help a Carsick Child Step 7Bullet1.jpg">

If
you
know
how
,
teach
your
toddler
to
recognise
the
signs
that
they
are
going
to
throw
up
so
they
can
warn
you
you
so
you
can
pull
over
in
time
.
Remember
,
never
pull
over
unless
it
is
safe
to
do
so
,
especially
on
motorways
.

Deal
with
grumpy
toddlers
on
a
road
trip
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Your
toddler
may
get
grumpy
if
they
are
hungry
or/and
tired
.
Pack
food
so
your
toddler
can
eat
.
Make
sure
you
keep
your
toddler
hydrated
and
be
very
careful
to
avoid
foods
they
make
choke
on
if
you
let
your
child
eat
while
you
are
driving
and
not
supervising
them
.

Avoid
giving
toddlers
sugary
drinks
.
These
are
bad
for
their
teeth
and
can
cause
peaks
and
troughs
in
their
energy
levels
through
out
the
journey
.
Pack
fruit
and
a
sandwich
,
perhaps
.
</item>
<item>
If
possible
plan
your
road
trip
to
let
your
toddler
fall
asleep
in
the
car
for
as
much
of
the
journey
as
possible
.
