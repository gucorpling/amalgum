Paint
a
City
Skyline
in
Watercolor
</head>
<p>
A
city
skyline
is
exciting
to
see
and
fun
to
paint
.
This
project
focuses
on
using
geometric
shapes
,
including
the
square
,
rectangle
,
triangle
,
and
to
a
lesser
degree
,
the
circle
rather
than
following
the
laws
of
perspective
.
The
result
is
a
stylized
,
make-believe
view
of
a
city
rather
than
a
realistic
one
.
Artists
of
any
skill
level
can
have
a
good
time
exploring
the
city
and
build
confidence
by
doing
what
can
often
be
thought
of
as
a
difficult
subject
.

Draw
out
the

a
line
of
building
roofs
in

.
Keep
it
simple
-
just
draw
geometric
shapes
side

side
with
lots
of
variety
in
heights
.
Include
many
deep
dips
for
interest
.
Draw
another
line
a
little
up
from
the
bottom
edge
of
the
paper
to
indicate
where
the
buildings
start
from
at
the
bottom
.
Then
draw
lines
down
from
the
rooftops
of
the
buildings
ending
at
this
line
to
sketch
out
the
whole
building
.

Prepare
your
brush
.

up
a
1
”
flat
brush
and
load
it
with
any
color
of
well
diluted
paint
,
working
from
a
puddle
of
color
that
you
made
on
your
palette
.
Do
this

Paint
a
layer
of
colored
stripes
for
the
buildings
.
Start
at
the
top
of
one
of
the
buildings
and
make
a
continuous
stroke
ending
it
at
the
line
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
.
Paint
a
number
of
lines
in

building
you
made
.
Change
colors
for
different
buildings
if
you
'd
like
.
Continue
until
you
have
a
multi-colored
layer
of
various
width
stripes
over
the
entire
paper
.
Allow
this
to
dry
.
A
hairdryer
can
help
with
drying
the
page
faster

If
you
want
to
put

a

dry
paper
between

Add
another
layer

detail
to
your
painting
.
Choose
a
½
”
flat
brush
and
load
it
with
any
color
.
Do
this
on
the
now-dry
painting
to
preserve
the
freshness
of
colors
you
already
put
down
.
Paint
doorways
,
more
windows
,
edgings
and
frames
along
the
tops
of
some
of
the
windows
and
buildings
,
etc.
Turn
the
brush
sideways
and
use
it
to
stamp
texture
on
one
or
two
of
the
buildings
.
Add
any
amount
of
small
details
you
'd
like
until
you
are
satisfied
that
your
scene
is
interesting
and
varied
.
Allow
this

dry

Paint
the
foreground
.
Unmask
the
area
you
preserved
.
Draw
and
paint
the
object(s)
that
you
chose
for
visual
interest
.
Paint
the
streets
,
the
sidewalks
,
people
,
cars
,
or
any
other
thing
you
'd
find
in
a
real
city
that
you
sketched
out

Allow
the
piece
to
dry
thoroughly
and
touch
up
areas
that
need
punching
up

Hang
the
picture
to
view
over
time
.
It
might
inspire
you
to
paint
another
street
scene
.
We
get
new
ideas
from
looking
at
what
we
have
created
.
We
picture
things
we
would
like
to
change
or
add
.
This
is
what
keeps
us
painting
and
creating
.
Also
,
be
aware
that
in
your
travels
,
you
will
see
city
views
with
new
eyes
.
Art
makes
your
powers
of
observation
keener
and
you
will
find
a
greater
appreciation
and
beauty
in
what
was
once
considered
the
mundane
and
ordinary
.

Tips
</head>
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Play
around
with
your
paints
prior
to
starting
any
project
.
Test
color
mixtures
and
above
all
,
aim
to
achieve
the
correct
consistency
of
paint
.
This
one
thing
is
all
important
in
doing
successful
watercolors
.
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Put
a
few
strokes
of
clear
water
onto
your
palette
.
Add
pure
,
undiluted
paint
gradually
.
</item>
<item>
Test
the
paint
on
scrap
paper
often
.
It
should
be
thick
enough
to
clearly
show
the
color
,
but
transparent
enough
to
allow
the
white
paper
to
shine
through
.
Avoid
,
at
all
costs
,
working
with
your
paint
too
dense
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
A
play
of
light
is
what
makes
watercolor
successful
.
Use
only
good
,
strong
watercolor
paper
(
student
grade
if
fine
initially
)
to
support
the
paint
.
Respect
the
white
of
the
paper
-
allow
it
to
do
its
work
by
not
overwhelming
it
.
