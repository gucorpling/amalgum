Chapter
12
</head>
<p>
The
library
looked
as
she
had
pictured
it
.
The
green-shaded
lamps
made
tranquil
circles
of
light
in
the
gathering
dusk
,
a
little
fire
flickered
on
the
hearth
,
and
Selden
's
easy-chair
,
which
stood
near
it
,
had
been
pushed
aside
when
he
rose
to
admit
her
.
</p>
<p>
He
had
checked
his
first
movement
of
surprise
,
and
stood
silent
,
waiting
for
her
to
speak
,
while
she
paused
a
moment
on
the
threshold
,
assailed
by
a
rush
of
memories
.
</p>
<p>
The
scene
was
unchanged
.
She
recognized
the
row
of
shelves
from
which
he
had
taken
down
his
La
Bruyere
,
and
the
worn
arm
of
the
chair
he
had
leaned
against
while
she
examined
the
precious
volume
.
But
then
the
wide
September
light
had
filled
the
room
,
making
it
seem
a
part
of
the
outer
world
:
now
the
shaded
lamps
and
the
warm
hearth
,
detaching
it
from
the
gathering
darkness
of
the
street
,
gave
it
a
sweeter
touch
of
intimacy
.
</p>
<p>
Becoming
gradually
aware
of
the
surprise
under
Selden
's
silence
,
Lily
turned
to
him
and
said
simply
:
&quot;
I
came
to
tell
you
that
I
was
sorry
for
the
way
we
parted
--
for
what
I
said
to
you
that
day
at
Mrs.
Hatch
's
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
words
rose
to
her
lips
spontaneously
.
Even
on
her
way
up
the
stairs
,
she
had
not
thought
of
preparing
a
pretext
for
her
visit
,
but
she
now
felt
an
intense
longing
to
dispel
the
cloud
of
misunderstanding
that
hung
between
them
.
</p>
<p>
Selden
returned
her
look
with
a
smile
.
&quot;
I
was
sorry
too
that
we
should
have
parted
in
that
way
;
but
I
am
not
sure
I
did
n't
bring
it
on
myself
.
Luckily
I
had
foreseen
the
risk
I
was
taking
--
--
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
So
that
you
really
did
n't
care
--
--
?
&quot;
broke
from
her
with
a
flash
of
her
old
irony
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
So
that
I
was
prepared
for
the
consequences
,
&quot;
he
corrected
good-humouredly
.
&quot;
But
we
'll
talk
of
all
this
later
.
Do
come
and
sit
by
the
fire
.
I
can
recommend
that
arm-chair
,
if
you
'll
let
me
put
a
cushion
behind
you
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
While
he
spoke
she
had
moved
slowly
to
the
middle
of
the
room
,
and
paused
near
his
writing-table
,
where
the
lamp
,
striking
upward
,
cast
exaggerated
shadows
on
the
pallour
of
her
delicately-hollowed
face
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
You
look
tired
--
do
sit
down
,
&quot;
he
repeated
gently
.
</p>
<p>
She
did
not
seem
to
hear
the
request
.
&quot;
I
wanted
you
to
know
that
I
left
Mrs.
Hatch
immediately
after
I
saw
you
,
&quot;
she
said
,
as
though
continuing
her
confession
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Yes
--
yes
;
I
know
,
&quot;
he
assented
,
with
a
rising
tinge
of
embarrassment
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
And
that
I
did
so
because
you
told
me
to
.
Before
you
came
I
had
already
begun
to
see
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
remain
with
her
--
for
the
reasons
you
gave
me
;
but
I
would
n't
admit
it
--
I
would
n't
let
you
see
that
I
understood
what
you
meant
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Ah
,
I
might
have
trusted
you
to
find
your
own
way
out
--
do
n't
overwhelm
me
with
the
sense
of
my
officiousness
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
His
light
tone
,
in
which
,
had
her
nerves
been
steadier
,
she
would
have
recognized
the
mere
effort
to
bridge
over
an
awkward
moment
,
jarred
on
her
passionate
desire
to
be
understood
.
In
her
strange
state
of
extra-lucidity
,
which
gave
her
the
sense
of
being
already
at
the
heart
of
the
situation
,
it
seemed
incredible
that
any
one
should
think
it
necessary
to
linger
in
the
conventional
outskirts
of
word-play
and
evasion
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
It
was
not
that
--
I
was
not
ungrateful
,
&quot;
she
insisted
.
But
the
power
of
expression
failed
her
suddenly
;
she
felt
a
tremor
in
her
throat
,
and
two
tears
gathered
and
fell
slowly
from
her
eyes
.
</p>
<p>
Selden
moved
forward
and
took
her
hand
.
&quot;
You
are
very
tired
.
Why
wo
n't
you
sit
down
and
let
me
make
you
comfortable
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
He
drew
her
to
the
arm-chair
near
the
fire
,
and
placed
a
cushion
behind
her
shoulders
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
And
now
you
must
let
me
make
you
some
tea
:
you
know
I
always
have
that
amount
of
hospitality
at
my
command
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
She
shook
her
head
,
and
two
more
tears
ran
over
.
But
she
did
not
weep
easily
,
and
the
long
habit
of
self-control
reasserted
itself
,
though
she
was
still
too
tremulous
to
speak
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
You
know
I
can
coax
the
water
to
boil
in
five
minutes
,
&quot;
Selden
continued
,
speaking
as
though
she
were
a
troubled
child
.
</p>
<p>
His
words
recalled
the
vision
of
that
other
afternoon
when
they
had
sat
together
over
his
tea-table
and
talked
jestingly
of
her
future
.
There
were
moments
when
that
day
seemed
more
remote
than
any
other
event
in
her
life
;
and
yet
she
could
always
relive
it
in
its
minutest
detail
.
</p>
<p>
She
made
a
gesture
of
refusal
.
&quot;
No
:
I
drink
too
much
tea
.
I
would
rather
sit
quiet
--
I
must
go
in
a
moment
,
&quot;
she
added
confusedly
.
</p>
<p>
Selden
continued
to
stand
near
her
,
leaning
against
the
mantelpiece
.
The
tinge
of
constraint
was
beginning
to
be
more
distinctly
perceptible
under
the
friendly
ease
of
his
manner
.
Her
self-absorption
had
not
allowed
her
to
perceive
it
at
first
;
but
now
that
her
consciousness
was
once
more
putting
forth
its
eager
feelers
,
she
saw
that
her
presence
was
becoming
an
embarrassment
to
him
.
Such
a
situation
can
be
saved
only
by
an
immediate
outrush
of
feeling
;
and
on
Selden
's
side
the
determining
impulse
was
still
lacking
.
</p>
<p>
The
discovery
did
not
disturb
Lily
as
it
might
once
have
done
.
She
had
passed
beyond
the
phase
of
well-bred
reciprocity
,
in
which
every
demonstration
must
be
scrupulously
proportioned
to
the
emotion
it
elicits
,
and
generosity
of
feeling
is
the
only
ostentation
condemned
.
But
the
sense
of
loneliness
returned
with
redoubled
force
as
she
saw
herself
forever
shut
out
from
Selden
's
inmost
self
.
She
had
come
to
him
with
no
definite
purpose
;
the
mere
longing
to
see
him
had
directed
her
;
but
the
secret
hope
she
had
carried
with
her
suddenly
revealed
itself
in
its
death-pang
.
