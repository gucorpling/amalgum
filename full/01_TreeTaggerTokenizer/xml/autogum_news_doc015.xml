,
is
down

individuals
remaining
worldwide
,
most
of
them
in
Africa
and
,
rarely

in

.
</p>
<p>
The
number
establishes
cheetahs
as
much
less
commonplace
than
just
over
one
hundred
years
ago
.
There
are
now
scientists
calling
for
the

indicates

more

According
to
the
study
's
authors
,
the
habitat
preservation
strategy
that
can
be
so
effective
in
other
species
does
not
work
on
cheetahs
because
of
their
wide
range
.
About
77
%
of
wild
cheetah
's
ranges
are
outside
protected
areas
.
According

'
s

150

Causes
of
cheetah
decline
have
been
mostly
habitat
loss
,
killings
of
cheetahs
by
humans
,
human
hunting
of
cheetah
's
resources
such
as
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antelope">

,
illegal

trafficking
,
and
<ref target="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/roadkill">

.
According
to
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheetah%20Conservation%20Fund">
Cheetah
Conservation
Fund
</ref>
,
about
85
%
of
an
estimated
1,200
trafficked
cheetah
cubs
have
died
within
the
past
ten
years
,
perishing
en
route
.

<p>
Their
exotic
aesthetic
renders
cheetah
very
valuable
.
A
trafficked
cub
can
fetch
$
10,000
,
according
to
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/BBC">
BBC
</ref>
.
According
to
DW
,
cheetah
skin
and
meat
are
valuable
as
well
.
</p>
<p>
Complicating
conservation
efforts
,
cheetahs
are
carnivores
and
difficult
to
maintain
in
captivity
.
According
to
one
report
,
the
77
%
of
wild
cheetah
habitat
is
outside
the
range
of
protected
wildlife
areas
and
reserves
.
The
cheetahs
'
secretive
nature
makes
finding
conclusive
evidence
on
cheetahs
difficult
,
says
Durant
.
</p>
<p>
Cheetah
is
the
world
's
fastest
springing
species
and
predator
.
One
cheetah
was
recorded
sprinting
at
29meters
(
95.1ft
)
per
second
.
They
slow
down
if
needed
to
hunt
,
and
can
maintain
high
speeds
for
hundred
of
metres
.
The
running
speed
of
cheetahs
has
not
prevented
their
decline
.
