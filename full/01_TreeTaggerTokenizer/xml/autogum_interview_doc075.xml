<p>
I
have
five
daughters
.
My
oldest
daughter
is
19
and
a
freshman
at
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana%20University%20 – %20Purdue%20University%20Indianapolis">
IUPUI
</ref>
here
in
Indianapolis
.
She
's
our
first
proud
graduate
of
Delph
Academy
for
Girls
.
She
did
really
well
her
first
semester
of
college
,
making
the
Dean
's
List
.
So
mom
and
dad
were
obviously
very
ecstatic
there
.
I
have
a
17-year-old
daughter
,
who
just
turned
17
.
She
told
dad
that
she
wanted
a
boyfriend
for
her
birthday
,
and
so
I
went
out
and
got
a
little
stuffed
animal
of
the
good
guy
from
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frozen%20(2013%20film)">
Frozen
</ref>
[
a
film
]
,
which
I
said
you
can
take
to
bed
with
you
every
night
and
cuddle
with
.
So
her
name
is
Evelyn
.
I
have
a
14-year
old
named
Anna
,
a
10-year
old
named
Emma
,
and
my
7-year-old
,
who
will
probably
—
well
her
name
is
Lilly
,
that
she
believes
she
will
be
the
next
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame">
rock
star
</ref>
of
rock
music
.
And
she
and
I
play
my
guitar
and
sing
every
night
.
So
that
's
a
little
bit
about
my
family
.
</p>
<p>
I
work
as
general
counsel
for
a
second-generation
family-owned
business
based
out
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomington,%20Indiana">
Bloomington
</ref>
,
Indiana
,
named
CarDon
&amp;
Associates
.
And
we
are
in
the
business
of
senior
housing
and
long-term
care
,
post-acute
care
,
nursing
homes
,
assisted-living
facilities
and
independent
living
facilities
.

We
understand
that
you

How
did
you
decide

home

?

<hi rend="bold">

:
Well
the
name
of
our
home
school
is
the
Delph
Academy
for
Girls
.
Originally
my
19-year
old
was
part
of
the
Carmel
school
system
and
attended
Carmel
Elementary
and
had
a
real
challenging
year
,
her
first
grade
year
.
We
were
actually
told
by
her
first
grade
teacher
that
she
would
have
a
hard
time
graduating
from
high
school
and
that
college
was
not
in
the
cards
,
which
obviously
was
a
lot
for
mom
and
dad
to
take
with
our
first
grader
.
We
went
and
had
a
battery
of
tests
done
.
And
there
was
a
dispute
within
the
school
system
as
to
what
,
if
any
,
learning
disabilities
that
she
might
have
,
and
what
we
should
do
about
it
.
So
we
finished
out
that
school
year
and
went
a
little
bit
into
the
next
,
and
then
we
just
made
the
decision
as
a
family
that
we
were
n't
going
to
fight
the
system
.
We
were
going
to
take
matters
into
our
own
hands
and
start
homeschooling
our
daughter
.
Then
we
just
started
homeschooling
the
rest
of
our
kids
.
It
's
turned
out
to
be
a
very
big
blessing
in
the
life
of
the
Delph
family
for
obvious
reasons
because
our
daughter
has
turned
around
her
academic
life
in
a
very
positive
fashion
and
is
doing
very
well
in
college
,
as
I
mentioned
before
.
</p>
<p>
Another
reason
why
we
homeschool
our
students
,
is
we
teach
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible">
Bible
</ref>
in
our
school
.
And
obviously
you
ca
n't
do
that
in
the
public
school
system
.
Our
faith
and
Christian
values
are
very
important
to
Beth
and
I
and
to
our
daughters
.
