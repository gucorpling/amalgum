Summary
and
Conclusions
</head>
<p>
A
new
methodology
is
proposed
for
the
development
of
appropriate
technology
that
allows
satisfying
energy
needs
in
rural
communities
.
Thus
,
the
novelty
of
this
work
consisted
in
the
integration
of
the
technical
,
environmental
and
social
aspects
to
obtain
a
device
,
which
not
only
met
the
engineering
required
features
but
also
takes
into
account
the
user
opinions
and
needs
in
the
whole
process
.
The
integration
of
all
these
characteristics
is
crucial
because
it
contributes
to
a
successful
functionality
and
operability
of
the
proposed
appropriate
technology
.
The
introduced
methodology
included
several
stages
grouped
in
a
process
that
consists
of
two
parts
:
(
a
)
Identification
of
energy
consumption
or
natural
resources
,
and
(
b
)
development
of
appropriate
technology
.
</p>
<p>
The
methodology
is
implemented
in
a
case
study
for
the
development
of
a
solar
wood-dryer
in
the
artisan
community
of
the
indigenous
population
of
Pichátaro
,
in
the
Mexican
state
of
Michoacán
.
The
key
results
and
findings
from
this
investigation
are
as
follows
:
</p>
<list>
<item>
Three
geometries
of
a
solar
wood-dryer
prototype
were
proposed
and
analyzed
with
the
computer
software
Open
FOAM
.
All
proposed
geometries
showed
better
interior
heat
transfer
than
the
traditional
wood-brick
dryer
.
</item>
<item>
A
Life-Cycle
Analysis
(
LCA
)
of
the
proposed
solar
wood-dryer
was
carried
out
as
part
of
the
methodology
.
The
results
showed
that
the
new
solar
wood-dryer
prototype
has
environmental
impacts
in
all
analyzed
categories
that
are
5
%
or
smaller
than
those
of
the
traditional
dryer
.
Particularly
,
global
warming
potential
figures
decreased
by
about
98
%
with
the
use
of
the
proposed
solar
wood-dryer
.
Due
to
the
aim
of
this
study
was
to
compare
our
proposed
solar
wood-dryer
with
the
traditional
dryer
it
was
immediately
displacing
,
we
omitted
comparisons
with
other
devices
in
the
market
.
</item>
<item>
Based
on
the
designed
geometries
,
the
LCA
,
and
the
considerations
proposed
by
the
artisans
of
the
community
,
a
solar
wood-dryer
was
developed
which
has
20
%
efficiency
.
The
design
,
construction
,
and
energy
evaluation
of
this
device
,
incorporated
the
technical
and
operational
requirements
requested
by
the
artisans
in
the
community
.
</item>
<item>
The
functionality
of
the
solar
wood-dryer
was
checked
to
meet
an
identified
need
based
on
a
diagnosis
of
consumption
of
timber
resources
.
The
dryer
met
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
designed
,
and
it
will
be
delivered
to
artisans
for
frequent
use
.
</item>
<item>
It
was
identified
that
the
accompaniment
of
artisans
during
all
stages
of
the
methodology
was
essential
to
facilitate
the
construction
and
functionality
evaluation
.
The
information
that
they
provided
at
each
stage
represented
an
exercise
in
co-design
and
technology
development
that
covered
their
needs
and
motivated
its
possible
adoption
.
Therefore
,
it
should
be
noted
that
accompaniment
is
a
key
factor
since
we
believe
that
technology
should
always
suits
the
user
and
not
vice
versa
.
Finally
,
it
is
envisioned
that
the
systematic
way
of
developing
appropriate
technology
should
be
energy
efficient
,
socially
acceptable
,
and
economic
and
environmentally
viable
as
suggested
in
this
methodology
.
</item>
</list>
<p>
It
is
well
known
that
the
way
to
check
the
impact
of
the
appropriate
technology
is
through
monitoring
that
evaluates
the
transfer
and
adoption
of
it
.
Therefore
,
the
monitoring
process
will
be
discussed
in
a
follow-up
work
.
