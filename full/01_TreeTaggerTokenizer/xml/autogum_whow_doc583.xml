Be
friendly
to
others
.
We
all
have
to
be
friendly
to
each
other
.
We
are
all
the
same
,
all
human
,
but
all
different
to
each
other
and
being
different
is
a
good
thing
.
We
do
n't
even
look
the
same
,
so
our
personalities
are
all
different
too
.
We
ca
n't
judge
someone
because
they
are
different
from
us
.
Think
about
what
would
happen
if
everyone
was
the
same
?
Would
our
life
be
interesting
?
Would
their
be
anything
different
in
life
to
learn
?

Help
others
.
We
should
all
help
each
other
if
we
see
others
are
struggling
with
things
.
Imagine
you
had
something
that
you
were
struggling
with
and
no
one
to
help
you
.
What
would
you
do
?
How
would
you
do
it
?
Will
it
work
if
you
are
doing
what
you
are
doing
?

Take
care
of
those
in
special
need
.
We
should
all
try

go
to
visit
someone
who
is
in
hospital
and
take
care
of
this
we
know
that
are
ill
or
in
pain
.
Think
how
it
feels
to
be
all
alone
without
any
friends
when
you
are
suffering
.
Would
you
like
it
if
no
one
came
to
visit
you
?

Do
n't
let
others
risk
their
lives
.
Someone

What
do
you
do
?
(
You
think
of
anything
that
will
save
them
,
the
best
thing
that
will
save
them

be
some
think
that
floats
)
throw
them
a
floating
hoop
,
if
there
is
nothing
that
floats
go
and
dive
to
save
them
.

Be
happy
with
the
things
in
life
.
If
you
are
not
happy
,
think
why
are
you
not
happy
.
Think
how
can
you
improve
it
or
do
it
?
Will
I
be
able
to
do
it
?
If
you
ca
n't
do
it
think
to
yourself
that
you

not
have
?

Be
a
better
person
.
Some
people
do
mean
things
because
of
how
they
were
treated
when
they
where
younger
.
But
you
can
change
your
life
into
a
better
life
then
being
mean
.
We
all
have
good
and
bad
things
in
us

Find
yourself
some
good
friends
to
hang
around
with
,
to
play
basketball
,
go
to
the
cinema
,
go
to
the
club
and
shopping
.

Understand
that
some
people
steal
because
they
take
drugs
.
There
is
a
good
drug
called
the
African
Iboga
plant
.
But
it
costs
a
lot
of
money
.
If
you
could
make
this
for
free
this
would
change
the
whole
world
.
Imagine
a
place
where
no
one
takes
drugs
,
does
n't
smoke
and
does
n't
have
any
silly
habits
.
There
will
be
less
criminal
things
happening
around
the
world
like
killing
,
stealing
,
etc.
People
do
n't
do
things
without
a
reasons
there
is
a
reason
to
why
people
do
it
.

Encourage
children
to
meditate
.
People
should
make
every
child
do
meditation
.
In
schools
they
should
teach
them
how
to
relax
.
If
somebody
really
wants
to
something
bad
they
could
meditate
and
relax
and
not
do
anything
bad
at
all
but
instead
,
go
and
do
something
nice
.
In
schools
they
should
do
a
relaxation
room
where
they
do
meditation
.
If
someone
gets
bullied
they
could
go
and
meditate
to
make
themselves
feel
better
.
It
might
be
a
good
idea
if
they
teach
children
about
differences
.
