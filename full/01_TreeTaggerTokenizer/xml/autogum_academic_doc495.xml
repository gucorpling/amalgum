Introduction
</head>
<p>
Dementia
and
depression
are
the
most
frequent
psychiatric
disorders
of
old
age
.
Both
affect
quality
of
life
of
patients
in
a
more
fundamental
way
and
to
a
much
greater
extent
than
many
somatic
diseases
.
Depression
is
also
considered
a
serious
risk
factor
for
developing
dementia
.
In
addition
,
dementia
and
depression
share
a
diagnostic
deficit
.
Dementia
is
often
only
diagnosed
in
more
advanced
stages
showing
higher
degrees
of
functional
impairment
.
Worldwide
,
patients
suffering
from
depression
frequently
are
not
correctly
diagnosed
;
therefore
,
in
many
countries
less
than
10
%
of
depressed
subjects
receive
adequate
treatment
.
</p>
<p>
Due
to
an
overlap
in
symptoms
,
a
valid
differential
diagnosis
between
dementia
and
depression
is
sometimes
difficult
to
establish
:
Depressive
disorders
in
old
age
are
associated
with
cognitive
impairment
in
40
%
to
60
%
of
patients
.
Conversely
,
about
40
%
of
dementia
patients
develop
depression
symptoms
.
Accordingly
,
among
the
differential
diagnoses
of
dementia
,
in
the
first
place
the
ICD-10
lists
depressive
disorders
,
which
can
show
characteristics
of
incipient
dementia
with
memory
impairment
,
slowed
thinking
and
lack
of
spontaneity
.
In
the
same
way
,
the
DSM-5
recommends
inspecting
the
cognitive
profiles
of
patients
suggesting
memory
and
executive
impairment
as
typical
for
Alzheimer
’s
disease
,
whereas
nonspecific
and
more
variable
test
performance
could
be
expected
in
major
depression
.
In
accordance
with
this
perspective
,
a
number
of
reviews
state
a
lack
of
clarity
in
the
neuropsychological
profiles
of
depressive
disorders
.
However
,
other
authors
consider
impairment
in
speed
of
information
processing
,
attention
or
executive
functions
as
cognitive
core
features
of
depressed
older
patients
.
</p>
<p>
Since
the
cognitive
deficits
associated
with
depression
are
less
pronounced
than
those
found
in
dementia
,
making
a
differential
diagnosis
much
more
difficult
when
it
is
not
a
full-blown
dementia
,
but
“
mild
cognitive
impairment
”
(
MCI
)
,
which
has
to
be
differentiated
from
depression
.
For
almost
30
years
,
MCI
has
been
conceptualized
as
a
transitional
phase
between
normal
aging
and
dementia
;
it
is
discussed
as
a
clinical
condition
with
a
high
prognostic
value
for
future
dementia
development
,
mostly
towards
Alzheimer
’s
dementia
.
The
diagnostic
differentiation
of
MCI
and
depression
is
further
complicated
by
the
existence
of
several
MCI
subtypes
(
amnestic
vs.
non-amnestic
,
single
vs.
multiple
domains
)
causing
a
potential
variety
of
neuropsychological
performance
patterns
.
Furthermore
,
nearly
one
third
of
MCI
patients
also
will
develop
depression
symptoms
.
Overall
,
a
wide
range
of
disturbed
cognitive
functions
may
be
expected
in
both
MCI
and
depressed
subjects
.
Consequently
,
attempts
to
differentiate
between
MCI
and
depression
by
means
of
psychometric
tests
often
have
failed
.
</p>
<p>
Against
this
background
,
the
present
study
compared
the
neuropsychological
profiles
of
patients
with
MCI
,
mild
dementia
and
depression
tested
with
the
SKT
according
to
Erzigkeit
.
The
SKT
(
acronym
for
Syndrom-Kurztest
;
however
,
this
German
term
is
outdated
and
not
used
anymore
)
is
a
short
cognitive
performance
test
assessing
memory
and
attention
,
the
latter
in
the
sense
of
speed
of
information
processing
.
Thus
,
the
SKT
addresses
exactly
those
two
cognitive
domains
that
are
considered
to
be
primarily
impaired
in
patients
with
mild
dementia
and
depressive
disorders
,
respectively
.
Furthermore
,
given
the
fact
that
amnestic
MCI
is
the
most
frequent
MCI
subtype
,
it
was
expected
that
patients
with
MCI
or
mild
dementia
would
show
greater
deficits
in
the
memory
section
of
the
SKT
,
while
depressed
patients
would
be
more
impaired
in
subtests
measuring
speed
of
information
processing
.
