Introduction
</head>
<p>
The
III
–
V
zincblende
GaP
is
one
of
the
most
widely
utilized
substrates
for
fabricating
various
semiconducting
and
magnetic
thin
films
.
From
the
viewpoint
of
device
applications
,
it
is
thus
of
crucial
importance
to
fully
recognize
the
response
of
substrates
due
to
mechanical
stresses
introduced
during
fabrication
processes
,
which
might
cause
the
contact-induced
damage
and
cracking
.
Accordingly
,
in
order
to
implementing
the
important
functional
components
of
the
devices
on
the
GaP
substrates
,
an
accurate
measurement
of
its
mechanical
characteristics
is
highly
demanded
.

<p>
Nanoindentation
has
been
proved
to
be
a
powerful
tool
for
studying
the
fundamental
mechanical
properties
(
for
instance
,
the
hardness
and
Young
’s
modulus
)
of
various
nanostructured
materials
,
biomaterials
,
and
thin
films
.
Combining
the
nanoindentation
with
microscopic
techniques
,
the
nanoindentation-induced
shear
band
formation
in
bulk
metallic
glasses
,
dislocation
nucleation
in
GaN
films
,
and
phase
transition
in
single-crystals
Si
and
Ge
had
been
extensively
investigated
to
reveal
the
underlying
mechanisms
in
great
detail
.
For
instance
,
it
was
indicated
that
in
many
nanoindentation
measurements
,
the
materials
often
exhibits
a
characteristic
feature
called
the
“
pop-in
”
event
characterized
by
a
sudden
displacement
burst
at
a
nearly
constant
indentation
load
,
which
acts
as
a
trigger
signifying
the
onset
of
plastic
deformation
.
On
the
other
hand
,
the
“
pop-in
”
behaviors
have
been
attributed
otherwise
to
the
crack
nucleation
and
the
delamination
phenomena
.
In
some
cases
,
it
has
been
also
interpreted
as
the
manifestations
of
the
dislocation
activity
depending
strongly
on
the
crystal
structure
of
the
test
materials
,
temperature
,
the
shape
of
indenter
tip
and
indenter
angle
.
Furthermore
,
the
correlations
between
pop-in
behaviors
and
dislocation
activities
of
materials
have
been
widely
studied
by
combining
microstructural
observations
with
the
cross-sectional
transmission
electron
microscopy
in
recent
years
.

For
the
nanoindentation
responses
,
the
single
“
pop-in
”
behavior
is
often
observed
in
the
zincblende-structured
,
such
as
GaAs
and
InP
single-crystals
.
Whereas
the
multiple
“
pop-ins
”
has
been
ubiquitously
identified
in
the
hexagonal-structured
materials
,
such
as
GaN
thin
films
and
ZnO
single-crystal
.
However
,
although
pop-in
phenomenon
in
the
loading
segment
was
cited
in
the
zincblende-structured
GaP
single-crystal
,
the
features
were
not
as
apparent
,
presumably
due
to
the
sensitivity
of
testing
module
used
in
their
indentation
measurements
was
force
module
,
which
often
resulted
in
serrated
loading
curve
and
blurred
the
feature
of
pop-in
events
.
Herein
,
in
this
study
,
the
mechanical
properties
and
indentation-induced
deformation
behaviors
of
GaP(100
)
single-crystal
were
investigated
by
using
continuous
stiffness
measurements
(
CSM
)
nanoindentation
module
to
unveil
the
fundamental
aspects
of
plasticity
and
mechanisms
of
local
dislocation
activities
.
Using
the
classical
dislocation
theory
,
we
also
estimated
the
number
of
indentation-induced
dislocation
loops
formed
at
the
initial
stage
of
nanoscale
deformation
in
GaP(100
)
single-crystal
.
Moreover
,
the
Vickers
indentation-induced
fracture
behaviors
and
mechanisms
of
GaP(100
)
single-crystal
will
be
discussed
,
as
well
.
