Rags
are
royal

worn

virtue

sake

<p>
(
I
shall
stop
here
and
go
down
to
the
pantry
.
I
could
eat
no
dinner
,
being
filled
with
emotion
.
But
I
must
keep
strong
if
I
am
to
help
Adrian
in
his
trouble
.
The
mince
pie
was
excellent
,
but
after
all
pastry
does
not
take
the
place
of
solid
food
.

</p>
<p>
LATER
:
I
shall
now
go
on
with
my
recital
.
As
the
theater
was
almost
empty
,
at
the
end
of
Act
One
I
put
on
the
pink
hat
and
left
it
on
as
though
absent-minded
.
There
was
no
one
behind
me
.
And
,
although
during
act
one
I
had
thought
that
he
perhaps
felt
my
presence
,
he
had
not
once
looked
directly
at
me
.
</p>
<p>
But
the
hat
captured
his
errant
gaze
,
as
one
may
say
.
And
,
after
capture
,
it
remained
on
my
face
,
so
much
so
that
I
flushed
and
a
woman
sitting
near
with
a
very
plain
girl
in
a
skunk
collar
,
observed
:
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Really
,
it
is
outrageous
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Now
came
a
moment
which
I
thrill
even
to
recollect
.
For
Adrian
plucked
a
pink
rose
from
a
vase
--
he
was
in
the
millionaire
's
house
,
and
was
starving
in
the
midst
of
luxury
--
and
held
it
to
his
lips
.
</p>
<p>
The
rose
,
not
the
house
,
of
course
.
Looking
over
it
,
he
smiled
down
at
me
.
</p>
<p>
LATER
:
It
is
midnight
.
I
cannot
sleep
.
Perchance
he
too
,
is
lying
awake
.
I
am
sitting
at
the
window
in
my
robe
de
nuit
.
Below
,
mother
and
Sis
have
just
come
in
,
and
Smith
has
slammed
the
door
of
the
car
and
gone
back
to
the
garage
.
How
puny
is
the
life
my
family
leads
!
Nothing
but
eating
and
playing
,
with
no
higher
thoughts
.
</p>
<p>
A
man
has
just
gone
by
.
For
a
moment
I
thought
I
recognized
the
footstep
.
But
no
,
it
was
but
the
night
watchman
.

<p>
JANUARY
17TH
.
Father
still
away
.
No
money
,
as
mother
absolutely
refuses
on
account
of
Maddie
Mackenzie
's
gown
,
which
she
had
to
send
away
to
be
repaired
.
</p>
<p>
JANUARY
18TH
.
Father
still
away
.
The
Hon.
sent
Sis
a
huge
bunch
of
orchids
today
.
She
refused
me
even
one
.
She
is
always
tight
with
flowers
and
candy
.
</p>
<p>
JANUARY
19TH
.
The
paper
says
that
Adrian
's
play
is
going
to
close
the
end
of
next
week
.
No
business
.
How
can
I
endure
to
know
that
he
is
suffering
,
and
that
I
cannot
help
,
even
to
the
extent
of
buying
one
ticket
?
Matinee
today
,
and
no
money
.
Father
still
away
.
</p>
<p>
I
have
tried
to
do
a
kind
deed
today
,
feeling
that
perhaps
it
would
soften
mother
's
heart
and
she
would
advance
my
allowance
.
I
offered
to
manicure
her
nails
for
her
,
but
she
refused
,
saying
that
as
Hannah
had
done
it
for
many
years
,
she
guessed
she
could
manage
now
.
</p>
<p>
JANUARY
20TH
.
Today
I
did
a
desperate
thing
,
dear
Diary
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
The
desperate
is
the
wisest
course
.
&quot;
Butler

</p>
<p>
It
is
Sunday
.
I
went
to
church
,
and
thought
things
over
.
What
a
wonderful
thing
it
would
be
if
I
could
save
the
play
!
Why
should
I
feel
that
my
sex
is
a
handicap
?
</p>
<p>
The
rector
preached
on
&quot;
The
Opportunities
of
Women
.
&quot;
The
Sermon
gave
me
courage
to
go
on
.
When
he
said
,
&quot;
Women
today
step
in
where
men
are
afraid
to
tread
,
and
bring
success
out
of
failure
,
&quot;
I
felt
that
it
was
meant
for
me
.
</p>
<p>
Had
no
money
for
the
plate
,
and
mother
attempted
to
smuggle
a
half
dollar
to
me
.
I
refused
,
however
,
as
if
I
cannot
give
my
own
money
to
the
heathen
,
I
will
give
none
.
Mother
turned
pale
,
and
the
man
with
the
plate
gave
me
a
black
look
.
What
can
he
know
of
my
reasons
?
</p>
<p>
Beresford
lunched
with
us
,
and
as
I
discouraged
him
entirely
,
he
was
very
attentive
to
Sis
.
Mother
is
planing
a
big
wedding
,
and
I
found
Sis
in
the
store
room
yesterday
looking
up
mother
's
wedding
veil
.
</p>
<p>
No
old
stuff
for
me
.
</p>
<p>
I
guess
Beresford
is
trying
to
forget
that
he
kissed
my
hand
the
other
night
,
for
he
called
me
&quot;
Little
Miss
Barbara
&quot;
today
,
meaning
little
in
the
sense
of
young
.
I
gave
him
a
stern
glance
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
am
not
any
littler
than
the
other
night
,
&quot;
I
observed
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
That
was
merely
an
affectionate
diminutive
,
&quot;
he
said
,
looking
uncomfortable
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
If
you
do
n't
mind
,
&quot;
I
said
coldly
,
&quot;
you
might
do
as
you
have
heretofore
--
reserve
your
affectionate
advances
until
we
are
alone
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Barbara
!
&quot;
mother
said
.
And
began
quickly
to
talk
about
a
Lady
Something
or
other
we
'd
met
on
a
train
in
Switzerland
.
Because
--
they
can
talk
until
they
are
black
in
the
face
,
dear
Diary
,
but
it
is
true
we
do
not
know
any
of
the
British
Nobility
,
except
the
aforementioned
and
the
man
who
comes
once
a
year
with
flavoring
extracts
,
who
says
he
is
the
third
son
of
a
baronet
.
</p>
<p>
Every
one
being
out
this
afternoon
,
I
suddenly
had
an
inspiration
,
and
sent
for
Carter
Brooks
.
I
then
put
my
hair
up
and
put
on
my
blue
silk
,
because
while
I
do
not
believe
in
woman
using
her
feminine
charm
when
talking
business
,
I
do
believe
that
she
should
look
her
best
under
any
and
all
circumstances
.
</p>
<p>
He
was
rather
surprised
not
to
find
Sis
in
,
as
I
had
used
her
name
in
telephoning
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
did
it
,
&quot;
I
explained
,
&quot;
because
I
knew
that
you
felt
no
interest
in
me
,
and
I
had
to
see
you
.
&quot;
