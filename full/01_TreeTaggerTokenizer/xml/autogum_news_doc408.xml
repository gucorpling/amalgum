<p>
According
to
the
Associated
Press
,
several
factors
played
a
part
in
Sochi
's
win
.
One
factor
was
that
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President%20of%20Russia">
Russian
president
</ref>
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir%20Putin">
Vladimir
Putin
</ref>
himself
.
Putin
,
an
avid
skier
and
a
black
belt
in
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Judo">
judo
</ref>
,
traveled
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemala">
Guatemala
</ref>
to
lobby
IOC
members
and
headed
up
the
final
presentation
of
Sochi
's
bid
to
the
assembly
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Putin
being
here
was
very
important
,
he
worked
very
hard
at
it
.
He
was
nice
.
He
spoke
French
--
he
never
speaks
French
.
He
spoke
English
--
he
never
speaks
English
,
&quot;
said
French
IOC
member
and
former
ski
champion
Jean-Claude
Killy
.
</p>
<p>
Patrick
Hickey
,
an
Irish
member
of
the
IOC
agreed
.
&quot;
There
's
no
doubt
that
President
Putin
's
presence
was
a
massive
influence
,
his
performance
was
superb
.
He
was
humble
.
He
spoke
in
English
and
French
.
The
second
most
powerful
man
in
the
world
said
everything
will
be
delivered
.

</p>
<p>
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan%20Antonio%20Samaranch">
Juan
Antonio
Samaranch
</ref>
,
former
IOC
president
and
Spanish
ambassador
to
Russia
made
a
big
push
for
Sochi
,
which
may
have
swung
some
key
votes
according
to
some
IOC
members
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
This
is
,
without
doubt
,
not
just
a
recognition
of
Russia
's
sporting
achievements
but
it
is
,
beyond
any
doubt
,
a
judgment
on
our
country
,
it
is
a
recognition
of
our
growing
capability
,
first
of
all
economically
and
socially
,
&quot;
Putin
stated
upon
his
return
to
Russia
.
</p>
<p>
Another
factor
is
Russia
's
brand
new
wealth
from
exports
of
Russian
natural
gas
and
oil
,
which
provided
over
$
12
billion
for
Putin
to
invest
in
the
Games
and
the
infrastructure
around
Sochi
.
</p>
<p>
Russia
last
hosted
the
games

,
when

country
was

as

<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet%20Union">

.
The
games
were
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American-led%20boycott%20of%20the%201980%20Summer%20Olympics">

.
</p>
<p>
The
United
States
continues
to
spar
with
Russia
over
human
rights
abuses
and
the
subjugation
of
democratic
freedoms
.
</p>
<p>
U.S.
State
Department
spokesman
Sean
McCormack
spoke
in
Washington
to
reporters
stating
,
&quot;
Well
,
it
's
a
proud
moment
for
Russia
and
I
am
sure
it
's
a
proud
moment
for
him
so
he
can
characterize
it
as
he
sees
fit
,
I
'm
not
sure
that
the
selection
of
Russia
to
host
the
Winter
Olympics
really
,
at
this
point
,
changes
our
view
or
others
'
views
--
or
concerns
--
about
the
direction
of
democracy
and
related
issues
:
human
rights
,
respect
for
freedom
of
speech
,
freedom
of
assembly
and
to
be
able
to
peaceably
organize
opposition
democratic
parties
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile
,
Sochi
has
announced
that
progress
of
construction
on
venues
in
Sochi
will
be
offered
online
.
Dmitri
Chernyshenko
,
Sochi
2014
's
bid
leader
said
,
&quot;
The
IOC
will
be
online
every
single
moment
in
terms
of
construction
,
there
will
be
live
video
from
all
construction
sites
.
