<p>
He
has

send

[
The

will
be
setting
a
dangerous
precedent
if

allowed

&quot;
he
said
.
&quot;
Right
now
Mugabe
is
a
crisis
,
they
have
no

with
legitimacy

run
the

<p>
Robert
Mugabe
was
recently
under
a
large
amount
of
pressure
to
postpone
the
election
after
the
main
opposition
candidate
,
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Morgan_Tsvangirai">
Morgan
Tsvangirai
</ref>
,
pulled
out
due
to
fears
of
violence
.
For
example
,
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Ban_Ki-moon">
Ban
Ki-moon
</ref>
,
secretary
general
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_Nations">
United
Nations
</ref>
,
yesterday
called
for
the
election
to
be
postponed
.
He
said
that
he
&quot;
strongly
supports
the
statement
of
the
Chairman
of
SADC
(
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern%20African%20Development%20Community">
Southern
African
Development
Community
</ref>
)
that
conditions
do
not
exist
for
a
run-off
election
to
be
held
at
this
time
and
that
they
should
be
postponed
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Mugabe
yesterday
claimed
the
current
results
show
that
he
will
have
a
'
sweeping
victory
'
in
the
unopposed
presidential
run-off
elections
.
He
announced
his
victory
on
one
of
the
state
run
television
networks
.
&quot;
The
returns
show
that
we
are
winning
convincingly
,
that
we
have
won
in
all
the
26
constituencies
in
Harare
,
an
MDC
stronghold
where
we
won
in
only
one
constituency
in
March
.

</p>
<p>
As
an
African
Union
summit
began
in
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Egypt">
Egypt
</ref>
today
,
Mugabe
took
his
seat
among
other
African
heads
of
state
hours
after
declaring
victory
in
the
election
.
His
appearance
at
the
summit
generated
different
reactions
,
from
being
hailed
as
a
&quot;
hero
&quot;
by
the
President
of
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Gabon">
Gabon

</p>
<p>
Mugabe
,
now
in
his
sixth
term
as
President
,
arrived
in
the
Egyptian
city
of
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Sharm_el-Sheikh">
Sharm
el-Sheikh
</ref>
on
Monday
.
Despite
criticism
from
the
African
Union
's
election
observers
,
who
said
the
election
fell
short
of
their
standards
,
Mugabe
was
reportedly
warmly
received
at
the
summit
.
One
delegate
,
speaking
on
condition
of
anonymity
,
said
Mugabe
was
seen
hugging
other
African
leaders
after
the
opening
session
.
</p>
<p>
Delegates
at
the
convention
discussed
the
elections
,
but
largely
avoided
direct
criticism
of
Mugabe
or
the
government
.

,
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Tanzania">

President
chairing
the
summit
,
said
,
&quot;
We
would
like
to
congratulate
the
Zimbabwean
people
for
their
successes
but
we
would
also
like
to
express
our
commiserations
for
their
suffering
.
&quot;
A
draft
resolution
being
considered
for
adoption
on
Tuesday
calls
for
negotiations
and
an
end
to
violence
,
but
also
does
not
directly
criticize
Mugabe
or
the
election
.

,
said
he
hopes
that
the
summit
would
take
stronger
measures
during
Tuesday
sessions
.
&quot;
I
would
hope
that
the
nature
of
what
happened
in
Zimbabwe
warrants
a
strong
response
and
a
lot
of
the
leaders
are
taking
our
problems
into
consideration

said
