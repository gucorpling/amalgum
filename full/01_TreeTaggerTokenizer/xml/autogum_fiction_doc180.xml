<p>
In
America
we
have
been
bringing
up
our
women
like
men
,
and
treating
them
like
children
.
They
have
active
minds
with
nothing
to
act
upon
.
Thus
they
are
driven
to
think
chiefly
about
themselves
.
With
Jane
Hastings
,
self-centering
took
the
form
of
self-analysis
most
of
the
time
.
She
was
intensely
interested
in
what
she
regarded
as
the
new
development
of
her
character
.
This
definite
and
apparently
final
decision
for
the
narrow
and
the
ungenerous
.
In
fact
,
it
was
no
new
development
,
but
simply
a
revelation
to
herself
of
her
own
real
character
.
She
was
seeing
at
last
the
genuine
Jane
Hastings
,
inevitable
product
of
a
certain
heredity
in
a
certain
environment
.
The
high
thinking
and
talking
,
the
idealistic
aspiration
were
pose
and
pretense
.
Jane
Hastings
was
a
selfish
,
self-absorbed
person
,
ready
to
do
almost
any
base
thing
to
gain
her
ends
,
ready
to
hate
to
the
uttermost
any
one
who
stood
between
her
and
her
object
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
'm
certainly
not
a
lovely
person
--
not
a
lovable
person
,
&quot;
thought
she
,
with
that
gentle
tolerance
wherewith
we
regard
our
ownselves
,
whether
in
the
dress
of
pretense
or
in
the
undress
of
deformed
humanness
.
&quot;
Still
--
I
am
what
I
am
,
and
I
've
got
to
make
the
best
of
it
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
As
she
thought
of
Selma
's
declaration
of
war
she
became
less
and
less
disturbed
about
it
.
Selma
neither
would
nor
could
do
anything
sly
.
Whatever
she
attempted
in
the
open
would
only
turn
Victor
Dorn
more
strongly
toward
herself
.
However
,
she
must
continue
to
try
to
see
him
,
must
go
to
see
him
in
a
few
days
if
she
did
not
happen
upon
him
in
her
rides
or
walks
.
How
poorly
he
would
think
of
her
if
he
knew
the
truth
about
her
!
But
then
,
how
poor
most
women
--
and
men
,
too
--
would
look
in
a
strong
and
just
light
.
Few
indeed
could
stand
idealizing
;
except
Victor
,
no
one
she
knew
.
And
he
was
human
enough
not
to
make
her
uncomfortable
in
his
presence
.
</p>
<p>
But
it
so
happened
that
before
she
could
see
Victor
Dorn
her
father
disobeyed
Dr.
Charlton
and
gave
way
to
the
appetite
that
was
the
chief
cause
of
his
physical
woes
.
He
felt
so
well
that
he
ate
the
family
dinner
,
including
a
peach
cobbler
with
whipped
cream
,
which
even
the
robust
Jane
adventured
warily
.
Martha
was
dining
with
them
.
She
abetted
her
father
.
&quot;
It
's
light
,
&quot;
said
she
.
&quot;
It
could
n't
harm
anybody
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
You
must
n't
touch
it
,
popsy
,
&quot;
said
Jane
.
</p>
<p>
She
unthinkingly
spoke
a
little
too
commandingly
.
Her
father
,
in
a
perverse
and
reckless
mood
,
took
Martha
's
advice
.
An
hour
later
Dr.
Charlton
was
summoned
,
and
had
he
not
arrived
promptly
--
--
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Another
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
,
&quot;
said
he
to
the
old
man
when
he
had
him
out
of
immediate
danger
,
&quot;
and
I
'd
have
had
nothing
to
do
but
sign
a
certificate
of
natural
death
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Murder
would
have
been
nearer
the
truth
,
&quot;
said
Martin
feebly
.
&quot;
That
there
fool
Martha
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Come
out
from
behind
that
petticoat
!
&quot;
cried
Charlton
.
&quot;
Did
n't
I
spend
the
best
part
of
three
days
in
giving
you
the
correct
ideas
as
to
health
and
disease
--
in
showing
you
that
ALL
disease
comes
from
indigestion
--
ALL
disease
,
from
falling
hair
and
sore
eyes
to
weak
ankles
and
corns
?
And
did
n't
I
convince
you
that
you
could
eat
only
the
things
I
told
you
about
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Do
n't
hit
a
man
when
he
's
down
,
&quot;
groaned
Hastings
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
If
I
do
n't
,
you
'll
do
the
same
idiotic
trick
again
when
I
get
you
up
--
if
I
get
you
up
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Hastings
looked
quickly
at
him
.
This
was
the
first
time
Charlton
had
ever
expressed
a
doubt
about
his
living
.
&quot;
Do
you
mean
that
?
&quot;
he
said
hoarsely
.
&quot;
Or
are
you
just
trying
to
scare
me
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Both
,
&quot;
said
Charlton
.
&quot;
I
'll
do
my
best
,
but
I
ca
n't
promise
.
I
've
lost
confidence
in
you
.
No
wonder
doctors
,
after
they
've
been
in
practice
a
few
years
,
stop
talking
food
and
digestion
to
their
patients
.
I
've
never
been
able
to
convince
a
single
human
being
that
appetite
is
not
the
sign
of
health
,
and
yielding
to
it
the
way
to
health
.
But
I
've
made
lots
of
people
angry
and
have
lost
their
trade
.
I
had
hopes
of
you
.
You
were
such
a
hopeless
wreck
.
But
no
.
And
you
call
yourself
an
intelligent
man
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
'll
never
do
it
again
,
&quot;
said
Hastings
,
pleading
,
but
smiling
,
too
--
Charlton
's
way
of
talking
delighted
him
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
You
think
this
is
a
joke
,
&quot;
said
Charlton
,
shaking
his
bullet
head
.
&quot;
Have
you
any
affairs
to
settle
?
If
you
have
,
send
for
your
lawyer
in
the
morning
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Fear
--
the
Great
Fear
--
suddenly
laid
its
icy
long
fingers
upon
the
throat
of
the
old
man
.
He
gasped
and
his
eyes
rolled
.
&quot;
Do
n't
trifle
with
me
,
Charlton
,
&quot;
he
muttered
.
&quot;
You
know
you
will
pull
me
through
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
'll
do
my
best
,
&quot;
said
Charlton
.
&quot;
I
promise
nothing
.
I
'm
serious
about
the
lawyer
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
do
n't
want
no
lawyer
hanging
round
my
bed
,
&quot;
growled
the
old
man
.
&quot;
It
'd
kill
me
.
I
've
got
nothing
to
settle
.
I
do
n't
run
things
with
loose
ends
.
And
there
's
Jinny
and
Marthy
and
the
boy
--
share
and
share
alike
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Well
--
you
're
in
no
immediate
danger
.
I
'll
come
early
to-morrow
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Wait
till
I
get
to
sleep
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
You
'll
be
asleep
as
soon
as
the
light
's
down
.
But
I
'll
stop
a
few
minutes
and
talk
to
your
daughter
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Charlton
found
Jane
at
the
window
in
the
dressing
room
next
her
father
's
bedroom
.
He
said
loudly
enough
for
the
old
man
to
overhear
:
