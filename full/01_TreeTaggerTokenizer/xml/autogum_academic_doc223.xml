Fault
Signals
for
Detection
</head>
<p>
This
section
discuss
the
signals
used
for
fault
detection
for
the
methods
proposed
.
Signals
are
generated
such
that
the
fault
detection
is
more
clear
.

Commanded
Voltages
Method
</head>
<p>
The
difference
in
the
voltages
between
healthy
and
faulty
cases
is
directly
proportional
to
the
difference
in
the
flux
linkages
of
healthy
and
faulty
case
.
The
difference
between
the
flux
linkages
is
significant
in
certain
range
of
the
current
.
The
difference
is
maximum
at
the
point
shown
in
<figure>
Figure
4
</figure>
.
Therefore
,
for
fault
detection
the
machine
should
be
operated
as
close
as
possible
to
point
of
maximum
separation
.

Calculation
of
Incremental
Inductance
</head>
<p>
Incremental
inductance
is
generated
by
using
DC
current
injection
in
the
d-axis
with
constant
rotation
.
The
current
is
injected
with
increasing
current
levels
and
the
q-axis
voltage
(
)
is
recorded
at
each
level
.
The
value
of
d-axis
flux
(
)
is
calculated
from
the
q-axis
voltage
(
)
.
Finally
,
incremental
inductance
is
calculated
by
taking
the
derivative
of
vs.
curve
given
by
(

)
</p>
<p>
The
difference
in
the
two
current
levels
is
.
Therefore
,
the
above
relation
reduces
to
(
30
)
where
is
the
difference
in
the
flux
linkages
at
two
different
levels
of
current
.
and
are
shown
in
<figure>
Figure
5
</figure>
.
</p>
<p>
The
difference
in
current
levels
is
chosen
such
that
there
is
a
measurable
difference
in
the
q-axis
voltages
between
two
levels
.
The
minimum
difference
in
current
levels
is
chosen
once
measurable
difference
in
the
voltages
is
recorded
,
because
increased
difference
in
current
levels
decreases
peak
prominence
.

Harmonics
in
Voltage
and
Current
Signals
</head>
<p>
The
first
15
harmonics
present
in
IAP
(
Instantaneous
Active
Power
)
are
used
for
analysis
for
fault
detection
which
was
extracted
using
FFT
(
Fast
Fourier
Transform
)
.
The
harmonic
that
shows
the
maximum
separation
between
the
healthy
and
faulty
cases
is
used
for
analysis
.
The
machine
is
operated
at
the
same
operating
conditions
as
it
is
operated
for
commanded
voltages
method
.

Vibration
Signals
for
Analysis
</head>
<p>
The
oscillating
forces
were
calculated
by
using
FEA
model
.
First
the
magnitude
of
magnetic
field
density
was
calculated
around
the
rotor
.
After
that
for
an
angle
,
as
shown
in
<figure>
Figure
6
</figure>
,
radial
stress
was
estimated
using
Equation
(
31
)
.
(
31
)
</p>
<p>
Then
,
the
stress
is
calculated
by
taking
projections
in
y
and
x-axis
as
follows
(
32
)
(
33
)
</p>
<p>
Net
force
at
a
given
time
can
be
calculated
by
integrating
the
forces
over
the
periphery
of
the
rotor
.
(
34
)
(
35
)
</p>
<p>
Therefore
,
forces
are
estimated
using
flux
density
at
different
times
.
Once
,
forces
are
estimated
,
FFT
is
performed
and
results
are
analyzed
.
</p>
<p>
To
analyze
the
vibration
signals
the
accelerometers
were
placed
on
both
stator
core
and
rotor
bearing
in
the
direction
of
static
eccentricity
(
y-axis
)
and
90
Â°apart
from
the
direction
of
static
eccentricity
(
x-axis
)
.
The
arrangement
of
accelerometers
on
the
rotor
bearing
and
stator
core
is
shown
in
