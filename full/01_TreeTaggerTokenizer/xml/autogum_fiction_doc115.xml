The
Wedding
Gown

<p>
&quot;
The
gay
belles
of
fashion
may
boast
of
excelling
In
waltz
or
cotillon
,
at
whist
or
quadrille
;
And
seek
admiration
by
vauntingly
telling
Of
drawing
and
painting
,
and
musical
skill
;
But
give
me
the
fair
one
,
in
country
or
city
,
Whose
home
and
its
duties
are
dear
to
her
heart
,
Who
cheerfully
warbles
some
rustical
ditty
,
While
plying
the
needle
with
exquisite
art
:
The
bright
little
needle
,
the
swift-flying
needle
,
The
needle
directed
by
beauty
and
art
.

<p>
The
next
morning
Miss
Amelia
finished
the
chapter
--
that
made
two
for
our
family
.
Father
always
read
one
before
breakfast
--
no
wonder
I
knew
the
Bible
quite
well
--
then
we
sang
a
song
,
and
she
made
a
stiff
,
little
prayer
.
I
had
my
doubts
about
her
prayers
;
she
was
on
no
such
terms
with
the
Lord
as
my
father
.
He
got
right
at
Him
and
talked
like
a
doctor
,
and
you
felt
he
had
some
influence
,
and
there
was
at
least
a
possibility
that
he
might
get
what
he
asked
for
;
but
Miss
Amelia
prayed
as
if
the
Lord
were
ten
million
miles
away
,
and
she
would
be
surprised
to
pieces
if
she
got
anything
she
wanted
.
When
she
asked
the
Almighty
to
make
us
good
,
obedient
children
,
there
was
not
a
word
she
said
that
showed
she
trusted
either
the
Lord
or
us
,
or
thought
there
was
anything
between
us
and
heaven
that
might
make
us
good
because
we
wanted
to
be
.
You
could
n't
keep
your
eyes
from
the
big
gad
and
ruler
on
her
desk
;
she
often
fingered
them
as
she
prayed
,
and
you
knew
from
her
stiff
,
little
,
sawed-out
petition
that
her
faith
was
in
implements
,
and
she
'd
hit
you
a
crack
the
minute
she
was
the
least
angry
,
same
as
she
had
me
the
day
before
.
I
did
n't
feel
any
too
good
toward
her
,
but
when
the
blood
of
the
Crusaders
was
in
the
veins
,
right
must
be
done
even
if
it
took
a
struggle
.
I
had
to
live
up
to
those
little
gold
shells
on
the
trinket
.
Father
said
they
knew
I
was
coming
down
the
line
,
so
they
put
on
a
bird
for
me
;
but
I
told
him
I
would
be
worthy
of
the
shells
too
.
This
took
about
as
hard
a
fight
for
me
as
any
Crusade
would
for
a
big
,
trained
soldier
.
I
had
been
wrong
,
Laddie
had
made
me
see
that
.
So
I
held
up
my
hand
,
and
Miss
Amelia
saw
me
as
she
picked
up
Ray
's
arithmetic
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
What
is
it
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
I
held
to
the
desk
to
brace
myself
,
and
tried
twice
before
I
could
raise
my
voice
so
that
she
heard
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Please
,
Miss
Amelia
,
&quot;
I
said
,
&quot;
I
was
wrong
about
the
birds
yesterday
.
Not
that
they
do
n't
fight
--
they
do
!
But
I
was
wrong
to
contradict
you
before
every
one
,
and
on
your
first
day
,
and
if
you
'll
only
excuse
me
,
the
next
time
you
make
a
mistake
,
I
'll
tell
you
after
school
or
at
recess
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
room
was
so
still
you
could
hear
the
others
breathing
.
Miss
Amelia
picked
up
the
ruler
and
started
toward
me
.
Possibly
I
raised
my
hands
.
That
would
be
no
Crusader
way
,
but
you
might
do
it
before
you
had
time
to
think
,
when
the
ruler
was
big
and
your
head
was
the
only
place
that
would
be
hit
.
The
last
glimpse
I
had
of
her
in
the
midst
of
all
my
trouble
made
me
think
of
Sabethany
Perkins
.
</p>
<p>
Sabethany
died
,
and
they
buried
her
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
in
our
graveyard
before
I
could
remember
.
But
her
people
thought
heaps
of
her
,
and
spent
much
money
on
the
biggest
tombstone
in
the
cemetery
,
and
planted
pinies
and
purple
phlox
on
her
,
and
went
every
Sunday
to
visit
her
.
When
they
moved
away
,
they
missed
her
so
,
they
decided
to
come
back
and
take
her
along
.
The
men
were
at
work
,
and
Leon
and
I
went
to
see
what
was
going
on
.
They
told
us
,
and
said
we
had
better
go
away
,
because
possibly
things
might
happen
that
children
would
sleep
better
not
to
see
.
Strange
how
a
thing
like
that
makes
you
bound
you
will
see
.
We
went
and
sat
on
the
fence
and
waited
.
Soon
they
reached
Sabethany
,
but
they
could
not
seem
to
get
her
out
.
They
tried
,
and
tried
,
and
at
last
they
sent
for
more
men
.
It
took
nine
of
them
to
bring
her
to
the
surface
.
What
little
wood
was
left
,
they
laid
back
to
see
what
made
her
so
fearfully
heavy
,
and
there
she
was
turned
to
solid
stone
.
They
could
n't
chip
a
piece
off
her
with
the
shovel
.
Mother
always
said
,
&quot;
For
goodness
sake
,
do
n't
let
your
mouth
hang
open
,
&quot;
and
as
a
rule
we
kept
ours
shut
;
but
you
should
have
seen
Leon
's
when
he
saw
Sabethany
would
n't
chip
off
,
and
no
doubt
mine
was
as
bad
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
When
Gabriel
blows
his
trumpet
,
and
the
dead
arise
and
come
forth
,
what
on
earth
will
they
do
with
Sabethany
?
&quot;
I
gasped
.
&quot;
Why
,
she
could
n't
fly
to
Heaven
with
wings
a
mile
wide
,
and
what
use
could
they
make
of
her
if
she
got
there
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
ca
n't
see
a
thing
she
'd
be
good
for
except
a
hitching
post
,
&quot;
said
Leon
,
&quot;
and
I
guess
they
do
n't
let
horses
in
.
Let
's
go
home
.
&quot;
