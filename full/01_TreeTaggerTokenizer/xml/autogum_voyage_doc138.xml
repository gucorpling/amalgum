<p>
The
community
that
is
now
Lincoln
Park
has
existed
since
colonial
times
.
This
small
community
further
grew
with
the
construction
of
the
Delaware
,
Lackawanna
,
and
Western
Railroad
's
Boonton
Branch
(
present-day
Montclair-Boonton
Line
)
.
It
was
formerly
part
of
neighboring
Pequannock
.
The
borough
was
founded
as
a
township
under
the
name
<hi rend="bold">
Beavertown
</hi>
on
March
11
,
1922
.
The
town
was
reincorporated
as
the
borough
of
Lincoln
Park
in
February
26
,
1925
.
It
was
named
after
President
Abraham
Lincoln
.

Lincoln

can
also
be
easily
accessed
from
Interstates
80
and
287
,
as
well
as
U.S.
Route
46
and
New
Jersey
Route
23
using
these
roads
.

<head>
By

</head>
<p>
NJ

provides
service
from
Mondays
to
Saturdays
on
the
<hi rend="bold">

Buses
in

four

One
can
transfer
to
an
express

bound
for
<ref target="Manhattan/Theater%20District">

at

.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Lakeland
Buses
</hi>
also
provides
occasional
service
on
weekdays
,
with
buses
heading
directly
to
<ref target="New%20York%20City">
New

</ref>
in
early
mornings
,
and
buses
on
the
return
trip
arriving
in
the
late
evening
.
</p>
<head>
By
train
</head>
<p>
The
<hi rend="bold">
Montclair-Boonton
Line
</hi>
has
a
station
in
the
borough
.
This
is
not
the
best
way
,
however
,
as
trains
are
limited
to
weekday
rush
hour
service
,
and
a
transfer
is
required
further
down
the
line
in
order
to
reach
New
York
Penn
Station
.
This
will
not
be
a
problem
however
if
you
are
arriving
from
Hoboken
.
Additionally
,
the
station
is
not
wheelchair
accessible
due
to
its
odd
layout
.
<hi rend="bold">
Mountain
View
</hi>
station
,
although
it
has
equally
lousy
service
,
is
also
close
to
Lincoln
Park
(
and
ADA-compliant
,
too
!
)
.
However
,
it
is
relatively
far
from
the
center
of
the
borough
.

Get
around
</head>
<p>
Driving
by
car
is
the
only
quick
way
to
get
around
.
Walking
around
the
center
of
the
borough
is
easy
,
as
it
is
relatively
small
in
size
.
Walking
up
certain
roads
can
be
quite
a
workout
however
,
as
they
cross
over
<hi rend="bold">
Hook
Mountain
</hi>
,
which
is
part
of
the
Watchung
Mountain
group
.
There
are
multiple
bus
stops
around
,
but
bus
service
is
<hi rend="bold">
rare
</hi>
,
making
it
an
impractical
way
to
get
around
.

Walk
along
the
old
Morris
Canal
.
</hi>
The
historic
Morris
Canal
formerly
ran
through
the
borough
,
and
its
remnants
are
still
scattered
along
its
former
path
.
The
proper
way
to
walk
along
the
Morris
Canal
in
Lincoln
Park
is
to
take
the
bus
to
or
park
your
car
near
the
bridge
over
the
Pompton
River
.
Then
,
walk
along
U.S.
Route
202
until
you
reach
the
Main
Street
intersection
.
Cross
Main
Street
then
proceed
to
walk
along
Beaverbrook
Road
.
Turn
left
when
you
reach
the
entrance
to
the
condos
and
you
will
notice
a
large
board
demarcating
the
canal
's
path
.
Cross
the
road
with
care
,
and
walk
the
remainder
of
the
right-of-way
via
a
portion
of
the
Morris
Canal
Greenway
.
This
will
take
you
to
