<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikileaks">
Wikileaks
</ref>
has
obtained
and
released
a
list
of
all
3,863
websites
that
are
being
censored
by
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Denmark">
Danish
</ref>
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet%20Service%20Provider">

as
of
February
2008
.
The
system
is
used
to
filter
out
child
pornography
,
although
Wikileaks
points
out
it
&quot;
can
be
used
to
censor
anything
&quot;
and
claims
&quot;
most
sites
on
the
list
are
still
censored
(
i.
e
must
be
on
the
current
list
)
,
even
though
many
have
clearly
changed
owners
or
were
possibly
even
wrongly
placed
on
the
list
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">
Wikinews
</hi>
was
able
to
contact
Wikileaks
.
We
discussed
the
unusual
leak
with
them
,
and
the
results
are
published
here
.
</p>
<p>
We
asked
if
Wikileaks
was
worried
about
the
criminal
implications
of
linking
to
so
much
illegal
content
,
but
they
were
not
.
They
said
that
it
was
&quot;
politically
untenable
&quot;
to
prosecute
them
,
pointing
out
that
Wikileaks
is
hosted
in
many
different
countries
across
the
globe
.
</p>
<p>
We
asked
them
if
they
were
&quot;
concerned
about
the
possibility
of
censorship
in
the
UK
,
Denmark
,
Finland
etc.
?
&quot;
&quot;
No
,
&quot;
Wikileaks
told
us
&quot;
We
welcome
it
.
&quot;
<hi rend="italic">
Wikinews
</hi>
wondered
if
this
was
because
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand%20effect">
Streisand
effect
</ref>
,
but
Wikileaks
said
it
was
&quot;
because
it
will
demonstrate
how
censorship
systems
are
abused
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">
Wikinews
</hi>
asked
Wikileaks
why
they
did
n't
simply
post
a
list
of
the
sites
which
they
felt
were
legal
and
add
that
all
the
others
contained
child
porn
,
but
Wikileaks
felt
&quot;
that
would
not
be
a
fair
representation
of
the
material
we
obtained
.
&quot;
After
seeking
clarification
,
<hi rend="italic">
Wikinews
</hi>
was
told
&quot;
the
question
is
not
what
we
need
to
be
told
.
The
question
is
what
we
need
not
to
be
told
and
who
decides
.
Secret
censorship
systems
are
unaccountable
and
dangerous
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">
Wikinews
</hi>
then
asked
why
they
did
n't
leave
the
full
list
available
,
but
mark
which
sites
they
felt
should
not
be
censored
.
&quot;
We
have
better
things
to
do
,
&quot;
was
the
response
given
.
So
how
would
Wikileaks
suggest
dealing
with
child
porn
?
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Block
financial
transactions
after
due
process
.
It
's
easy
to
set
up
servers
.
It
is
not
so
easy
to
set
up
merchant
accounts
.
&quot;
And
what
would
due
process
be
?
&quot;
Due
process
would
involve
sending
a
letter
to
the
owner
of
the
merchant
account
with
the
accusation
and
giving
them
a
right
to
be
heard
and
an
appeal
process
.
The
banks
are
politically
a
lot
more
powerful
than
the
internet
industry
so
this
has
n't
happened
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
And
should
funds
in
these
accounts
be
seized
straight
away
,
or
simply
frozen
until
a
judge
or
similar
clears
their
release
?
&quot;
If
the
accounts
are
in-jurisdiction
,
they
should
be
frozen
and
released
or
not
at
the
end
of
the
process
.
There
are
plenty
of
existing
mechanisms
to
do
this
for
drug
trafficking
,
for
example
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Wikileaks
then
added
&quot;
As
an
analogy
,
one
might
argue
that
everyone
should
have
a
loaded
gun
in
the
house
to
protect
themselves
against
home
invasions
.
This
seems
perfectly
reasonable
;
however
experience
has
shown
that
once
the
gun
is
in
the
house
,
it
will
find
other
targets
.
