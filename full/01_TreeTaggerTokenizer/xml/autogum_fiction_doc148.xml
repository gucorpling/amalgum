THE
JAIL-BREAKERS
</head>
<p>
For
a
long
time
it
had
been
arranged
they
all
should
go
to
the
Harvard
and
Yale
game
in
Winthrop
's
car
.
It
was
perfectly
well
understood
.
Even
Peabody
,
who
pictured
himself
and
Miss
Forbes
in
the
back
of
the
car
,
with
her
brother
and
Winthrop
in
front
,
condescended
to
approve
.
It
was
necessary
to
invite
Peabody
because
it
was
his
great
good
fortune
to
be
engaged
to
Miss
Forbes
.
Her
brother
Sam
had
been
invited
,
not
only
because
he
could
act
as
chaperon
for
his
sister
,
but
because
since
they
were
at
St.
Paul
's
,
Winthrop
and
he
,
either
as
participants
or
spectators
,
had
never
missed
going
together
to
the
Yale-Harvard
game
.
And
Beatrice
Forbes
herself
had
been
invited
because
she
was
herself
.
</p>
<p>
When
at
nine
o'clock
on
the
morning
of
the
game
,
Winthrop
stopped
the
car
in
front
of
her
door
,
he
was
in
love
with
all
the
world
.
In
the
November
air
there
was
a
sting
like
frost-bitten
cider
,
in
the
sky
there
was
a
brilliant
,
beautiful
sun
,
in
the
wind
was
the
tingling
touch
of
three
ice-chilled
rivers
.
And
in
the
big
house
facing
Central
Park
,
outside
of
which
his
prancing
steed
of
brass
and
scarlet
chugged
and
protested
and
trembled
with
impatience
,
was
the
most
wonderful
girl
in
all
the
world
.
It
was
true
she
was
engaged
to
be
married
,
and
not
to
him
.
But
she
was
not
yet
married
.
And
to-day
it
would
be
his
privilege
to
carry
her
through
the
State
of
New
York
and
the
State
of
Connecticut
,
and
he
would
snatch
glimpses
of
her
profile
rising
from
the
rough
fur
collar
,
of
her
wind-blown
hair
,
of
the
long
,
lovely
lashes
under
the
gray
veil
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
'
Shall
be
together
,
breathe
and
ride
,
so
,
one
day
more
am
I
deified
;
'
&quot;
whispered
the
young
man
in
the
Scarlet
Car
;
&quot;
'
who
knows
but
the
world
may
end
to-night
?
'
&quot;
</p>
<p>
As
he
waited
at
the
curb
,
other
great
touring-cars
,
of
every
speed
and
shape
,
in
the
mad
race
for
the
Boston
Post
Road
,
and
the
town
of
New
Haven
,
swept
up
Fifth
Avenue
.
Some
rolled
and
puffed
like
tugboats
in
a
heavy
seaway
,
others
glided
by
noiseless
and
proud
as
private
yachts
.
But
each
flew
the
colors
of
blue
or
crimson
.
</p>
<p>
Winthrop
's
car
,
because
her
brother
had
gone
to
one
college
,
and
he
had
played
right
end
for
the
other
,
was
draped
impartially
.
And
so
every
other
car
mocked
or
cheered
it
,
and
in
one
a
bare-headed
youth
stood
up
,
and
shouted
to
his
fellows
:
&quot;
Look
!
there
's
Billy
Winthrop
!
Three
times
three
for
old
Billy
Winthrop
!
&quot;
And
they
lashed
the
air
with
flags
,
and
sent
his
name
echoing
over
Central
Park
.
</p>
<p>
Winthrop
grinned
in
embarrassment
,
and
waved
his
hand
.
A
bicycle
cop
,
and
Fred
,
the
chauffeur
,
were
equally
impressed
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Was
they
the
Harvoids
,
sir
?
&quot;
asked
Fred
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
They
was
,
&quot;
said
Winthrop
.
</p>
<p>
Her
brother
Sam
came
down
the
steps
carrying
sweaters
and
steamer-rugs
.
But
he
wore
no
holiday
countenance
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
What
do
you
think
?
&quot;
he
demanded
indignantly
.
&quot;
Ernest
Peabody
's
inside
making
trouble
.
His
sister
has
a
Pullman
on
one
of
the
special
trains
,
and
he
wants
Beatrice
to
go
with
her
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
In
spite
of
his
furs
,
the
young
man
in
the
car
turned
quite
cold
.
&quot;
Not
with
us
?
&quot;
he
gasped
.
</p>
<p>
Miss
Forbes
appeared
at
the
house
door
,
followed
by
Ernest
Peabody
.
He
wore
an
expression
of
disturbed
dignity
;
she
one
of
distressed
amusement
.
That
she
also
wore
her
automobile
coat
caused
the
heart
of
Winthrop
to
leap
hopefully
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Winthrop
,
&quot;
said
Peabody
,
&quot;
I
am
in
rather
an
embarrassing
position
.
My
sister
,
Mrs.
Taylor
Holbrooke&quot;
--
he
spoke
the
name
as
though
he
were
announcing
it
at
the
door
of
a
drawing-room
--
&quot;desires
Miss
Forbes
to
go
with
her
.
She
feels
accidents
are
apt
to
occur
with
motor
cars
--
and
there
are
no
other
ladies
in
your
party
--
and
the
crowds
--
--
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Winthrop
carefully
avoided
looking
at
Miss
Forbes
.
&quot;
I
should
be
very
sorry
,
&quot;
he
murmured
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Ernest
!
&quot;
said
Miss
Forbes
,
&quot;
I
explained
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
go
with
your
sister
.
We
would
be
extremely
rude
to
Mr.
Winthrop
.
How
do
you
wish
us
to
sit
?
&quot;
she
asked
.
</p>
<p>
She
mounted
to
the
rear
seat
,
and
made
room
opposite
her
for
Peabody
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Do
I
understand
,
Beatrice
,
&quot;
began
Peabody
in
a
tone
that
instantly
made
every
one
extremely
uncomfortable
,
&quot;
that
I
am
to
tell
my
sister
you
are
not
coming
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Ernest
!
&quot;
begged
Miss
Forbes
.
</p>
<p>
Winthrop
bent
hastily
over
the
oil
valves
.
He
read
the
speedometer
,
which
was
,
as
usual
,
out
of
order
,
with
fascinated
interest
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Ernest
,
&quot;
pleaded
Miss
Forbes
,
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Mr.
Winthrop
and
Sam
planned
this
trip
for
us
a
long
time
ago
--
to
give
us
a
little
pleasure
--
--
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Then
,
&quot;
said
Peabody
in
a
hollow
voice
,
&quot;
you
have
decided
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Ernest
,
&quot;
cried
Miss
Forbes
,
&quot;
do
n't
look
at
me
as
though
you
meant
to
hurl
the
curse
of
Rome
.
I
have
.
Jump
in
.
Please
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
will
bid
you
good-by
,
&quot;
said
Peabody
;
&quot;
I
have
only
just
time
to
catch
our
train
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Miss
Forbes
rose
and
moved
to
the
door
of
the
car
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
had
better
not
go
with
any
one
,
&quot;
she
said
in
a
low
voice
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
You
will
go
with
me
,
&quot;
commanded
her
brother
.
&quot;
Come
on
,
Ernest
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Thank
you
,
no
,
&quot;
replied
Peabody
.
&quot;
I
have
promised
my
sister
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
All
right
,
then
,
&quot;
exclaimed
Sam
briskly
,
&quot;
see
you
at
the
game
.
Section
H.
Do
n't
forget
.
Let
her
out
,
Billy
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
With
a
troubled
countenance
Winthrop
bent
forward
and
clasped
the
clutch
.
