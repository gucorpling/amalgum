Introduction

<p>
In
a
world
full
of
opportunities
and
challenges
,
it
is
imperative
for
different
countries
to
attach
supreme
importance
to
the
high
quality
of
development
.
To
gain
a
first-mover
advantage
in
the
new
round
of
international
economic
competition
,
the
majority
of
the
world
’s
players
have
embarked
on
strategies
for
future-oriented
development
.
The
number
of
countries
propelled
by
national
development
plans
has
more
than
doubled
,
from
about
62
in
2006
to
134
in
2018
,
making
over
80
%
of
the
global
population
subject
to
a
national
plan
of
one
form
or
another
.
</p>
<p>
Against
the
backdrop
of
intensifying
global
competition
and
novel
domestic
development
environment
,
China
has
become
a
leader
among
emerging
economies
in
the
process
of
actively
exploring
new
growth
paths
and
development
models
.
However
,
excessive
energy
consumption
,
environmental
deterioration
,
imbalance
of
economic
structure
,
and
a
widening
income
gap
have
become
increasingly
prominent
.
For
these
reasons
,
the
path
of
high-quality
development
has
become
the
optimal
way
to
handle
the
current
difficulties
and
achieve
a
leap
in
the
future
.
</p>
<p>
With
the
reflection
on
the
rapid
economic
development
in
the
past
40
years
of
reform
and
opening-up
,
China
’s
economic
development
has
shifted
its
focus
from
scale
and
speed
to
efficiency
and
quality
,
which
also
symbolizes
the
start
of
China
’s
high-quality
development
.
According
to
the
government
work
report
2018
of
China
’s
State
Council
,
a
new
statement
on
high-quality
development
has
been
made
.
Compared
to
the
traditional
development
model
,
the
high-quality
development
model
in
China
represents
high
efficiency
,
equitable
,
and
sustainable
development
,
which
is
aimed
at
meeting
the
growing
needs
of
the
people
for
a
better
life
.
Additionally
,
how
to
correctly
position
the
governments
’
role
in
the
high-quality
development
of
mainland
China
has
also
been
proposed
.
Following
the
state
’s
guidelines
,
academics
have
begun
to
conduct
extensive
studies
revolving
around
three
aspects
:
high-quality
development
connotations
,
high-quality
development
systems
,
and
high-quality
development
paths
.
Although
the
research
contents
differ
,
they
all
hold
that
innovation
has
become
the
first
driving
force
for
high-quality
development
.
</p>
<p>
The
basis
of
in-depth
study
on
these
three
aspects
is
to
make
an
objective
evaluation
of
high-quality
innovation
development
levels
of
different
regions
in
mainland
China
.
On
this
basis
,
exploring
the
government
role
in
high-quality
innovation
development
will
promote
China
’s
economic
advance
.
Therefore
,
this
paper
firstly
evaluates
the
high-quality
innovation
development
level
of
30
provinces
and
municipalities
in
mainland
China
;
secondly
,
on
the
basis
of
the
evaluation
results
,
it
introduces
role
theory
to
determine
the
role
of
different
governments
in
promoting
high-quality
innovation
development
of
the
provinces
and
municipalities
.
</p>
<p>
At
present
,
the
main
methods
used
in
evaluating
the
high-quality
development
are
AHP
(
analytic
hierarchy
process
)
,
the
multi-objective
linear
weighting
method
,
SFA
(
stochastic
frontier
analysis
)
,
and
the
entropy
value
method
.
These
research
methods
follow
nearly
the
same
research
idea
:
firstly
,
establishing
an
evaluation
system
in
advance
;
secondly
,
selecting
different
kinds
of
indicators
;
thirdly
,
determining
the
weights
of
them
through
the
analytic
hierarchy
process
,
multi-objective
linear
weighting
method
,
and
entropy
value
method
,
etc.
;
and
,
finally
,
conducting
a
comprehensive
assessment
of
the
high-quality
development
of
research
objects
.
However
,
the
above
research
methods
have
some
limitations
:
the
AHP
method
may
be
too
subjective
when
comparing
the
importance
of
various
indicators
;
the
entropy
weight
method
can
obtain
relatively
objective
results
,
but
it
has
higher
requirements
on
the
number
of
data
samples
;
and
multi-objective
linear
weighting
and
SFA
require
a
definite
function
to
show
the
relationship
between
high-quality
development
efficiency
and
influencing
factors
,
which
is
easily
affected
by
the
misspecification
and
,
thus
,
leads
to
inaccurate
results
.
</p>
<p>
Given
the
limitations
of
the
above
research
methods
,
we
introduce
the
super-efficiency
DEA
model
and
the
Tobit
regression
model
into
this
study
to
evaluate
the
high-quality
innovation
development
level
in
different
regions
of
mainland
China
.
As
to
the
advantages
of
super-efficiency
DEA
model
,
it
does
not
need
to
determine
the
index
construction
function
relation
in
advance
,
which
can
avoid
the
influence
of
subjective
factors
on
the
model
construction
and
can
distinguish
the
efficiency
value
of
effective
and
non-effective
decision-making
units
.
In
addition
,
it
can
compare
the
decision-making
units
with
a
higher
efficiency
value
that
reaches
1
.
In
addition
,
Tobit
regression
can
analyze
the
real
effect
of
exogenous
variables
.
Thus
,
the
research
method
not
only
has
high
credibility
and
applicability
but
also
conforms
to
the
research
design
of
this
paper
.
</p>
<p>
Based
on
the
correct
evaluation
of
high-quality
innovation
development
level
of
different
regions
in
mainland
China
,
how
to
specify
the
role
of
governments
is
the
next
core
issue
;
particularly
,
the
role
of
provincial
governments
remains
controversial
.
Therefore
,
this
paper
will
attempt
to
identify
the
role
of
government
from
the
perspective
of
role
theory
.
