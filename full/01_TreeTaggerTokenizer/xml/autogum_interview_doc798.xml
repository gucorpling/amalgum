Does
the
idea
that
our
lives
on
Earth
may
be
all
that
there
is
unsettle
you
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
AD
:
</hi>
Yes
,
sure
.
I
think
there
’s
more
.
I
’m
always
seeking
things
of
beauty
,
and
my
art
reflects
the
search
for
that
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
You
had
said
in
an
interview
that
your
family
was
n’t
particularly
supportive
of
your
career
path
,
but
you
are
also
saying
they
were
atheists
who
were
n’t
curious
about
the
things
you
are
curious
about
.
It
sounds
like
you
were
a
hothouse
flower
.
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
AD
:
</hi>
Yes
.
I
think
what
went
with
my
parents
'
atheism
was
a
distrust
of
the
arts
as
frivolous
and
extraneous
.
They
were
very

pragmatic

.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
They
almost
sound

Communist

.
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
AD
:
</hi>
Yeah
,
a
little
bit
[
<hi rend="italic">
Laughs
</hi>
]
.
They
had
an
austere
way
of
living
,
and
my
wanting
to
pursue
music
as
a
career
was
the
last
straw
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
What
’s
your
relationship
with
them
now
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
AD
:
</hi>
I
do
n’t
actually
speak
to
my
mother
and
stepfather
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
Why
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
AD
:
</hi>
A
lot
of
reasons
,
but
when
I
was
about
21
I
was
fairly
certain
I
wanted
to
go
the
music
path
and
they
said
,
“
Fine
,
then
go
!
”
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
That
’s
the
reason
you
do
n’t
speak
with
them
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
AD
:
</hi>
That
’s
the
main
.
“
Go
ahead
,
do
what
you
want
,
and
have
a
nice
life
.
”
So
the
music
thing
cost
the
relationship
with
my
parents
,
although
I
think
there
may
have
been
some
other
things
that
have
done
it
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
That
must
be
a
difficult
thing
to
contend
with
,
that
a
career
would
be
the
basis
for
a
relationship
.
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
AD
:
</hi>
Yes
,
it
’s
strange
,
but
my
love
of
music
is
perhaps
stronger
for
it
because
of
the
sacrifices
I
have
made
for
it
early
on
.
I
had
to
fight
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
Would
you
say
in
your
previous
work
some
of
your
conflict
of
dating
would
have
been
birthed
from
how
your
relationship
with
your
family
?
How
do
you
see
the
arc
of
your
work
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
AD
:
</hi>
My
songs
are
sort
of
therapy
for
me
,
so
you
<hi rend="italic">
can
</hi>
trace
my
personal
progress
through
them
[
<hi rend="italic">
Laughs
</hi>
]
.
I
think
there
is
some
improvement
.
I
wrote
my
first
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love%20song">
love
song
</ref>
the
other
day
,
so
I
think
I
’m
getting
the
hang
of
what
relationships
are
all
about
.
I
’m
ever
grateful
for
music
for
being
there
for
me
when
things
were
n’t
going
so
well
.

Has
the

affected
you
as
an
artist
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
AD
:
</hi>
Not
directly
,
but
I
do
have
a
few
songs
that
are
political
.
One
about
George
Bush
and
the
hypocrisy
,
but
it
’s
very
indirect
;
you
would
n’t
know
it
was
about

How
has
it
affected
you
personally
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
AD
:
</hi>
I
feel
sad
about
it
.
People
say
my
music
is
sad
,
but
it
’s
a
therapeutic
thing
so
the
war
affects
me
.
