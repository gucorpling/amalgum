Prioritize
means
over
ends
.
Gandhi
strongly
believed
in
the
primacy
of
means
over
ends

Even
the

must
be
pursued
only
through
the
right
means
,
even
if
it
means
it
takes
longer
to
achieve
.
For

,
Gandhi
highly
valued
nonviolence

and
chose
to

his
goals
only
through

means

even
at

worldly
things
