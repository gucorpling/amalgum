Kiribati
is
heavily
dependent
on
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/diesel%20fuel">
diesel
fuel
</ref>
for
most
of
the
energy
available
on
the
national
power
grid
,
which
supplies
power
to
half
Kiribati
's
population
of
110,000
.
In
addition
,
a
third
of
the
country
's
population
lacks
access
to
electricity
.
Once
installation
of
the
solar
panels
is
complete
,
they
are
estimated
to
reduce
diesel
consumption
by
230,000
liters
(
60,760
gallons
)
a
year
and
give
access
to
the
electricity
to
some
parts
of
the
population
that
currently
have
no
electricity
.
The
European
Union
already
has
committed
€
100
million
to
sustainable
energy
in
the
region
,
with
€
10
million
of
that
coming
as
a
result
of
an
announcement
made
last
week
.

In

press
release
about
the
news
,
Kiribati
President
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anote%20Tong">
Anote
Tong
</ref>
was
quoted
as
saying
,
&quot;
Kiribati
faces
big
challenges
it
is
remote
,
it
is
at
risk
from
the
effects
of
climate
change
,
and
it
is
vulnerable
to
economic
shocks
.
[

Shifting
Kiribati
's
focus
to
reliable
solar
energy
will
provide
a
more
secure
,
more
sustainable
power
source
for
the
country
's
people
.

quoted
Tong
as
saying
,
&quot;
It
's
the
first
time
we
are
doing
this
.
We
're
excited
at
the
prospect
of
even
substituting
fossil
fuel
to
a
small
extent
at
this
stage
.
What
the
system
being
envisaged
will
only
produce
around
500
kilowatts
,
but
this
is
the
beginning
of
what
I
hope
will
be
a
pattern
,
the
trend
in
the
future
.

The
European
Union
's
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Fiji">
Fiji
</ref>
-based
head
of
operations
for
the
Pacific
region
,
Renato
Mele
,
supported
alternative
energy
solutions
like
solar
power
for
the
region
,
but
said
that
solar
power
had
limitations
because
climate
and
environmental
conditions
sometimes
meant
batteries
required
to
power
the
panels
had
a
life
of
only
12
months
,
compared
to
other
climates
where
batteries
normally
last
five
years
.
This
created
the
potential
to
drive
up
standard
operating
costs
.
Mele
has
also
noted
these
additional
costs
though
are
still
lower
than
the
cost
of
diesel
power
.

&quot;
Governments
will
be
able
to
put
the
money
they
(
currently

spend
on
diesel
into
things
like
education
and
health
