Chapter
9
</head>
<p>
By
the
time
Mrs.
Stogbuchner
came
out
to
the
playground
to
call
her
class
,
Baartock
had
almost
forgotten
how
hungry
he
was
.
He
had
found
Jason
and
they
had
raced
four
times
,
and
Baartock
had
won
three
times
.
Then
several
other
boys
had
joined
in
,
and
they
'd
played
tag
.
That
was
a
whole
new
game
for
Baartock
.
He
liked
being
'
it
'
,
then
he
could
do
the
chasing
.
When
he
was
'
not
it
'
,
he
could
run
faster
than
any
of
the
other
boys
,
so
they
did
n't
try
to
chase
him
at
all
.
</p>
<p>
They
went
back
into
the
classroom
,
and
all
the
children
went
to
their
seats
and
got
out
their
pencil
boxes
.
Baartock
was
horrified
to
discover
that
his
pencil
box
was
missing
.
It
was
n't
on
the
table
where
he
'd
left
it
.
It
was
n't
in
the
drawer
at
his
place
at
the
table
.
It
was
his
brand-new
pencil
box
and
he
had
n't
even
used
the
crayons
yet
,
and
now
it
was
gone
.
He
did
n't
see
it
anywhere
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Hello
.
You
must
be
Baartock
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
He
looked
around
to
see
an
adult
standing
right
behind
him
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
'm
Mrs.
Pangle
,
Timmy
's
mother
.
&quot;
She
pointed
at
one
of
the
boys
at
the
next
table
.
&quot;
I
come
in
two
afternoons
a
week
.
I
'm
the
aide
for
this
class
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Baartock
might
have
asked
what
an
'
aide
'
was
,
but
he
was
worried
about
his
pencil
box
.
&quot;
If
you
're
looking
for
your
box
,
I
put
it
in
your
cubby
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Where
cubby
?
&quot;
He
did
n't
know
that
he
had
a
cubby
,
but
if
that
was
where
his
box
was
,
he
wanted
to
find
it
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
It
's
right
over
here
.
&quot;
Mrs.
Pangle
led
him
to
the
back
of
the
room
,
and
stopped
near
the
door
going
outside
.
&quot;
Here
you
are
,
&quot;
she
said
pointing
.
&quot;
This
is
your
cubby
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
There
,
just
as
she
had
said
,
was
his
missing
pencil
box
.
He
picked
it
up
and
held
it
,
almost
afraid
that
he
might
lose
it
again
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
My
cubby
?
&quot;
he
asked
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
That
's
right
.
See
,
right
here
,
'
Baartock
'
.
&quot;
At
the
top
of
his
cubby
was
a
little
card
with
marks
on
it
.
He
thought
they
looked
like
the
marks
Mrs.
Jackson
had
made
on
his
pencil
box
.
He
looked
at
his
box
.
The
marks
were
just
the
same
.
&quot;
I
fixed
it
for
you
while
you
were
at
lunch
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
He
remembered
what
Mrs.
Jackson
said
that
humans
say
when
only
one
gives
something
.
&quot;
Thank
you
,
&quot;
he
said
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
You
're
welcome
,
Baartock
.
You
should
n't
leave
your
things
on
the
table
,
unless
Mrs.
Stogbuchner
tells
you
to
.
It
makes
the
room
messy
and
you
might
lose
something
.
Either
put
them
in
here
,
or
in
your
drawer
in
the
table
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
He
did
n't
to
tell
her
that
he
was
n't
going
to
lose
his
box
again
.
He
held
on
to
it
tightly
.
&quot;
And
over
here
is
where
you
can
hang
a
coat
,
&quot;
Mrs.
Pangle
said
,
pointing
to
some
hooks
in
the
wall
.
&quot;
This
one
is
yours
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
There
were
cards
over
each
hook
,
and
there
was
a
mark
on
one
that
he
recognized
.
That
must
be
his
hook
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
You
'd
better
get
back
to
your
seat
now
.
But
I
'll
be
here
if
you
need
help
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
He
went
back
to
the
table
and
found
that
someone
had
given
him
some
sheets
of
paper
with
marks
all
over
them
.
They
did
n't
look
like
the
ones
he
and
Jason
had
used
the
crayons
on
before
.
And
they
were
n't
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
It
's
a
writing
worksheet
,
&quot;
Jason
said
.
&quot;
You
're
supposed
to
make
letters
on
the
lines
that
look
just
like
the
ones
they
've
made
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Baartock
looked
at
the
papers
,
then
opened
his
box
and
got
out
his
crayons
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
No
,
you
're
supposed
to
use
your
pencil
,
&quot;
Jason
said
,
seeing
what
Baartock
was
holding
.
</p>
<p>
Baartock
looked
around
and
saw
than
none
of
them
were
using
crayons
.
He
had
wanted
to
make
colored
marks
,
but
they
were
all
using
long
yellow
sticks
instead
.
He
had
n't
used
one
of
those
before
.
He
put
away
his
box
of
crayons
,
and
got
out
his
yellow
stick
.
He
tried
to
use
his
the
way
all
the
children
were
,
but
it
would
n't
make
any
marks
on
the
paper
.
The
girl
sitting
across
the
table
started
giggling
.
She
had
been
watching
him
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
You
have
to
sharpen
it
,
&quot;
she
said
.
&quot;
The
pencil
sharpener
is
on
Mrs.
Stogbuchner
's
desk
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Baartock
got
up
and
walked
up
to
the
desk
.
He
looked
all
over
the
desk
,
but
he
did
n't
see
anything
to
sharpen
the
stick
with
.
There
was
n't
a
knife
,
or
any
kind
of
blade
.
Mississtog-Buchner
was
helping
a
girl
at
one
table
and
Mississpangel
was
helping
a
boy
in
the
back
of
the
classroom
.
He
just
stood
there
looking
at
the
desk
and
waited
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Yes
,
Baartock
,
what
do
you
need
?
&quot;
Mrs.
Stogbuchner
had
finished
with
the
girl
and
saw
him
just
standing
at
her
desk
.
Baartock
was
n't
sure
just
what
to
say
,
so
he
held
up
the
pencil
instead
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Do
you
need
some
help
with
the
pencil
sharpener
?
&quot;
she
asked
.
Several
children
in
the
front
of
the
class
started
snickering
.
&quot;
All
right
,
get
back
to
your
work
,
&quot;
she
said
to
them
as
she
came
over
to
help
him
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
This
is
the
pencil
sharpener
,
&quot;
she
said
,
and
taking
the
pencil
from
his
hand
,
&quot;
and
this
is
how
to
use
it
.
&quot;
She
put
the
pencil
in
a
hole
in
a
little
box
and
started
working
the
little
crank
on
the
side
.
She
pulled
the
pencil
out
of
the
box
,
and
it
had
a
point
.
&quot;
That
's
how
you
do
it
.
You
do
n't
want
to
sharpen
it
too
much
,
or
you
'd
grind
it
all
away
.
Is
that
all
you
need
?
