<hi rend="bold">
What
makes
you
the
most
desirable
of
all
candidates
running
in
the
riding
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
I
am
not
a
resident
of
the
riding
so
my
decisions
will
not
be
based
in
local
bias
or
favouritism
.
I
come
with
a
commitment
to
help
empower
families
with
the
authority
which
is
rightfully
theirs
.
I
seek
to
serve
,
not
because
of
a
love
for
power
but
,
because
I
believe
that
we
need
strong
families
to
build
a
strong
society
and
economy
.
I
would
cheerfully
address
the
issues
of
G-P-R
and
maintain
a
residence
there
to
ensure
there
is
access
to
me
as
their
MPP
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
What
do
you
feel
are
the
three
most
important
issues
to
voters
in
your
riding
?
Are
these
the
same
top
three
issues
that
are
most
important
to
you
?
What
would
you
do
to
address
these
issues
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
My
first
priority
is
our
families
.
It
is
for
them
that
we
work
and
seek
to
maintain
a
stable
home
life
.
I
believe
the
welfare
of
their
families
is
of
prime
importance
to
the
people
of
G-P-R
.
Whether
it
's
recreational
concerns
,
information
provided
to
them
outside
of
approved
sources
such
as
the
internet
,
education
or
child
care
.
People
are
concerned
primarily
about
their
family
.
This
would
be
the
first
area
I
would
seek
to
address
.
I
would
do
so
by
decreasing
government
involvement
in
our
personal
lives
.
I
would
like
to
see
parents
empowered
to
make
decisions
for
the
well-being
of
their
family
.
This
would
include
the
freedom
to
choose
what
form
of
education
the
children
should
have
.
</p>
<p>
Access
to
health
care
-
There
are
too
many
people
who
do
not
have
access
to
a
family
doctor
.
A
cooperative
clinic
does
not
provide
the
same
access
.
Wait
times
in
hospitals
can
be
as
long
as
10
hours
in
the
emergency
room
.
For
all
the
touting
of
things
getting
better
,
this
was
about
1
month
ago
.
These
are
important
issues
.
</p>
<p>
Elective
surgeries
should
not
be
paid
for
by
public
health
care
.
They
are
elective
and
thus
un-essential
.
The
health
care
savings
would
ensure
that
we
are
able
to
fully
provide
necessary
and
lifesaving
medical
care
.
</p>
<p>
I
would
work
with
the
federal
government
to
develop
a
testing
and
upgrading
system
to
ensure
qualified
foreign
doctors
become
active
medical
practitioners
within
our
system
.
</p>
<p>
Rural
areas
find
the
shortage
of
doctors
even
more
challenging
than
large
cities
.
We
would
strengthen
the
Under-serviced
Areas
Training
Program
,
providing
tuition
,
books
and
living
expenses
for
each
year
of
medical
school
in
exchange
for
an
equal
number
of
years
in
under-serviced
areas
.
</p>
<p>
While
small
communities
generally
have
less
dramatic
crimes
,
where
there
is
crime
there
are
victims
.
We
need
to
protect
the
rights
of
law
abiding
citizens
over
those
of
convicted
offenders
.
</p>
<p>
Educationally
,
we
need
to
promote
personal
responsibility
.
Violent
offenders
should
need
not
receive
reduced
sentences
.
