THE
START
</head>
<p>
With
so
much
to
think
about
,
the
few
weeks
that
were
left
between
vacation
and
the
country
passed
quickly
for
the
Bobbseys
.
As
told
in
any
first
book
,
&quot;
The
Bobbsey
Twins
,
&quot;
this
little
family
had
a
splendid
home
in
Lakeport
,
where
Mr.
Bobbsey
was
a
lumber
merchant
.
The
mother
and
father
were
both
young
themselves
,
and
always
took
part
in
their
children
's
joys
and
sorrows
,
for
there
were
sorrows
sometimes
.
Think
of
poor
little
Freddie
getting
shut
up
all
alone
in
a
big
store
with
only
a
little
black
kitten
,
&quot;
Snoop
,
&quot;
to
keep
him
from
being
scared
to
death
;
that
was
told
of
in
the
first
book
,
for
Freddie
went
shopping
one
day
with
his
mamma
,
and
wandered
off
a
little
bit
.
Presently
he
found
himself
in
the
basement
of
the
store
;
there
he
had
so
much
trouble
in
getting
out
he
fell
asleep
in
the
meantime
.
Then
,
when
he
awoke
and
it
was
all
dark
,
and
the
great
big
janitor
came
to
rescue
him
--
oh
!
--
Freddie
thought
the
man
might
even
be
a
giant
when
he
first
heard
the
janitor
's
voice
in
the
dark
store
.
</p>
<p>
Freddie
often
got
in
trouble
,
but
like
most
good
little
boys
he
was
always
saved
just
at
the
right
time
,
for
they
say
good
children
have
real
angels
watching
over
them
.
Nan
,
Bert
,
and
Flossie
all
had
plenty
of
exciting
experiences
too
,
as
told
in
&quot;
The
Bobbsey
Twins
,
&quot;
for
among
other
neighbors
there
was
Danny
Rugg
,
a
boy
who
always
tried
to
make
trouble
for
Bert
,
and
sometimes
almost
succeeded
in
getting
Bert
into
&quot;
hot
water
,
&quot;
as
Dinah
expressed
it
.
</p>
<p>
Of
course
Nan
had
her
friends
,
as
all
big
girls
have
,
but
Bert
,
her
twin
brother
,
was
her
dearest
chum
,
just
as
Freddie
was
Flossie
's
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
When
we
get
to
the
country
we
will
plant
trees
,
go
fishing
,
and
pick
blackberries
,
&quot;
Nan
said
one
day
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Yes
,
and
I
'm
going
with
Harry
out
exploring
,
&quot;
Bert
announced
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
'm
just
going
to
plant
things
,
&quot;
prim
little
Flossie
lisped
.
&quot;
I
just
love
melons
and
ice
cream
and
--
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Ice
cream
!
Can
you
really
plant
ice
cream
?
&quot;
Freddie
asked
innocently
,
which
made
the
others
all
laugh
at
Flossie
's
funny
plans
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
'm
going
to
have
chickens
,
&quot;
Freddie
told
them
.
&quot;
I
'm
going
to
have
one
of
those
queer
chicken
coops
that
you
shut
up
tight
and
when
you
open
it
it
's
just
full
of
little
'
kippies
.
'
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Oh
,
an
incubator
,
you
mean
,
&quot;
Nan
explained
.
&quot;
That
's
a
machine
for
raising
chickens
without
any
mother
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
But
mine
are
going
to
have
a
mother
,
&quot;
Freddie
corrected
,
thinking
how
sad
little
chickens
would
be
without
a
kind
mamma
like
his
own
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
But
how
can
they
have
a
mother
where
there
is
n't
any
for
them
?
&quot;
Flossie
asked
,
with
a
girl
's
queer
way
of
reasoning
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
'll
get
them
one
,
&quot;
Freddie
protested
.
&quot;
I
'll
let
Snoop
be
their
mamma
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
A
cat
!
the
idea
!
why
,
he
would
eat
'
em
all
up
,
&quot;
Flossie
argued
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Not
if
I
whipped
him
once
for
doing
it
,
&quot;
the
brother
insisted
.
Then
Nan
and
Bert
began
to
tease
him
for
whipping
the
kitten
after
the
chickens
had
been
&quot;
all
eaten
up
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
So
the
merry
days
went
on
until
at
last
vacation
came
!
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Just
one
more
night
,
&quot;
Nan
told
Flossie
and
Freddie
when
she
prepared
them
for
bed
,
to
help
her
very
busy
mother
.
Bert
assisted
his
father
with
the
packing
up
,
for
the
taking
of
a
whole
family
to
the
country
meant
lots
of
clothes
,
besides
some
books
and
just
a
few
toys
.
Then
there
was
Bert
's
tool
box
--
he
knew
he
would
need
that
at
Meadow
Brook
.
</p>
<p>
The
morning
came
at
last
,
a
beautiful
bright
day
,
a
rare
one
for
traveling
,
for
a
fine
shower
the
evening
before
had
washed
and
cooled
things
off
splendidly
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Now
come
,
children
,
&quot;
Mr.
Bobbsey
told
the
excited
youngsters
.
&quot;
Keep
track
of
your
things
.
Sam
will
be
ready
in
a
few
minutes
,
and
then
we
must
be
off
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Promptly
Sam
pulled
up
to
the
door
with
the
family
carriage
,
and
all
hurried
to
get
in
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Oh
,
Snoop
,
Snoop
!
&quot;
cried
Freddie
.
&quot;
He
's
in
the
library
in
the
box
!
Dinah
,
get
him
quick
,
get
him
!
&quot;
and
Dinah
ran
back
after
the
little
kitten
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Here
you
is
,
Freddie
!
&quot;
she
gasped
,
out
of
breath
from
hurrying
.
&quot;
You
do
n't
go
and
forget
poor
Snoopy
!
&quot;
and
she
climbed
in
beside
Sam
.
</p>
<p>
Then
they
started
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Oh
,
my
lan
'
a-massy
!
&quot;
yelled
Dinah
presently
in
distress
.
&quot;
Sam
Johnson
,
you
jest
turn
dat
hoss
around
quick
,
&quot;
and
she
jerked
at
the
reins
herself
.
&quot;
You
heah
,
Sam
?
Quick
,
I
tells
you
.
Get
back
to
dat
house
.
I'se
forgot
to
bring
--
to
bring
my
lunch
basket
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Oh
,
never
mind
,
Dinah
,
&quot;
Mrs.
Bobbsey
interrupted
.
&quot;
We
will
have
lunch
on
the
train
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
But
I
could
n't
leab
dat
nice
lunch
I
got
ready
fo
'
de
chillen
in
between
,
missus
,
&quot;
the
colored
woman
urged
.
&quot;
I
'll
get
it
quick
as
a
wink
.
Now
,
Sam
,
you
rush
in
dar
quick
,
and
fetch
dat
red
and
white
basket
dat
smells
like
chicken
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
So
the
good-natured
maid
had
her
way
,
much
to
the
delight
of
Bert
and
Freddie
,
who
liked
nothing
so
well
as
one
of
Dinah
's
homemade
lunches
.
</p>
<p>
The
railroad
station
was
reached
without
mishap
,
and
while
Mr.
Bobbsey
attended
to
getting
the
baskets
checked
at
the
little
window
in
the
big
round
office
,
the
children
sat
about
&quot;
exploring
.
&quot;
Freddie
hung
back
a
little
when
a
locomotive
steamed
up
.
He
clung
to
his
mother
's
skirt
,
yet
wanted
to
see
how
the
machine
worked
.
