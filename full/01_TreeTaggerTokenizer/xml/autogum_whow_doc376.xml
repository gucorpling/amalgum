Cut
Vinyl
</head>
<p>
Vinyl
is
a
great
crafting
material
that
you
can
use
to
create
your
own
custom
designs
to
apply
to
t-shirts
,
windows
,
and
just
about
anything
else
.
Cutting
vinyl
is
actually
easier
than
you
might
think
.
To
cut
a
design
or
image
out
of
vinyl
,
you
’ll
need
an
electronic
cutting
machine
.
But
you
can
also
cut
simple
shapes
out
of
vinyl
paper
with
scissors
or
a
craft
knife
.

Get
an

cutting
machine
if

do
n't
already
have
one

machines

are
easy
to
load
vinyl
paper

connected

the
machine
to
design
and
size
images
that
can
then
be
printed
and
cut
on
the
vinyl
paper
loaded
