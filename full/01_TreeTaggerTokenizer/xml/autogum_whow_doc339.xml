Maintain
Wellbeing
in
a
Mobile
World
</head>
<p>
As
a
style
statement
and
useful
communication
device
,
the
mobile
phone
is
perhaps
the
most
sought-after
gadget
of
our
times
.
It
has
also
become
a
vital
part
of
daily
life
for
billions
of
people
around
the
world
.
Whether
used
for
keeping
tabs
on
children
or
running
a
business
,
the
mobile
phone
has
made
a
huge
difference
in
how
we
do
things
today
.
</p>
<p>
But
our
increasing
dependence
on
the
benefits
of
wireless
communication
has
also
come
with
a
cost
.
If
something
goes
wrong
–
like
the
phone
is
lost
or
it
gets
infected
with
a
virus
–
this
can
quickly
cause
some
serious
life
complications
.
It
's
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
the
security
of
our
mobile
phones
now
affects
our
well
being
in
the
broadest
sense
.
</p>
<p>
While
we
are
enjoying
the
technological
advances
that
make
mobile
phones
ever
more
versatile
,
we
are
also
facing
new
security
risks
.
Mobile
phones
have
always
been
a
popular
target
for
thieves
working
the
streets
,
but
they
are
now
also
increasingly
targeted
by
cyber
criminals
who
have
been
using
the
Internet
to
make
money
through
all
kinds
of
scams
,
frauds
,
identity
theft
and
extortion
.
This
is
especially
the
case
with
the
new
generation
of
feature-packed
smartphones
.

Use
Common
Sense
Security
Measures
:
Try
not
to
make
things
easy
for
thieves
by
showing
off
your
phone
in
public
places
where
it
can
be
snatched
,
or
by
leaving
it
visible
inside
a
car
.
You
can
also
preempt
trouble
by
spending
a
little
time
on
your
phone
's
security
settings
.
Always
keep
the
phone
locked
and
protected
with
a
password
if
you
must
leave
it
unattended
somewhere
.

Educate
Your
Children
:
Statistics
show
that
most
mobile
phones
are
lost
by
teenagers
,
so
educate
them
about
security
issues
and
think
twice
before
investing
in
expensive
models
that
could
easily
disappear
tomorrow
.
If
your
family
has
a
history
of
dropping
mobile
phones
down
the
toilet
or
leaving
them
on
top
of
the
car
and
driving
off
,
consider
taking
out
insurance
.

Backup
Your
Information
:
Treat
your
SIM
card
with
care
and
make
sure
you
have
a
backup
record
of
all
the
information
it
contains
.
Also
make
a
record
of
your
phone
's
unique
15
digit
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Find_the_IMEI_or_MEID_Number_on_a_Mobile_Phone">
IMEI
number
</ref>
which
can
be
found
by
typing
*#06#
on
the
keypad
.
This
helps
the
police
identify
a
recovered
phone
.
Marking
the
phone
with
your
contact
details
makes
it
easy
for
honest
people
to
return
a
lost
phone
as
well
.

Do
n't
Talk
To
Strangers
:
Think
of
your
mobile
phone
in
the
same
way
as
your
computer
.
Only
accept
messages
,
downloads
and
applications
from
reliable
sources
,
just
like
you
would
when
using
your
PC
.
Any
multimedia
message
(
mms
)
that
prompts
an
installation
should
be
refused
.
Disable
your
phone
's
Bluetooth
discoverability
.

Consider
Mobile
Security
Software
:
As
mobile
threats
increase
in
number
and
sophistication
,
consider
protecting
your
mobile
phone
with
software
like
F-Secure
Mobile
Security
–
especially
if
you
are
using
a
smartphone
for
business
or
online
banking
.
It
lets
you
enjoy
the
mobile
world
to
the
full
,
safe
in
the
knowledge
that
your
privacy
and
valuable
information
remain
protected
.

When
you
are
web
browsing
on
your
phone
,
remember
that
the
interface
is
different
so
you
may
not
be
able
spot
the
telltale
signs
of
dubious
websites
.
Be
on
the
lookout
for
'
phishing
'
attempts
that
ask
you
to
reveal
personal
information
such
as
credit
card
details
.
