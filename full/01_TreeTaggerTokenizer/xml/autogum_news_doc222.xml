partnering
with

,
examined
key
output
from
Madrid
's
US
embassy
.
</p>
<p>
The
latest
cables
focus
on
US
–
Spain
relations
,
particularly
during
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/George_W._Bush">
George
W.

</ref>
presidency
,
with
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo%20Aguirre">
Eduardo
Aguirre
</ref>
serving
as
ambassador
in
Madrid
.
He
is
cited
as
having
&quot;
personally
exerted
&quot;
pressure
on
Spain
's
government
and
judiciary
;
this
leading
to
at
least
three
investigations
being
dropped
.
</p>
<p>
Of
concern
to
the
press
is
the
death
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/José%20Couso">
José
Couso
</ref>
in
2003
.
The
Spanish
cameraman
was
killed
during
the
battle
for
Baghdad
;
the
Spanish
judiciary
intended
to
prosecute
three
US
servicemen
over
the
fatality
.

'
was
a
second
concern
the
US
embassy
in
Madrid
pressured
the
government
on
.
Spanish
prosecutors
had
been
keen
to
pursue
13
CIA
officers
over
the
illegal
flights
.
</p>
<p>
Repeatedly
,
concern
over
Spain
's
independent
judiciary
invoking
'
universal
jurisdiction
'
appears
in
leaked
cables
.
Reports
at
the
time
showed
magistrates
considered
actions
at
Guantanamo
Bay
torture
,
and
seemed
keen
to
pursue
ex-US
government
officials
on
grounds
of
&quot;
criminal
responsibility
&quot;
.

<p>
Cable

highlights
the
cases
of
Hamed
Abderrahaman
Ahmed
and
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Morocco">

Lahcen
Ikassrien

respectively
transferred
from
Guantanamo

,
to
Spanish
custody
,
in
February
2004
and
July
2005
.
</p>
<p>
Describing
conditions
at
the
Cuban
detention
centre
as
&quot;
impossible
to
explain
,
much
less
justify
&quot;
,
Hamed
—
better
known
as
the
&quot;
Spanish
Taliban
&quot;
—
saw
a
July
2006
ruling
by
the
country
's
Supreme
Court
annul
his
six-year
prison
sentence
,
granting
him
an
immediate
release
.
The
ruling
cast
doubt
on
the
reliability
of
evidence
against
Lahcen
,
who
was
released
on
bail
.
</p>
<p>
Hamed
and
his
family
,
at
the
time
,
announced
their
intent
to
sue
the
US
government
over
his
suffering
in
Guantanamo

Pronouncements
by
the
two
,
and
others
,
on
&quot;
criminal
responsibility
&quot;
were
met
with
a
diplomatically
stern
response
;
cable

states
that
the
government
of
Spain
was
&quot;
cautioned
that

all
being

</p>
<p>
Come
April
this
year
,
Garzón
himself
faced
prosecution
.
A
probe
into
Franco-era
war
crimes
saw
him
suspended
,
possibly
to
be
tried
for
acting
contrary
to
an
amnesty
extended
to
Franco
supporters
.
It
is
alleged
he
&quot;
acted

Supreme

judge

working

.
Reports
based
on
<hi rend="italic">
El

'
</hi>
investigation
around
the
leaked
cables
suggest
the
country
's
judiciary
has
been
politicised
to
suit
American
interests
.
</p>
<p>
With
a
price
of

85,000
cited
for
each
former

that
Spain
was
to
take
,
recent
reports
assert
other
countries
have
been
offered
financial
incentives
to
help
empty
the
camp
.
</p>
<p>
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Belgium">

alongside

supposedly

only
a
