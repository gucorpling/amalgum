This
event
,
called
the
March
for
Life
,
has
taken
place
every
year
since
1973
,
the
year
abortion
was
ruled
legal
in
the
U.S.
by
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe%20v%20Wade">

&quot;
is
the
umbrella
term
of

of
the

movement
that
favors

illegal
and
less
accessible
and

<p>
Donald

has
recently
reversed
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Barack_Obama">

'
s
repeal
of
a
global
funding
ban
,
which
prohibits
the
use
of
U.S.
funds
for
any
organization
that
provides
or
counsels
for
abortions
abroad
.
</p>
<p>
Trump
specifically
asked
Vice
President
Mike
Pence
to
attend
the
march
.
&quot;
Life
is
winning
in
America
!
&quot;
he
told
the
crowd
,
noting
that
he
serves
under
&quot;
a
president
who
I
proudly
say
stands
for
the
right
to
life
.
&quot;
A
Pew
Research
Institute
poll
taken
this
year
shows
that
69
%
of
Americans
support
the
Roe
v
Wade
decision
,
up
from
60
%
in
1992
.
</p>
<p>
One
reason
why
many
opponents
of
abortion
say
the
procedure
should
be
illegal
is
the
belief
,
often
religious
,
that
life
begins
at
<ref target="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/conception">
conception
</ref>
.
Correspondingly
,
the
event
was
accompanied
by
religious
music
and
speeches
,
including
one
by
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic">

<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archbishop%20Timothy%20Dolan">

One
reporter
for
the

<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/BBC">

</ref>
</hi>
noted
a
large
number
of
young
women
in
the
crowd
,
especially
college
students
.
Signs
included
&quot;
Women
DO
Regret
Abortion
&quot;
and
&quot;
I
am
the
Pro-Life
Generation
,
&quot;
many
held
up
by
young
women
.
Others
showed
pictures
of

,
quoted
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible">

or
called
for
the
defunding
of

by

.
There
is
already
a
law
in
place
,
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyde%20Amendment">
Hyde
Amendment
</ref>
,
which
bans
the
use
of
federal
funds
for
abortions
,
though
this
money
can
go
to
organizations
that
also
perform
abortions
so
long
as
the
funds
are
kept
separate
.

<p>
As
governor
of
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Indiana">
Indiana
</ref>
,
Mike
Pence
established
some
of
the
country
's
strictest
abortion
laws
.
Years
ago
,
Donald
Trump
said
publicly
that
he
was
&quot;
very
pro-choice
&quot;
but
has
since
changed
his
stance
.
Trump
commented
,
as
is
his
custom
,
via

&quot;
To
all
of
you
marching
—
you
have
my
full
support
!

The
crowds
in
Washington
,
D.C.
yesterday
numbered
in
the
tens
of
thousands
,
in
contrast
to
the
roughly
500,000
in
last
week
's
Women
's
March
,
though
some
organizations
did
attend
both
events
.
March
for
Life
President
Jeanne
Mancini
told
<hi rend="italic">
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/National_Public_Radio">
National
Public
Radio
</ref>
</hi>
,
&quot;
I
think
we
're
a
pretty
different
march
—
we
're
a
one-issue
march
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
abortion
rate
in
the
United
States
hit
a
record
low
in
2013
,
but
the
pro-
and
anti-abortion
rights
movements
are
at
odds
about
why
.
Both
sides
credit
increased
availability
of
contraceptives
,
but
anti-abortion
organizations
tend
to
give
more
credit
to
state-level
laws
that
have
made
it
harder
to
keep
abortion
clinics
open
and
limit
abortions
to
only
the
early
stages
of
pregnancy
.
As

pointed
out
,
the
anti-abortion
movement
now
has
the
opportunity
to
work
at
the
federal
level
;
&quot;
We
're
living
at
the
apex
of
a
40-year
,
state-by-state
effort
by
the
anti-choice
people
[
...
]
We
have
to
be
prepared
for
the
fact
that
they
've
got
all
the
pieces
in
place
to
do
real
damage
.
