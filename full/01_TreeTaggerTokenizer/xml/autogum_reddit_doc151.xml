Still
angry
about
my
proposal
two
years
ago
</head>
<sp who="#SweetAsPi">
<p>
Hi
,
I
’d
like
to
start
out
by
saying
I
have
a
wonderful
marriage
and
an
amazing
husband
and
we
have
a
great
life
together
.
We
just
came
back
from
our
one
year
anniversary
trip
to
a
present
from
my
mom
.
I
loathe
my
mom
.
I
have
been
wanting
to
cut
her
out
of
my
life
for
so
long
but
one
thing
or
another
(
usually
money
related
)
keeps
her
around
.
One
of
the
things
I
cannot
let
go
of
is
my
now
husband
involving
my
mother
in
our
engagement
.
It
makes
me
so
mad
and
it
feels
so
disrespectful
of
him
.
I
get
so
angry
every
time
I
even
think
about
it
and
whenever
she
sends
us
anything
related
to
our
marriage
,
or
comments
anything
related
to
our
marriage
,
it
brings
me
back
to
the
proposal
and
how
I
will
never
have
that
moment
back
and
how
she
was
involved
in
one
of
the
best
decisions
of
my
life
and
tainted
that
memory
.
I
remember
how
we
had
our
sister
in
law
on
speakerphone
congratulating
us
and
SHE
said
thank
you
!
As
if
it
’s
her
achievement
!
?
!
I
remember
how
she
took
so
long
in
the
chair
complaining
about
my
makeup
and
hair
person
on
our
wedding
day
that
I
had
to
be
rushed
through
hair
and
make
up
!
!
I
remember
her
being
so
angry
with
us
because
my
mother
in
law
had
a
cancer
scare
and
we
did
n’t
share
it
with
her
and
we
should
have
“
cause
she
’s
family
.
”
It
was
a
personal
matter
that
she
(
MIL
)
only
wanted
immediate
family
to
know
but
my
husband
slipped
up
.
She
told
us
it
was
wrong
of
us
to
keep
her
out
of
the
loop
and
that
we
were
a
bad
daughter
and
son
in
law
cause
of
it
.
Everything
just
feels
so
tainted
when
she
’s
involved
.
I
wanna
get
over
it
but
I
have
flashbacks
to
those
moments
,
especially
the
engagement
one
.
Not
only
do
I
feel
angry
with
her
but
I
feel
angry
with
my
husband
and
this
is
n’t
something
I
wanna
bring
up
2
years
later
when
he
already
apologized
for
it
.
I
want
to
stop
being
angry
about
it
and
at
him
.
I
wanna
let
it
go
but
I
ca
n’t
and
I
feel
like
I
ca
n’t
bring
it
up
to
him
caise
is
makes
him
feel
bad
so
I
just
have
to
sit
here
and
let
my
anger
Brew
which
makes
me
even
angrier
.
I
want
to
break
our
wedding
photo
right
now
,
one
that
she
’s
in
(
I
wo
n’t
but
I
want
to
)
.
The
gift
was
nice
too
but
I
just
ca
n’t
.
Like
no
.
I
do
n’t
want
it
.

Just
my
hunble
opinion
-
it
sounds
like
you
are
trying
valiantly
to
keep
your
anger
in
check
and
not
do
harm
to
your
husband
or
relationship-
which
is
the
right
idea
.
But
,
in
my
experience
,
it
does
n't
work
.
It
will
never
work
that
way
...
.
.
</p>
<p>
What
I
have
learned
to
do
is
to
get
alone
and
somewhere
safe
and
BE
ANGRY
.
Be
honest
with
yourself
,
even
if
it
seems
wrong
to
be
angry
-
your
emotions
are
valid
regardless
.
Feel
all
the
anger
and
hurt
and
all
the
reasons
and
what
you
're
really
afraid
of
.
What
happens
with
me
is
a
)
that
takes
most
of
the
power
out
of
the
emotion
and
b
)
I
usually
find
out
the
issue
was
something
different
anyway
,
and
that
frees
up
my
current
relationship
.
This
can
be
a
very
intense
process
and
you
should
definitely
talk
to
your
counselor
about
it
.
:
)
naturally
,
everyone
is
different
and
also
at
a
different
place
on
their
healing
.
</p>
<p>
Also
,
I
have
cut
ties
with
my
mom
.
It
took
me
10
years
to
decide
to
do
it
,
and
I
worked
out
several
issues
on
the
way
.
Ultimately
,
tho
,
she
continues
to
be
controlling
and
toxic
,
and
I
do
n't
need
that
in
my
life
.
This
sucks
in
general
,
but
it
is
an
option
that
you
can
consider
.
Even
just
giving
yourself
the
option
might
feel
healing
to
you
.
