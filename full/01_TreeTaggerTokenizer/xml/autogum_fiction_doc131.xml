CHAPTER
XXX
—
EVENTS
OF
WEDNESDAY
;
THE
UNIVERSITY
OF
CRAMOND
</head>
<p>
I
awoke
to
much
diffidence
,
even
to
a
feeling
that
might
be
called
the
beginnings
of
panic
,
and
lay
for
hours
in
my
bed
considering
the
situation
.
Seek
where
I
pleased
,
there
was
nothing
to
encourage
me
and
plenty
to
appal
.
They
kept
a
close
watch
about
the
cottage
;
they
had
a
beast
of
a
watch-dog
—
at
least
,
unless
I
had
settled
it
;
and
if
I
had
,
I
knew
its
bereaved
master
would
only
watch
the
more
indefatigably
for
the
loss
.
In
the
pardonable
ostentation
of
love
I
had
given
all
the
money
I
could
spare
to
Flora
;
I
had
thought
it
glorious
that
the
hunted
exile
should
come
down
,
like
Jupiter
,
in
a
shower
of
gold
,
and
pour
thousands
in
the
lap
of
the
beloved
.
Then
I
had
in
an
hour
of
arrant
folly
buried
what
remained
to
me
in
a
bank
in
George
Street
.
And
now
I
must
get
back
the
one
or
the
other
;
and
which
?
and
how
?
</p>
<p>
As
I
tossed
in
my
bed
,
I
could
see
three
possible
courses
,
all
extremely
perilous
.
First
,
Rowley
might
have
been
mistaken
;
the
bank
might
not
be
watched
;
it
might
still
be
possible
for
him
to
draw
the
money
on
the
deposit
receipt
.
Second
,
I
might
apply
again
to
Robbie
.
Or
,
third
,
I
might
dare
everything
,
go
to
the
Assembly
Ball
,
and
speak
with
Flora
under
the
eyes
of
all
Edinburgh
.
This
last
alternative
,
involving
as
it
did
the
most
horrid
risks
,
and
the
delay
of
forty-eight
hours
,
I
did
but
glance
at
with
an
averted
head
,
and
turned
again
to
the
consideration
of
the
others
.
It
was
the
likeliest
thing
in
the
world
that
Robbie
had
been
warned
to
have
no
more
to
do
with
me
.
The
whole
policy
of
the
Gilchrists
was
in
the
hands
of
Chevenix
;
and
I
thought
this
was
a
precaution
so
elementary
that
he
was
certain
to
have
taken
it
.
If
he
had
not
,
of
course
I
was
all
right
:
Robbie
would
manage
to
communicate
with
Flora
;
and
by
four
o’clock
I
might
be
on
the
south
road
and
,
I
was
going
to
say
,
a
free
man
.
Lastly
,
I
must
assure
myself
with
my
own
eyes
whether
the
bank
in
George
Street
were
beleaguered
.
</p>
<p>
I
called
to
Rowley
and
questioned
him
tightly
as
to
the
appearance
of
the
Bow
Street
officer
.
</p>
<p>
‘
What
sort
of
looking
man
is
he
,
Rowley
?
’
I
asked
,
as
I
began
to
dress
.
</p>
<p>
‘
Wot
sort
of
a
looking
man
he
is
?
’
repeated
Rowley
.
‘
Well
,
I
do
n’t
very
well
know
wot
you
would
say
,
Mr.
Anne
.
He
ai
n’t
a
beauty
,
any’ow
.
’
</p>
<p>
‘
Is
he
tall
?
’
</p>
<p>
‘
Tall
?
Well
,
no
,
I
should
n’t
say
<hi rend="italic">
tall
</hi>
Mr.
Anne
.
’
</p>
<p>
‘
Well
,
then
,
is
he
short
?
’
</p>
<p>
‘
Short
?
No
,
I
do
n’t
think
I
would
say
he
was
what
you
would
call
<hi rend="italic">
short
</hi>
.
No
,
not
piticular
short
,
sir
.
’
</p>
<p>
‘
Then
,
I
suppose
,
he
must
be
about
the
middle
height
?
’
</p>
<p>
‘
Well
,
you
might
say
it
,
sir
;
but
not
remarkable
so
.
’
</p>
<p>
I
smothered
an
oath
.
</p>
<p>
‘
Is
he
clean-shaved
?
’
I
tried
him
again
.
</p>
<p>
‘
Clean-shaved
?
’
he
repeated
,
with
the
same
air
of
anxious
candour
.
</p>
<p>
‘
Good
heaven
,
man
,
do
n’t
repeat
my
words
like
a
parrot
!
’
I
cried
.
‘
Tell
me
what
the
man
was
like
:
it
is
of
the
first
importance
that
I
should
be
able
to
recognise
him
.
’
</p>
<p>
‘
I
’m
trying
to
,
Mr.
Anne
.
But
<hi rend="italic">
clean-shaved
</hi>
?
I
do
n’t
seem
to
rightly
get
hold
of
that
p’int
.
Sometimes
it
might
appear
to
me
like
as
if
he
was
;
and
sometimes
like
as
if
he
was
n’t
.
No
,
it
would
n’t
surprise
me
now
if
you
was
to
tell
me
he
’
ad
a
bit
o
’
whisker
.
’
</p>
<p>
‘
Was
the
man
red-faced
?
’
I
roared
,
dwelling
on
each
syllable
.
</p>
<p>
‘
I
do
n’t
think
you
need
go
for
to
get
cross
about
it
,
Mr.
Anne
!
’
said
he
.
‘
I
’m
tellin
’
you
every
blessed
thing
I
see
!
Red-faced
?
Well
,
no
,
not
as
you
would
remark
upon
.
’
</p>
<p>
A
dreadful
calm
fell
upon
me
.
</p>
<p>
‘
Was
he
anywise
pale
?
’
I
asked
.
</p>
<p>
‘
Well
,
it
do
n’t
seem
to
me
as
though
he
were
.
But
I
tell
you
truly
,
I
did
n’t
take
much
heed
to
that
.
’
</p>
<p>
‘
Did
he
look
like
a
drinking
man
?
’
</p>
<p>
‘
Well
,
no
.
If
you
please
,
sir
,
he
looked
more
like
an
eating
one
.
’
</p>
<p>
‘
Oh
,
he
was
stout
,
was
he
?
’
</p>
<p>
‘
No
,
sir
.
I
could
n’t
go
so
far
as
that
.
No
,
he
was
n’t
not
to
say
<hi rend="italic">
stout
</hi>
.
If
anything
,
lean
rather
.
’
</p>
<p>
I
need
not
go
on
with
the
infuriating
interview
.
It
ended
as
it
began
,
except
that
Rowley
was
in
tears
,
and
that
I
had
acquired
one
fact
.
The
man
was
drawn
for
me
as
being
of
any
height
you
like
to
mention
,
and
of
any
degree
of
corpulence
or
leanness
;
clean-shaved
or
not
,
as
the
case
might
be
;
the
colour
of
his
hair
Rowley
‘
could
not
take
it
upon
himself
to
put
a
name
on
’
;
that
of
his
eyes
he
thought
to
have
been
blue
—
nay
,
it
was
the
one
point
on
which
he
attained
to
a
kind
of
tearful
certainty
.
‘
I
’ll
take
my
davy
on
it
,
’
he
asseverated
.
They
proved
to
have
been
as
black
as
sloes
,
very
little
and
very
near
together
.
So
much
for
the
evidence
of
the
artless
!
And
the
fact
,
or
rather
the
facts
,
acquired
?
Well
,
they
had
to
do
not
with
the
person
but
with
his
clothing
.
The
man
wore
knee-breeches
and
white
stockings
;
his
coat
was
‘
some
kind
of
a
lightish
colour
—
or
betwixt
that
and
dark
’
;
and
he
wore
a
‘
mole-skin
weskit
.
’
As
if
this
were
not
enough
,
he
presently
haled
me
from
my
breakfast
in
a
prodigious
flutter
,
and
showed
me
an
honest
and
rather
venerable
citizen
passing
in
the
Square
.
