Find
a
store
or
person
that
sells
the
type
of
animal
that
you
want
.
Make
sure
to
go
to
a
place
that
has
a
good
reputation

is
n't
sketchy
.

do
buy
an

questionable
seller

be
prepared
for
sick
and/or
injured
animals

For
exotic
pets
,
prices
can
easily
add
up
to
a
big
sum
.
Make
sure
that
the
animal
you
want
fits
into
your
budget
.
Do
n't
buy
an
expensive
animal
knowing
that
you
do
n't
have
the
money
to
take
care
of
it
properly
.
Your
animal
will
suffer
because
of
you
,
and
you
wo
n't
be
happy
with
your
purchase

buying
an
animal

your
city

could
be
travelling
the

It
all
depends
on
how
rare/endangered
they
are
.

They
are
