<hi rend="bold">
Chaweng
</hi>
is
a
beach
on
the
east
coast
of
<ref target="Ko%20Samui">
Ko
Samui
</ref>
.
It
has
a
lovely
white
beach
and
vibrant
nightlife
,
especially
at
its
north
end
.
</p>
<head>
Understand
</head>
<p>
Chaweng
is
the
largest
and
most
popular
of
Samui
's
beaches
,
and
is
usually
divided
into
three
sections
:
North
Chaweng
,
Central
Chaweng
and
Chaweng
Noi
(
Little
Chaweng
)
around
a
headland
to
the
south
.
Chaweng
Beach
is
the
longest
beach
on
Samui
's
east
coast
.
The
beach
is
beautiful
here
and
local
developers
are
finally
cleaning
up
some
of
the
trashy
areas
nearby
.
It
attracts
many
young
travellers
and
families
alike
,
but
still
remains
good
value
for
money
.
</p>
<p>
The
beach
is
approximately
7
km
long
with
powdery
white
sand
.
It
is
bordered
by
emerald-blue
waters
and
a
coral
reef
where
waves
break
,
leaving
the
bay
quite
peaceful
.
Not
far
from
the
beach
,
there
are
two
small
islands
near
the
reef
.
After
swimming
,
you
can
explore
the
nearest
one
by
walking
through
shallow
water
or
go
for
snorkelling
and
kayaking
at
the
second
island
which
is
further
out
and
larger
.
</p>
<p>
The
central
part
of
the
beach
is
a
bit
more
crowded
than
the
quieter
north
.
Many
vendors
pass
by
,
offering
beverages
,
fruit
,
ice
cream
and
local
Thai
food
for
the
more
daring
.
A
variety
of
local
crafts
and
Thai
souvenirs
are
also
available
.
</p>
<p>
The
beach
itself
is
usually
accessed
through
the
hotels
,
as
there
are
no
beach
roads
to
disturb
the
peacefulness
of
the
area
.
It
is
very
relaxing
but
noticeably
more
touristy
during
the
high
season
.
The
water
is
clean
with
normal
temperatures
between
25-28°C
.
</p>
<p>
Parallel
to
the
beach
,
clustered
in
the
middle
of
the
strip
,
lies
Samui
's
greatest
concentration
of
restaurants
,
bars
,
souvenir
shops
,
and
of
course
,
fast
food
and
convenience
stores
.

Chaweng
is
a
few
minutes
ride
south
of
the
airport
.
If
you
book
a
taxi
at
the
airport
's
transport
desk
,
it
will
cost
400
baht
.
A
shared
van
(
usually
requiring
5
passengers
before
it
departs
)
will
cost
120
baht
per
person
.
Taxi
drivers
rarely
use
taxi
meters
here
.
If
you
decide
not
to
use
the
booking
desk
,
negotiate
the
fare
in
advance
with
the
taxi
driver
.
It
should
cost
from
200-400
baht
.
Or
you
may
book
a
transfer
with
your
hotel
.
This
service
usually
costs
300
baht
,
though
some
of
the
higher-end
hotels
have
quoted
rates
of
400
baht
per
person
.
</p>
<p>
You
may
opt
to
take
other
,
more
adventurous
forms
of
transportation
like
the
following
:
</p>
<p>
Motorcycle
taxis
are
ordinary
motorbikes
and
you
sit
behind
the
driver
during
the
ride
.
Depending
on
the
distance
,
the
price
ranges
from
30-150
baht
.
</p>
<p>
Motorbike
rentals
are
available
if
riding
solo
is
what
you
prefer
.
Most
motorbike
rentals
in
Chaweng
offer
100-125
cc
bikes
such
as
Honda
Waves
,
Honda
Clicks
,
Suzuki
Steps
,
etc.
Rentals
cost
100-200
baht
per
day
depending
on
the
length
of
the
rental
.
</p>
<p>
Bigger
motorbikes
like
Harley
Davidson
's
and
sport
bikes
like
Kawasaki
Ninjas
and
Honda
CBRs
are
also
available
.
Be
warned
that
bike
accidents
tend
to
be
a
regular
occurrence
in
Ko
Samui
,
so
drive
carefully
.
</p>
<p>
If
you
are
travelling
in
a
large
group
,
you
may
opt
to
rent
a
Jeep
.
The
rental
usually
costs
at
least
800
baht
per
day
.
A
private
car
will
set
you
back
1,500
baht
or
more
per
day
.
There
are
many
models
to
choose
from
:
Honda
Jazz
,
Isuzu
Hi-Lander
,
Toyota
Camry
,
Toyota
Fortuner
,
etc.
Established
rental
companies
such
as
Avis
and
Hertz
also
offer
insurance
.
It
might
be
a
good
idea
to
get
the
insurance
along
with
the
rental
as
having
no
insurance
and
an
accident
could
be
expensive
.

<p>
There
are
lots
of
<hi rend="bold">
souvenir
shops
</hi>
around
town
.
It
is
not
uncommon
for
the
shopkeepers
to
ask
5
times
the
normal
tourist
price
particularly
in
the
central
areas
.
Bargaining
is
always
acceptable
when
it
comes
to
souvenirs
.
Even
when
a
price
is
indicated
a
discount
up
to
50
%
might
be
available
.
As
many
shops
and
the
often
cheaper
market
stalls
sell
mostly
similar
products
,
ask
at
several
places
to
get
an
idea
of
what
is
a
reasonable
price
before
starting
haggling
for
the
product
you
really
want
.
