Think
Differently
</head>
<p>
Thinking
differently
is
more
than
just
a
mind
setup
.
It
means
approaching
problems
in
new
,

innovative

ways.conceptualizing
problems
differently
and
understanding
your
position
in
relation
to
any
particular
situation
in
a
way
you
’d
never
thought
of
before
.
Here
are
some
steps
to
find
out
how
we
can
achieve
this

Study
another
industry
.
Go
to
the
library
and
pick
up
a
trade
magazine
in
an
industry
other
than
your
own
,
or
grab
a
few
books
from
the
library
,
and
learn
about
how
things
are
done
in
other
industries
.
You
might
find
that
many
of
the
problems
people
in
other
industries
face
are
similar
to
the
problems
on
your
own
,
but
that
they
’ve
developed
really
quite
different
ways
of
dealing
with
them
.
Or
you
might
well
find
new
linkages
between
your
own
industry
and
the
new
one
,
linkages
that
might
well
be
the
basis
of
innovative
partnerships
in
the
future
.

Learn
about
another
religion
.
Religions
are
the
way
that
humans
organize
and
understand
their
relationships
not
only
with
the
supernatural
or
divine
but
with
each
other
.
Learning
about
how
such
relations
are
structured
can
teach
you
a
lot
about
how
people
relate
to
each
other
and
the
world
around
them
.
Starting
to
see
the
reason
in
another
religion
can
also
help
you
develop
mental
flexibility
–
when
you
really
look
at
all
the
different
ways
people
comprehend
the
same
mysteries
,
and
the
fact
that
they
generally
manage
to
survive
regardless
of
what
they
believe
,
you
start
to
see
the
limitations
of
whatever
dogma
or
doxy
you
follow
,
a
revelation
that
will
transfer
quite
a
bit
into
the
non-religious
parts
of
your
life
.

Take
a
class
.
Learning
a
new
topic
will
not
only
teach
you
a
new
set
of
facts
and
figures
,
it
will
teach
you
a
new
way
of
looking
at
and
making
sense
of
aspects
of
your
everyday
life
or
of
the
society
or
natural
world
you
live
in
.
This
in
turn
will
help
expand
both
how
you
look
at
problems
and
the
breadth
of
possible
solutions
you
can
come
up
with
.

Read
a
novel
in
an
unfamiliar
genre
.
Reading
is
one
of
the
great
mental
stimulators
in
our
society
,
but
it
’s
easy
to
get
into
a
rut
.
Try
reading
something
you
’d
never
have
touched
otherwise
–
if
you
read
literary
fiction
,
try
a
mystery
or
science
fiction
novel
;
if
you
read
a
lot
of
hard-boiled
detective
novels
,
try
a
romance
;
and
so
on
.
Pay
attention
not
only
to
the
story
but
to
the
particular
problems
the
author
has
to
deal
with
.
For
instance
,
how
does
the
fantasy
author
bypass
your
normal
skepticism
about
magic
and
pull
you
into
their
story
?
Try
to
connect
those
problems
to
problems
you
face
in
your
own
field
.
For
example
,
how
might
your
marketing
team
overcome
your
audiences
normal
reticence
about
a
new
“
miracle
”
product
?

Write
a
poem
</ref>
.
While
most
problem-solving
leans
heavily
on
our
brain
’s
logical
centers
,
poetry
neatly
bridges
our
more
rational
left-brain
though
processes
and
our
more
<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Be_Creative">
creative
</ref>
right-brain
processes
.
Though
it
may
feel
foolish
(
and
getting
comfortable
with
feeling
foolish
might
be
another
way
to
think
outside
the
box
)
,
try
writing
a
poem
about
the
problem
you
’re
working
on
.
Your
poem
does
n’t
necessarily
have
to
propose
a
solution
–
the
idea
is
to
shift
your
thinking
away
from
your
brain
’s
logic
centers
and
into
a
more
creative
part
of
the
brain
,
where
it
can
be
mulled
over
in
a
non-rational
way
.
Remember
,
nobody
has
to
ever
see
your
poem
…

<ref target="https://www.wikihow.com/wiki/Draw">
Draw
a
picture
</ref>
.
Drawing
a
picture
is
even
more
right-brained
,
and
can
help
break
your
logical
left-brain
’s
hold
on
a
problem
the
same
way
a
poem
can
.
Also
,
visualizing
a
problem
engages
other
modes
of
thinking
that
we
do
n’t
normally
use
,
bringing
you
another
creative
boost
.

Turn
it
upside
down
.
Turning
something
upside-down
,
whether
physically
by
flipping
a
piece
of
paper
around
or
metaphorically
by
re-imagining
it
can
help
you
see
patterns
that
would
n’t
otherwise
be
apparent
.
The
brain
has
a
bunch
of
pattern-making
habits
that
often
obscure
other
,
more
subtle
patterns
at
work
;
changing
the
orientation
of
things
can
hide
the
more
obvious
patterns
and
make
other
patterns
emerge
.
For
example
,
you
might
ask
what
a
problem
would
look
like
if
the
least
important
outcome
were
the
most
important
,
and
how
you
’d
then
try
to
solve
it
.

Work
backwards
.
Just
like
turning
a
thing
upside
down
,
working
backwards
breaks
the
brain
’s
normal
conception
of
causality
.
This
is
the
key
to
backwards
planning
,
for
example
,
where
you
start
with
a
goal
and
think
back
through
the
steps
needed
to
reach
it
until
you
get
to
where
you
are
right
now
.
<figure rend="Think Different Step 8.jpg">

Ask
a
child
for
advice
.
Do
n’t
buy
into
the
notion
that
children
are
inherently
ore
creative
before
society
“
ruins
”
them
,
but
children
can
think
and
speak
with
an
ignorance
of
convention
that
is
often
helpful
.
Ask
a
child
how
they
might
tackle
a
problem
,
or
if
you
do
n’t
have
a
child
around
think
about
how
you
might
reformulate
a
problem
so
that
a
child
could
understand
it
if
one
was
available
.
Do
n’t
run
out
and
build
a
boat
made
out
of
cookies
because
a
child
told
you
to
,
though
–
the
idea
is
n’t
to
do
what
the
child
says
,
necessarily
,
but
to
jog
your
own
thinking
into
a
more
unconventional
path
.

Invite
randomness
.
If
you
’ve
ever
seen
video
of
Jackson
Pollock
painting
,
you
have
seen
a
masterful
painter
consciously
inviting
randomness
into
his
work
.
Pollock
exercises
a
great
deal
of
control
over
his
brushes
and
paddles
,
in
the
service
of
capturing
the
stray
drips
and
splashes
of
paint
that
make
up
his
work
.
Embracing
mistakes
and
incorporating
them
into
your
projects
,
developing
strategies
that
allow
for
random
input
,
working
amid
chaotic
juxtapositions
of
sound
and
form
–
all
of
these
can
help
to
move
beyond
everyday
patterns
of
thinking
into
the
sublime
.

Take
a
shower
.
</ref>
There
’s
some
kind
of
weird
psychic
link
between
showering
and
creativity
.
Who
knows
why
?
Maybe
it
’s
because
your
mind
is
on
other
things
,
maybe
it
’s
because
you
’re
naked
,
maybe
it
’s
the
warm
water
relaxing
you
–
it
’s
a
mystery
.
But
a
lot
of
people
swear
by
it
.
So
maybe
when
the
status
quo
response
to
some
circumstance
just
is
n’t
working
,
try
taking
a
shower
and
see
if
something
remarkable
does
n’t
occur
to
you
!
