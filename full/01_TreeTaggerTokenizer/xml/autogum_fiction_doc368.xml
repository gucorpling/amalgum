CHAPTER
XXIV
</head>
<p>
On
the
morning
of
the
twenty-sixth
Duane
rode
into
Bradford
in
time
to
catch
the
early
train
.
His
wounds
did
not
seriously
incapacitate
him
.
Longstreth
was
with
him
.
And
Miss
Longstreth
and
Ruth
Herbert
would
not
be
left
behind
.
They
were
all
leaving
Fairdale
for
ever
.
Longstreth
had
turned
over
the
whole
of
his
property
to
Morton
,
who
was
to
divide
it
as
he
and
his
comrades
believed
just
.
Duane
had
left
Fairdale
with
his
party
by
night
,
passed
through
Sanderson
in
the
early
hours
of
dawn
,
and
reached
Bradford
as
he
had
planned
.
</p>
<p>
That
fateful
morning
found
Duane
outwardly
calm
,
but
inwardly
he
was
in
a
tumult
.
He
wanted
to
rush
to
Val
Verde
.
Would
Captain
MacNelly
be
there
with
his
rangers
,
as
Duane
had
planned
for
them
to
be
?
Memory
of
that
tawny
Poggin
returned
with
strange
passion
.
Duane
had
borne
hours
and
weeks
and
months
of
waiting
,
had
endured
the
long
hours
of
the
outlaw
,
but
now
he
had
no
patience
.
The
whistle
of
the
train
made
him
leap
.
</p>
<p>
It
was
a
fast
train
,
yet
the
ride
seemed
slow
.
</p>
<p>
Duane
,
disliking
to
face
Longstreth
and
the
passengers
in
the
car
,
changed
his
seat
to
one
behind
his
prisoner
.
They
had
seldom
spoken
.
Longstreth
sat
with
bowed
head
,
deep
in
thought
.
The
girls
sat
in
a
seat
near
by
and
were
pale
but
composed
.
Occasionally
the
train
halted
briefly
at
a
station
.
The
latter
half
of
that
ride
Duane
had
observed
a
wagon-road
running
parallel
with
the
railroad
,
sometimes
right
alongside
,
at
others
near
or
far
away
.
When
the
train
was
about
twenty
miles
from
Val
Verde
Duane
espied
a
dark
group
of
horsemen
trotting
eastward
.
His
blood
beat
like
a
hammer
at
his
temples
.
The
gang
!
He
thought
he
recognized
the
tawny
Poggin
and
felt
a
strange
inward
contraction
.
He
thought
he
recognized
the
clean-cut
Blossom
Kane
,
the
black-bearded
giant
Boldt
,
the
red-faced
Panhandle
Smith
,
and
Fletcher
.
There
was
another
man
strange
to
him
.
Was
that
Knell
?
No
!
it
could
not
have
been
Knell
.
</p>
<p>
Duane
leaned
over
the
seat
and
touched
Longstreth
on
the
shoulder
.
</p>
<p>
“
Look
!
”
he
whispered
.
Cheseldine
was
stiff
.
He
had
already
seen
.
</p>
<p>
The
train
flashed
by
;
the
outlaw
gang
receded
out
of
range
of
sight
.
</p>
<p>
“
Did
you
notice
Knell
was
n't
with
them
?
”
whispered
Duane
.
</p>
<p>
Duane
did
not
speak
to
Longstreth
again
till
the
train
stopped
at
Val
Verde
.
</p>
<p>
They
got
off
the
car
,
and
the
girls
followed
as
naturally
as
ordinary
travelers
.
The
station
was
a
good
deal
larger
than
that
at
Bradford
,
and
there
was
considerable
action
and
bustle
incident
to
the
arrival
of
the
train
.
</p>
<p>
Duane
's
sweeping
gaze
searched
faces
,
rested
upon
a
man
who
seemed
familiar
.
This
fellow
's
look
,
too
,
was
that
of
one
who
knew
Duane
,
but
was
waiting
for
a
sign
,
a
cue
.
Then
Duane
recognized
him
--
MacNelly
,
clean-shaven
.
Without
mustache
he
appeared
different
,
younger
.
</p>
<p>
When
MacNelly
saw
that
Duane
intended
to
greet
him
,
to
meet
him
,
he
hurried
forward
.
A
keen
light
flashed
from
his
eyes
.
He
was
glad
,
eager
,
yet
suppressing
himself
,
and
the
glances
he
sent
back
and
forth
from
Duane
to
Longstreth
were
questioning
,
doubtful
.
Certainly
Longstreth
did
not
look
the
part
of
an
outlaw
.
</p>
<p>
“
Duane
!
Lord
,
I
'm
glad
to
see
you
,
”
was
the
Captain
's
greeting
.
Then
at
closer
look
into
Duane
's
face
his
warmth
fled
--
something
he
saw
there
checked
his
enthusiasm
,
or
at
least
its
utterance
.
</p>
<p>
“
MacNelly
,
shake
hand
with
Cheseldine
,
”
said
Duane
,
low-voiced
.
</p>
<p>
The
ranger
captain
stood
dumb
,
motionless
.
But
he
saw
Longstreth
's
instant
action
,
and
awkwardly
he
reached
for
the
outstretched
hand
.
</p>
<p>
“
Any
of
your
men
down
here
?
”
queried
Duane
,
sharply
.
</p>
<p>
“
No.
They
're
up-town
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Come
.
MacNelly
,
you
walk
with
him
.
We
've
ladies
in
the
party
.
I
'll
come
behind
with
them
.
”
</p>
<p>
They
set
off
up-town
.
Longstreth
walked
as
if
he
were
with
friends
on
the
way
to
dinner
.
The
girls
were
mute
.
MacNelly
walked
like
a
man
in
a
trance
.
There
was
not
a
word
spoken
in
four
blocks
.
</p>
<p>
Presently
Duane
espied
a
stone
building
on
a
corner
of
the
broad
street
.
There
was
a
big
sign
,
“
Rancher
's
Bank
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
There
's
the
hotel
,
”
said
MacNelly
.
“
Some
of
my
men
are
there
.
We
've
scattered
around
.
”
</p>
<p>
They
crossed
the
street
,
went
through
office
and
lobby
,
and
then
Duane
asked
MacNelly
to
take
them
to
a
private
room
.
Without
a
word
the
Captain
complied
.
When
they
were
all
inside
Duane
closed
the
door
,
and
,
drawing
a
deep
breath
as
if
of
relief
,
he
faced
them
calmly
.
</p>
<p>
“
Miss
Longstreth
,
you
and
Miss
Ruth
try
to
make
yourselves
comfortable
now
,
”
he
said
.
“
And
do
n't
be
distressed
.
”
Then
he
turned
to
his
captain
.
“
MacNelly
,
this
girl
is
the
daughter
of
the
man
I
've
brought
to
you
,
and
this
one
is
his
niece
.
”
</p>
<p>
Then
Duane
briefly
related
Longstreth
's
story
,
and
,
though
he
did
not
spare
the
rustler
chief
,
he
was
generous
.
</p>
<p>
“
When
I
went
after
Longstreth
,
”
concluded
Duane
,
“
it
was
either
to
kill
him
or
offer
him
freedom
on
conditions
.
So
I
chose
the
latter
for
his
daughter
's
sake
.
He
has
already
disposed
of
all
his
property
.
I
believe
he
'll
live
up
to
the
conditions
.
He
's
to
leave
Texas
never
to
return
.
The
name
Cheseldine
has
been
a
mystery
,
and
now
it
'll
fade
.
”
</p>
<p>
A
few
moments
later
Duane
followed
MacNelly
to
a
large
room
,
like
a
hall
,
and
here
were
men
reading
and
smoking
.
Duane
knew
them
--
rangers
!
