In
parting
remarks
made
after
a
three-day
visit
to
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Kenya">
Kenya

late
on
Wednesday
,
former
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/UN">
UN
</ref>
chief
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Kofi_Annan">
Kofi
Annan

warned
that
the
country
risks
returning
to
ethnic
clashes
if
reforms
are
not
implemented
.

&quot;
My
conversations
with
Kenyans
during
the
last
three
days
have
underscored
that
there
is
a
crisis
of
confidence
in
Kenya
's
political
leadership
,
&quot;
Annan
said
.
&quot;
Only
Kenya
's
politicians
can
solve
that
crisis
.
I
urge
them
to
listen
to
the
voices
of
Kenyans
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Annan
said
that
he
had
noted
some
progress
on
the
reform
agenda
but
warned
that
time
was
running
out
.
</p>
<p>
Politically-fueled
ethnic
tensions
flared
up
in
early
2008
following
a
disputed
presidential
election
,
plunging
Kenya
into
weeks
of
deadly
turmoil
.
</p>
<p>
Flown
in
to
mediate
the
crisis
,
Annan
led
the
two
sides
to
a
power-sharing
agreement
that
made
incumbent
candidate
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Mwai_Kibaki">
Mwai
Kibaki
</ref>
president
and
his
rival
,
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Raila_Odinga">
Raila
Odinga
</ref>
,
prime
minister
.
The
deal
brought
an
end
to
the
clashes
,
but
has
resulted
in
a
bloated
coalition
government
unchallenged
by
a
real
political
opposition
.
</p>
<p>
As
part
of
the
agreement
between
the
two
principle
rivals
,
the
new
government
agreed
to
undergo
a
far-reaching
reform
agenda
to
prevent
the
tensions
from
boiling
over
in
the
next
election
.
Critics
claim
that
the
government
has
not
followed
through
on
its
commitments
,
an
accusation
the
government
strongly
denies
.
</p>
<p>
“
Kenya
is
already
at
—
or
past
—
the
halfway
mark
between
the
formation
of
the
Coalition
Government
and
the
next
electoral
cycle
.
Kenya
cannot
afford
a
recurrence
of
the
crisis
and
violence
that
engulfed
it
after
the
2007
election
.
But
that
is
a
serious
risk
if
tangible
reform
is
not
achieved
,
”
Annan
said
,
warning
that
the
government
's
term
is
already
halfway
expired
and
the
2012
elections
are
quickly
approaching
.
</p>
<p>
Overshadowing
the
former
UN
chief
's
remarks
was
a
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/BBC">
BBC
</ref>
report
released
on
Wednesday
that
claimed
that
ethnic
groups
in
the
regions
most
hit
by
the
2008
violence
are
now
stockpiling
guns
to
prepare
for
2012
.
</p>
<p>
The
2008
conflict
,
the
nation
's
worst
since
its
independence
more
than
45
years
ago
,
was
carried
out
chiefly
by
machete-wielding
gangs
in
the
slums
and
in
the
affected
rural
areas
by
tribal
militias
armed
primarily
with
spears
and
bows
and
arrows
.
</p>
<p>
Hassan
Omar
,
vice
chairman
of
the
Kenyan
National
Commission
on
Human
Rights
,
said
that
his
group
has
also
received
reports
about
groups
purchasing
firearms
but
has
as
yet
been
unable
to
independently
verify
the
claims
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
The
allegations
are
becoming
more
and
more
credible
,
&quot;
Omar
said
.
&quot;
The
Kenya
National
Commission
[
on
Human
Rights
]
did
have
these
allegations
,
and
we
had
not
necessarily
undertaken
the
time
of
investigation
or
documentation
towards
proving
their
existence
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
According
to
the
private
fears
expressed
by
a
senior
parliamentary
official
,
another
flare-up
similar
to
the
2008
turmoil
has
the
potential
to
fragment
the
nation
into
regional
power-centers
run
by
tribal
warlords
,
given
the
country
's
current
political
climate
and
simmering
ethnic
tensions
.
</p>
<p>
However
,
Kenyan
cabinet
minister
William
Ruto
,
a
political
leader
of
one
of
the
ethnic
groups
named
by
the
BBC
report
for
buying
the
guns
,
dismissed
the
claims
as
rumors
.
&quot;
The
people
making
these
allegations
should
either
come
forward
with
substance
to
their
claims
,
or
they
should
shut
up
,
&quot;
said
Ruto
;
&quot;
I
do
n't
think
rumor
mongering
is
going
to
take
this
country
anywhere
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_States">
United
States
</ref>
has
threatened
fifteen
senior
Kenyan
officials
with
travel
bans
if
the
reform
process
is
perceived
as
continuing
to
stall
.
