Digital
Twins
emergence
is
an
endeavor
to
create
intelligent
adaptive
machines
by
generating
a
parallel
virtual
version
of
the
system
along
with
the
connectivity
and
analytical
capabilities
enabled
by
IoT
.
The
Digital
Twin
technology
is
moving
towards
creating
a
digital
representation
of
a
real-world
object
(
e.
g.
,
a
car
,
a
machine
tool
,
a
factory
,
a
person
)
and
the
spatio-temporal
relations
between
the
objects
represented
by
a
subgraph
of
nodes
and
edges
.
<figure>
Figure

</figure>
illustrates
this
concept
.
For
example
,
a
car
“
T37BTT
”
is
represented
by
multiple
nodes
and
edges
in
a
subgraph
,
of
which
its
nodes
represent
the
car
’s
CAD
design
,
the
service
records
,
its
current
state
(
where
it
is
,
its
speed
,
etc.
)
,
and
its
manufacturing
information
(
where
it
was
produced
,
by
which
machines
,
etc.
)
.

Building

in

a
BIM
IFC

existing
in
the
Victorian
Government
Digital

platform

It
enables
the
Digital
Twin
users
to
access
different
physical
elements
of
the
building
(
e.
g.
,
ceiling
,
wall
,
roof
,
window
)
as
well
as
its
cadastral
(

)
information
.
Similar
to
the
abovementioned
car
“
T37BTT
”
example
,
the
nodes
of
a
building
can
consist
of
CAD
floor
plans
,
utility

,
occupancy/ownership/spaces/

information
,
and

Several
researchers
have
already
worked
on
integrating
BIM
and
IoT
;
however
,
this
research
domain
is
still
in
nascent
stages
.
Isikdag
proposed
an
architecture
,
based
on
GIS
,
for
integration
and
visualization
of
information
coming
from
BIM
objects
and
IoT
nodes
.
Rowland
proposed
an
informational
city
model
including
BIM
geometry
,
real-time
data
via
IoT
,
multiplayer
online
gaming
based
platform
and
an
Augmented
Reality
interface
.
Teizer
et
al.
focused
on
an
IoT
approach
that
integrates
environmental
and
localization
data
in
a
cloud-based
BIM
platform
,
aiming
at
making
performance
,
environmental
and
localization
data
of
workers
available
in
an
indoor
work
environment
.
Dave
et
al.
proposed
a
framework
for
integrating
BIM
and
IoT
using
open
standards
to
provide
information
about
energy
usage
,
occupancy
and
user
comfort
.
Tanga
et
al.
provided
an
in-depth
review
of
BIM
and
IoT
devices
integration
in
the
AEC
industry
from
domain
application
and
integration
methodologies
perspectives
.
</p>
<p>
Smart
buildings
are
predicated
on
the
appropriate
integration
of
IoT
datasets
and
3D
BIM
models
.
IoT
devices
could
collect
data
during
the
construction
(
structure
monitoring
)
and
operation
(
energy
meters
)
.
The
purpose
of
these
devices
is
to
monitor
the
health
and
safety
of
the
building
which
will
benefit
all
occupants
.
Integration
of
BIM
and
IoT
has
been
adopted
and
used
for
various
applications
.
These
include
construction
operation
and
monitoring
,
health
and
safety
management
,
construction
logistics
and
management
,
facility
management
,
energy
management
,
and
disaster
and
emergency
response
services
.
Here
,
we
will
review
the
recent
investigations
and
initiatives
that
studied
the
integration
of
IoT
datasets
and
3D
BIM
models
for
supporting
smart
building
management
in
different
application
domains
.
</p>
<p>
In
the
construction
operation
and
monitoring
domain
,
the
integration
of
BIM
and
IoT
datasets
provides
new
opportunities
to
integrate
real-time
datasets
such
as
environmental
data
and
localization
data
to
support
management
and
operations
of
construction
activities
.
Since
incorporating
data
sourced
from
IoT
sensors
into
BIM
models
can
facilitate
real-time
exchange
and
communication
of
data
,
monitoring
construction
activities
would
benefit
from
this
in
several
aspects
including
on-site
monitoring
of
the
construction
environment
,
monitoring
of
resources
and
labor
behaviors
,
real-time
communication
and
collaboration
,
and
monitoring
progress
and
performance
of
construction
activities
.
</p>
<p>
In
terms
of
health
and
safety
management
,
IoT
datasets
are
considered
valuable
for
smart
monitoring
of
activities
related
to
health
and
safety
aspects
.
On
the
other
hand
,
BIM
models
include
a
rich
repository
of
information
related
to
building
components
,
which
provide
the
right
context
for
the
datasets
sourced
from
IoT
devices
.
Two
major
applications
of
integrating
BIM
and
IoT
datasets
for
managing
health
and
safety
aspects
include
development
of
health
and
safety
training
systems
to
track
the
location
of
trainers
,
trainees
,
materials
and
equipment
,
and
on-site
monitoring
of
health
and
safety
by
providing
real-time
data
query
,
identifying
risks
as
well
as
visualizing
and
notifying
them
inside
the
BIM
models
.
</p>
<p>
In
construction
logistics
and
management
domain
,
the
combination
of
BIM
and
IoT
datasets
provide
significant
improvements
in
automating
prefabrication
and
lean
construction
.
BIM
and
IoT
devices
such
as
RFID
tags
are
useful
for
tracking
,
visualization
and
automatic
assembly
in
prefabricated
manufacturing
.
In
terms
of
lean
construction
,
BIM
coupled
with
IoT
can
facilitate
the
assessment
of
work
progress
,
constraints
and
productivity
by
providing
a
reliable
basis
for
information
flow
.
Various
investigations
showed
that
integration
of
IoT
datasets
and
BIM
models
would
enable
real-time
information
sharing
,
fostering
communication
between
humans
and
machines
throughout
the
entire
supply
chain
and
the
building
lifecycle
.
Despite
the
benefits
,
there
are
some
limitations
in
the
studies
that
looked
at
the
integration
of
BIM
and
IoT
for
construction
logistics
and
management
.
These
limitations
include
;
1
)
Information
overload
due
to
a
large
amount
of
data
2
)
Frameworks
and
solutions
are
conceptual
or
prototypical
ones
that
only
work
in
the
laboratory
environment
,
and
3
)
Proposed
prototypical
solutions
are
not
realizable
in
real-world
projects
due
to
the
conservative
attitudes
in
the
construction
industry
.
