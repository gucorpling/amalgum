I
deeply
regret
my
comments
I
made
last

Israelis
</ref>
and
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Palestine">
Palestinians
</ref>
.
They
do
not
reflect
my
heart-felt
belief
that
peace
will
come
to
the

Middle
East

only
when
all
parties
recognize
the
need
for
mutual
respect

tolerance

May
that
day
come
soon

Remember

are
occupied
and
it
's
their
land
.
It
's
not
Germany
,
it
's
not
Poland
,
&quot;
and
that
Israelis
should
&quot;
get
the
hell
out
of
Palestine

and
&quot;
they
should
go
home
&quot;
to
Poland

the
US

&quot;
everywhere
else

Two

she
asked

,
&quot;
Mr.

,
when
are
you
going
to
get
out

Why
are
you
continuing

die
there

What
is
the
real
excuse
?
And
do

they
'll
all
come
here

ended

a
signature
&quot;

always
issued
a
caveat

&quot;
In

as
good
as
your
last
story
