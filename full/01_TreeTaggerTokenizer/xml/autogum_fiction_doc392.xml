CHAPTER
VI
</head>
<p>
He
stayed
away
,
after
this
,
for
a
year
;
he
visited
the
depths
of
Asia
,
spending
himself
on
scenes
of
romantic
interest
,
of
superlative
sanctity
;
but
what
was
present
to
him
everywhere
was
that
for
a
man
who
had
known
what
<hi rend="italic">
he
</hi>
had
known
the
world
was
vulgar
and
vain
.
The
state
of
mind
in
which
he
had
lived
for
so
many
years
shone
out
to
him
,
in
reflexion
,
as
a
light
that
coloured
and
refined
,
a
light
beside
which
the
glow
of
the
East
was
garish
cheap
and
thin
.
The
terrible
truth
was
that
he
had
lost
--
with
everything
else
--
a
distinction
as
well
;
the
things
he
saw
could
n't
help
being
common
when
he
had
become
common
to
look
at
them
.
He
was
simply
now
one
of
them
himself
--
he
was
in
the
dust
,
without
a
peg
for
the
sense
of
difference
;
and
there
were
hours
when
,
before
the
temples
of
gods
and
the
sepulchres
of
kings
,
his
spirit
turned
for
nobleness
of
association
to
the
barely
discriminated
slab
in
the
London
suburb
.
That
had
become
for
him
,
and
more
intensely
with
time
and
distance
,
his
one
witness
of
a
past
glory
.
It
was
all
that
was
left
to
him
for
proof
or
pride
,
yet
the
past
glories
of
Pharaohs
were
nothing
to
him
as
he
thought
of
it
.
Small
wonder
then
that
he
came
back
to
it
on
the
morrow
of
his
return
.
He
was
drawn
there
this
time
as
irresistibly
as
the
other
,
yet
with
a
confidence
,
almost
,
that
was
doubtless
the
effect
of
the
many
months
that
had
elapsed
.
He
had
lived
,
in
spite
of
himself
,
into
his
change
of
feeling
,
and
in
wandering
over
the
earth
had
wandered
,
as
might
be
said
,
from
the
circumference
to
the
centre
of
his
desert
.
He
had
settled
to
his
safety
and
accepted
perforce
his
extinction
;
figuring
to
himself
,
with
some
colour
,
in
the
likeness
of
certain
little
old
men
he
remembered
to
have
seen
,
of
whom
,
all
meagre
and
wizened
as
they
might
look
,
it
was
related
that
they
had
in
their
time
fought
twenty
duels
or
been
loved
by
ten
princesses
.
They
indeed
had
been
wondrous
for
others
while
he
was
but
wondrous
for
himself
;
which
,
however
,
was
exactly
the
cause
of
his
haste
to
renew
the
wonder
by
getting
back
,
as
he
might
put
it
,
into
his
own
presence
.
That
had
quickened
his
steps
and
checked
his
delay
.
If
his
visit
was
prompt
it
was
because
he
had
been
separated
so
long
from
the
part
of
himself
that
alone
he
now
valued
.
</p>
<p>
It
's
accordingly
not
false
to
say
that
he
reached
his
goal
with
a
certain
elation
and
stood
there
again
with
a
certain
assurance
.
The
creature
beneath
the
sod
knew
of
his
rare
experience
,
so
that
,
strangely
now
,
the
place
had
lost
for
him
its
mere
blankness
of
expression
.
It
met
him
in
mildness
--
not
,
as
before
,
in
mockery
;
it
wore
for
him
the
air
of
conscious
greeting
that
we
find
,
after
absence
,
in
things
that
have
closely
belonged
to
us
and
which
seem
to
confess
of
themselves
to
the
connexion
.
The
plot
of
ground
,
the
graven
tablet
,
the
tended
flowers
affected
him
so
as
belonging
to
him
that
he
resembled
for
the
hour
a
contented
landlord
reviewing
a
piece
of
property
.
Whatever
had
happened
--
well
,
had
happened
.
He
had
not
come
back
this
time
with
the
vanity
of
that
question
,
his
former
worrying
&quot;
What
,
<hi rend="italic">
what
</hi>
?
&quot;
now
practically
so
spent
.
Yet
he
would
none
the
less
never
again
so
cut
himself
off
from
the
spot
;
he
would
come
back
to
it
every
month
,
for
if
he
did
nothing
else
by
its
aid
he
at
least
held
up
his
head
.
It
thus
grew
for
him
,
in
the
oddest
way
,
a
positive
resource
;
he
carried
out
his
idea
of
periodical
returns
,
which
took
their
place
at
last
among
the
most
inveterate
of
his
habits
.
What
it
all
amounted
to
,
oddly
enough
,
was
that
in
his
finally
so
simplified
world
this
garden
of
death
gave
him
the
few
square
feet
of
earth
on
which
he
could
still
most
live
.
It
was
as
if
,
being
nothing
anywhere
else
for
any
one
,
nothing
even
for
himself
,
he
were
just
everything
here
,
and
if
not
for
a
crowd
of
witnesses
or
indeed
for
any
witness
but
John
Marcher
,
then
by
clear
right
of
the
register
that
he
could
scan
like
an
open
page
.
The
open
page
was
the
tomb
of
his
friend
,
and
there
were
the
facts
of
the
past
,
there
the
truth
of
his
life
,
there
the
backward
reaches
in
which
he
could
lose
himself
.
He
did
this
from
time
to
time
with
such
effect
that
he
seemed
to
wander
through
the
old
years
with
his
hand
in
the
arm
of
a
companion
who
was
,
in
the
most
extraordinary
manner
,
his
other
,
his
younger
self
;
and
to
wander
,
which
was
more
extraordinary
yet
,
round
and
round
a
third
presence
--
not
wandering
she
,
but
stationary
,
still
,
whose
eyes
,
turning
with
his
revolution
,
never
ceased
to
follow
him
,
and
whose
seat
was
his
point
,
so
to
speak
,
of
orientation
.
Thus
in
short
he
settled
to
live
--
feeding
all
on
the
sense
that
he
once
<hi rend="italic">
had
</hi>
lived
,
and
dependent
on
it
not
alone
for
a
support
but
for
an
identity
.
