,
probably
in

<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thropton">
Thropton
</ref>
,
a
small
village
near
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rothbury">
Rothbury

and
was
described
as
a
“
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freehold_(law)">
freeholder
</ref>
”
(
i.
e.
owner
of
land
)
,
in
the
village
.
He
became
a
Jacobite
,
siding
with

James

(
also
called
the

son
of

and
some
said
rightful
heir
to

and
took
part
in
the

First
Jacobite
Rising
</ref>
(
or
Rebellion
)
.
</p>
<p>
During
this
uprising
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Carpenter,_1st_Baron_Carpenter">
General
Carpenter
</ref>
,
after
marching
his
men
and
horses
into
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland">
Scotland
</ref>
,
returned
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne">
Newcastle
</ref>
tired
and
weary
,
but
was
immediately
ordered
to
meet
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobite_risings">
Jacobite
</ref>
&quot;
rebels
&quot;
at
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancaster,_Lancashire">

He
met
the
rebels
at

Preston

,
where
the
rebels
,
after
defending
the
place
for
some
time
,
surrendered
to
the

troops

Among
the
rebels
was
Mr
James
Robson

Throston
,
who
was
imprisoned
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preston_(HM_Prison)">
Preston
Jail
</ref>
.
</p>
<p>
He
was
a
poet
,
songwriter
,
but
whether
this
was
by
natural
bent
,
or
because
of
his
incarceration
,
is
not
clear
.
It
appears
that
he
may
have
been
a
musician
,
as
many
of
the
historical
documents
describe
him
as
&quot;
a
(
or
&quot;
the
&quot;
)
leader
of
a
(
or
&quot;
the
&quot;
)
band
in
the
Pretender
’s
army
&quot;
,
and
although
these
does
not
make
clear
whether
this
means
a
&quot;
group
of
musicians
&quot;
or
just
a
&quot;
group
of
rebels
