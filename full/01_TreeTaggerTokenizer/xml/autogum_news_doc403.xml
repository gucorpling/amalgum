led
early
in
the
first
with
a
score
of
6
–
2
and
then
6
–
4
,
before

6
–

time
there
was
6:33
left
in
the
first
.
Both
teams
made
a
number
of
substitutions
in

first
quarter
and
tried
to
shoot
3-point
shots
that
they
did
not
land
.
The
Capitals
could
not
keep
their
hands
on
the
ball
,
turning
it
over
several
times
in
the
first
.
Playing
a
zone
defense
,
the
Chinese
team
appeared
to
have
better
control
on
their
side
of
the
court
when
playing
zone
defense
on
that
side
of
the
court
,
while
the
Chinese
offense
frustrated
the
Capitals
who
were
playing
man-to-man
and
appeared
to
lose
the
woman
they
were
marking
.
The
Chinese
were
also
quick
to
foul
,
allowing
Canberra
to
go
into
bonus
.
The
quarter
ended
13
–
19
thanks
to
a
last
minute
shot
by
Hunt
.

The
second
quarter
started
with
a
Canberra
possession
,
where
they
turned
over
the
ball
to
China
before
they
were
able
to
get
a
shot
up
.
Ogoke
managed
to
steal
the
ball
back
before
China
could
capitalize
on
the
turnover
.
The
Chinese
bench
started
making
noise
on
the
bench
,
cheering
and
chanting
to
support
their
teammates
on
the
court
.
The
Capitals
coach
,
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Carrie_Graf">
Carrie
Graf

,
was
very
animated
on
the
sidelines
.
Chinese
fouls
sent
Canberra
to
the
line
several
times
,
with
Norwood
scoring
a
pair
with
1:41
left
in
the
half
.
Dombkins

Contrasting
half

styles
saw

go
into

,

scored
for

,
China
took
advantage
of
a
free
throw
opportunity
to
narrow
the
score
to
39
–
37
.
Canberra
fell
apart
a
bit
,
with
Cosier
turning
over
the
ball
and
Bibby
missing
a
pass
because
she
was
out
of
position
.
Thee
Capitals
were
not
marking
players
,
leaving
the
Chinese
shooters
open
,
but
they
could
not
get
the
ball
in
the
net
.
A
3-point
shot
by

later
,

drew
a

game
face
on

scored
a

down
the
court
,
and
Hunt
did
,
scoring
2
points
to
put
her
