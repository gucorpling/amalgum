CHAPTER
II
</head>
<p>
Genevieve
and
Joe
were
working-class
aristocrats
.
In
an
environment
made
up
largely
of
sordidness
and
wretchedness
they
had
kept
themselves
unsullied
and
wholesome
.
Theirs
was
a
self-respect
,
a
regard
for
the
niceties
and
clean
things
of
life
,
which
had
held
them
aloof
from
their
kind
.
Friends
did
not
come
to
them
easily
;
nor
had
either
ever
possessed
a
really
intimate
friend
,
a
heart-companion
with
whom
to
chum
and
have
things
in
common
.
The
social
instinct
was
strong
in
them
,
yet
they
had
remained
lonely
because
they
could
not
satisfy
that
instinct
and
at
that
same
time
satisfy
their
desire
for
cleanness
and
decency
.
</p>
<p>
If
ever
a
girl
of
the
working
class
had
led
the
sheltered
life
,
it
was
Genevieve
.
In
the
midst
of
roughness
and
brutality
,
she
had
shunned
all
that
was
rough
and
brutal
.
She
saw
but
what
she
chose
to
see
,
and
she
chose
always
to
see
the
best
,
avoiding
coarseness
and
uncouthness
without
effort
,
as
a
matter
of
instinct
.
To
begin
with
,
she
had
been
peculiarly
unexposed
.
An
only
child
,
with
an
invalid
mother
upon
whom
she
attended
,
she
had
not
joined
in
the
street
games
and
frolics
of
the
children
of
the
neighbourhood
.
Her
father
,
a
mild-tempered
,
narrow-chested
,
anaemic
little
clerk
,
domestic
because
of
his
inherent
disability
to
mix
with
men
,
had
done
his
full
share
toward
giving
the
home
an
atmosphere
of
sweetness
and
tenderness
.
</p>
<p>
An
orphan
at
twelve
,
Genevieve
had
gone
straight
from
her
father
's
funeral
to
live
with
the
Silversteins
in
their
rooms
above
the
candy
store
;
and
here
,
sheltered
by
kindly
aliens
,
she
earned
her
keep
and
clothes
by
waiting
on
the
shop
.
Being
Gentile
,
she
was
especially
necessary
to
the
Silversteins
,
who
would
not
run
the
business
themselves
when
the
day
of
their
Sabbath
came
round
.
</p>
<p>
And
here
,
in
the
uneventful
little
shop
,
six
maturing
years
had
slipped
by
.
Her
acquaintances
were
few
.
She
had
elected
to
have
no
girl
chum
for
the
reason
that
no
satisfactory
girl
had
appeared
.
Nor
did
she
choose
to
walk
with
the
young
fellows
of
the
neighbourhood
,
as
was
the
custom
of
girls
from
their
fifteenth
year
.
&quot;
That
stuck-up
doll-face
,
&quot;
was
the
way
the
girls
of
the
neighbourhood
described
her
;
and
though
she
earned
their
enmity
by
her
beauty
and
aloofness
,
she
none
the
less
commanded
their
respect
.
&quot;
Peaches
and
cream
,
&quot;
she
was
called
by
the
young
men
--
though
softly
and
amongst
themselves
,
for
they
were
afraid
of
arousing
the
ire
of
the
other
girls
,
while
they
stood
in
awe
of
Genevieve
,
in
a
dimly
religious
way
,
as
a
something
mysteriously
beautiful
and
unapproachable
.
</p>
<p>
For
she
was
indeed
beautiful
.
Springing
from
a
long
line
of
American
descent
,
she
was
one
of
those
wonderful
working-class
blooms
which
occasionally
appear
,
defying
all
precedent
of
forebears
and
environment
,
apparently
without
cause
or
explanation
.
She
was
a
beauty
in
color
,
the
blood
spraying
her
white
skin
so
deliciously
as
to
earn
for
her
the
apt
description
,
&quot;
peaches
and
cream
.
&quot;
She
was
a
beauty
in
the
regularity
of
her
features
;
and
,
if
for
no
other
reason
,
she
was
a
beauty
in
the
mere
delicacy
of
the
lines
on
which
she
was
moulded
.
Quiet
,
low-voiced
,
stately
,
and
dignified
,
she
somehow
had
the
knack
of
dress
,
and
but
befitted
her
beauty
and
dignity
with
anything
she
put
on
.
Withal
,
she
was
sheerly
feminine
,
tender
and
soft
and
clinging
,
with
the
smouldering
passion
of
the
mate
and
the
motherliness
of
the
woman
.
But
this
side
of
her
nature
had
lain
dormant
through
the
years
,
waiting
for
the
mate
to
appear
.
</p>
<p>
Then
Joe
came
into
Silverstein
's
shop
one
hot
Saturday
afternoon
to
cool
himself
with
ice-cream
soda
.
She
had
not
noticed
his
entrance
,
being
busy
with
one
other
customer
,
an
urchin
of
six
or
seven
who
gravely
analyzed
his
desires
before
the
show-case
wherein
truly
generous
and
marvellous
candy
creations
reposed
under
a
cardboard
announcement
,
&quot;
Five
for
Five
Cents
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
She
had
heard
,
&quot;
Ice-cream
soda
,
please
,
&quot;
and
had
herself
asked
,
&quot;
What
flavor
?
&quot;
without
seeing
his
face
.
For
that
matter
,
it
was
not
a
custom
of
hers
to
notice
young
men
.
There
was
something
about
them
she
did
not
understand
.
The
way
they
looked
at
her
made
her
uncomfortable
,
she
knew
not
why
;
while
there
was
an
uncouthness
and
roughness
about
them
that
did
not
please
her
.
As
yet
,
her
imagination
had
been
untouched
by
man
.
The
young
fellows
she
had
seen
had
held
no
lure
for
her
,
had
been
without
meaning
to
her
.
In
short
,
had
she
been
asked
to
give
one
reason
for
the
existence
of
men
on
the
earth
,
she
would
have
been
nonplussed
for
a
reply
.
</p>
<p>
As
she
emptied
the
measure
of
ice-cream
into
the
glass
,
her
casual
glance
rested
on
Joe
's
face
,
and
she
experienced
on
the
instant
a
pleasant
feeling
of
satisfaction
.
The
next
instant
his
eyes
were
upon
her
face
,
her
eyes
had
dropped
,
and
she
was
turning
away
toward
the
soda
fountain
.
But
at
the
fountain
,
filling
the
glass
,
she
was
impelled
to
look
at
him
again
--
but
for
no
more
than
an
instant
,
for
this
time
she
found
his
eyes
already
upon
her
,
waiting
to
meet
hers
,
while
on
his
face
was
a
frankness
of
interest
that
caused
her
quickly
to
look
away
.
</p>
<p>
That
such
pleasingness
would
reside
for
her
in
any
man
astonished
her
.
&quot;
What
a
pretty
boy
,
&quot;
she
thought
to
herself
,
innocently
and
instinctively
trying
to
ward
off
the
power
to
hold
and
draw
her
that
lay
behind
the
mere
prettiness
.
&quot;
Besides
,
he
is
n't
pretty
,
&quot;
she
thought
,
as
she
placed
the
glass
before
him
,
received
the
silver
dime
in
payment
,
and
for
the
third
time
looked
into
his
eyes
.
Her
vocabulary
was
limited
,
and
she
knew
little
of
the
worth
of
words
;
but
the
strong
masculinity
of
his
boy
's
face
told
her
that
the
term
was
inappropriate
.
