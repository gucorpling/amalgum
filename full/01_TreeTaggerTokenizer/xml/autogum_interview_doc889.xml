In
chapter
10
,
&quot;
Assault
and
Battery
&quot;
,
you
recount
witnessing
instances
of
violence
by
David
Miscavige
towards
Scientology
officials
including
:
Ray
Mithoff
,
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Mike_Rinder">
Mike
Rinder
</ref>
,
and
Jeff
Hawkins
.
You
write
,
&quot;
I
am
ashamed
that
I
did
not
have
enough
courage
at
the
time
to
inform
the
authorities
or
call
the
police
,
which
would
have
been
the
logical
thing
to
do
.
&quot;
Why
do
you
think
you
decided
not
to
report
these
instances
to
the
police
?
What
do
you
think
law
enforcement
would
have
done
if
you
had
reported
the
matter
to
police
?
Knowing
what
you
know
now
,
and
revisiting
your
memories
of
these
incidents
in
hindsight
,
would
you
have
acted
differently
if
you
were
in
the
same
situation
again
?

AS
</hi>
:
As
I
mentioned
above
,
I
learned
at
an
early
age
that
Scientology
&quot;
handles
its
own
&quot;
and
that
one
of
the
biggest
crimes
you
can
commit
is
to
bring
about
bad
publicity
for
the
organization
as
that
is
directly
counter
to
the
expansion
plans
of
eradicating
the
reactive
mind
on
the
entire
planet
before
it
's
&quot;
too
late
&quot;
.
At
first
,
I
justified
the
abuse
–
making
excuses
for
why
it
could
possibly
be
occurring
.
I
thought
,
&quot;
Miscavige
is
the
head
of
the
religion
and
he
's
having
to
handle
so
much
that
all
the
stress
and
non-compliance
is
putting
him
over
the
edge
&quot;
.
But
when
it
kept
occurring
and
kept
occurring
,
I
ran
out
of
justifications
.
I
could
finally
see
that
it
was
a
pattern
of
an
abusive
sociopath
.
When
I
first
started
exposing
the
abuse
after
I
left
Scientology
,
several
of
the
Scientology
executives
who
I
used
to
work
with
put
together
sworn
affidavits
claiming
Miscavige
never
laid
a
hand
on
anyone
.
These
were
typed
up
and
signed
under
the
penalty
of
perjury
.
They
know
it
's
a
blatant
lie
,
but
they
think
they
're
defending
their
religion
by
doing
this
.
</p>
<p>
Regarding
whether
or
not
I
would
have
done
things
differently
were
I
in
the
same
situation
today
–
ABSOLUTLEY
.
I
would
have
called
the
police
.
I
would
have
filed
criminal
reports
.
I
would
have
alerted
the
authorities
that
the
head
of
the
organization
is
hurting
people
in
many
ways
and
I
would
have
gotten
the
agreement
from
my
peers
that
Miscavige
needed
to
come
off
any
position
of
authority
and
has
no
right
to
lead
in
this
fashion
.
I
know
that
I
would
have
been
removed
for
Treason
and
declared
a
suppressive
person
for
making
that
stand
,
but
I
'd
be
proud
of
the
title
because
the
one
thing
I
would
have
left
intact
is
my
personal
integrity
.
