.
The
native
Purhépecha
from
the
pueblos
near
Erongarícuaro
come
to
market
day
on
Tuesdays
.
This
ancient
town
was
one
of
the
critical
trade
points
for
the
Purhepecha
empire
.
Friendly
to
outsiders
,
Erongarícuaro
has
hosted
artists
such
as
Frida
Kahlo
and
Diego
Rivera
along
with
the
father
of
surrealism
,
Andre
Breton
,
and
Russian
revolutionary
Leon
Trotsky
.
Former

.
Today
Erongarícuaro
hosts
ex-patriots
from

History
</head>
<p>
The
pretty
colonial-era
village
of
Erongarícuaro
lies
on
the
west
side
of
the
lake
about
17km/11mi
from
Pátzcuaro
.
During
the
Second
World
War
a
group
of
French
Surrealists
found
refuge
in
Erongarícuaro
making
the
village
a
new
Left
Bank
.
Stokely
Carmichael
hid
out
here
during
the
dangerous
years
of
the
1960s
.
</p>
<p>
The
original
Purhépecha
village
of
Erongarícuaro
was
located
up
the
mountain
from
the
present
day
village
and
dates
back
around
two
thousand
years
.
See
the
Web
site
of
Dave
Haskell
,
an
archaeologist
who
has
studied
the
area
in
depth
.
(
http://www.davehaskell.com/index.html
)
.
Professor
Haskell
's
studies
indicate
pretty
clearly
that
although
Erongarícuaro
was
a
part
of
the
Purhé
Empire
,
it
was
such
an
important
village
that
it
was
relatively
independent
from
the
main
seat
of
the
empire
in
Tzintzuntzan
,
probably
due
to
its
ties
with
the
villages
on
the
Meseta
Purhépecha
to
the
west
.
