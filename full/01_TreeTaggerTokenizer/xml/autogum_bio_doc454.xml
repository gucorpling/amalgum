on

In
the
same
year
he
began
his
ministry
at
Northampton
,
and
at
once
got
into
trouble
for
his
nonconformity
,
and
was
committed
to
gaol
.
The
inhabitants
of
Northampton
petitioned
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England">
Queen
Elizabeth
</ref>
for
his
release
,
giving
him
a
high
character
as
a
preacher
and
a
loyal
subject
.
</p>
<p>
On
21
Feb.
1578
he
succeeded
Anthony
Fletcher
as
vicar
of
Holy
Trinity
,
Coventry
,
and
became
a
prominent
man
in
the
party
headed
by
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Cartwright_(Puritan)">
Thomas
Cartwright
</ref>
(
1535
–
1603
)
.
At
the
request
of
the
London
puritans
he
accompanied
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Dudley,_1st_Earl_of_Leicester">
Earl
of
Leicester
</ref>
to
represent
their
grievances
to
the
queen
.
On
the
issue
of
Whitgift
's
three
articles
(
1583
)
,
he
refused
to
subscribe
.
He
was
cited
to
Lambeth
(
1584
)
,
and
suspended
.
An
account
of
his
examination
is
given
by
Brook
,
from
Roger
Morrice
's
manuscript
.
His
place
was
taken
by
‘
one
Griffen
,
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_people">
Welchman
</ref>
,
’
between
whom
and
Fenn
,
according
to
the
manuscript
city
annals
,
there
was
‘
a
great
contention
’
for
the
vicarage
in
1584
or
1585
.
Fenn
was
restored
to
his
vicarage
shortly
after
14
July
1585
,
through
the
intercession
of
Leicester
.
But
in
1590
he
was
again
suspended
,
owing
to
the
active
part
which
he
took
in
the
‘
associations
’
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warwickshire">
Warwickshire

divines
,
was
committed
to
the
Fleet
by
the
high
commission
,
with
Cartwright
and
others
,
and
,
refusing
the
purgation
by
oath
,
was
deprived
.
</p>
<p>
His
successor
,
Richard
Eaton
,
was
instituted
on
12
Jan.
1591
.
On
13
May
Fenn
and
his
companions
were
brought
before
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star-chamber">
Star-chamber
</ref>
.
Articles
,
dealing
mainly
with
their
‘
book
of
discipline
,
’
were
exhibited
against
them
.
They
denied
that
in
their
‘
associations
’
they
exercised
any
jurisdiction
,
or
meddled
with
sedition
.
Fenn
‘
seemed
more
stiff
than
Cartwright
.
’
The
Star-chamber
remanded
them
without
bail
.
James
VI
of
Scotland
interceded
(
12
June
)
for
their
release
;
on
4
Dec.
they
petitioned
for
bail
;
Fenn
's
signature
stands
second
in
the
list
,
immediately
after
Cartwright
's
.
In
April
1592
they
again
petitioned
for
release
,
this
time
successfully
.
(
Leicester
's
letter
of
thanks
is
dated
21
May

)
</p>
<p>
Fenn
returned
to
Coventry
,
and
resumed
his
ministry
,
probably
preaching
only
on
week-days
.
On
24
April
1624
‘
Mr.
Humphrey
Fenn
,
preacher
,
’
was
appointed
to
the
Sunday
lectureship
at
St.
John
the
Baptist
's
(
Bablake
)
.
This
was
a
new
lectureship
;
the
church
,
which
had
been
in
ruins
,
was
repaired
in
1608
,
and
a
week-day
lectureship
established
in
favour
of
John
Oxenbridge
.
In
1626
or
soon
after
‘
old
Mr.
Fenn
’
joined
with
the
mayor
and
leading
citizens
in
inviting
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Clarke">
Samuel
Clarke
</ref>
(
1599
–
1683
)
,
the
martyrologist
,
to
become
a
lecturer
at
Coventry
.
This
is
the
last
notice
of
Fenn
.
Tong
says
that
he
‘
spent
above
forty
years
’
with
the
Coventry
people
;
we
must
correct
this
to
‘
above
fifty
,
’
even
if
we
deduct
his
enforced
absences
.
He
died
early
in
1633
–
4
,
and
was
buried
on
8
Feb.
in
Holy
Trinity
churchyard
,
Coventry
.
He
seems
to
have
had
a
son
and
grandson
of
the
same
name
.
</p>
<p>
His
will
,
made
in
1631
,
was
prefaced
by
‘
so
full
and
so
open
a
protestation
against
the
hierarchy
and
the
ceremonies
,
that
the
prelatical
party
would
not
suffer
it
to
be
put
among
the
records
of
the
court
when
the
will
was
tendred
to
be
proved
’

Feb.
1634
a
copy
of

Fen
the

’
was
