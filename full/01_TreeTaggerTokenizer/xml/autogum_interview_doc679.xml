If
he
's
looking
for
any
of
those
issues
to
be
addressed
by
the
Democrats
,
they
're
not
going
to
be
.
And
I
would
hope
he
could
also
see
that
we
've
got
two
people
on
the
Supreme
Court
now
that
are
,
we
hope
,
pro-life
votes
to
overturn
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe%20vs.%20Wade">
Roe
versus
Wade
</ref>
,
that
he
will
see
that
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pro-life">
pro-life
</ref>
legislation
was
passed
,
that
taxes
were
cut
.
And
what
I
would
also
say
to
him
is
that
I
think
we
also
have
to
see
that
the
system
is
built
to
spend
.
I
hear
from
Republicans
and
Independents
alike
that
the
biggest
thing
they
've
been
upset
about
,
if
you
set
aside
opinions
on
the
war
,
has
been
spending
.
And
the
system
's
just
built
to
spend
.
Whether
Republicans
or
Democrats
are
in
control
,
you
just
constantly
get
that
.
I
've
said
many
times
—
I
’ve
represented
Kansas
since
1995
--
I
have
yet
to
have
a
single
constituent
come
in
my
office
and
say
,
&quot;
Hey
,
we
're
getting
too
much
Federal
money
;
would
you
please
cut
it
?
&quot;
I
get
all
the
time
people
saying
,
&quot;
Look
,
I
'm
a
conservative
,
but
we
need
this
bridge
,
we
need
this
subsidy
,
we
need
this
hospital
.
”
And
the
system
's
just
built
to
spend
.
That
's
why
you
've
gotta
change
the
system
,
and
I
've
been
pushing
aggressively
,
taking
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base%20Realignment%20and%20Closure,%202005">
BRAC
military
base
closing
commission
</ref>
process
they
'll
use
for
military
bases
and
applying
it
to
the
rest
of
government
.
So
you
've
got
an
actual
culling
process
that
you
're
regularly
requiring
Congress
to
vote
on
.
Because
you
've
just
got
to
change
the
system
of
its
spending
proclivities
.

When

Well
,
that
presumes
I
'm
taking
that
step

what
we
're

</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
You
've
discussed
it
,
and
I
'm
just
wondering
when
it
's
a
thought
that
occurs
to
you
--
not
an
inevitability
--
-just
when
you
think
about
it
as
a
possibility
,
how
do
you
feel
when
you
reflect
upon
it
?

You
know
,
what
I
've
said
is
that
if
we
do
n't
finish
fourth
or
better
in
Iowa
that
we
'll
pull
out
.
And
I
think
you
just
--
if
you
look
at
it
in
that
context
,
and
I
do
,
and
this
is
a
fabulous
country
,
it
's
a
great
honor
to
be
running
for
President
,
sharing
big
ideas
with
the
country
,
and
what
a
great
place
,
that
a
guy
can
grow
up
on
a
farm
in
Eastern
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Kansas">
Kansas
</ref>
and
run
for
President
of
the
United
States
.
I
love
a
country
like
that
.

No
,
I
feel
the
great
honor
of
putting
ideas
out
there
,
and
we
continue
to
do
it
.
We
're
giving
a
big
speech
on
Sunday
in
Boston
,
and
we
're
going
to
talk
there
about
the
expansion

the
