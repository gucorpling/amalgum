Be
precise
but
flexible
when
inviting
family
members
.
In
too
many
situations
,
hosts
can
be
overly
unclear
on
arriving
times
,
or
they
can
be
too
strict
.
The
best
thing
to
do
is
create
a
window
of
time
that
is
appropriate
for
a
guest
to
arrive
at
your
house
.

Do
n't
make
all
the
food
yourself
.
Ask
a
person
in
each
family
unit
to
prepare
a
dish
.
If
they
are
famous
for
a
certain
dish
in
your
family
,
ask
them
to
make
that
.
Keep
an
even
balance
between
appetizers
,
entrees
,
and
desserts
.

Decide
what
parts
of
your
house
are
off-limits
.
Inform
each
person
as
they
walk
in
your
door
,
and
if
you
feel
the
need
,
make
signs
and
tape
them
to
doors
of
off-limits
areas
.

Keep
children
in
mind
.
Chances
are
that
small
children
may
be
running
around
your
house
,
and
since
the
adults
will
most
likely
going
to
be
occupied
,
leave
out
some
child-friendly
toys
and
activities
in
a
common
space
,
like
a
living
room
.
These
items
could
be
:

Privately
tell
an
older
child
,
minimum
age
12
,
that
they
need
to
keep
an
eye
on
younger
kids
.
This
will
retain
order
in
rooms
where
there
is
not
constant
adult
supervision
.
You
can
include
a
small
monetary
incentive
,
like
$
2
per
hour
.
Remind
them
not
to
be
too
“
bossy
”
and
to
simply
resolve
small
quarrels
and
retrieve
adult
help
in
case
of
problems
on
a
bigger
scale
,
like
physical
fighting
or
injuries
.
This
also
gives
a
preteen
a
sense
of
importance
,
which
is
always
good
.

Purchase
assorted
crackers
,
chips
,
cheeses
and
dips
.
Display
them
nicely
on
a
coffee
table
or
in
a
dining
room
.
This
can
be
a
common
space
where
all
guests
are
allowed
,
which
gives
them
an
opportunity
to
converse
and
bond
,
which
is
the
goal
of
your
party
.

Create
an
adult
dinner
table
and
a
kid
's
dinner
table
.
Chances
are
that
you
will
not
have
room
for
all
family
members
to
dine
together
in
the
same
room
,
so
the
practical
thing
to
do
is
seat
the
children
in
the
kitchen
and
the
adults
in
the
formal
dining
room
.
Remember
to
check
in
on
the
kids
occasionally
.

Finally
,
say
goodbye
to
all
your
guests
as
they
leave
your
house
.
This
may
be
the
last
impression
they
have
of
you
for
a
while
,
and
you
never
know
when
you
will
see
them
again
.
