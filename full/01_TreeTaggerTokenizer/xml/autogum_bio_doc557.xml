was
an

painter
who

of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Renaissance">

</ref>
.
</p>
<p>
While
many
surviving
paintings
have
been
attributed
,
there
is
very
little
known
of
him
from
records
,
and
he
tended
not
to
sign
his
work
.
He
is
believed
to
be
responsible
for
mainly
religious
art
,
but
also
painted
portraits
on
commission
.
He
sometime
painted
from
classical
sources
,
often
setting
the
figures
in
modern-dress
,
or
a
contemporary
domestic
setting
.

In
his
lifetime
he
was
successful
;
he
had
a
large
workshop
,
his
work
was
sold
internationally
and
he
was
especially
popular
in
Spain

became
popular

a
source

who

In
particular
his
many
variations
of
the
Magdalen
and

were
further
copied

Although
Ambrosius
Benson
(
or
Ambrose
Benzone
,
as
he
is
named
by
an
early
scholar
in
deference
to
his
Lombardian
origin
)
was
Italian
by
birth
,
scholars
consider
him
a
painter
of
the
Flemish
school
.

Typical
of

time
,
he
moved
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruges">

Benson
came
into
dispute
with
Gerard
around
1519
,
over
a
number
of
paintings
and
drawings
Benson
had
created
-including
a
book
of
studies
for
heads
and
nudes
as
well
as
various
patterns-
in
the
older
master
's
workshop
without
his
assistance
.
David
refused
to
return
the
material
,
and
after
Benson
pursued
him
legally
,
served
time
in
prison
for
his
appropriation
.
