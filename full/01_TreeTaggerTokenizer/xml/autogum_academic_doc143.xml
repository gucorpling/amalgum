Discussion
:
The
Risks
of
Unsustainability
and
the
Conflicts
between
Culture
and
Tourism
</head>
<p>
The
analysis
of
the
recovery
strategies
of
the
city
centre
of
Porto
and
the
evolution
of
its
socio-economic
dynamics
evidence
some
conflicts
that
may
jeopardize
the
sustainability
of
the
relation
between
culture
and
tourism
.
This
could
be
especially
problematic
if
we
consider
the
dependency
that
the
city
has
on
its
cultural
capital
.
This
dependency
is
notorious
,
considering
the
importance
that
culture
had
in
the
process
of
the
physical
,
functional
and
symbolic
recovery
of
the
city
.
Among
the
most
important
actions
are
:
firstly
,
efforts
made
to
achieve
the
distinction
of
a
World
Heritage
Site
by
UNESCO
in
1996
;
secondly
,
the
construction
of
new
cultural
equipment
and
the
improvements
of
the
infrastructure
,
carried
out
through
the
European
Capital
of
Culture
initiative
in
2001
;
and
thirdly
,
using
tourism
,
culture
and
leisure
as
development
vectors
for
the
revitalization
of
Porto
’s
city
centre
.
In
fact
,
according
to
the
SRU-Porto
Vivo
Masterplan
,
Porto
’s
culture
,
based
on
the
“
city
’s
traditions
,
history
and
festivals
,
represented
in
their
traditional
form
or
with
a
greater
contemporary
influence
”
,
has
been
essential
for
the
renovation
project
of
the
city
.
As
a
result
,
together
with
other
already
mentioned
measures
and
the
strong
growth
of
low-cost
travel
at
the
global
scale
,
Porto
is
now
an
important
urban
tourist
destination
.
As
a
consequence
,
Porto
in
general
,
and
its
centre
in
particular
,
is
now
heavily
influenced
by
tourism
in
all
areas
.
</p>
<p>
The
equilibrium
between
tourism
,
culture
and
urbanism
in
the
city
centre
of
Porto
may
be
in
danger
because
of
the
overuse
of
its
touristic
function
and
the
loss
of
its
residential
function
.
That
is
precisely
what
the
ICOMOS
report
of
2018
pointed
out
:
<hi rend="italic">
“
</hi>
<hi rend="italic">
Local
residents
and
traders
are
expropriated
,
and
the
buildings
are
replaced
by
hotels
,
car
parks
,
shops
and
luxury
apartments
,
while
the
World
Heritage
Committee
recommended
to
deal
with
the
issue
of
depopulation
as
soon
as
the
city
integrated
the
World
Heritage
List
.
The
population
of
the
historic
Centre
of
the
city
of
Porto
has
decreased
by
more
than
50
%
since
then
</hi>
<hi rend="italic">
”
</hi>
(

)
.
To
these
warnings
,
we
add
all
the
collected
data
which
show
that
the
transformations
experienced
by
the
city
of
Porto
are
similar
to
those
verified
in
many
other
cities
that
have
a
stake
in
urban
recovery
based
on
tourism
and
culture
,
and
are
oriented
towards
international
markets
and
short-term
returns
.
In
fact
,
Porto
’s
trajectory
is
similar
to
that
of
Lisbon
or
Barcelona
,
for
example
,
although
the
scale
of
what
happened
and
the
time
that
it
took
to
happen
are
especially
difficult
to
absorb
.
Likewise
,
in
Porto
,
this
process
is
highly
concentrated
in
the
centre
of
the
city
,
which
is
the
place
where
the
major
part
of
the
tourist
attractions
are
located
.
As
a
consequence
,
its
residential
function
is
becoming
marginal
,
thus
constituting
,
in
the
face
of
processes
of
speculation
,
gentrification
and
touristification
,
a
space
of
conflict
and
claim
.
Consequently
,
the
impacts
also
seem
to
be
similar
to
those
in
these
cities
.
Among
the
main
the
main
damaging
consequences
of
“
over-tourism
”
(
i.
e.
,
an
overuse
of
the
resources
,
infrastructure
,
or
facilities
of
a
destination
or
parts
of
it
)
are
:
the
rising
costs
of
living
,
real-estate
speculation
and
the
associated
gentrification
,
congestion
of
transport
infrastructure
and
a
deterioration
of
the
local
identity
.
Furthermore
,
the
evolution
of
the
functions
of
the
city
centre
,
namely
,
the
opening
of
short-term
rentals
,
the
changes
in
street
trade
and
the
expansion
of
the
franchised
retailing
,
seem
to
indicate
that
this
place
is
being
transformed
into
a
place
of
visitor
consumption
.
These
transformations
seem
to
be
in
line
with
what
Sequera
and
Nofre
(
p.
6
)
described
as
being
the
“
new
Disneyficated
commercial
tourist
areas
”
,
which
today
characterize
the
most
central
areas
of
the
“
tourist
city
”
.
</p>
<p>
In
response
to
the
problems
generated
by
the
growing
mass
tourism
,
several
municipal
governments
are
pushing
for
specific
regulations
,
legislation
and
taxes
.
The
most
notorious
have
been
made
in
the
regulation
of
the
economic
activity
of
tourist
accommodation
platforms
,
which
currently
in
cities
such
as
Amsterdam
and
Barcelona
have
limitations
on
the
time
and
space
in
which
they
operate
.
In
the
case
of
Amsterdam
,
the
control
of
tourist
activity
has
gone
further
,
and
it
has
recently
been
announced
by
the
municipal
authorities
that
a
campaign
will
be
launched
to
dissuade
people
from
visiting
certain
parts
of
the
city
,
having
already
removed
one
of
the
tourist
icons
of
the
city
,
the
“
Iamsterdam
”
.
Another
of
the
measures
most
used
in
several
cities
,
recently
adopted
in
Porto
is
the
application
of
a
tourist
tax
per
person
and
per
night
,
whose
revenue
should
in
principle
be
used
to
minimize
the
consequences
of
tourism
growth
.
Additionally
,
in
Portugal
,
the
regulations
around
short-term
rentals
changed
at
the
end
of
2018
and
regulatory
powers
were
devolved
to
municipalities
.
Nevertheless
,
the
municipality
of
Porto
is
being
accused
by
some
social
movements
and
political
parties
of
having
a
passive
attitude
regarding
the
problems
generated
by
tourism
—
especially
those
which
affect
housing
.
