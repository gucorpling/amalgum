CHAPTER
I
</head>
<p>
It
was
four
o’clock
in
the
morning
when
George
Dupont
closed
the
door
and
came
down
the
steps
to
the
street
.
The
first
faint
streaks
of
dawn
were
in
the
sky
,
and
he
noticed
this
with
annoyance
,
because
he
knew
that
his
hair
was
in
disarray
and
his
whole
aspect
disorderly
;
yet
he
dared
not
take
a
cab
,
because
he
feared
to
attract
attention
at
home
.
When
he
reached
the
sidewalk
,
he
glanced
about
him
to
make
sure
that
no
one
had
seen
him
leave
the
house
,
then
started
down
the
street
,
his
eyes
upon
the
sidewalk
before
him
.
</p>
<p>
George
had
the
feeling
of
the
morning
after
.
There
are
few
men
in
this
world
of
abundant
sin
who
will
not
know
what
the
phrase
means
.
The
fumes
of
the
night
had
evaporated
;
he
was
quite
sober
now
,
quite
free
from
excitement
.
He
saw
what
he
had
done
,
and
it
seemed
to
him
something
black
and
disgusting
.
</p>
<p>
Never
had
a
walk
seemed
longer
than
the
few
blocks
which
he
had
to
traverse
to
reach
his
home
.
He
must
get
there
before
the
maid
was
up
,
before
the
baker
’s
boy
called
with
the
rolls
;
otherwise
,
what
explanation
could
he
give
?
--
he
who
had
always
been
such
a
moral
man
,
who
had
been
pointed
out
by
mothers
as
an
example
to
their
sons
.
</p>
<p>
George
thought
of
his
own
mother
,
and
what
she
would
think
if
she
could
know
about
his
night
’s
adventure
.
He
thought
again
and
again
,
with
a
pang
of
anguish
,
of
Henriette
.
Could
it
be
possible
that
a
man
who
was
engaged
,
whose
marriage
contract
had
actually
been
signed
,
who
was
soon
to
possess
the
love
of
a
beautiful
and
noble
girl
--
that
such
a
man
could
have
been
weak
enough
and
base
enough
to
let
himself
be
trapped
into
such
a
low
action
?
</p>
<p>
He
went
back
over
the
whole
series
of
events
,
shuddering
at
them
,
trying
to
realize
how
they
had
happened
,
trying
to
excuse
himself
for
them
.
He
had
not
intended
such
a
culmination
;
he
had
never
meant
to
do
such
a
thing
in
his
life
.
He
had
not
thought
of
any
harm
when
he
had
accepted
the
invitation
to
the
supper
party
with
his
old
companions
from
the
law
school
.
Of
course
,
he
had
known
that
several
of
these
chums
led
“
fast
”
lives
--
but
,
then
,
surely
a
fellow
could
go
to
a
friend
’s
rooms
for
a
lark
without
harm
!
</p>
<p>
He
remembered
the
girl
who
had
sat
by
his
side
at
the
table
.
She
had
come
with
a
friend
who
was
a
married
woman
,
and
so
he
had
assumed
that
she
was
all
right
.
George
remembered
how
embarrassed
he
had
been
when
first
he
had
noticed
her
glances
at
him
.
But
then
the
wine
had
begun
to
go
to
his
head
--
he
was
one
of
those
unfortunate
wretches
who
cannot
drink
wine
at
all
.
He
had
offered
to
take
the
girl
home
in
a
cab
,
and
on
the
way
he
had
lost
his
head
.
</p>
<p>
Oh
!
What
a
wretched
thing
it
was
.
He
could
hardly
believe
that
it
was
he
who
had
spoken
those
frenzied
words
;
and
yet
he
must
have
spoken
them
,
because
he
remembered
them
.
He
remembered
that
it
had
taken
a
long
time
to
persuade
her
.
He
had
had
to
promise
her
a
ring
like
the
one
her
married
friend
wore
.
Before
they
entered
her
home
she
had
made
him
take
off
his
shoes
,
so
that
the
porter
might
not
hear
them
.
This
had
struck
George
particularly
,
because
,
even
flushed
with
excitement
as
he
was
,
he
had
not
forgotten
the
warnings
his
father
had
given
him
as
to
the
dangers
of
contact
with
strange
women
.
He
had
thought
to
himself
,
“
This
girl
must
be
safe
.
It
is
probably
the
first
time
she
has
ever
done
such
a
thing
.
”
</p>
<p>
But
now
George
could
get
but
little
consolation
out
of
that
idea
.
He
was
suffering
intensely
--
the
emotion
described
by
the
poet
in
the
bitter
words
about
“
Time
’s
moving
finger
having
writ
.
”
His
mind
,
seeking
some
explanation
,
some
justification
,
went
back
to
the
events
before
that
night
.
With
a
sudden
pang
of
yearning
,
he
thought
of
Lizette
.
She
was
a
decent
girl
,
and
had
kept
him
decent
,
and
he
was
lonely
without
her
.
He
had
been
so
afraid
of
being
found
out
that
he
had
given
her
up
when
he
became
engaged
;
but
now
for
a
while
he
felt
that
he
would
have
to
break
his
resolution
,
and
pay
his
regular
Sunday
visit
to
the
little
flat
in
the
working-class
portion
of
Paris
.
</p>
<p>
It
was
while
George
was
fitting
himself
for
the
same
career
as
his
father
--
that
of
notary
--
that
he
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
young
working
girl
.
It
may
not
be
easy
to
believe
,
but
Lizette
had
really
been
a
decent
girl
.
She
had
a
family
to
take
care
of
,
and
was
in
need
.
There
was
a
grandmother
in
poor
health
,
a
father
not
much
better
,
and
three
little
brothers
;
so
Lizette
did
not
very
long
resist
George
Dupont
,
and
he
felt
quite
virtuous
in
giving
her
sufficient
money
to
take
care
of
these
unfortunate
people
.
Among
people
of
his
class
it
was
considered
proper
to
take
such
things
if
one
paid
for
them
.
</p>
<p>
All
the
family
of
this
working
girl
were
grateful
to
him
.
They
adored
him
,
and
they
called
him
Uncle
Raoul
(
for
of
course
he
had
not
been
so
foolish
as
to
give
them
his
true
name
)
.
