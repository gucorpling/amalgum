No
,
it
is
useless
.
There
is
no
human
help
for
me
;
I
must
fight
this
out
single-handed
.
Two
courses
lie
before
me
.
I
might
become
this
woman
's
lover
.
Or
I
must
endure
such
persecutions
as
she
can
inflict
upon
me
.
Even
if
none
come
,
I
shall
live
in
a
hell
of
apprehension
.
But
she
may
torture
me
,
she
may
drive
me
mad
,
she
may
kill
me
:
I
will
never
,
never
,
never
give
in
.
What
can
she
inflict
which
would
be
worse
than
the
loss
of
Agatha
,
and
the
knowledge
that
I
am
a
perjured
liar
,
and
have
forfeited
the
name
of
gentleman
?

<p>
Pratt-Haldane
was
most
amiable
,
and
listened
with
all
politeness
to
my
story
.
But
when
I
looked
at
his
heavy
set
features
,
his
slow
eyes
,
and
the
ponderous
study
furniture
which
surrounded
him
,
I
could
hardly
tell
him
what
I
had
come
to
say
.
It
was
all
so
substantial
,
so
material
.
And
,
besides
,
what
would
I
myself
have
said
a
short
month
ago
if
one
of
my
colleagues
had
come
to
me
with
a
story
of
demonic
possession
?
Perhaps
.
I
should
have
been
less
patient
than
he
was
.
As
it
was
,
he
took
notes
of
my
statement
,
asked
me
how
much
tea
I
drank
,
how
many
hours
I
slept
,
whether
I
had
been
overworking
much
,
had
I
had
sudden
pains
in
the
head
,
evil
dreams
,
singing
in
the
ears
,
flashes
before
the
eyes
--
all
questions
which
pointed
to
his
belief
that
brain
congestion
was
at
the
bottom
of
my
trouble
.
Finally
he
dismissed
me
with
a
great
many
platitudes
about
open-air
exercise
,
and
avoidance
of
nervous
excitement
.
His
prescription
,
which
was
for
chloral
and
bromide
,
I
rolled
up
and
threw
into
the
gutter
.
</p>
<p>
No
,
I
can
look
for
no
help
from
any
human
being
.
If
I
consult
any
more
,
they
may
put
their
heads
together
and
I
may
find
myself
in
an
asylum
.
I
can
but
grip
my
courage
with
both
hands
,
and
pray
that
an
honest
man
may
not
be
abandoned
.

April
10
.
It
is
the
sweetest
spring
within
the
memory
of
man
.
So
green
,
so
mild
,
so
beautiful
!
Ah
,
what
a
contrast
between
nature
without
and
my
own
soul
so
torn
with
doubt
and
terror
!
It
has
been
an
uneventful
day
,
but
I
know
that
I
am
on
the
edge
of
an
abyss
.
I
know
it
,
and
yet
I
go
on
with
the
routine
of
my
life
.
The
one
bright
spot
is
that
Agatha
is
happy
and
well
and
out
of
all
danger
.
If
this
creature
had
a
hand
on
each
of
us
,
what
might
she
not
do
?
</p>
<p>
April
16
.
The
woman
is
ingenious
in
her
torments
.
She
knows
how
fond
I
am
of
my
work
,
and
how
highly
my
lectures
are
thought
of
.
So
it
is
from
that
point
that
she
now
attacks
me
.
It
will
end
,
I
can
see
,
in
my
losing
my
professorship
,
but
I
will
fight
to
the
finish
.
She
shall
not
drive
me
out
of
it
without
a
struggle
.
</p>
<p>
I
was
not
conscious
of
any
change
during
my
lecture
this
morning
save
that
for
a
minute
or
two
I
had
a
dizziness
and
swimminess
which
rapidly
passed
away
.
On
the
contrary
,
I
congratulated
myself
upon
having
made
my
subject
(
the
functions
of
the
red
corpuscles
)
both
interesting
and
clear
.
I
was
surprised
,
therefore
,
when
a
student
came
into
my
laboratory
immediately
after
the
lecture
,
and
complained
of
being
puzzled
by
the
discrepancy
between
my
statements
and
those
in
the
text
books
.
He
showed
me
his
note-book
,
in
which
I
was
reported
as
having
in
one
portion
of
the
lecture
championed
the
most
outrageous
and
unscientific
heresies
.
Of
course
I
denied
it
,
and
declared
that
he
had
misunderstood
me
,
but
on
comparing
his
notes
with
those
of
his
companions
,
it
became
clear
that
he
was
right
,
and
that
I
really
had
made
some
most
preposterous
statements
.
Of
course
I
shall
explain
it
away
as
being
the
result
of
a
moment
of
aberration
,
but
I
feel
only
too
sure
that
it
will
be
the
first
of
a
series
.
It
is
but
a
month
now
to
the
end
of
the
session
,
and
I
pray
that
I
may
be
able
to
hold
out
until
then
.
</p>
<p>
April
26
.
Ten
days
have
elapsed
since
I
have
had
the
heart
to
make
any
entry
in
my
journal
.
Why
should
I
record
my
own
humiliation
and
degradation
?
I
had
vowed
never
to
open
it
again
.
And
yet
the
force
of
habit
is
strong
,
and
here
I
find
myself
taking
up
once
more
the
record
of
my
own
dreadful
experiences
--
in
much
the
same
spirit
in
which
a
suicide
has
been
known
to
take
notes
of
the
effects
of
the
poison
which
killed
him
.
</p>
<p>
Well
,
the
crash
which
I
had
foreseen
has
come
--
and
that
no
further
back
than
yesterday
.
The
university
authorities
have
taken
my
lectureship
from
me
.
It
has
been
done
in
the
most
delicate
way
,
purporting
to
be
a
temporary
measure
to
relieve
me
from
the
effects
of
overwork
,
and
to
give
me
the
opportunity
of
recovering
my
health
.
None
the
less
,
it
has
been
done
,
and
I
am
no
longer
Professor
Gilroy
.
The
laboratory
is
still
in
my
charge
,
but
I
have
little
doubt
that
that
also
will
soon
go
.
