I
think
this
is
a
very
important
issue
and
I
will
do
everything
I
can
to
draw
attention
to
it
!

You
were
one
of
the
public
faces
of
the
Orange
Revolution
,
and
ended
up
becoming
a
member
of
Parliament
for
a
while
.
What
caused
you
to
throw
your
support
behind
Viktor
Yushchenko
so
publicly
,
considering
it
could
have
been
dangerous
not
only
to
your
career
,
but
your
life
?

may
[
be
able
to
solve
]
certain
problems
.
Unfortunately
,
not
always
.
I
realized
that
in
our
country
,
if
you
want
to
do
something
for
your
Motherland
–
you
should
do
it
by
yourself
;
not
hoping
that
one
day
somebody
will
hear
or
help
you
...

When
you
left
Parliament
,
you
said
,
&quot;
I
still
hope
for
real
changes
and
for
a
new
political
generation
to
come
with
the
mentality
to
work
and
not
being
corrupt
.
&quot;
What
did
you
mean
by
that
?

<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Ruslana

:
All
that
I
can
say
is
that
I
'm
not
in
policy
any
more
.
And
I
'm
very
happy
because
of
that
!
It
seemed
to
me
that
[
passing
policies
]
could
help
me
make
more
for
my
country
,
but
on
the
contrary
,
[
policy
]
just
tied
my
hands
.
I
came
into
politics
[
with
]
&quot;
[
rose-colored
]
glasses
&quot;
and
[
left
]
there
very
disappointed

When
I
was
asking
for
research
help
among
the
Ukrainian
and
Russian-speaking
Wikipedians
,
one
of
the
Russians
made
an
off-hand
comment
to
me
that
stuck
.
&quot;
<hi rend="italic">
Ukraine
is
just
a
part
of
Russia
anyway

</hi>
&quot;
When
I
asked
a
Ukrainian
Wikipedian
what
that
meant
to
him
,
he
said
it
upset
him
.
How
do
you
feel
when
you
encounter
such
attitudes
,
considering
you
also
release
your
music
to
the
Russian
market
?

After

a

I
had

I

We

One
final
political
question
,
and
this
one
relates
to
Eurovision
:
I
interviewed
past
winners
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Eurovision_'82_winner_Nicole_talks_about_'Ein_bißchen_Frieden',_her_success_and_the_Contest_today">
Nicole
</ref>
and
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Eurovision_'73_winner_Anne_Marie_David_discusses_her_four-decade_career_and_the_Contest,_past_and_present">
Anne
Marie
David
</ref>
,
and
both
seemed
to
indicate
that
&quot;
bloc
voting
&quot;
could
exist
amongst
nations
;
in
Nicole
's
case
,
she
believed
it
is
currently
occurring
,
especially
between
the
countries
of
Eastern
Europe
.
Your
song
received
votes
from
nearly
every
country
in
Europe
,
but
other
winners
were
n't
so
fortunate
,
like
the
song
from
Russia
last
year
.
Do
you
believe
&quot;
bloc
voting
&quot;
exists
between
the
countries
of
Eastern
Europe
,
and
do
you
feel
it
is
unfair
to
Western
European
performers
who
enter
the
Contest
?
