Quantitative
Evaluation
of
the
Spatial
Resolution
</head>
<p>
In
this
study
,
the
digital
image
correlation
(
DIC
)
technique
was
used
to
investigate
the
effects
of
the
accelerating
voltage
and
specimen
thickness
.
The
DIC
method
can
be
used
to
quantitatively
evaluate
small
variations
between
patterns
by
calculating
their
correlation
coefficient
.
As
the
electron
beam
is
scanned
close
to
a
grain
boundary
,
the
interaction
volumes
of
both
sides
overlap
,
which
leads
to
overlapping
Kikuchi
patterns
,
and
thus
to
a
decreased
correlation
coefficient
.
Therefore
,
this
method
can
be
used
to
determine
the
spatial
resolution
.
It
has
been
extensively
used
to
evaluate
the
physical
resolutions
of
the
EBSD
and
off-axis
TKD
methods
.
The
correlation
coefficient
can
be
expressed
as
,
where
and
denote
the
grey
scale
of
the
reference
and
sampling
pattern
at
each
position
(

)
,
respectively
.
</p>
<p>
The
middle
part
of
the
on-axis
and
off-axis
Kikuchi
patterns
have
good
qualities
;
however
,
the
boundaries
of
the
patterns
contain
considerable
noise
.
Moreover
,
a
bright
spot
is
generated
by
the
transmitted
beam
in
the
center
of
the
on-axis
Kikuchi
pattern
.
The
size
and
shape
of
the
bright
spot
can
change
during
the
scanning
.
Thus
,
if
the
whole
pattern
(
640
×
480
pixels
)
is
considered
,
the
correlation
coefficient
would
deviate
and
the
results
would
be
inaccurate
.
Therefore
,
regions
of
interest
(
ROIs
)
have
to
be
selected
to
increase
the
precision
.
Wang
et
al.
used
this
method
to
determine
the
resolution
of
the
off-axis
TKD
.
In
this
study
,
we
have
used
a
similar
approach
.
Circular
ROIs
were
chosen
for
the
off-axis
TKD
,
which
contained
the
overlapping
region
,
as
shown
in
<figure>
Figure
1
</figure>
C.
On
the
other
hand
,
annular
ROIs
were
selected
in
the
on-axis
TKD
to
ensure
that
the
boundaries
and
bright
spots
were
eliminated
while
retaining
the
overlapping
regions
(
<figure>
Figure
1
</figure>
B
)
.
In
addition
,
the
chosen
ROIs
should
be
as
large
as
possible
to
ensure
representativity
.

The
calculated
correlation
coefficients
at
a
voltage
of
30
kV
and
specimen
thickness
of
91
nm
are
presented
in
<figure>
Figure

</figure>
.
Chen
et
al.
and
Shih
et
al.
applied
a
fast
Fourier
transform
(
FFT
)
filter
to
reduce
the
noise
,
while
FFT
followed
by
inverse
FFT
were
applied
by
Wang
et
al.
to
obtain
smooth
curves
.
FFT
is
commonly
used
for
filtering
in
the
frequency
domain
;
if
a
smooth
profile
is
needed
,
the
peak
may
be
broadened
.
Therefore
,
an
average
filtering
algorithm
is
introduced
to
avoid
the
deviation
in
the
correlation
coefficient
,
which
can
smooth
profiles
in
the
spatial
domain
.
As
it
does
not
affect
the
profile
width
,
it
is
commonly
used
to
filter
out
Gaussian
noise
.
In
<figure>
Figure
2
</figure>
B
,
the
low-frequency
noise
was
removed
and
the
whole
curve
became
smoother
after
filtering
.
The
smooth
profiles
of
the
correlation
coefficients
were
summed
and
normalized
.
The
procedure
is
presented
in
previous
reports
.
With
this
approach
,
we
can
obtain
the
sum
of
the
normalized
correlation
coefficients
as
a
function
of
the
distance
(
<figure>
Figure
2
</figure>
C
)
and
the
full
width
at
half
maximum
can
be
easily
calculated
,
which
is
defined
as
the
PSR
.

Difference
in
Spatial
Resolution
between
the
On-Axis
and
Off-Axis
TKD
Methods
</head>
<p>
By
using
the
above
method
,
the
spatial
resolutions
of
the
on-axis
and
off-axis
TKD
methods
were
measured
in
the
same
SEM
at
the
same
sample
position
.
The
data
obtained
at
different
voltages
and
sample
thicknesses
are
presented
in
<figure>
Figure
3
</figure>
.
The
intensity
and
contrast
of
the
pattern
for
the
169-nm-thick
sample
were
too
low
to
identify
at
the
same
parameters
used
for
the
other
two
samples
.
Therefore
,
results
are
presented
only
for
the
two
samples
.
</p>
<p>
The
spatial
resolution
of
the
on-axis
TKD
was
better
than
that
of
the
off-axis
TKD
at
the
same
accelerating
voltage
and
thickness
;
the
largest
gap
was
8
nm
.
The
only
difference
between
the
two
configurations
was
the
intersection
angle
between
the
phosphor
screen
and
incident
beam
(
α
)
.
In
the
off-axis
TKD
,
the
intersection
angle
had
a
magnitude
of
only
a
few
degrees
,
which
led
to
a
high
gnomonic
distortion
and
low
diffraction
intensity
.
On
the
contrary
,
no
pattern
distortion
and
high
diffraction
intensity
were
observed
in
the
on-axis
TKD
because
the
angle
α
was
close
to
90
°.
Consequently
,
in
the
off-axis
TKD
,
the
probe
current
and/or
exposure
time
have
to
be
increased
to
produce
an
equivalent
pattern
quality
.
In
this
study
,
we
increased
both
current
and
exposure
time
.
Nonetheless
,
the
increase
in
current
leads
to
larger
probe
size
and
interaction
volume
,
which
inevitably
increase
the
spatial
resolution
.
Therefore
,
at
their
optimal
parameters
,
the
beam
current
used
in
the
off-axis
TKD
method
should
be
higher
than
that
in
the
on-axis
TKD
method
,
which
leads
to
a
larger
spatial
resolution
.
Similarly
,
if
we
set
equal
parameters
for
both
TKD
methods
,
the
pattern
quality
in
the
off-axis
TKD
method
would
be
worse
owing
to
its
lower
intensity
.
Therefore
,
the
spatial
resolution
of
the
off-axis
TKD
would
still
be
worse
than
that
of
the
on-axis
TKD
.
