What

They
were
just
as
you
would
find
them
in
New

where
gay
men
hang
around
and
they
have
their
music
and
their
dancing

When
I
first
became
aware
of
it
,
it
's
like
in
Iran
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmoud%20Ahmadinejad">
Ahmadinejad
</ref>
says
there
's
no
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay%20Rights%20in%20Iran">
homosexuals
in
Iran
</ref>
...
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
It
's
because
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Execution_of_two_gay_teens_in_Iran_spurs_controversy">
they
kill
them

.

Well
whatever
it
is
,
but
in
China
I
do
n't
hear
of
any
,
either
boastfully
or
with
reticence
,
the
acknowledgment
of
homosexuals
.
I
always
stayed
in
the
hotel
because
I
do
n't
have
the
language
so
I
could
n't
stay
in
a
Bed
&amp;
Breakfast
in
China
or
wherever
you
did
in
Cuba
.
You
speak
Spanish
,
you
said
.
But
I
do
not
speak
anything
.
When
I
noticed
this
,
I
would
sometimes
have
room
service
,
and
invariably
it
was
a
guy
,
sometimes
two
,
who
were
very
very
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effeminacy">
effeminate
</ref>
.
They
really
were
.
There
's
just
one
thing
about
how
free
it
could
be
.

DS

How
did
you
get
introduced
to
a
gay
bar
in
Beijing
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
GT

I
got
introduced
to
it
because
I
needed
interpreters
and
in
order
to
get
interpreters
,
I
had
people
who
were
college
students
,
Americans
,
sometimes
of
Chinese
origin
.
One
of
them
in
particular
who
went
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale%20University">
Yale
</ref>
,
who
came
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto">
Toronto
</ref>
from
Canton
as
a
young
boy
,
and
when
he
graduated
from
high
school
in
Toronto
he
went
to
Yale
and
after
graduating
at
21
,
returned
to
China
and
taught
English
in
one
of
the
high
schools
in
Beijing
.
When
I
went
it
was
very
hard
to
get
interpreters
because
anybody
who
could
speak
English
and
Chinese
was
taken
by
corporations
at
high
paying
jobs
because
all
of
these
multi-national
corporations
having
Chinese
partners
needed
interpreters
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
DS
:
Including
the
European
ones
,
right
?
English
is
the
international
language
.
</hi>

Everybody
.
Everybody
.
So
people
like
me
would
have
to
really
scratch
around
to
find
somebody
.
I
would
get
to
know
journalists
very
easily
because
I
knew
the
bureaus
.
I
could
go
to
the
<hi rend="italic">
New
York
Times
</hi>
and
they
had
a
five
or
six
man
bureau
and
some
of
the
Chinese
workers
were
there
.
&quot;
Can
I
get
somebody
to
moonlight
for
me
for
a
little
bit
?
&quot;
&quot;
Well
no
,
we
ca
n't
give
you
one
of
our
people
,
but
he
has
got
a
cousin
over
here
,
who
's
working
part-time
at
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky%20Fried%20Chicken">
Kentucky
Fried
Chicken
</ref>
and
you
can
see
him
after
&quot;
.
So
this
is
how
I
met
this
fellow
from
Yale
.
Because
he
knew
the
city
,
he
not
only
served
as
my
interpreter
when
I
had
interviews
,
but
he
took
it
upon
himself
to
escort
me
places
,
including
these
bars
and
sex
shops
.
I
'm
always
interested
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution">
prostitution
</ref>
because
that
is
really
something
that
involves
danger
.
It
involves
a
kind
of
corruption
because
everybody
abolishes
it
,
but
it
exists
.
