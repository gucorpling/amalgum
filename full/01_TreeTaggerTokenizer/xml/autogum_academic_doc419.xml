<p>
Providing
future
generations
of
professionals
with
the
skills
for
sustainable
development
relies
mainly
on
integrating
approaches
and
strategies
into
Higher
Education
Institutions
and
their
systems
.
Education
for
sustainable
development
,
when
developed
in
Higher
Education
,
should
enhance
students
to
understand
how
their
professional
activity
interacts
with
society
and
the
environment
in
order
to
identify
possible
challenges
,
risks
,
and
impacts
.
Therefore
,
Higher
Education
Institutions
should
transfer
sustainability
competences
to
the
teaching
profession
by
developing
curricula
competences
in
education
for
sustainability
,
linking
sustainability
to
both
student
learning
and
in-practice
teaching
.
It
entails
promoting
student
interaction
and
fostering
relationships
in
socialization
and
learning
.
Education
for
Sustainable
Development
is
directed
towards
promoting
the
development
of
critical
thinking
,
strategic
action
,
and
interpersonal
relationships
as
well
as
collaboration
,
personal
involvement
,
and
tolerance
for
ambiguity
,
in
which
students
accept
uncertainty
and
acknowledge
dilemmas
.
It
empowers
students
to
change
their
way
of
thinking
and
to
work
towards
a
sustainable
future
.
How
students
understand
what
they
know
and
how
they
are
progressing
as
they
develop
their
knowledge
through
reconsidering
what
they
learn
in
practice
is
a
fundamental
element
of
sustainable
education
.
</p>
<p>
Education
for
Sustainable
Development
concerns
sustainable
actions
at
all
educational
levels
,
favoring
the
development
of
competences
that
allow
people
to
think
about
their
actions
.
Competences
integrate
knowledge
,
skills
,
values
,
and
attitudes
,
and
a
competence-based
education
is
a
type
of
education
that
focuses
on
the
implementation
,
development
,
and
assessment
of
competences
.
Both
cooperative
and
reflective
learning
are
instructional
practices
that
can
activate
and
promote
sustainable-oriented
competences
.
For
example
,
reflecting
on
beliefs
,
actions
,
and
goals
are
the
foundations
of
critical
thinking
and
analysis
.
Sustainable-oriented
competences
also
promote
developing
ideas
and
applying
strategies
,
planning
and
executing
projects
,
reflecting
on
risks
,
taking
responsibility
for
motivating
others
;
all
of
which
form
the
basic
principles
of
strategic
action
.
</p>
<p>
Cooperative
learning
is
an
educational
methodology
based
on
small
(
usually
heterogeneous
)
groups
of
students
working
together
.
In
cooperative
learning
,
students
join
forces
and
share
ideas
and
resources
to
learn
something
themselves
and
encourage
other
team
members
to
learn
as
well
.
Cooperative
learning
activates
peer-to-peer
learning
,
which
is
defined
as
building
both
sustainable
knowledge
and
skills
through
interaction
.
The
five
variables
that
mediate
the
effectiveness
of
cooperative
learning
are
positive
interdependence
,
individual
accountability
,
promotive
interaction
,
the
appropriate
use
of
social
skills
,
and
group
processing
.
Cooperative
learning
relies
mainly
on
the
interdependence
of
the
students
among
each
other
,
with
the
roles
of
the
team
members
being
clearly
mapped
out
,
although
they
can
be
negotiated
.
The
students
submit
the
complete
group
task
at
the
end
of
the
lesson
and
during
the
final
group
processing
.
In
contrast
,
in
collaborative
learning
,
if
this
method
is
properly
directed
by
the
teacher
,
the
students
themselves
can
learn
to
manage
the
task
with
no
further
instruction
.
Most
important
,
in
collaborative
learning
,
each
student
is
responsible
for
their
own
individual
work
,
separately
.
In
general
,
authors
see
collaborative
learning
as
a
broader
,
more
general
concept
covering
multiple
approaches
on
peer
collaboration
,
among
which
,
for
example
,
is
cooperative
learning
.
</p>
<p>
Cooperative
physical
challenges
are
cooperative
learning
activities
that
have
a
clearly
defined
objective
and
are
posed
as
a
collective
(
team
)
challenge
in
which
the
group
,
in
the
first
stage
,
must
resolve
a
specific
problem
by
using
multiple
solutions
and
,
in
the
second
stage
,
reflect
on
the
whole
process
.
To
do
so
,
each
team
needs
not
only
to
agree
on
their
actions
as
a
group
but
,
more
importantly
,
to
consider
and
value
the
individual
characteristics
of
each
and
every
one
of
its
members
to
resolve
the
problem
posed
.
While
a
specific
response
to
completing
the
challenge
may
be
valid
for
one
team
,
it
may
not
be
for
another
.
Cooperative
physical
challenges
maximize
the
acquisition
of
competences
through
individual
cooperation
in
teamwork
,
the
intrapersonal
construction
of
professional
identity
,
and
the
definition
of
strategic
decision
actions
.

<p>
Cooperation
is
the
reciprocal
relationship
between
people
or
groups
,
which
are
characterized
by
being
heterogeneous
,
aimed
at
achieving
a
goal
through
a
common
effort
.
Cooperation
is
also
a
principle
that
can
guarantee
a
more
creative
and
sound
teaching
process
,
provided
the
teacher
and
the
student
are
involved
in
the
construction
of
knowledge
.
Cooperative
learning
is
an
educational
strategy
in
which
students
work
together
in
groups
to
achieve
a
common
goal
that
is
characterized
by
a
structure
that
promotes
positive
interdependence
between
the
group
members
.
Students
gain
both
academically
and
socially
when
they
have
opportunities
to
interact
with
others
to
accomplish
shared
goals
.
In
the
process
,
students
learn
to
communicate
effectively
by
explaining
the
experiences
in
which
they
have
been
involved
,
and
the
language
they
learn
to
use
to
explain
the
experiences
,
in
turn
,
helps
them
to
construct
new
ways
of
thinking
.
In
addition
,
if
students
are
encouraged
to
participate
in
group
discussions
,
they
demonstrate
a
more
sophisticated
level
of
discourse
and
intellectually
valuable
contributions
.
