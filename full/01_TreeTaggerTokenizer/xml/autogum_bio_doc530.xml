The
arrival
of
the
Spanish
conquerors
was
revealed
to
Tisquesusa
by
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohan_(legendary)">
mohan
</ref>
Popón
,
from
the
village
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubaque">

.
He
told
the
Muisca
ruler
that
foreigners
were
coming
and
Tisquesusa
would
die
&quot;
bathing
in
his
own
blood
&quot;
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-3">

When
Tisquesusa
was
informed
of
the
advancing
invasion
of
the
Spanish
soldiers
,
he
sent
a
spy
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suesca">
Suesca
</ref>
to
find
out
more
about
their
army
strength
,
weapons
and
with
how
many
warriors
they
could
be
beaten
.
The
<hi rend="italic">
zipa

left
the
capital
Bacatá
and
took
shelter
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nemocón">

which
directed
the
Spanish
troops
to
there
,
during
this
march
attacked
by
more
than
600
Muisca
warriors
.

When
Tisquesusa
retreated
in
his
fortified
place
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cajicá">
Cajicá
</ref>
he
allegedly
told
his
men
he
would
not
be
able
to
combat
against
the
strong
Spanish
army
in
possession
of
weapons
that
produced
&quot;
thunder
and
lightning
&quot;
.
He
chose
to
return
to
Bacatá
and
ordered
the
capital
to
be
evacuated
,
resulting
in
an
abandoned
site
when
the
Spanish
arrived
.
In
search
for
the
Muisca
ruler
the
conquistadores
went
north
to
find
Tisquesusa
in
the
surroundings
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facatativá">
Facatativá
</ref>
where
they
attacked
him
at
night
.
</p>
<p>
Tisquesusa
was
thrusted
by
the
sword
of
one
of
De
Quesada
's
soldiers
but
without
knowing
he
was
the
<hi rend="italic">
zipa
</hi>
he
let
him
go
,
after
taking
the
expensive
mantle
of
the
ruler
.
Tisquesusa
fled
hurt
into
the
mountains
and
died
of
his
wounds
there
.
His
body
was
only
discovered
a
year
later
because
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_vulture">
black
vultures
</ref>
circling
over
it
.
</p>
<p>
At
the
death
of
Tisquesusa
,
his
son
Hama
and
daughter
Machinza
hid
the
sister
of
the
<hi rend="italic">
zipa
</hi>
,
Usaca
,
in
one
of
the
settlements
on
the
Bogotá
savanna
.
When
one
of
the
conquistadors
,
Juan
María
Cortés
,
found
out
about
this
,
he
prepared
a
battle
to
gain
control
over
the
area
.
At
that
moment
,
Usaca
appeared
and
resisted
against
the
Spanish
conqueror
.
Legend
tells
that
he
dropped
his
weapons
and
fell
in
love
with
her
,
eventually
marrying
the
sister
of
Tisquesusa
and
they
were
baptised
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usaquén">
Usaquén
</ref>
,
meaning
&quot;
Land
of
the
Sun
&quot;
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chibcha_language">
Muysccubun
</ref>
.
This
formed
the
start
of
the
construction
of
a
colonial
village
,
today
part
of
the
capital
and
known
for
its
colonial
architecture
and
parks
.

Succession
to

</head>
<p>
Contrary
to
Muisca
tradition
,
where
the
eldest
son
of
the
oldest
sister
of
the
previous
ruler
would
become
the
next
<hi rend="italic">

the
reign
was
taken
over
by
Tisquesusa
's
brother
;
his
army
general
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagipa">

This
would
be
the
last
ruler
of
the
southern
Muisca
,
defeated
in
1538
and
died
of
Spanish
torture
in
early
1539
.

In
investigations
in

century
about
the
existence
of
Tisquesusa

doubt
has
been
cast
on
his
name
.

decades
after
the
events
of

.
In
his
work
he
names
