Pick
a
pet
that
you
have
enough
time
to
care
for
.
For
a
busier
lifestlye
,
you
might
want
a
neat
pet
that
does
n't
require
that
much
care
,
which
could
range
from
anything
from
a
gerbil
to
a
cat
(
this
range
will
be
narrowed
down
later
.
)
For
a
lifestyle
where
you
are
n't
away
from
home
often
and
have
plenty
of
free
time
,
you
might
want
a
dog
that
you
can
spend
plenty
of
time
with
.
When
evaluating
how
much
time
you
can
dedicate
to
a
pet
,
think
of
these
factors
:
<list type="unordered">
<item>
Do
I
travel
often
?
</item>
<item>
Do
I
want
to
spend
the
money
it
takes
on
vaccinations
and
checkups
,
is
it
worth
it
to
me
?
</item>
<item>
Will
I
be
able
to
give
my
pet
the
time
it
needs
?
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Think
about
how
much
this
pet
will
cost
.
A
parakeet
,
for
example
,
requires
a
cage
,
toys
,
treats
,
and
plenty
of
food
and
clean
water
.
You
'll
need
to
do
some
research
and
see
how
much
it
would
cost
you
,
based
on
the
pet
you
were
thinking
of
.
You
'll
also
need
to
think
about
whether
or
not
your
pet
would
need
checkups
or
feather
clippings
.
Think
about
your
money
and
your
needs
,
and
from
there
see
how
much
financial
wiggle
room
you
have
.

Find
a
pet
you
know
you
'll
really
care
about
.
Go
to
a
pet
store
and
talk
to
one
of
the
employees
about
which
pets
you
're
considering
,
and
they
can
give
you
lots
of
helpful
information
.
Mention
some
of
the
pets
you
were
thinking
of
.
If
you
were
,
for
example
,
considering
getting
some
koi
,
ask
about
the
care
they
require
.
If
you
were
considering
getting
a
ferret
,
ask
to
hold
one
and
ask
about
the
care
one
would
need
.

shelter

all
deserve
good
,
loving
homes
,
and
shelter
dogs

out

ever
known

pick
out
which
cat/bird/gerbil/rat/mouse/guinea
pig/fish/whatever
you

the
best

The
more
you
spend
time
with
your
pet
,
the
more
comfortable
it
will
be
around
you
and
the
more
trusting
it
will
become
.

It
takes
a
lot
more
steps
than
this
to
decide
on
a
bigger
pet
,
such
as
a
horse
.
If
you
are
planning
on
getting
a
big
pet
,
you
should
talk
to
local
sellers
about
the
care
of
such
a
creature
and
think
deeply
about
your
decision
.
It
will
cost
a
lot
to
effectively
care
for
larger
animals
.

It
is
crucial
that
you
take
good
care
of
your
pet
.
You

note
any
unusual
behavior
or
signs
of
pain
or
illness
and
talk
to
a
vet
right
away
.
