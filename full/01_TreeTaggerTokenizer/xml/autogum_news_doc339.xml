and

took
off
Saturday
for
the
first
time
in
more
than
half
a
century
.

<p>
Traditional
dragon
dancers
in
bright
costumes
performed
on
the
tarmac
as
three
airplanes
prepared
to
leave
Beijing
's
airport
Saturday
,
the
first
to
fly
nonstop
to
Taiwan
since
1949
.
The
ceremony
marked
the
first
of
48
charter
flights
allowed
to
operate
between
Taiwan
and
the
mainland
over
the
three-week

amid

.
This
marked
the
first
successful
direct
flight
across
the
two
sides
,
still
technically
at
war
.
</p>
<p>
The
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic%20of%20China">
Republic

</ref>
government
banned
direct
flights

Although

,
Taiwan
's
President
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chen%20Shui-bian">
Chen
Shui-bian
</ref>
has
been
reluctant
to
move
ahead
,
citing
the
possibility
that
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's%20Republic%20of%20China">
People
's
Republic
of
China
</ref>
could
disguise
troop
carriers
as
commercial
airliners
to
invade
Taiwan
.
</p>
<p>
All
normal
airline
flights
between
the
two
sides
have
to
be
routed
through
a
third
party
—
usually
Hong
Kong
—
making
a
three
hour
flight
between
Taipei
and
Shanghai
last
eight
hours
.
</p>
<p>
Taiwanese
and
mainland
airlines
are
forbidden
to
travel
into
their
respective
airspaces
,
forcing
passengers
to
change
airlines
too
.
These
restrictions
were
first
lifted
for
Chinese
New
Years
in
2003
,
but
those
flights
still
stopped
briefly
in
Hong
Kong
.

Taiwanese
legislator

John

,
the
grandson
of
former
President
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiang%20Kai-shek">
Chiang

</ref>
,
spoke
of
the
flights
'
significance
at
the
ceremony
.
</p>
<p>
Mr.
Chang
said
that
despite
differences
,
the
flights
symbolize
&quot;
the
hopes
of
the
two
sides
for
peace
,
stability
,
dialogue
and
mutual
development
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Mr.
Chang
had
been
part
of
the
group
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-Blue%20Coalition">
opposition
</ref>
lawmakers
that
helped
arrange
the
flights
.
</p>
<p>
This
year
's
flights
were
planned
after
diplomatic
negotiations
in
Macau
,
ending
on
January
15
.
They
are
aimed
to
allow
the
easy
reuniting
of
families
which
are
split
between
the
island
and
the
mainland
for
the
celebrations
.
</p>
<p>
The
ROC
government
hopes
the
flights
can
form
the
basis
for
further
negotiations
and
better
relations
with
the
People
's
Republic
of
China
.
However
,
the
PRC
,
which
is
refusing
to
deal
with
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan%20independence">
independence
</ref>
-leaning
government
of
President
Chen
,
is
less
optimistic
.
</p>
<p>
Most
of
the
passengers
taking
advantage
of
the
nonstop
flights
,
running
until
February
20
,
are
Taiwanese
businesspeople
who
work
on
the
mainland
.
</p>
<p>
Many
Taiwanese
have
lobbied
their
government
to
ease
its
ban
on
direct
air
links
,
especially
as
trade
continues
to
grow
between
the
island
and
the
mainland
,
despite
the
political
tensions
.
Mainland
Chinese
officials
this
month
said
cross-strait
trade
had
reached
a
record
$
70
billion
in
2004
.
