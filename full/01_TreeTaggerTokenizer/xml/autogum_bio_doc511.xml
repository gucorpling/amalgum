Biography
</head>
<p>
Nothing
is
known
of
his
early
life
.
A
French
origin
is
indicated
by
three
bits
of
evidence
:
his
name
,
a
dedication
he
left
in
a
manuscript
book
of
madrigals
,
in
which
he
said
he
was
of
French
nationality
,
and
a
comment
by
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padua">
Paduan
</ref>
publisher
of
his
1546
collection
of
madrigals
for
four
voices
that
he
was
French
.

During
this
period
many
musicians
from
France
and
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Countries">
Low
Countries
</ref>
came
to
Italy
after
receiving
their
early
musical
training
in
the
north
;
employment
and
patronage
prospects
were
greater
in
Italy
throughout
most
of
the
16th
century
.
</p>
<p>
Although
the
exact
events
are
not
documented
,
scholars
have
inferred
that
Boyleau
probably
spent
his
first
Italian
years
in
Venice
,
due
to
musical
influences
seen
in
his
work
as
well
as
their
publication
history
.
In
1551
he
became

(

at

he
held

he
was

Boyleau

<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Maria_presso_San_Celso">

and
he

around

Boyleau
had
long
had
close
ties
with
the
court
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_of_France,_Duchess_of_Berry">
Marguerite
of
Savoy
</ref>
,
as
evident
from
music
he
dedicated
to
Marguerite
and
her
husband
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Philibert,_Duke_of_Savoy">
Emanuele
Filiberto
</ref>
,
many
years
earlier
;
these
ties
helped
him
gain
a
post
at
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turin_Cathedral">
Turin
Cathedral
</ref>
in
1582
.
Turin
was
then
the
capital
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Savoy">

,

Boyleau
kept
this
post
until

,
but
it
is
not
known
how
long
he
lived
after
dismissal
,
or
if
he
stayed
in
Turin
.
A
payment
record
from
the
Savoy
court
in
1586
indicates
he
was
still
alive
in
that
year
.

Music
and
influence
</head>
<p>
Boyleau
wrote
both
sacred
and
secular
music
.
Everything
which
has
survived
is
vocal
,
although
some
of
his
compositions
were
later
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intabulation">
intabulated
</ref>
for
instruments
.

His
sacred
music
was
conservative
and
tended
to
be
modest
,
as
could
be
expected
for
a
musician
working
in
Milan
,
the
home
of
Cardinal
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Borromeo">
Carlo
Borromeo

,

,
unclarity

,
and
&quot;
immodesty
&quot;
were
among
the
qualities
for
which
contemporary
musicians
were
criticized
by
the
Council
)
.
He
wrote
a
book
of
motets
which
he
dedicated
to
Giovanni
da
Legge
,
the
procurator
at
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Marco_di_Venezia">
St.
Mark
's
</ref>
in
Venice
in
1544
;
he
may
have
been
seeking
a
job
there
,
the
most
prestigious
musical
institution
in
northern
Italy
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-3">
[

</ref>
After
moving
to
Milan
he
wrote
a
series
of
settings
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnificat">
Magnificat
</ref>
which
he
dedicated
to
Borromeo
.
Stylistically
these
works
are
in
conformance
with
the
dictates
of
the
Council
of
Trent
in
their
scope
,
declamation
,
and
overall
.

Boyleau

</ref>
,
published

copied
in
six
books
,
only
three
of
which

survived

His
style
spans
the
period
from
the
late
1530s

early
1540s
,
the
early
history
of
the
madrigal
,
as
it
was
practiced
in
Venice
,
to
the
1560s
,
at
which
time
composers
were
experimenting
with
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromaticism">
chromaticism

greater

Boyleau
