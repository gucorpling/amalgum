Kenyan
humanitarian
crisis
deepens
as
talks
continue

<p>
In
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Kenya">
Kenya
</ref>
,
the
government
and
opposition
have
resumed
talks
on
the
dispute
over
the
elections
that
sparked
a
month-long
wave
of
violence
.
Relief
officials
say
the
humanitarian
toll
continues
to
rise
and
are
calling
for
a
speedy
solution
.
</p>
<p>
Relief
officials
appealed
to
political
leaders
to
stabilize
security
throughout
Kenya
as
the
number
of
people
fleeing
violence
in
some
parts
of
the
country
continued
to
rise
.
</p>
<p>
A
Kenya
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Red_Cross">
Red
Cross
</ref>
spokesman
,
Tony
Mwangi
,
says
the
instability
is
aggravating
the
humanitarian
crisis
.
&quot;
There
are
a
lot
of
areas
that
require
immediate
assistance
in
the
form
of
food
as
well
as
shelter
for
freshly
displaced
people
and
this
is
mostly
in
the
western
region
of
the
country
and
a
bit
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rift%20Valley">
Rift
Valley
</ref>
,
&quot;
Mwangi
said
.
</p>
<p>
Nearly
100
people
have
been
killed
in
the
violence
in
the
past
several
days
,
mostly
in
western
Kenya
.
The
Red
Cross
says
as
a
result
the
death
toll
has
risen
to
about
1,000
and
the
number
of
homeless
has
grown
to
more
than
300,000
.
</p>
<p>
Mwangi
said
his
organization
has
provided
some
assistance
to
most
of
the
displaced
in
the
country
but
not
enough
.
He
said
security
was
an
essential
condition
for
the
efficient
distribution
of
aid
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Our
humanitarian
response
moves
a
lot
faster
when
security
is
available
.
And
while
the
Kenya
Red
Cross
have
access
to
some
of
the
areas
that
have
been
affected
the
speed
at
which
we
would
like
to
operate
is
not
the
best
,
&quot;
Mwangi
said
.
</p>
<p>
Mwangi
said
the
best
solution
is
for
the
displaced
to
be
able
to
return
home
where
they
can
receive
food
rations
while
their
homes
and
communities
are
rebuilt
.
The
camps
,
which
are
prone
to
disease
,
criminality
and
social
problems
,
are
not
a
long-term
solution
.
</p>
<p>
The
talks
aimed
at
resolving
the
Kenyan
crisis
continued
Wednesday
.
They
focused
on
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenyan%20presidential%20election,%202007">
disputed
December
elections
</ref>
that
sparked
the
violence
.
</p>
<p>
The
opposition
accuses
the
government
of
rigging
the
elections
in
order
to
install
President
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Mwai_Kibaki">

for
a
second

The
government
says
the
opposition
should
take
its
objections
to
the
courts
.

</p>
<p>
He

and
a

and

</p>
<p>
Several
hundred
business
leaders
Tuesday
announced
that
industrial
production
had
been
reduced
by
40
percent
during
the
past
month
.
Exports
had
been
hard
hit
by
the
paralysis
of
transportation
.
And
hotel
occupancy
in
tourist
areas
had
fallen
from
90
percent
to
10
percent
.
</p>
<p>
They
forecast
that
economic
growth
would
decline
by
several
percentage
points
from
its
recent
rate
of
more
than
six
percent
.
They
said
400,000
jobs
could
be
lost
in
the
next
six
months
and
the
country
could
fall
into
recession
if
the
crisis
continued
.
