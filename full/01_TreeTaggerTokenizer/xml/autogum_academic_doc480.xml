Introduction

<p>
Debilitating
,
unexplained
provoked
localized
vulvar
pain
or
vulvodynia
affects
a
significant
proportion
(
~8
%
)
of
women
and
is
epidemiologically
linked
to
a
history
of
both
seasonal
and
contact
allergies
.
Vulvar
biopsies
from
diagnosed
patients
show
increases
in
mast
cells
and
nerves
.
To
recapitulate
and
dissect
the
pathobiology
of
allergy-driven
tactile
sensitivity
and
to
inform
novel
therapies
,
we
established
mouse
models
of
allergy-driven
genital
pain
.
We
have
shown
that
contact
hypersensitivity
to
the
commonly
used
laboratory
haptens
oxazolone
(
Ox
)
on
the
labiar
skin
or
dinitrofluorobenzene
(
DNFB
)
on
the
labiar
skin
or
vaginal
canal
induces
persistent
tactile
genital
pain
and
increased
accumulation
of
mast
cells
in
the
labiar
tissues
of
outbred
,
female
ND4
mice
well
beyond
the
resolution
of
visible
inflammation
.
Chemical
depletion
of
labiar
mast
cells
reduced
Ox-driven
painful
responses
and
therapeutic
topical
administration
of
Î”-9-tetrahydrocannabinol
(
THC
)
in
the
vaginal
canal
alleviated
DNFB-induced
pain
and
reduced
numbers
of
accumulated
mast
cells
in
the
affected
tissue
.
Here
,
we
examined
the
potential
of
a
common
household
chemical
,
2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one/methylisothiazolinone
(
MI
)
,
to
induce
contact
hypersensitivity
reactions
and
consequent
allergy-driven
genital
pain
in
ND4
female
outbred
mice
.
MI
is
a
biocide
preservative
present
in
soaps
,
shampoos
,
vaginal
washes
,
household
cleaners
,
and
paints
.
Recent
evidence
suggests
that
a
significant
portion
of
people
exposed
to
MI
developed
the
capacity
for
an
allergic
response
,
showed
exacerbated
inflammatory
responses
,
and
experienced
tissue
injury
in
the
skin
or
lungs
after
exposure
.
Allergic
responses
to
MI
have
also
been
linked
to
vulvar
dermatitis
,
but
no
connections
between
such
dermatoses
and
the
later
development
of
vulvar
pain
have
been
made
in
the
published
clinical
literature
.
Recently
,
Reed
and
colleagues
identified
exposures
to
household
and
workplace
chemicals
as
a
possible
risk
factor
for
the
development
of
vulvodynia
.
Our
previously
published
mouse
models
demonstrated
the
biological
plausibility
of
the
epidemiological
link
between
chemical
exposures
and
the
development
of
genital
pain
.
However
,
a
specific
link
between
vulvodynia
and
a
known
environmental
chemical
does
not
yet
exist
.
We
suggest
that
MI
is
a
plausible
candidate
for
an
environmental
irritant/allergen
,
and
that
exposure
to
MI
might
drive
allergy-provoked
pain
.
Here
,
we
repeatedly
applied
MI
dissolved
in
saline
(
a
surrogate
for
water-based
cleansers
that
typically
contain
MI
as
a
preservative
)
topically
within
the
vaginal
canals
of
mice
and
characterized
consequent
allergic
inflammation
,
accumulation
of
mast
cells
,
and
ano-genital
sensitivity
to
pressure
.
We
also
assessed
the
effects
of
therapeutic
and
preventive
administration
of
topical
THC
treatments
in
the
vaginal
canal
on
mast
cell
abundance
and
painful
sensitivity
.
