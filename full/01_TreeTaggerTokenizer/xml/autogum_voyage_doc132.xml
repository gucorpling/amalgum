Regions

<p>
The
three
traditional
lands
of
Sweden
,
<hi rend="bold">
Götaland
</hi>
,
<hi rend="bold">
Svealand
</hi>
and
<hi rend="bold">
Norrland
</hi>
,
are
further
divided
into
25
provinces
(
<hi rend="italic">
landskap
</hi>
)
,
which
largely
define
Swedish
people
's
cultural
identity
.
</p>
<p>
The
provinces
mostly
coincide
with
the
21
counties
(
<hi rend="italic">
län
</hi>
)
,
the
mid-level
political
entities
.
The
290
municipalities
(
<hi rend="italic">
kommun
</hi>
)
,
are
the
bottom-level
political
entities
,
typically
consisting
of
a
town
or
a
city
,
and
the
surrounding
countryside
,
including
small
villages
.
Some
municipalities
used
to
hold
city
(
<hi rend="italic">
stad
</hi>
)
privileges
,
and
still
style
themselves
as
such
,
though
there
is
no
legal
distinction
.
Most
municipalities
have
their
own
visitor
centre
.
</p>
<p>
Though
Swedish
people
rarely
have
strong
feelings
for
their
country
,
most
of
them
are
patriotic
for
their
province
or
hometown
,
and
appreciate
anything
good
that
a
traveller
can
say
about
them
.

<p>
The
&quot;
Nordic
model
&quot;
of
economics
and
social
policy
was
largely
developed
by
Swedish
social
democrats
and
liberals
during
the
early
20th
century
.
The
foundation
is
a
strong
welfare
state
,
combined
with
market
economics
.
Swedish
society
,
as
it
has
become
through
this
policy
,
is
often
described
as
&quot;
folkhemmet
&quot;
,
comparing
solidarity
in
the
society
with
that
in
a
family

History
</head>
<p>
In
ancient
times
,
Sweden
was
inhabited
by
the
Suiones
(
<hi rend="italic">
svear
</hi>
)
in
<ref target="Svealand">
Svealand
</ref>
and
the
Geats
(
<hi rend="italic">
götar
</hi>
)
in
Götaland
.
Some
of
these
participated
in
Viking
expeditions
(
see
<ref target="Vikings%20and%20the%20Old%20Norse">
Vikings
and
the
Old
Norse
</ref>
)
,
and
are
said
to
have
founded
the
first
kingdoms
in
<ref target="Russia">
Russia
</ref>
.
Written
sources
from
the
Viking
Age
are
few
and
short
.
</p>
<p>
Around
AD
1000
,
Christianity
replaced
Norse
paganism
,
Suiones
and
Geats
united
under
one
king
(
probably
Olof
Skötkonung
)
,
and
the
first
cities
were
founded
;
among
them
<ref target="Sigtuna">
Sigtuna
</ref>
,
<ref target="Uppsala">
Uppsala
</ref>
and
<ref target="Skara">
Skara
</ref>
.
With
Christianity
came
written
chronicles
and
stone
architecture
,
which
have
provided
the
afterworld
with
better
historical
detail
than
earlier
remnants
.
Swedish
kings
christianized
and
annexed
<ref target="Finland">
Finland
</ref>
.
During
the
14th
and
15th
century
,
Sweden
was
a
subject
of
the
Kalmar
Union
with
Norway
and
Denmark
.
Gustav
Vasa
liberated
Sweden
from
Danish
rule
,
was
elected
as
king
in
1523
,
and
is
regarded
as
the
founder
of
modern
Sweden
.
He
also
reformed
the
church
to
Lutheran-Protestant
.
Today
's
Sweden
is
a
secular
state
with
very
few
church-goers
.
</p>
<p>
During
the
17th
century
Sweden
rose
as
a
Great
Power
,
through
several
successful
wars
(
such
as
the
<ref target="Thirty%20Years%27%20War">
Thirty
Years
'
War
</ref>
)
,
where
kings
such
as
Gustavus
Adolphus
and
Charles
X
annexed

,
<ref target="Halland">

In

early
18th
century
,
an
alliance
of
Denmark
,
Poland
and
the
<ref target="Russian%20Empire">
Russian
Empire
</ref>
defeated
Swedish
king
Charles
XII
,
marking
the
end
of
the
Swedish
Empire
.
In
1809
,
Sweden
was
again
defeated
by
Russia
,
which
annexed
Finland
.
The
country
has
been
at
peace
since
1814
;
the
country
has
a
high
peace
profile
,
with
internationally
renowned
names
such
as
Raoul
Wallenberg
,
Dag
Hammarskjöld
,
Olof
Palme
and
Hans
Blix
.
Sweden
is
a
monarchy
by
constitution
,
but
King
Carl
XVI
Gustaf
has
no
executive
power
.
</p>
<p>
Sweden
is
a
developed
post-industrial
society
with
an
advanced
welfare
state
.
The
standard
of
living
and
life
expectancy
rank
among
the
highest
in
the
world
.
Sweden
joined
the
European
Union
in
1995
,
but
decided
by
a
referendum
in
2003
not
to
commit
to
the
European
Monetary
Union
and
the
euro
currency
.
Leadership
of
Sweden
has
for
the
larger
part
of
the
20th
century
been
dominated
by
the
Social
Democratic
Party
,
which
started
out
at
the
end
of
the
19th
century
as
a
labor
movement
(
coalitions
of
centre-right
liberal/conservative
parties
held
the
power
1976
–
1982
and
2006
–
2014
)
.
</p>
<p>
Sweden
has
a
strong
tradition
of
being
an
open
,
yet
discreet
country
.
Citizens
sometimes
appear
to
be
quite
reserved
at
first
,
but
once
they
get
to
know
who
they
are
dealing
with
,
they
'll
be
as
warm
and
friendly
as
you
'd
wish
.
Privacy
is
regarded
as
a
key
item
and
many
visitors
,
for
example
mega-stars
in
various
lines
of
trade
,
have
many
times
realized
that
they
mostly
can
walk
the
streets
of
the
cities
virtually
undisturbed
.
</p>
<p>
Sweden
houses
the
Nobel
Prize
committee
for
all
the
prizes
except
the
peace
prize
,
which
is
hosted
in
Oslo
,
a
memento
of
the
Swedish-Norwegian
union
that
was
dissolved
in
1905
.
