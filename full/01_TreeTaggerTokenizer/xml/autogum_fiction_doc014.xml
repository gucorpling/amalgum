The
Prisoners
of
the
Queen
</head>
<p>
Approaching
the
gateway
of
the
Emerald
City
the
travelers
found
it
guarded
by
two
girls
of
the
Army
of
Revolt
,
who
opposed
their
entrance
by
drawing
the
knitting-needles
from
their
hair
and
threatening
to
prod
the
first
that
came
near
.
</p>
<p>
But
the
Tin
Woodman
was
not
afraid
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
At
the
worst
they
can
but
scratch
my
beautiful
nickel-plate
,
&quot;
he
said
.
&quot;
But
there
will
be
no
'
worst
,
'
for
I
think
I
can
manage
to
frighten
these
absurd
soldiers
very
easily
.
Follow
me
closely
,
all
of
you
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Then
,
swinging
his
axe
in
a
great
circle
to
right
and
left
before
him
,
he
advanced
upon
the
gate
,
and
the
others
followed
him
without
hesitation
.
</p>
<p>
The
girls
,
who
had
expected
no
resistance
whatever
,
were
terrified
by
the
sweep
of
the
glittering
axe
and
fled
screaming
into
the
city
;
so
that
our
</p>
<p>
170
travelers
passed
the
gates
in
safety
and
marched
down
the
green
marble
pavement
of
the
wide
street
toward
the
royal
palace
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
At
this
rate
we
will
soon
have
your
Majesty
upon
the
throne
again
,
&quot;
said
the
Tin
Woodman
,
laughing
at
his
easy
conquest
of
the
guards
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Thank
you
,
friend
Nick
,
&quot;
returned
the
Scarecrow
,
gratefully
.
&quot;
Nothing
can
resist
your
kind
heart
and
your
sharp
axe
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
As
they
passed
the
rows
of
houses
they
saw
through
the
open
doors
that
men
were
sweeping
and
dusting
and
washing
dishes
,
while
the
women
sat
around
in
groups
,
gossiping
and
laughing
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
What
has
happened
?
&quot;
the
Scarecrow
asked
a
sad-looking
man
with
a
bushy
beard
,
who
wore
an
apron
and
was
wheeling
a
baby-carriage
along
the
sidewalk
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Why
,
we
've
had
a
revolution
,
your
Majesty
as
you
ought
to
know
very
well
,
&quot;
replied
the
man
;
&quot;
and
since
you
went
away
the
women
have
been
running
things
to
suit
themselves
.
I
'm
glad
you
have
decided
to
come
back
and
restore
order
,
for
doing
housework
and
minding
the
children
is
wearing
out
the
strength
of
every
man
in
the
Emerald
City
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Hm
!
&quot;
said
the
Scarecrow
,
thoughtfully
.
&quot;
If
it
</p>
<p>
171
is
such
hard
work
as
you
say
,
how
did
the
women
manage
it
so
easily
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
really
do
not
know
&quot;
replied
the
man
,
with
a
deep
sigh
.
&quot;
Perhaps
the
women
are
made
of
castiron
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
No
movement
was
made
,
as
they
passed
along
the
street
,
to
oppose
their
progress
.
Several
of
the
women
stopped
their
gossip
long
enough
to
cast
curious
looks
upon
our
friends
,
but
immediately
they
would
turn
away
with
a
laugh
or
a
sneer
and
resume
their
chatter
.
And
when
they
met
with
several
girls
belonging
to
the
Army
of
Revolt
,
those
soldiers
,
instead
of
being
alarmed
or
appearing
surprised
,
merely
stepped
out
of
the
way
and
allowed
them
to
advance
without
protest
.
</p>
<p>
This
action
rendered
the
Scarecrow
uneasy
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
I
'm
afraid
we
are
walking
into
a
trap
,
&quot;
said
he
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Nonsense
!
&quot;
returned
Nick
Chopper
,
confidently
;
&quot;
the
silly
creatures
are
conquered
already
!
&quot;
</p>
<p>
But
the
Scarecrow
shook
his
head
in
a
way
that
expressed
doubt
,
and
Tip
said
:
</p>
<p>
&quot;
It
's
too
easy
,
altogether
.
Look
out
for
trouble
ahead
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
will
,
&quot;
returned
his
Majesty
.
Unopposed
they
reached
the
royal
palace
and
marched
up
the
marble
steps
,
which
had
once
been
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
&quot;
IT'S
TOO
EASY
,
ALTOGETHER
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
173
thickly
crusted
with
emeralds
but
were
now
filled
with
tiny
holes
where
the
jewels
had
been
ruthlessly
torn
from
their
settings
by
the
Army
of
Revolt
.
And
so
far
not
a
rebel
barred
their
way
.
</p>
<p>
Through
the
arched
hallways
and
into
the
magnificent
throne
room
marched
the
Tin
Woodman
and
his
followers
,
and
here
,
when
the
green
silken
curtains
fell
behind
them
,
they
saw
a
curious
sight
.
</p>
<p>
Seated
within
the
glittering
throne
was
General
Jinjur
,
with
the
Scarecrow
's
second-best
crown
upon
her
head
,
and
the
royal
sceptre
in
her
right
hand
.
A
box
of
caramels
,
from
which
she
was
eating
,
rested
in
her
lap
,
and
the
girl
seemed
entirely
at
ease
in
her
royal
surroundings
.
</p>
<p>
The
Scarecrow
stepped
forward
and
confronted
her
,
while
the
Tin
Woodman
leaned
upon
his
axe
and
the
others
formed
a
half-circle
back
of
his
Majesty
's
person
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
How
dare
you
sit
in
my
throne
?
&quot;
demanded
the
Scarecrow
,
sternly
eyeing
the
intruder
.
&quot;
Do
n't
you
know
you
are
guilty
of
treason
,
and
that
there
is
a
law
against
treason
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
The
throne
belongs
to
whoever
is
able
to
take
it
,
&quot;
answered
Jinjur
,
as
she
slowly
ate
another
caramel
.
&quot;
I
have
taken
it
,
as
you
see
;
so
just
now
I
am
the
Queen
,
and
all
who
oppose
me
are
guilty
of
</p>
<p>
174
treason
,
and
must
be
punished
by
the
law
you
have
just
mentioned
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
This
view
of
the
case
puzzled
the
Scarecrow
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
How
is
it
,
friend
Nick
?
&quot;
he
asked
,
turning
to
the
Tin
Woodman
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Why
,
when
it
comes
to
Law
,
I
have
nothing
to
,
say
&quot;
answered
that
personage
.
&quot;
for
laws
were
never
meant
to
be
understood
,
and
it
is
foolish
to
make
the
attempt
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Then
what
shall
we
do
?
&quot;
asked
the
Scarecrow
,
in
dismay
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Why
do
n't
you
marry
the
Queen
?
And
then
you
can
both
rule
,
&quot;
suggested
the
Woggle-Bug
.
</p>
<p>
Jinjur
glared
at
the
insect
fiercely
.
&quot;
Why
do
n't
you
send
her
back
to
her
mother
,
where
she
belongs
?
&quot;
asked
Jack
Pumpkinhead
.
</p>
<p>
Jinjur
frowned
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Why
do
n't
you
shut
her
up
in
a
closet
until
she
behaves
herself
,
and
promises
to
be
good
?
&quot;
enquired
Tip
.
Jinjur
's
lip
curled
scornfully
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Or
give
her
a
good
shaking
!
&quot;
added
the
Saw-Horse
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
No
,
&quot;
said
the
Tin
Woodman
,
&quot;
we
must
treat
the
poor
girl
with
gentleness
.
Let
us
give
her
all
the
Jewels
she
can
carry
,
and
send
her
away
happy
and
contented
.
