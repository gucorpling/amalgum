Know
that
the
ending
chosen
is
possibly
the
best
ending
there
is
.
Authors
work
very
hard
writing
and
rewriting
the
book
.
A
good
ending
could
even
get
them
more
reads
,
so
there
's
a
good
reason
they
chose
to
end
it
this
way
.
It
serves
the
theme
of
the
book
.

Write
your
own
ending

Still
think
the
ending
is
unfair
?
than
simply
make
your
own
ending

Rewrite

book

way
in
which
you
find
a
different
route
the
author
never
thought
of
.
It
'll
feel
better
and
you
can
always
think
of
your
version
as
the
original
one
.
You
can
also
go
and
share
it
on
different
writing
sites
that
might
enjoy
your
fanfiction
(
like
Quotev
and
Wattpad
.
)
Maybe
you
'll
even
get
published
.
