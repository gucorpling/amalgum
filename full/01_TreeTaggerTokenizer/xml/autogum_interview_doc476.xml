Interview
with
Shelley
Chaplin
.
First
of
all
,
what
position
do
you
play
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Shelley
Chaplin
:
</hi>
Usually
a
point
guard
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
(
(

<hi rend="bold">

</hi>
<hi rend="bold">

)
</hi>
Right
.
And
whenever
I
go
to
see
the
basketball
in
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Canberra">
Canberra
</ref>
,
we
pass
by
a
glass
case
.
In
the
case
is
a
guernsey
with
number
twelve
on
it
,
and
a
big
sign
that
says
that
this
was
the
guernsey
worn
by
Shelley
Chaplin
...
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Shelley
Chaplin
:
</hi>
That
's
me
!
That
's
my
...
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
(
(
</hi>
<hi rend="bold">
WN
</hi>
<hi rend="bold">
)
)
</hi>
It
's
signed
by
the
rest
of
the
team
,
if
you
look
—
press
your
nose
to
the
glass
and
look
really
close
.
How
did
that
come
to
be
there
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Shelley
Chaplin
:
</hi>
It
's
actually
the
singlet
that
I
wore
in
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/2008_Summer_Paralympics">
Beijing
</ref>
.
Usually
you
get
people
to
sign
stuff
.
Anyway
,
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Australian_Institute_of_Sport">
AIS
</ref>
just
asked
everybody
if
we
would
donate
something
[
...
]
.
I
was
n't
using
it
so
,
yeah
,
I
gave
them
that
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
(
(

<hi rend="bold">

</hi>
<hi rend="bold">
)
)
</hi>
Oh
okay
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Shelley
Chaplin
:
</hi>
I
do
n't
think
they
have
it
...
It
's
been
there
for
a
while
now
.
It
think
that
was
a
four
year
loan
or
something
like
that
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
(
(
</hi>
<hi rend="bold">
WN
</hi>
<hi rend="bold">
)
)
</hi>
I
think
it
's
been
there
for
longer
than
that
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Shelley
Chaplin
:
</hi>
It
's
been
there
for
longer
than
that
.
Or
—
it
must
be
four
years
around
about
now
.
Went
in
just
after
Beijing
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
(
(
</hi>
<hi rend="bold">
WN
</hi>
<hi rend="bold">
)
)
</hi>
So
they
'll
return
that
to
you
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Shelley
Chaplin
:
</hi>
They
'll
return
it
at
some
point
.
I
mean
,
I
like
it
.
It
's
nice
to
have
it
there
.
It
's
good
that
they
have
some
stuff
from
wheelchair
basketball
there
,
and
I
do
n't
need
it
,
so
,
yeah
.

How
did
you
get
into
playing
wheelchair
basketball
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Shelley
Chaplin
:
</hi>
After
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996%20Summer%20Paralympics">
Atlanta
Paralympics
</ref>
actually
.
There
was
a
welcome
home
parade
in
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Melbourne">
Melbourne
</ref>
.
So
I
never
knew
anything
about
wheelchair
sports
before
that
.
And
I
went
to
the
parade
,
and
I
used
to
walk
around
,
but
that
day
I
used
a
wheelchair
because
I
was
really
tired
,
and
someone
just
approached
me
and
said
&quot;
Hey
,
do
you
know
anything
about
wheelchair
sports
?
You
should
get
involved
!
&quot;
And
,
yeah
,
so
I
did
!
I
tried
everything
,
and
I
liked
basketball
the
most
.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">
(
(

<hi rend="bold">
WN
</hi>
<hi rend="bold">
)
)
</hi>
And
you
're
a
three
point
player
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Shelley
Chaplin
:
</hi>
Three
point
five
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
(
(
</hi>
<hi rend="bold">
WN
</hi>
<hi rend="bold">
)
)
</hi>
I
'd
never
seen
the
game
before
.
My
first
experience
of
it
was
when
the
Gliders
came
out
on
the
court
for
that
first
game
[
in
London
]
,
and
I
was
really
taken
with
the
sport
from
the
word
go
.
It
has
a
sort
of
grace
that
normal
basketball
lacks
.
But
otherwise
it
's
very
similar
.
