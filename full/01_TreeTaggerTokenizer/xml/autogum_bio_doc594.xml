Little
is
known
about
Jacob
Cornelisz
van
Oostsanen
's
life
.
Historians
rely
mostly
on
the
biographical
sketch
of
him
written
by
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karel_van_Mander">
Karel
van

</ref>
,
the
archives
of
Amsterdam
,
and
the

of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egmond_Abbey">
Egmond
Abbey
</ref>
,
a
Benedictine
monastery
that
commissioned
works
by
him
.
His
name
indicates
he
was
from

north

.
His
family
managed
land
in
that
area
.
A
good
impression
of
life
there
in
those
times
can
be
had
by
a
visit
to
the

His
entire
family
were

also
known
as

As

dates

,
all
of

other

such
as
death
dates

family
members
.
Similar
to
the
archival
evidence
surrounding
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frans_Hals">
Frans
Hals
</ref>
,
the
first
known
commissions
for
Jacob
Cornelisz
were
from
when
he
was
at
least
35
years
of
age
.
It
is
assumed
that
he
worked
in
a
painters
's
workshop
before
that
,
and
judging
from
his
close
copies
of
Haarlem
painting
techniques
,
this
was
possibly
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haarlem">
Haarlem
</ref>
.
</p>
<p>
He
bought
his
first
house
in
Amsterdam
in
1500
,
in
the
Kalverstraat
.
Twenty
years
later
he
bought
the
neighboring
house
.
For
this
reason
he
is
sometimes
called
Jacob
Cornelisz
van
Amsterdam
.
His
wife
is
called
a
widow
in
archives
for
the
first
time
in
1533
.
The
last
payments
made
to
him
according
to
the
Egmond
Abbey
archives
were
in
1526
–
1528
for
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retable">

In
his
earlier
years
Jacob
Cornelisz
was
under
the
influence
of
Haarlem
painter
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geertgen_tot_Sint_Jans">
Geertgen
tot
Sint
Jans
</ref>
.
The
colors
and
techniques
suggest
that
he
learned
his
craft
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haarlem">
Haarlem
</ref>
.
His
later
influence
then
became
painter
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrecht_Dürer">
Albrecht
Dürer
</ref>
.
He
may
have
gone
to
visit
him
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antwerp">
Antwerp
</ref>
in
the
1520s
.
The
painting
patterns
of
his
earlier
works
suggest
he
was
trained
as
a
woodcut
designer
or
goldsmith
.
One
of
his
first
works
was
Christ
as
a
gardener.

There
are
about
200
known
woodcuts
and
27
paintings
by
Cornelisz
.
His
prints
are
traditional
north
Netherlandish
small-scale
book
illustrations
.
Writings
are
used
to
present
the
narrative
with
actions
placed
in
the
foreground
.
</p>
<p>
Throughout
his
artistic
career
Cornelisz
's
painting
style
changed
.
At
first
he
started
as
a
late
Gothic
craftsman
under
the
influence
of
the
Haarlem
school
and
then
ended
with
a
style
presented
by
the
painting
<hi rend="italic">
Saul
and
the
Witch
of
Endor
</hi>
.
In
this
particular
painting
the
details
are
simple
,
elongated
proportions
and
a
looser
stroke
of
paint
.
Though
he
excelled
as
a
technical
painter
,
he
was
not
a
good
leader
.
He
progressed
at
presenting
contemporary
trends
in
subject-matter
and
style
.
</p>
<p>
Cornelisz
's
symbolism
was
also
conservative
as
well
.
He
painted
mostly
sacred
themes
with
traditional
iconography
in
old
and
new
combinations
in
response
to
an
event
,
such
as
the
Reformation
.
Some
of
his
works
such
as
<hi rend="italic">
Christ
as
the
Man
of
Sorrows
</hi>
(
1510
)
were
used
by
biblical
humanists
and
the
Amsterdam
oligraphy
,
who
wanted
to
defend
Catholic
orthodoxy
against
the
claims
of
early
Reformers
.
The
painting
represented
Roman
Catholic
beliefs
in
an
easily
understood
format
.
Other
paintings
such
as
<hi rend="italic">
The
Nativity
</hi>
(
1512
)
and
<hi rend="italic">
Saul
and
the
Witch
of
Endor
</hi>
were
visually
similar
to
what
the
Catholic
essays
patrons
were
writing
.
</p>
<p>
Later
in
his
life
Jacob
Cornelisz
van
Oostsanen
ran
a
workshop
with
pupils
,
like
his
son
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk_Jacobsz">
Dirk
Jacobsz
</ref>
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_van_Scorel">
Jan
van
Scorel
</ref>
did
after
him
.
In
the
workshop
,
his
assistants
helped
him
design
book
illustrations
,
woodcuts
and
stained-glass
windows
.
After
1526
Jacob
produced
only
one
known
painting
,
<hi rend="italic">
Self
Portrait
</hi>
(
1533
)
.
Scholars
were
led
to
believe
this
was
the
year
of
his
death
,
but
according
to
Dutch
historian
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I._H_van_Eeghen">
I.
H
van
Eeghen
</ref>
there
was
a
seven-year
gap
between
paintings
,
which
was
unusual
.
He
suggested
it
could
have
been
his
son
that
produced
the
<hi rend="italic">
Self
Portrait
</hi>
(
1533
)
.
</p>
<p>
Some
regard
him
as
the
last
of
the
Flemish
painters
not
to
show
an
Italian
influence
.
