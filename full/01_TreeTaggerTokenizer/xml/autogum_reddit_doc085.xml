Bad
break
up
and
I
’m
mentally
sick
?
</head>
<sp who="#Stefffwilliamshehe">
<p>
So
I
’ve
always
been
anti-social
growing
up
.
Not
many
friends
,
a
loner
,
when
I
got
to
about
9
or
10
I
stopped
being
friends
with
people
because
I
noticed
people
made
me
the
target
for
jokes
.
I
would
get
bullied
beat
up
ruled
out
.
I
got
so
used
to
it
that
in
high
school
.
I
stayed
to
myself
3
years
and
only
watched
anime
and
played
video
games
,
until
my
Senior
year
someone
told
me
I
’m
waisting
my
looks
that
I
’m
good
looking
.
I
started
going
out
with
friends
,
smoking
,
drinking
,
ran
track
my
senior
year
.
I
made
out
with
girls
,
but
did
n’t
date
or
have
sexual
intercourse
,
but
girls
whom
I
wanted
to
date
would
be
scared
off
by
me
because
I
would
get
attached
quickly
and
blow
up
there
phones
when
I
was
n’t
getting
the
attention
I
wanted
and
I
would
send
mean
messages
because
I
was
hurt
.
So
I
did
this
with
3
girls
my
senior
year
then
started
focusing
on
myself
,
I
went
to
work
at
mall
&amp;
a
call
center
my
first
year
out
of
school
then
towards
the
summer
of
2017
I
started
working
at
this
store
called
Ross
as
a
security
guard
.
My
interview
I
met
this
beautiful
girl
,
I
have
n’t
seen
any
girls
I
wanted
in
a
whole
year
so
I
tell
myself
I
’m
going
to
talk
to
her
when
I
start
workin
.
2
months
go
by
and
I
still
have
n’t
said
a
single
word
bc
im
so
shy
until
finally
I
sucked
in
air
walked
to
her
and
said
hi
.
After
that
weeks
later
we
hang
out
then
we
kiss
and
month
later
we
have
sex
(
first
time
for
me
)
and
I
have
my
first
girlfriend
.
Mind
u
I
learned
from
my
past
not
to
be
overly
emotional
so
I
would
talk
to
other
women
to
keep
my
mind
off
of
her
as
friends
.
My
first
car
breaks
down
after
a
month
of
having
it
and
I
think
my
girlfriend
is
going
to
break
up
with
me
but
she
tells
me
the
car
does
n’t
matter
it
’s
me
that
matters
and
that
’s
when
I
started
getting
attached
.
I
would
still
give
her
space
and
do
my
thing
at
work
I
ended
up
getting
a
second
job
to
get
another
car
for
us
,
but
I
felt
I
was
n’t
enough
I
would
always
tell
my
girlfriend
stuff
like
this
is
n’t
enough
money
or
why
do
people
treat
me
like
a
joke
and
I
’m
so
much
better
then
this
.
She
would
get
mad
and
feel
like
she
was
n’t
good
enough
for
me
or
say
things
like
u
think
ur
better
then
people
.
She
even
said
something
like
I
think
your
so
stuck
on
what
u
wanna
be
in
life
Bc
u
do
n’t
wanna
be
like
ur
dad
and
lost
so
you
try
to
copy
everyone
else
and
find
a
style
that
suits
you
.
I
started
crying
after
the
call
bc
she
was
right
my
mindset
is
so
negative
I
do
n’t
even
know
who
I
am
or
who
I
want
to
be
.
I
would
do
things
like
run
over
to
her
house
when
she
was
angry
at
me
and
it
make
her
furious
.
I
even
ran
to
our
job
Bc
someone
told
her
I
was
cheating
on
her
when
it
was
n’t
true
and
I
embarrassed
her
.
She
gave
me
a
second
chance
on
our
10th
month
of
being
together
to
work
on
myself
and
give
her
space
but
I
ended
up
getting
kicked
out
my
moms
and
needing
my
girlfriends
emotional
support
when
she
needed
space
she
did
n’t
wnana
see
me
and
I
was
hurt
she
kept
telling
me
to
let
her
breathe
so
she
change
for
us
so
I
kept
forcing
her
to
see
me
bc
i
needed
her
but
she
would
be
even
pushed
further
away
then
finally
one
day
I
went
nuts
and
tried
to
break
into
her
home
to
spend
time
with
her
and
tell
her
my
problems
because
I
missed
her
and
she
was
pissed
.
She
walked
out
pushed
me
away
and
go
into
a
Lyft
ride
and
told
me
she
was
done
.
She
told
me
she
was
balling
her
eyes
out
bc
i
was
n’t
that
same
guy
10
months
ago
that
I
’m
disgusting
and
she
sees
me
as
this
person
who
looks
down
on
people
and
thinks
he
’s
the
shit
.
We
argued
I
called
her
names
and
she
thinks
I
looked
down
on
her
our
whole
relationship
when
I
just
wanted
better
for
her
I
’d
tell
her
go
back
to
college
go
follow
your
dreams
and
she
’d
make
Excuses
.
Now
she
’s
telling
me
she
’s
hanging
out
with
guys
she
’s
going
back
to
school
and
traveling
.
I
’m
so
hurt
so
mad
at
myself
because
I
feel
left
behind
.
I
wanted
to
kill
myself
before
I
met
her
&amp;
I
think
I
was
mentally
unstable
before
our
relationship
and
now
I
feel
even
worse
.
Am
I
insane
am
I
a
psychopath
what
’s
wrong
with
me
?
!
!
!
!
?
!
?
!
?
I
think
I
need
to
see
a
doctor
I
’ve
been
in
my
apartment
for
2
months
have
n’t
left
begging
her
and
pleading
her
over
messages
that
I
’m
sorry
.
Idk
what
to
do
anymore
it
’s
like
she
was
my
emotional
support
and
calmed
me
down
.
WHATS
WRONG
WITH
ME
I
NEED
TO
FIGURE
IT
OUT
BEFORE
ITS
TOO
LATE
AND
IM
REALLY
THINKING
ABOUT
KILLING
MYSELF
FRIDAY

It
's
going
to
be
okay
,
just
take
a
deep
breath
.
You
seem
to
have
a
lot
of
issues
from
past
unresolved
trauma
that
is
manifesting
into
the
problems
affecting
you
today
,
before
you
can
peruse
a
stable
and
healthy
relationship
with
someone
else
you
need
to
work
on
the
relationship
you
have
with
yourself
.
I
think
it
would
definitely
be
in
your
best
interest
to
start
seeing
a
therapist
,
and
there
's
absolutely
nothing
wrong
with
that
.
I
see
a
therapist
and
having
a
shrink
has
honestly
helped
me
so
much
.
You
should
n't
peruse
a
relationship
right
now
,
just
wait
until
you
feel
comfortable
enough
with
yourself
and
therapy
could
really
help
you
with
this
.
