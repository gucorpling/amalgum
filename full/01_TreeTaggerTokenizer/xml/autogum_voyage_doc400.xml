Finnmark
covers
an
area
about
the
size
of
countries
like
Slovakia
,
Switzerland
or
Denmark
.
From
west
to
east
it
is
almost
1000
km
,
comparable
to
the
distance
from
London
to
Edinburgh
.
A
large
part
of
the
county
consists
of
the
<hi rend="italic">
Finnmarksvidda
</hi>
plateau
at
about
300
to
500
meters
above
sea
level
.
Finnmark
's
rugged
coastline
totals
about
6800
km
if
islands
are
included
(
more
than
the
coastline
of
Spain
or
Chile
)
.
The
municipality
of
Kautokeino
is
about
10,000
square
kilometers
(
4
times
the
size
of
Luxembourg
)
with
a
population
of
less
than
3,000
.
Almost
10
%
of
Kautokeino
's
area
is
lake
surface
.
In
total
there
are
well
over
100,000
lakes
in
Finnmark
.
</p>
<p>
In
Eastern
Finnmark
the
borders
of
Finland
,
Norway
and
Russia
coincide
,
with
no
less
than
three
different
time
zones
within
a
few
steps
.
Finnmark
is
the
northernmost
as
well
as
the
easternmost
part
of
Scandinavia
.

Finnmark
is
Norway
's
coldest
area
,
but
temperatures
varies
over
the
county
.
The
interior
has
a
continental
climate
with
winter
temperatures
down
to
-40°C/F
(
record
-50°C
)
,
while
summers
can
be
warm
.
Karasjok
for
instance
has
an
<hi rend="italic">

average
at

The
coast
has
chilly
summers
,
and
winters
that
are
not
so
cold
but
windy
(
the
open
sea
is
ice
free
in
winter
)
.
The
town
of
Vardø
has
an
Arctic
climate
,
as
even
July
has
a
monthly
average
at
9°C
,
like
most
of
the
outer
coastline
of
Finnmark
.

History
</head>
<p>
Finnmark
was
largely
destroyed
during
<ref target="World%20War%20II%20in%20Europe">
World
War
II
</ref>
.
The
eastern
part
of
Finnmark
was
on
the
front
between
Soviet
Union
and
Germany
;
fierce
fighting
took
place
east
of
the
small
town
of
Kirkenes
,
which
was
subjected
to
more
than
300
bombing
raids
.
When
the
occupying
forces
retreated
to
Troms
,
they
applied
a
scorched
earth
strategy
,
where
virtually
every
home
,
church
,
factory
,
bridge
and
telegraph
pole
was
destroyed
.
The
population
was
relocated
by
force
to
Tromsø
and
further
south
.
The
result
was
a
vast
no-man
's
land
about
twice
the
size
of
Belgium
(
similar
tactics
was
applied
across
the
border
in
Northern
Finland
)
.
Kirkenes
and
eastern
Finnmark
was
liberated
by
the
Soviet
army
1944
,
the
Soviets
retreated
in
1945
.
Some
20,000
residents
refused
to
relocate
and
endured
the
winter
in
tunnels
,
caves
and
makeshift
lodgings
.
The
county
was
quickly
rebuilt
after
the
war
,
virtually
no
building
older
than
1945
exist
.
</p>
<p>
Finnmark
was
for
centuries
Norway
's
frontier
.
The
very
northern
regions
of
Norway
,
Sweden
,
Finland
and
Russia
was
largely
a
common
area
without
clear
boundaries
until
1826
.
Along
with
the
Sami
people
and
Norwegians
there
are
also
Kven
people
of
Finnish
origin
in
Finnmark
.
There
have
been
close
connections
across
the
border
to
Finland
and
Russia
.
Trade
with
the
Pomors
of
Russia
even
resulted
in
a
local
pidgin
language
that
mixed
elements
of
Russian
and
Norwegian
,
as
well
as
words
from
English
,
French
,
Sami
and
other
languages
.

and
there
is

Sami
is
a
family
of
languages
and
the
northern
variant
spoken
in
Finnmark
and
Troms
is
the
most
common
.
Sami
languages
are
also
spoken
in
Finland
,
Russia
and
Sweden
.
As
in
rest
of
Norway
,
English
proficiency
is
good
.
Signs
are
often
with
Sami
names
in
addition
to
Norwegian
names
,
for
instance
<ref target="Kautokeino">
Kautokeino
</ref>
is
spelled
Guovdageaidnu
in
Sami
.
In
Eastern
Finnmark
around
Kirkenes
,
Russian
is
used
on
signs
and
also
spoken
.
Well
over
10
%
of
the
population
in
Kirkenes
are
Russians
.

<p>
Finnmark
is
located
on
the
very
north
of
the
Fenno-Scandinavian
landmass
,
just
north
of
Finland
.
Mode
of
transport
and
route
is
therefore
important
.
Overland
transport
is
very
time
consuming
from
most
places
,
including
South
Scandinavia
.
For
a
brief
visit
air
transport
is
usually
the
only
realistic
option
.
Overland
transport
from
South
Scandinavia
and
the
European
mainland
is
fastest
and
easiest
–
but
less
scenic
–
through
Sweden
and
Finland
.
The
shortest
road
from
for
instance
Hamburg
to
North
Cape
is
about
2800
km
(
1700
miles
)
,
more
than
30
hours
non-stop
driving
.
There
is
a
single
border
crossing
from
Russia
near
Kirkenes
(
note
that
this
is
an
outer
border
of
Schengen
)
.
There
is
no
rail
network
