<p>
But
what
set
me
on
the
past
to
exposing
the
abuse
within
Scientology
the
most
was
when
my
mother
was
forced
to
disconnect
from
me
,
per
Scientology
's
&quot;
disconnection
&quot;
policy
where
members
are
to
cut
all
ties
with
anyone
not
in
good
standing
with
their
&quot;
church
&quot;
.
This
was
a
very
emotionally
traumatic
situation
.
In
my
view
,
no
religion
worthy
of
the
title
should
have
a
right
to
stand
between
loved
ones
.

Quite
early
on
in
the
book
's
first
chapter
,
you
recount
an
incident
of
being
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Rape">
raped
</ref>
at
age
14
,
by
a
35-year-old
married
man
who
was
your
Scientology
supervisor
.
You
describe
how
your
&quot;
Scientology
Ethics
Officer
&quot;
found
out
,
said
you
were
in
a
&quot;
state
of
treason
&quot;
,
and
that
the
incident
was
kept
quiet
and
not
reported
to
the
police
by
Scientology
officials
.
How
difficult
was
it
to
include
this
in
the
book
?
For
what
reason
did
you
choose
to
include
this
?
Why
did
n't
you
tell
your
parents
about
this
?

AS

:
To
me
,
it
was
very
important
to
include
this
information
in
my
book
because
it
gives
the
reader
an
idea
of
how
Scientology
operates
.
One
of
the
worst
crimes
you
can
commit
as
a
Scientologist
is
bringing
about
&quot;
bad
public
relations
&quot;
for
them
.
Things
that
happen
internally
are
KEPT
internal
with
the
&quot;
we
handle
our
own
&quot;
doctrine
.
Unfortunately
,
this
was
a
CRIME
for
which
that
person
could
have
been
arrested
.
Instead
,
it
was
&quot;
handled
&quot;
by
the
local
staff
(
swept
under
the
carpet
)
and
forgotten
about
.
I
did
n't
tell
my
parents
because
I
was
ashamed
and
afraid
.

After
describing
your
arrival
at
the
Scientology
&quot;
Flag
Land
Base
&quot;
in
Florida
at
age
16
,
you
recall
how
you
met
and
became
intimate
with
a
26-year-old
man
named
David
Paul
,
who
later
became
your
husband
.
For
this
act
,
you
were
subjected
to
a
&quot;
security
check
&quot;
process
on
the
Scientology
device
,
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-meter">
E-meter
</ref>
,
and
ordered
to
serve
time
performing
manual
labor
on
the
controversial
&quot;
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehabilitation%20Project%20Force">
Rehabilitation
Project
Force
</ref>
&quot;
(
RPF
)
of
Scientology
.
Is
16
a
relatively
young
age
to
be
sentenced
to
the
Rehabilitation
Project
Force
in
Scientology
?
Did
you
know
other
individuals
on
this
program
that
were
younger
than
you
,
or
around
the
same
age
?
</hi>

<p>
<hi rend="bold">
AS
</hi>
:
Yes
,
16
is
a
young
age
to
be
sentenced
to
the
Rehabilitation
Project
Force
.
I
should
have
been
attending
school
as
per
the
agreement
with
my
mother
when
she
gave
parental
consent
for
me
to
join
the
Sea
Organization
–
but
I
factually
never
saw
one
day
of
school
after
I
joined
.
There
were
other
teen-agers
on
the
RPF
at
the
same
time
,
but
I
believe
I
was
the
youngest
.
