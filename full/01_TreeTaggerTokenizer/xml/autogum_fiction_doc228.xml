THE
LETTER
IN
THE
CHAPS
</head>
<p>
Though
hours
may
drag
themselves
into
the
past
so
sluggishly
that
one
is
fairly
maddened
by
the
snail
's
pace
of
them
,
into
the
past
they
must
go
eventually
.
Jean
had
sat
and
listened
to
the
wheels
of
the
Golden
State
Limited
clank
over
the
cryptic
phrase
that
meant
so
much
.
&quot;
Letter-in-the-chaps
!
Letter-in-the
chaps
!
&quot;
was
what
they
had
said
while
the
train
pounded
across
the
desert
and
slid
through
arroyas
and
deep
cuts
which
leveled
hills
for
its
passing
.
&quot;
Letter-in-the-chaps
!
Letter-in-the-chaps
!
&quot;
And
then
a
silence
while
they
stood
by
some
desolate
station
where
the
people
were
swarthy
of
skin
and
black
of
hair
and
eyes
,
and
moved
languidly
if
they
moved
at
all
.
Then
they
would
go
on
;
and
when
the
wheels
had
clicked
over
the
switches
of
the
various
side
tracks
,
they
would
take
up
again
the
refrain
:
&quot;
Letter-in-the-chaps
!
Letter-in-the-chaps
!
&quot;
until
Jean
thought
she
would
go
crazy
if
they
kept
it
up
much
longer
.
</p>
<p>
Little
by
little
they
drew
near
to
Los
Angeles
.
And
then
they
were
there
,
sliding
slowly
through
the
yards
in
a
drab
drizzle
of
one
of
California
's
fall
rains
.
Then
they
were
in
a
taxicab
,
making
for
the
Third
Street
tunnel
.
Then
Jean
stared
heavy-eyed
at
the
dripping
palms
along
the
boulevard
which
led
away
from
the
smoke
of
the
city
and
into
Hollywood
,
snuggled
against
the
misty
hills
.
&quot;
Letter-in-the-chaps
!
&quot;
her
tired
brain
repeated
it
still
.
</p>
<p>
Then
she
was
in
the
apartment
shared
with
Muriel
Gay
and
her
mother
.
These
two
were
over
at
the
studio
,
the
landlady
told
her
when
she
let
them
in
,
and
Jean
was
glad
that
they
were
gone
.
</p>
<p>
She
knelt
,
still
in
her
hat
and
coat
and
with
her
gloves
on
,
and
fitted
her
trunk
key
into
the
lock
.
And
there
she
stopped
.
What
if
the
letter
were
not
in
the
chaps
,
after
all
?
What
if
it
were
but
a
trivial
note
,
concerning
a
matter
long
since
forgotten
;
a
trivial
note
that
had
not
the
remotest
bearing
upon
the
murder
?
&quot;
Letter-in-the-chaps
!
&quot;
The
phrase
returned
with
a
mocking
note
and
beat
insistently
through
her
brain
.
She
sat
back
on
the
floor
and
shivered
with
the
chill
of
a
fireless
room
in
California
,
when
a
fall
rain
is
at
its
drizzling
worst
.
</p>
<p>
In
the
next
room
one
of
the
men
coughed
;
afterwards
she
heard
Lite
's
voice
,
saying
something
in
an
undertone
to
Art
Osgood
.
She
heard
Art
's
voice
mutter
a
reply
.
She
raised
herself
again
to
her
knees
,
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
,
and
lifted
the
trunk-lid
with
an
air
of
determination
.
</p>
<p>
Down
next
the
bottom
of
her
big
trunk
they
lay
,
just
as
she
had
packed
them
away
,
with
her
dad
's
six-shooter
and
belt
carefully
disposed
between
the
leathern
folds
.
She
groped
with
her
hands
under
a
couple
of
riding-skirts
and
her
high
,
laced
boots
,
got
a
firm
grip
on
the
fringed
leather
,
and
dragged
them
out
.
She
had
forgotten
all
about
the
gun
and
belt
until
they
fell
with
a
thump
on
the
floor
.
She
pulled
out
the
belt
,
left
the
gun
lying
there
by
the
trunk
,
and
hurried
out
with
the
chaps
dangling
over
her
arm
.
</p>
<p>
She
was
pale
when
she
stood
before
the
two
who
sat
there
waiting
with
their
hats
in
their
hands
and
their
faces
full
of
repressed
eagerness
.
Her
fingers
trembled
while
she
pulled
at
the
stiff
,
leather
flap
of
the
pocket
,
to
free
it
from
the
button
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Maybe
it
ai
n't
there
yet
,
&quot;
Art
hazarded
nervously
,
while
they
watched
her
.
&quot;
But
that
's
where
he
put
it
,
all
right
.
I
saw
him
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Jean
's
fingers
went
groping
into
the
pocket
,
stayed
there
for
a
second
or
two
,
and
came
out
holding
a
folded
envelope
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
That
's
it
!
&quot;
Art
leaned
toward
her
eagerly
.
&quot;
That
's
the
one
,
all
right
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Jean
sat
down
suddenly
because
her
knees
seemed
to
bend
under
her
weight
.
Three
years
--
and
that
letter
within
her
reach
all
the
time
!
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Let
's
see
,
Jean
.
&quot;
Lite
reached
out
and
took
it
from
her
nerveless
fingers
.
&quot;
Maybe
it
wo
n't
amount
to
anything
at
all
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Jean
tried
to
hold
herself
calm
.
&quot;
Read
it
--
out
loud
,
&quot;
she
said
.
&quot;
Then
we
'll
know
.
&quot;
She
tried
to
smile
,
and
made
so
great
a
failure
of
it
that
she
came
very
near
crying
.
The
faint
crackle
of
the
cheap
paper
when
Lite
unfolded
the
letter
made
her
start
nervously
.
&quot;
Read
it
--
no
matter
--
what
it
is
,
&quot;
she
repeated
,
when
she
saw
Lite
's
eyes
go
rapidly
over
the
lines
.
</p>
<p>
Lite
glanced
at
her
sharply
,
then
leaned
and
took
her
hand
and
held
it
close
.
His
firm
clasp
steadied
her
more
than
any
words
could
have
done
.
Without
further
delay
or
attempt
to
palliate
its
grim
significance
,
he
read
the
note
:
</p>
<p>
Aleck
:
</p>
<p>
If
Johnny
Croft
comes
to
you
with
anything
about
me
,
kick
him
off
the
ranch
.
He
claims
he
knows
a
whole
lot
about
me
branding
too
many
calves
.
Do
n't
believe
anything
he
tells
you
.
He
's
just
trying
to
make
trouble
because
he
claims
I
underpaid
him
.
He
was
telling
Art
a
lot
of
stuff
that
he
claimed
he
could
prove
on
me
,
but
it
's
all
a
lie
.
Send
him
to
me
if
he
comes
looking
for
trouble
.
I
'll
give
him
all
he
wants
.
</p>
<p>
Art
found
a
heifer
down
in
the
breaks
that
looks
like
she
might
have
blackleg
.
I
'm
going
down
there
to
see
about
it
.
Maybe
you
better
ride
over
and
see
what
you
think
about
it
;
we
do
n't
want
to
let
anything
like
that
get
a
start
on
us
.
