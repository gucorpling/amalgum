Monday
to
commemorate

.
Mr.
Ahern
makes
this
visit
annually
,
for
what
he
calls
a
&quot;
very
substantial
and
useful
meeting
.
&quot;
Mr.
Ahern
started
his
speech
by
saying
&quot;
Mr.
President
and
Mrs.
Bush
,
thank
you
for
the
welcome
and
honor
which
you
've
extended
to
our
delegation
,
and
to
all
the
Irish
guests
,
from
North
and
from
South
,
who
are
here
at
the
White
House
this
morning
to
mark
St.
Patrick
's
Day
,
Ireland
's
National
Day
.
I
'm
very
grateful
,
Mr.
President
,
for
the
opportunity
which
we
have
just
had
to
hold
a
very
substantial
and
useful
meeting
with
you
in
the
Oval
Office
.
We
appreciate
it
,
and
we
appreciate
the
amount
of
time
that
you
've
given
to
us
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Mr.
Bush
commented
on
the
relationship
between
the
US
and
Ireland
,
saying
that
&quot;
we
've
[
the
US
and
Ireland
have
]
had
a
long
relationship
,
Taoiseach
.
Our
history
has
been
one
where
the
United
States
and
Ireland
have
made
liberty
our
common
cause
,
and
both
of
our
nations
are
richer
for
it
.
Our
partnership
is
based
upon
principles
,
and
it
's
also
based
upon
people
.
Ireland
founded
itself
--
found
itself
in
the
grip
of
poverty
and
famine
in
the
19th
century
,
and
millions
of
Irish
came
here
to
our
soil
.
They
were
drawn
here
by
a
promise
that
success
would
be
attainable
to
all
those
who
were
willing
to
work
hard
.
And
that
's
certainly
what
happened
.

<p>
&quot;
And
that
's
what
we
celebrate
on
St.
Patrick
's
Day
.
Our
countries
are
more
than
just
partners
,
we
are
family
,
Taoiseach
.
And
today
more
than
35
million
Americans
claim
Irish
ancestry
.
America
is
richer
for
every
Murphy
,
Kelly
,
and
O'Sullivan
.
I
should
have
said
McCain
--
Well
,
I
just
did
.
After
all
,
this
history
together
,
the
United
States
and
the
Republic
of
Ireland
continue
to
stand
side
by
side
in
firm
friendship
.
We
were
friends
in
the
past
,
we
're
friends
today
,
and
,
Taoiseach
,
I
am
confident
,
after
my
time
in
office
,
the
next
President
will
be
friends
with
Ireland
.
We
are
cooperating
to
build
prosperous
economies
and
vibrant
trade
and
sound
investment
between
our
countries
,
&quot;
continued
Mr.
Bush
.
The
mentions
of
McCain
in
this
article
were
both
followed
by
laughter
and
applause
from
the
audience
.
</p>
<p>
Mr.
Ahern
also
commented
on
the
resolution
to
the
conflicts
that
had
been
troubling
Ireland
for
many
years
.
He
said
that
&quot;
we
[
the
people
of
Ireland
]
are
all
glad
to
say
,
and
enormously
pleased
and
proud
to
stand
here
and
say
that
we
've
achieved
peace
in
Ireland
.
It
's
a
peace
that
I
firmly
believe
will
endure
to
future
generations
.
