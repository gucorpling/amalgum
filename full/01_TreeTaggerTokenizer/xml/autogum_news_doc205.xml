A
human
rights
project
,
The
Detainee
Abuse
and
Accountability
Project
(
DAA
)
,
released
a
report
in
Washington
saying
that
allegations
of
detainee
abuse
,
torture
and
killings
have
now
implicated
at
least
600
U.S.
military
and
civilian
personnel
deployed
in
Iraq
and
Afghanistan
,
as
well
as
the
prison
for
terrorist
suspects
in
Guantanamo
Bay
,
Cuba
.
The
project
is
a
cooperation
between
New
York
University
's
Center
for
Human
Rights
and
Global
Justice
,
Human
Rights
Watch
and
Human
Rights
First
.
</p>
<p>
The
human
rights
groups
say
they
analyzed
thousands
of
pages
of
government
documents
and
conducted
interviews
with
witnesses
and
prisoners
who
say
they
were
abused
by
U.S.
troops
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Over
95
percent
of
those
implicated
were
military
personnel
,
&quot;
said
Hina
Shamsi
,
a
senior
counsel
for
the
group
Human
Rights
First
.
&quot;
The
remainder
were
from
the
CIA
or
other
intelligence
agencies
or
were
civilian
contractors
working
either
for
the
military
or
the
CIA
The
cases
involve
over
1,000
acts
of
abuse
,
including
homicide
,
assault
,
cruelty
,
maltreatment
,
maiming
and
sexual
abuse
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
We
found
that
abuses
were
pervasive
,
extending
far
beyond
Abu
Ghraib
and
that
investigations
have
been
incomplete
and
delayed
,
which
has
left
a
general
failure
of
accountability
,
&quot;
she
said
.
</p>
<p>
In
the
two
years
since
the
Abu
Ghraib
scandal
surfaced
,
the
human
rights
groups
say
40
people
have
been
sentenced
to
serve
time
in
prison
.
Of
those
,
10
have
been
sentenced
to
a
year
or
more
in
detention
.
</p>
<p>
Lieutenant
Commander
Jeffrey
Gordon
,
a
press
officer
at
the
Department
of
Defense
,
told
VOA
the
allegations
outlined
by
the
human
rights
groups
&quot;
are
false
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Commander
Gordon
says
the
military
has
conducted
more
than
600
criminal
investigations
resulting
in
charges
against
251
soldiers
who
faced
courts-martial
,
the
military
's
equivalent
of
criminal
trials
,
or
administrative
punishment
.
</p>
<p>
Commander
Gordon
says
all
allegations
of
abuse
are
taken
seriously
,
people
were
held
accountable
,
and
the
military
's
system
of
justice
does
work
.
</p>
<p>
The
information
from
the
human
rights
groups
comes
at
same
time
as
the
news
that
a
U.S.
Army
lieutenant
colonel
is
expected
to
be
charged
in
connection
with
the
abuse
of
detainees
at
the
Abu
Ghraib
prison
in
Iraq
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Two
years
ago
,
U.S.
officials
said
the
abuses
at
Abu
Ghraib
were
aberrations
and
that
people
who
abused
detainees
would
be
brought
to
justice
,
&quot;
said
the
faculty
director
of
the
Center
for
Human
Rights
and
Global
Justice
at
NYU
Law
School
,
Professor
Meg
Satterthwaite
.
&quot;
Yet
our
research
shows
that
detainee
abuses
were
widespread
,
and
few
people
have
truly
been
brought
to
justice
.

Two
years
after
the
Abu
Ghraib
scandal
caused
a
worldwide
uproar
,
reports
say
Lieutenant
Colonel
Steven
Jordan
will
become
the
highest-ranking
officer
to
be
charged
in
the
case
.
</p>
<p>
Colonel
Jordan
's
attorney
says
he
expects
his
client
will
be
charged
within
the
next
few
days
on
several
counts
,
including
dereliction
of
duty
,
conduct
unbecoming
an
officer
and
lying
to
investigators
.

The
colonel
led
the
Joint
Interrogation
and
Debriefing
Center
at
Abu
Ghraib
between
September
and
December
2003
.
</p>
<p>
Military
investigations
determined
that
Colonel
Jordan
,
who
was
trained
as
a
civil
affairs
officer
,
had
no
experience
with
interrogating
prisoners
and
failed
to
properly
supervise
soldiers
under
his
command
.
