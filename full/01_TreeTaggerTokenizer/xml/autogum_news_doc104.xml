Darfur
town

<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kutum">

Armed
men
seized

</p>
<p>
Following
their
release
early
Sunday
morning
they
described
their
captivity
as
a
&quot;
difficult
time
&quot;
,
and
thanked
everyone
who
had
worked
to
secure
their
freedom
in
a
joint
statement
released
through
the
GOAL
.
They
were
,
&quot;
naturally
thrilled
to
be
released
after
such
a
long
period
in
captivity
&quot;
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
We
know
it
must
have
been
a
traumatic
period
for
our
families
especially
and
for
our
friends
,
&quot;
they
said
.
&quot;
It
was
of
course
,
a
difficult
time
-
but
we
found
strength
in
each
other
and
in
our
friendship
.
&quot;
They
also
could
&quot;
hardly
wait
to
get
home
&quot;
to
spend
time
with
their
families
.
</p>
<p>
Al-Gilani
indicated
the
pair
were
in
Kutum
and
due
to
fly
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khartoum">
Khartoum

later
the
same
day
prior
to
them
respectively
returning
to
Ireland
and
Uganda

<p>
John
O'Shea

by

&quot;
[
w]e
are
all
relieved
,
&quot;
and
that
all
at
the
charity
were
particularly
happy
for
their
families
.
&quot;
We
do
n't
yet
know
when
they
will
go
home
but
we
hope
it
is
as
soon
as
possible

al-Gilani
stressed
&quot;

The
captors
held
the
two
aid
workers
for
over
100
days
,
the
longest-running
kidnapping
in
Darfur
since
the
2003
start
of
the
region
's
conflict
.
Until
March
,
the
longest
an
aid
worker
had
been
detained
in
Darfur
was
24
hours
.

aid

say
hostility
and

have
increased
towards
them
,
and
that
Sudan
's
relations
with
foreign
relief
organisations
have
declined
dramatically
.

In
March
and

To
date
,
Sudanese
authorities
have
not
punished
kidnappers
;
however
al-Gilani
announced
yesterday
that
those
responsible
for
the
latest
kidnapping
must
be
brought
to
justice
.
In
talking
with
AFP
,
he
stated
,
&quot;
[
t]hey
must
be
punished
otherwise
there
will
be
no
more
order
&quot;
.
The
government
called
the
kidnappers
&quot;
bandits
&quot;
and
state
no
amnesty
will
be
granted
for
the
release
of
aid
workers
.
