Introduction
</head>
<p>
Every
year
,
approximately
1.2
–
1.8
Gt
yr
of
dust
is
released
into
the
atmosphere
reaching
the
medium
and
upper
troposphere
.
Of
this
,
approximately
50.7
%
is
transported
from
the
Sahara
to
Europe
.
The
most
affected
European
countries
by
the
Saharan
dust
transport
are
those
from
the
Mediterranean
basin
.
This
dust
transport
can
have
a
direct
and
indirect
effect
on
the
radiative
budget
,
human
health
and
terrestrial
and
aquatic
ecosystems
.
Dust
intrusions
were
observed
up
to
6
km
altitude
,
and
their
transport
directly
influenced
the
Alps
,
the
Apennines
,
the
Pyrenees
,
and
the
Carpathian
Mountains
.
Di
Mauro
et
al.
showed
that
dust
deposition
changes
the
snow
melt-out
dates
,
altering
the
hydrological
cycle
in
the
Alps
.
Also
,
dust
is
influencing
the
severity
of
respiratory
conditions
(
e.
g.
,
asthma
)
especially
when
significant
quantities
of
particulate
matter
(
PM
)
including
dust
are
present
in
the
air
(
i.
e.
,
an
increase
of
more
than
10
g
m
in
PM
,
)
.
Saharan
dust
particles
can
also
carry
bacteria
over
long
distances
(
e.
g.
,
the
Alps
)
despite
the
low
temperatures
and
UV
radiation
at
which
the
are
exposed
during
transport
.
Dust
deposition
can
also
have
beneficial
effects
,
for
example
,
the
high
Fe
content
of
dust
can
act
as
a
soil
nutrient
.
</p>
<p>
The
transport
of
Saharan
dust
over
Europe
has
been
extensively
analyzed
during
the
last
decades
.
This
was
facilitated
by
the
developments
of
remote
sensing
techniques
and
networks
using
ground-based
measurements
e.
g.
,
,
in-situ
measurements
e.
g.
,
,
satellite-based
measurements
e.
g.
,
,
and
numerical
modelling
e.
g.
,
.
To
understand
the
seasonality
of
dust
intrusions
over
Europe
,
Marinou
et
al.
performed
a
9-year
study
of
Saharan
dust
transport
based
on
satellite
data
from
Cloud-Aerosol
Lidar
and
Infrared
Pathfinder
Satellite
Observation
(
CALIPSO
)
and
lidar
ground-based
measurements
from
the
European
Aerosol
Research
Lidar
Network
(
EARLINET
)
.
The
study
showed
,
that
during
the
spring
,
dust
aerosols
are
transported
from
Sahara
to
Europe
,
with
the
highest
incidence
of
dust
intrusion
over
the
Mediterranean
region
.
Similar
results
concerning
the
seasonal
variation
of
dust
over
Europe
were
obtained
by
Mandija
et
al.
using
a
modelling
approach
.
</p>
<p>
Not
only
the
countries
bordering
the
Mediterranean
Sea
(
[
16,24
]
for
Greece
)
but
also
those
located
in
central
and
southeastern
Europe
(
e.
g.
,
for
Romania
,
for
Hungary
)
are
affected
by
Saharan
dust
transport
which
can
negatively
impact
the
daily
activities
.
Thus
,
under
certain
meteorological
conditions
the
dust
can
reach
high
altitudes
later
being
detected
at
the
ground
due
to
the
dry
and
wet
depositions
(
e.
g.
,
)
.
Over
southeastern
Europe
,
Saharan
dust
is
reported
more
frequently
during
the
spring
(
March
–
May
)
compared
with
other
periods
of
the
year
.
</p>
<p>
One
example
,
is
the
event
that
occurred
on
22
–
23
March
2018
when
Saharan
dust
was
deposited
at
the
ground
over
southeastern
Romania
.
A
particularity
of
this
event
is
that
the
dust
was
deposited
together
with
snow
.
Previous
studies
on
Saharan
dust
deposited
onto
snow
surfaces
focused
on
events
that
occurred
at
high
altitudes
over
central
Europe
(
e.
g.
,
for
the
Alps
)
.
There
are
very
few
studies
on
Saharan
dust
deposition
by
rainfalls
(
e.
g.
,
)
over
southeastern
Europe
,
and
no
studies
,
to
the
authors
knowledge
,
analyzing
the
dust
deposition
by
snowfall
.
</p>
<p>
The
purpose
of
this
article
is
to
analyze
for
the
first
time
the
characteristics
of
a
long-range
Saharan
dust
transport
event
accompanied
by
snowfall
that
occurred
over
southeastern
Europe
between
22
–
23
March
2018
.
The
analysis
is
based
on
the
continuous
measurements
performed
at
the
Romanian
Atmospheric
3D
Observatory
(
RADO
)
situated
near
Bucharest
which
allowed
the
analysis
of
the
type
of
mineral
particles
transported
,
the
chemical
composition
of
the
refractory
or
non-refractory
aerosols
and
their
physical
properties
.
This
article
is
structured
as
follows
.
Section
2
describes
the
sampling
site
,
the
data
and
the
methodology
,
including
discussions
on
its
main
limitations
.
Section
3
provides
the
synoptic
context
of
the
dust
transport
and
the
local
environment
before
the
dust
event
.
The
dust
particle
morphology
,
their
chemical
composition
and
their
optical
properties
are
also
described
in
Section
3
.
Finally
,
Section
4
summarizes
the
results
of
this
paper
.
