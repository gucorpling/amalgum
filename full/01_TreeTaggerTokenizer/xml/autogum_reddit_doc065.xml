UPDATE
Guys
...
I
'm
moved
out
!
Posted
twice
I
have
no
idea
how
to
do
updates
lol
.
This
week
has
been
the
most
stressful
week
holy
shit
.
So
Monday
after
the
argument
I
had
gotten
my
phone
taken
for
not
telling
my
step
mom
hey
...
I
ended
up
checking
out
a
laptop
at
my
school
library
.
I
had
made
an
account
for
a
texting
app
and
texted
my
sister
the
situation.
.
Long
story
short
my
sister
was
fed
and
told
my
mom
.
My
said
said
she
was
picking
me
up
Saturday
and
to
get
my
important
documents
out
.
Friday
I
was
out
of
school
I
gave
my
boyfriend
my
bags
while
my
dad
and
my
step
mom
were
at
work
.
My
dad
had
brought
me
to
work
the
next
morning
and
my
aunt
had
picked
me
up
earlier
.
I
told
select
people
at
work
I
was
leaving
suddenly
.
I
had
left
things
surprisingly
on
good
terms
and
my
manager
gave
me
his
number
if
I
even
needed
a
reference
.
Now
I
'm
at
a
cousins
house
.
My
mom
had
called
my
dad
and
told
him
that
she
was
taking
me
.
Guys
this
has
been
the
most
difficult
day
I
feel
like
I
've
been
in
shook
for
a
minute
These
past
few
days
have
been
the
hardest
.
It
was
hard
looking
into
my
dad
and
step
mom
's
face
knowing
I
was
leaving
.
Things
were
actually
going
well
when
I
had
left
and
the
guilt
was
eating
me
alive
.
I
try
to
tell
myself
that
even
tho
things
were
&quot;
good
&quot;
at
the
moment
nothing
was
ever
going
to
change
...
Apparently
my
dad
had
cried
on
the
phone
I
've
never
seen
or
heard
my
dad
cry
so
this
was
really
unexpected
I
have
no
idea
how
my
step
mom
acted
but
I
can
imagine
she
flipped
out
.
I
had/have
a
hard
time
coping
I
could
n't
stop
thinking
about
the
turmoil
going
on
at
home
right
now
and
keep
feeling
shitty
.
Despite
everything
,
I
still
care
for
them
even
my
step
mom
.
My
cousin
was
having
a
get
together
at
her
house
and
I
was
having
the
most
difficult
time
enjoying
myself
.
I
had
broke
down
and
cried
I
'm
still
feeling
awful
and
guilty
but
at
the
same
time
relieved
.
Thank
you
guys
a
lot
for
the
advice
,
I
ca
n't
believe
after
all
this
time
I
'm
out
if
this
situation
This
subreddit
has
been
so
helpful
.

GET
.
THE
.
FUCK
.
OUT
.
</p>
<p>
Since
you
're
probably
home
by
now
,
play
the
role
of
the
good
slave
for
one
last
night
.
If
safe
to
do
so
,
get
your
SS
card
,
birth
certificate
,
and
anything
else
that
will
be
hard
to
replace
.
Consider
anything
you
leave
behind
gone
forever
,
since
they
'll
destroy
it
to
punish
you
.
</p>
<p>
Tomorrow
,
go
to
school
and
do
n't
come
home
.
Use
bike
and
public
transportation
,
since
they
're
harder
to
trace
.
</p>
<p>
You
'll
need
cash
.
If
you
've
got
money
in
the
bank
and
you
were
a
minor
when
you
deposited
it
,
withdraw
it
now
,
since
they
're
going
to
take
it
to
punish
you
.
Hell
,
withdraw
everything
ASAP
.
</p>
<p>
Use
credit
cards
to
buy
some
clothes
toiletries
,
then
flush
the
card
.
You
do
n't
want
to
use
it
since
they
can
trace
your
purchases
.
With
cash
,
buy
a
prepaid
phone
(
basic
burner
)
.
</p>
<p>
When
you
buy
your
new
phone
,
ditch
your
old
one
.
For
this
,
you
can
remove
the
lock
code
and
put
a
note
on
it
saying
free
phone
.
Or
,
you
could
slip
it
into
a
package
going
far
away
.
This
will
especially
help
if
you
are
planning
on
leaving
the
area
.
(
i.
e.
mail
it
to
San
Francisco
and
take
a
bus
to
Boston
)
</p>
<p>
The
point
is
,
get
rid
of
your
old
phone
,
especially
if
it
is
a
smartphone
.
Your
parents
can
shut
off
the
old
phone
as
punishment
,
and
smartphones
can
be
traced
to
within
ten
meters
.
</p>
<p>
If
there
are
photos
or
other
files
you
want
to
keep
,
load
them
onto
a
thumb
drive
and
keep
it
with
you
.
</p>
<p>
Now
,
go
to
the
police
station
to
file
charges
and
tell
them
that
your
parents
may
file
a
missing
person
thingy
.
Give
the
cops
your
new
phone
number
,
so
they
can
contact
you
.
</p>
<p>
If
you
could
n't
grab
them
,
go
to
the
Social
Security
administration
to
get
a
new
card
and
to
city
records
to
get
a
new
copy
of
your
birth
certificate
.
</p>
<p>
Now
,
the
old
you
needs
to
disappear
.
Go
to
a
thrift
shop
and
get
some
clothes
that
look
completely
different
and
donate
toss
your
old
clothes
.
Dye
your
hair
and
or
get
it
into
a
completely
different
look
.
If
you
have
a
small
chest
,
add
something
to
make
it
look
larger
;
on
the
other
hand
,
if
you
have
a
large
bosum
,
get
some
sort
of
wrap
to
visually
shrink
.
Maybe
change
your
posture
.
Whatever
you
do
,
make
sure
you
do
n't
look
anything
like
what
you
did
before
.
</p>
<p>
With
your
burner
phone
,
call
your
mother
,
and
get
her
to
pick
you
up
,
then
go
to
a
new
bank
to
set
up
your
new
account
.
If
you
're
fast
enough
,
you
might
be
able
to
salvage
more
of
your
money
.
Finish
out
the
semester
,
then
change
schools
.

I
’m
pretty
sure
in
every
country
you
’re
legal
to
move
out
at
19
and
are
legally
considered
an
adult
.
</p>
<p>

<p>
It
really
sounds
like
she
was
just
looking
to
start
a
fight
and
you
are
literally
being
used
as
a
whipping
boy
.
Fuck
them
,
pack
up
all
your
vital
documents
and
run
.
Also
,
consider
reporting
them
to
the
police
because
hitting
you
with
a
belt
is
assault
.
