<p>
Urban
form
plays
a
key
role
in
explaining
the
concentration
of
transport-related
pollutant
emissions
.
Regarding
the
rapid
urbanization
and
urban
expansion
and
the
consequent
long-lasting
impacts
on
accessibility
,
housing
affordability
,
and
air
pollutants
,
knowledge
on
the
issue
of
how
compactness
and
poly-centricity
affect
air
quality
is
of
crucial
importance
for
China
.
For
the
mitigation
of
pollutant
emissions
,
many
studies
suggest
developing
compact
urban
forms
and
polycentricism
to
reduce
the
level
of
emissions
.
However
,
the
effect
of
compact
form
on
air
quality
is
usually
controversial
.
In
addition
,
knowledge
on
the
effects
of
poly-centricity
and
compactness
of
an
urban
form
in
terms
of
jobs-housing
balance
on
air
quality
in
Chinese
cities
is
scarce
.
</p>
<p>
The
current
study
takes
the
first
step
toward
a
better
understanding
of
the
relationships
between
compact
urban
form
and
poly-centricity
and
air
quality
for
a
sample
of
19
YRD
cities
by
using
the
analysis
of
the
spatial
durbin
model
(
SDM
)
.
Notwithstanding
the
limitations
of
OLS
analysis
,
the
SDM
provide
a
unique
opportunity
to
be
able
to
investigate
the
spatial
effect
of
pollutants
and
the
way
to
mitigate
emissions
.
The
analysis
indicates
that
air
pollutants
in
these
cities
responds
differently
to
some
urban
characteristics
than
was
expected
from
the
evidence
in
the
case
of
the
US
and
EU
cities
.
</p>
<p>
The
findings
show
that
compactness
in
terms
of
urban
density
,
jobs-housing
balance
,
and
urban
centralization
are
important
determinants
for
air
pollutants
in
terms
of
PM10
emissions
.
The
rapid
urbanization
and
urban
expansion
have
led
to
clustered
development
in
the
outskirts
,
as
yet
most
of
jobs
and
amenities
remained
concentrated
in
the
traditional
centers
.
Hence
,
the
large
effect
of
an
increase
in
city
size
on
VMT
and
congestion
,
cities
with
a
larger
city
size
tend
to
emit
more
PM10
.
In
addition
,
cities
with
more
vehicle
ownerships
have
a
large
effect
on
PM10
emissions
,
which
indicates
that
more
vehicles
used
are
one
of
the
reasons
for
more
PM10
emissions
.
After
controlling
these
variables
,
cities
with
higher
urban
density
have
more
PM10
,
while
higher
degree
of
jobs-housing
balance
and
urban
centralization
have
less
PM10
.
In
addition
,
poly-centricity
in
terms
of
developing
too
many
activity
centers
has
a
higher
level
of
PM10
emissions
,
while
enhancing
polycentric
clusters
does
not
necessarily
result
in
more
PM10
emissions
.
However
,
for
cities
with
more
private
car
vehicles
of
&gt;10
million
,
polycentric
clustered
development
may
improve
air
quality
in
terms
of
PM10
,
but
this
improvement
may
be
limited
.
Therefore
,
our
paper
indicates
that
jobs-housing
balanced
and
concentrated
compactness
can
be
two
effective
strategies
to
reduce
air
pollution
.
</p>
<p>
Our
findings
suggest
that
strategies
aimed
to
reduce
air
pollution
by
compactness
and
polycentric
development
may
need
to
be
reconsidered
in
the
context
of
Chinese
cities
.
According
to
the
findings
of
this
empirical
study
,
policy
implications
for
cities
in
developed
countries
should
be
cautiously
developed
.
Some
incomparable
results
of
our
empirical
findings
,
such
as
the
positive
impact
of
compactness
in
terms
of
urban
density
on
air
pollutants
in
the
context
of
YRD
cities
,
might
contribute
to
the
longstanding
debate
and
the
impact
of
compact
development
on
air
pollution
in
developed
countries
.
In
addition
,
our
empirical
results
also
contribute
additional
evidence
to
the
literature
and
provide
some
policy
implications
for
Chinese
cities
that
aim
to
mitigate
air
pollution
by
polycentric
development
.
To
some
degree
,
our
findings
support
the
current
polycentric
development
pattern
in
Chinese
cities
,
as
polycentric
development
enhances
a
more
balanced
population
distribution
between
the
main
center
and
its
sub-centers
for
those
cities
with
a
large
number
of
private
car
ownerships
(
&gt;10
million
within
cities
)
.
However
,
poly-centricity
by
developing
too
many
centers
may
also
lead
to
more
air
pollutant
emissions
.
</p>
<p>
However
,
the
data
used
in
this
paper
have
limitations
,
which
need
to
be
further
extended
.
First
,
following
Engelfriet
and
Koomen
and
Li
et
al.
,
we
use
population
centers
rather
than
employment
centers
to
measure
poly-centricity
.
Focusing
on
employment
data
will
shed
more
light
on
the
heterogeneity
that
potentially
exists
in
the
relationship
between
poly-centricity
and
air
pollution
,
i.
e.
,
the
impacts
may
be
heterogeneous
for
cities
with
different
jobs-housing
balances
,
which
is
not
considered
in
our
paper
.
Second
,
the
data
obtained
in
this
paper
is
limited
to
the
administrative
boundary
of
urban
districts
from
the
statistical
yearbook
of
local
cities
.
Future
studies
can
use
more
a
fine-grained
level
of
data
,
to
advance
our
understanding
of
compactness
and
poly-centricity
in
air
pollution
emissions
.
