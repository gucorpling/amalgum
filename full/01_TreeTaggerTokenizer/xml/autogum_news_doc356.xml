yesterday
said
the
aircraft
was
given
permission
to
divert
to
avoid
bad
weather
;
the
area
was
experiencing
thunderstorms
.
That
was
at

climb
from

to
38,000ft

</p>
<p>
Controllers
conferred
with
Singapore
and
agreed
the
plane
could
climb
as
high
as
34,000ft
with
another
flight
preventing
a
higher
altitude
.
When
they
radioed
permission
at
6:14
they
received
no
answer
.
The
flight
vanished

&quot;
Why
did
[
Iriyanto
]
request
to
climb
at
that
stage
?
&quot;
said
the
source
.
&quot;
Should
he
have
climbed
earlier
?
Other
aircraft
were
flying
at
a
higher
altitude
in
that
area
.
How
did
the
two
pilots
react
to
the
weather
?
We
are
asking
those
questions
