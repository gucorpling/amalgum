No

well

we

Like

</hi>
Yes
,
yes

We
’ve
had
many
an
argument
,
many
a
falling
out
,
but
he
separated
a
long
time
ago

Are

Yes

he
was
in
touch
with
the
office
a
couple
of
weeks

I
was
on
the
road

I

does

Do
you
mean
twenty

Because
we
’ve
had
the

twenty-seven
years

<p>
<hi rend="bold">

Just
twenty
years

<p>
<hi rend="bold">

</hi>
God
,
less

I

I

do

Do
you

you

things
you

wanted
back
then

</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
IN
:
</hi>
I
’m
never
looking
ahead
.
All
I
want
is
to
reduce
suffering
and
to
get
people
to
think
of
animals
in
a
different
way
,
and
that
’s
as
true
then
as
it
is
now
.
Perhaps
I
was
—
I
do
n’t
know
if
I
could
say
if
I
’m
less
or
more
optimistic
,
I
really
ca
n’t
.
I
think
I
was
just
me
,
only
younger
.

<p>
<hi rend="bold">

Do
you

other
people

that

I

so…I

so

that
’s
what
we

personally

Just
in
general

in
your
life

</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
IN

</hi>
These
are
just
terrible
questions
!
I
think
you
can
always
look
back
and
in
hindsight
,
knowing
the
results
of
what
you
’ve
done
,
think
,
‘
Maybe
I
could
have
been
more
strategic
then
’
;
or
‘
If
I
had
only
known…maybe
I
could
have
pushed
harder
then
.
’
But
I
think
in
compromising
sometimes
,
people
may
find
it
surprising
,
but
I
’m
so
anxious
not
to
lose
ground
,
but
to
gain
ground
so
that
we
can
move
ahead
,
that
I
might
take
less
than
if
I
had
known
I
could
have
pushed
harder
what
I
could
have
got
.

so
the
