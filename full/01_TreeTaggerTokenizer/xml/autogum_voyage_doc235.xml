Smuggling
and
other
illegal
activities
are
quite
rife
in
Chavakkad
and
there
is
a
big
and
established
underworld
.
Take
care
of
speeding
vehicles
and
suspicious
looking
persons
coming
near
your
luggage
.
You
need
not
carry
this
fear
complex
with
you
everywhere
in
Kerala
,
as
there
is
only
one
more
place
in
Kerala
where
smuggling
is
widespread
,
that
is
