,
announced
the
Ukrainian

</ref>
as
a
unified
sovereign
state
.
</p>
<p>
He
said
the
Ukrainian
Paralympic
team
is
very
democratic
,
and
reached
this
decision
together
.
Their
view
is
if
they
boycotted
the
Games
,
their
message
of
peace
would
be
forgotten
in
a
few
hours
.
While
stating
the
team
intends
to
compete
,
the
Ukrainian
team
reserved
the
right
to
leave
the
Games
immediately
should
peace
not
happen
,
and
the
Russian
military
does
further
intervention
in
the
Ukraine
.
</p>
<p>
Sushkevich
,
who
is
also
a
member
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Ukrainian_Parliament">
Ukrainian
Parliament
</ref>
,
denied
accusations
their
comments
and
decisions
have
been
political
in
regards
to
the
two
hour
delay
for
the
team
's
welcome
to
the
Paralympic
village
,
and
actions
taken
during
the
welcome
ceremony
.
Rather
,
he
claimed
these
actions
were
motivated
by
a
message
of
peace
and
human
rights
.
He
claimed
the
situation
for
Ukraine
is
unique
.
According
to
Sushkevich
,
never
before
during
the
Paralympic
Games
has
the
host
country
invaded
a
participating
country
.
Suskevich
talked
about
a
discussion
he
had
yesterday
with
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin">
Vladimir
Putin
</ref>
,
the
leader
of
Russia
,
where
Sushkevich
talked
to
Putin
as
a
member
of
the
Paralympic
family
.
He
said
he
asked
Putin
for
peace
,
for
detente
at
least
until
the
Paralympic
Games
are
over
.
The
response
he
received
from
Putin
was
that
he
was
heard
and
Putin
would
think
about
what
he
said
.
</p>
<p>
The
President
said
that
he
views
the
achievements
of
the
Paralympics
above
that

that
the
Paralympics
play
a
vital
role
in
the
lives
of
the
athletes
.
He
said
the
31
members
of
the
Ukrainian
team
want
to
compete
.
There
is
a
problem
being
the
national
team
of
the
Ukraine
,
though
,
when
the
country
is
not
whole
.
He
later
said
the
team
has
representatives
from
ten
regions
of
the
country
,
including
the
western
Russian
parts
.

<p>
Further
comments
were
made
by
Ukrainian
Paralympic
Committee
President
that
in
past
few
years
,
all

Afghanistan
</ref>

He
hoped
in
the
future
,
there
would
be
peace

disabilities
that
were
a
result
of
war
.
