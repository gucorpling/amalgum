When
fighting
the
Spaniards
he
used
an
ambush
strategy
;
he
first
engaged
the
enemy
with
a
small
force
that
feigned
a
retreat
,
and
then
lured
the
Spaniards
back
to
a
better
fortified
position
where
the
main
force
waited
.
The
Spaniards
retreated
when
too
many
of
their
men
were
killed
or
wounded
,
and
they
sought
a
peace
treaty
with
the
Tlaxcaltecs

was
in

but
Xicotencatl

opposed
this
idea
and
continued
to
fight

nearly
wiping

However
,
in
a
crucial
moment
,
the
soldiers
from

retreated
from
the

the
orders

The
description
of
Xicotencatl
has
been
subject
to
changing
attitudes
in
the
understanding
of
the
Spanish
Conquest
of
Mexico
.
In
the
early
period
he
was
seen
mostly
as
a
traitor
who
tried
to
halt
the
arrival
of
the
Spanish
&quot;
liberation
&quot;
of
the
Indians
from
Aztec
dominance
.
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-5">
[

</ref>
Later
he
was
romantically
construed
as
an
indigenous
hero
who
valiantly
opposed
the
onslaught
of
the
Spanish
.

Recently
,
ethnohistorian
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Hassig">
Ross
Hassig
</ref>
(
2001
)
has
analysed
his
actions
in
terms
of
Tlaxcaltec
politics
,
and
he
concludes
that
Xicotencatl
was
mostly
acting
to
further
the
political
interests
of
his
own
polity
,
that
of
Tizatlan
,
over
the
opposing
faction
of
Ocotelolco
.
The
charge
of
treason
lodged
against
him
and
his
subsequent
execution
were
,
in
this
view
,
the
logical
result
of
the
Ocotelolcans
finally
achieving
the
upper
hand
.
