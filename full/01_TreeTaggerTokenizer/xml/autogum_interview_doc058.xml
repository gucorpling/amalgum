I
encourage
people
to
go
to
commons
and
work
to
explain
to
the
community
there
some
of
the
concepts
behind
Hostile
environment
sexual
harrassment
.
I
encourage
everyone
to
seriously
consider
whether
it
is
appropriate
behavior
to
upload
a
clearly
non-notable
film
of
someone
using
his
penis
to
paint
a
picture
of
a
Wikipedia
volunteer
.
It
is
harassment
,
it
is
trolling
,
and
I
am
deeply
disappointed
to
have
to
point
this
out
to
some
people

<hi rend="bold">
Pricasso
</hi>
:
Harassment
is
when
one
continually
annoys
someone
,
over
and
over
again
;
I
only
painted
the
one
painting
of
him
and
it
to
my
mind
was
not
offensive
,
I
consider
my
work
as
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/satire">
satire
</ref>
just
like
late
night
TV
,
something
that
gives
light
relief
to
a
serious
subject
.
There
are
many
examples
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/political%20cartoon">
political
cartoon
</ref>
images
on
Wikipedia
,
so
why
are
they
still
up
there
or
is
it
just
the
things
Jimmy
Wales
does
n't
like
get
taken
down
?
By
the
way
anyone
who
has
not
seen
the
offending
Video
can
view
it
on
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vimeo">

I
paint
about
1000
portraits
a
year
and
get
paid
by
the
sitters
or
a
close
friend
of
them
to
do
so
.
I
had
a
request
to
paint
a
portrait
,
to
do
[
this
]
portrait
of
Jimmy
Wales
with
a
video
of
me
painting
,
by
<ref target="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Russavia">
Russavia
</ref>
(
who
is
an
editor
at
Wikipedia
)
,
something
I
do
all
the
time
and
I
have
great
feedback
as
to
how
funny
the
videos
are
;
I
had
no
idea
who
Jimmy
Wales
was
at
the
time
of
the
request
,
but
painted
him
only
once
so
it
ca
n't
be
called
Harassment
.
Is
he
just
using
his
position
of
power
to
cut
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/censor">
censor
</ref>
...
It
took
me
a
lot
of
effort
and
time
to
put
this
together
so
I
was
pretty
upset
.
And
would
really
like
it
to
be
republished
next
to
the
portrait
as
originally
it
was
before
Mr
Wales
had
it
removed
.
