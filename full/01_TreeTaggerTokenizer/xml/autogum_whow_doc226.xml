Avoid
Dealer
Status
to
Obtain
Capital
Gains
</head>
<p>
Two
different
groups
purchase
and
sell
capital
assets
:
dealers
and
investors
.
Dealers
are
generally
subject
to
more
stringent
financial
and
tax
laws
and
regulations
.
If
you
are
considered
a
dealer
,
you
will
not
be
able
to
claim
capital
gains
on
,
for
example
,
the
sale
of
a
property
;
the
sale
will
be
considered
business
income
.
Capital
assets
include
both
securities
and
real
estate
.
Of
the
two
,
real
estate
transactions
are
usually
more
complex
.

Obtaining
capital
gains
when
you
sell
the
property
may
be
dependent
upon
whether
you
live
in
the
house
and
how
long
you
have
owned
the
house
.
The
process
of
&quot;
flipping
&quot;
a
house
,
or
buying
and
selling
it
within
a
short
period
of
time
,
may
put
you
in
the
dealer
category
.
</item>
<item>
The
method
you
use
to
sell
a
house
could
also
affect
dealer
status
.
You
might
advertise
the
home
as
&quot;
For
Sale
By
Owner
&quot;
on
a
sign
that
you
place
on
your
front
lawn
to
avoid
being
seen
as
a
dealer
.
If
you
advertise
in
multiple
newspapers
and
on
television
,
you
may
be
seen
as
a
dealer
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Limit
the
number
of
properties
you
sell
.
If
you
own
multiple
properties
and
sell
and
buy
properties
frequently
,
the
government
may
view
you
as
a
dealer
.
There
is
an
extensive
legal
case
history
that
determines
the
parameters
for
dealer
status
.

Subdividing
a
property
for
the
purpose
profit
could
propel
you
to
dealer
status
.
Frequency
and
the
extent
to
which
you
develop
a
property
to
be
divided
also
plays
a
role
.
In
one
case
,
a
person
with
a
non-real-estate
job
sold
several
lots
of
land
over
a
twenty-year
period
and
obtained
capital
gains
.

Do
n't
set
up
an
office
from
which
you
purchase
and
sell
real
property
.
Professional
real
estate
agents
have
offices
.
If
you
open
an
office
,
the
government
may
consider
you
a
dealer
.

Avoid
hiring
someone
to
sell
your
property
,
as
in
a
person
over
which
you
have
a
supervisory
role
or
a
person
who
you
have
on
a
payroll
.
The
government
may
consider
this
an
activity
consistent
with
being
a
real
estate
professional
,
which
would
put
you
in
the
dealer
category
.

Devote
only
a
small
portion
of
your
time
to
purchasing
and
selling
property
to
avoid
dealer
status
.
If
you
avoid
devoting
a
significant
amount
of
time
to
selling
a
property
,
the
government
may
not
consider
you
to
be
a
dealer
.
