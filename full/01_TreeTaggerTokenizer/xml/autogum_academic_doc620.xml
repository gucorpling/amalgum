<p>
From
2018
until
August
2019
,
all
notifications
of
CSF
outbreaks
in
Japan
have
been
made
in
Gifu
Prefecture
as
well
as
in
the
surrounding
four
prefectures
.
A
total
of
1110
notifications
had
been
reported
so
far
,
with
1071
affecting
wild
boar
and
39
affecting
domestic
pig
farms
.
The
continuous
notification
of
CSF
in
the
area
might
have
been
attributed
to
wide
spread
of
the
virus
within
wild
boar
populations
favored
by
free
animal
movements
,
as
well
as
to
the
emergence
of
epidemiologically
related
domestic
pig
farms
.
To
prevent
the
disease
spreading
in
wild
boar
,
control
measures
including
(
i
)
fencing
to
restrict
animal
movements
,
(
ii
)
hunting
activities
for
active
monitoring
and
to
reduce
susceptible
populations
,
and
(
iii
)
disseminating
baits
for
oral
immunization
,
were
implemented
.
However
,
the
efficacy
of
these
strategies
has
not
been
confirmed
.
Therefore
,
we
conducted
a
spatio-temporal
analysis
to
obtain
epidemiological
information
of
the
spread
of
CSF
in
Gifu
Prefecture
.
Results
from
this
analysis
could
help
to
increase
our
understanding
of
the
current
CSF
epidemic
and
to
contribute
strategies
for
the
containment
of
the
disease
in
domestic
pigs
and
wild
boar
.
</p>
<p>
Japan
is
an
island
country
that
has
achieved
the
status
of
freedom
from
several
contagious
animal
diseases
by
implementing
adequate
control
measures
that
take
advantage
of
the
country
’s
geography
.
Nevertheless
,
Japan
has
imported
outbreaks
of
contagious
animal
diseases
from
neighboring
countries
.
In
2010
,
there
was
an
outbreak
of
foot-and-mouth
disease
(
FMD
)
in
Miyazaki
Prefecture
in
the
southern
part
of
Japan
,
which
caused
extensive
losses
in
animal
husbandry
.
According
to
the
high
degree
of
sequence
homology
between
an
original
virus
isolated
in
Japan
and
viruses
that
were
circulating
widely
in
East
Asia
,
it
was
suspected
that
the
FMD
virus
might
have
been
introduced
via
movement
of
people
or
commodities
from
East
Asia
.
The
high
homology
of
genetic
sequences
between
the
CSF
virus
isolated
in
Japan
and
viruses
prevailing
in
China
suggests
that
the
infectious
CSF
virus
may
have
been
introduced
from
China
.
Potential
factors
that
could
have
contributed
to
disease
introduction
include
easy
access
from
the
international
airport
to
the
affected
area
,
which
has
regular
and
direct
flights
from
China
,
and
the
relatively
high
population
density
of
Chinese
people
in
the
affected
area
.
</p>
<p>
In
the
present
study
,
standard
deviational
ellipse
analysis
was
conducted
to
measure
the
standard
distance
of
CSF
notifications
.
Shifting
the
centroids
of
identified
ellipses
indicated
that
the
disease
notification
has
spread
in
a
northeast
direction
.
Overlaying
the
three
identified
ellipses
with
a
map
of
snowfall
area
in
Gifu
Prefecture
revealed
that
the
disease
spread
along
the
border
of
the
snowfall
area
.
In
the
south
of
Gifu
Prefecture
,
there
is
a
widespread
area
of
flat
land
with
field
crops
or
animal
farms
,
residential
areas
,
and
forests
surrounded
by
mountains
to
the
north
.
As
suggested
by
other
authors
,
wild
boar
do
not
move
to
the
snowfall
or
high
mountain
areas
.
Therefore
,
mountains
could
have
acted
as
an
effective
geographical
barrier
to
limit
wild
boar
movements
and
guide
the
direction
of
the
spread
of
CSF
.
</p>
<p>
Another
concern
regarding
the
spread
of
the
disease
is
the
potential
for
it
to
jump
to
remote
areas
.
During
the
epidemic
,
CSFV
infections
were
confirmed
on
seven
farms
that
were
geographically
distant
from
,
but
epidemiologically
linked
,
to
the
farms
affected
by
CSFV
(
i.
e.
,
run
by
the
same
owner
,
supported
by
the
same
husbandry
company
,
etc.
)
.
Given
the
potential
for
transmission
of
the
virus
between
pigs
on
any
farms
or
from
wild
boar
near
that
farm
,
the
epidemiologically
related
farms
may
further
expand
the
spread
of
disease
.
This
“
disordered
”
spread
of
disease
could
affect
the
accuracy
of
spatio-temporal
analysis
by
overestimating
the
maximum
distance
of
significant
spatial
association
between
notifications
.
During
the
FMD
epidemic
in
Miyazaki
,
the
disease
was
confirmed
70
km
away
from
the
zone
of
movement
restriction
,
which
could
have
been
caused
by
vehicle
transportation
.
Unexpected
occurrences
of
disease
in
epidemiologically
related
farms
would
require
reviewing
farm
biosecurity
measures
,
as
well
as
disease
monitoring
protocols
.
</p>
<p>
In
the
present
study
,
the
results
of
the
multi-distance
spatial
cluster
analysis
revealed
that
the
maximum
distance
of
relationship
between
CSF
notifications
was
23
km
.
Because
of
the
small
number
of
CSF
outbreaks
on
domestic
pig
farms
,
we
estimated
the
maximum
distance
of
the
relationship
between
notifications
of
domestic
pigs
and
wild
boar
.
This
assumption
could
have
influenced
our
estimated
distance
resulting
in
overestimation
due
to
long
distance
spread
observed
on
domestic
pig
farms
.
Nevertheless
,
similar
approaches
have
studied
another
transboundary
animal
disease
,
African
swine
fever
(
ASF
)
,
which
shares
hosts
and
most
of
the
transmission
mechanisms
with
CSF
.
When
comparing
our
results
with
other
studies
,
the
estimated
distance
(
23
km
)
was
similar
to
that
obtained
for
notifications
of
ASF
in
domestic
pigs
(
15
km
)
and
wild
boar
(
25
km
)
in
Sardinia
.
This
finding
may
be
useful
for
setting
the
range
of
effective
surveillance
and
control
zones
in
the
affected
area
.
