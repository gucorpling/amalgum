Westhill
is
a
town
lying
approximately
to
the
west
of
Aberdeen
.
The
town
was
planned
and
built
on
former
farmland
in
the
1970s
and
continued
to
develop
primarily
as
a
commuter
town
,
however
a
small
industrial
park
was
developed
.
Recent
investment
has
seen
considerable
growth
in
the
commercial
and
industrial
sector
and
the
industrial
park
has
grown
considerably
.

<head>
By
car
</head>
<p>
The
A944
Aberdeen
to
Alford
road
passes
through
Westhill
.
The
road
is
largely
dual
2-lane
carriageway
into
Aberdeen
,
with
a
journey
time
of
approximately
20
–
30
minutes
,
and
a
decent
single
2-lane
carriageway
west
.
The
B9119
runs
immediately
south
of
the
industrial
park
and
provides
a
route
to
Banchory
and
Deeside
.
The
B979
,
which
skirts
the
west
and
north
,
runs
both
south
to
Stonehaven
via
Peterculter
and
north
to
the
airport/Dyce
via
the
A96
.
</p>
<head>
By
train
</head>
<p>
Westhill
is
not
served
by
rail
services
.
The
nearest
station
is
Aberdeen
from
which
both
buses
or
taxis
can
be
taken
.
Dyce
station
is
a
viable
alternative
to
Aberdeen
if
coming
in
from
the
Aberdeen
to
Inverness
line
,
however
there
are
no
bus
services
,
only
taxis
.
</p>
<head>
By
bus
</head>
<p>
Westhill
is
served
well
by
buses
.
Stagecoach
buses
run
the
frequent
X17
&quot;
express
&quot;
service
between
Aberdeen
and
Westhill
,
which
runs
through
the
west
end
of
Aberdeen
and
straight
out
the
main
road
.
Journey
times
are
approximately
30
minutes
with
a
daytime
frequency
of
12
minutes
.
Services

at
Aberdeen
Bus
Station
from
approximately
5:35AM
with
the
last
bus
departing
at
11:35PM
.
Evening
and
Sunday
frequency
is
between
1
and
2
buses
per

.
</p>
<p>
Further
journey
options
between
Aberdeen
and
Westhill
exist
in
the
form
of
the
218
,
which
runs
a
more
circuitous
route
through
Kingswells
,
Summerhill
and
Aberdeen
Royal
Infirmary
,
journey
time
approximately
60
minutes
.
Services
on
this
route
have
been
largely
cut
in
the
recent
(
April
2012
)
timetable
and
run
to
a
frequency
of
one
bus
every
2½
hours
.
Please
consult
timetables
if
using
this
service
to
avoid
a
long
wait
.
This
service
does
not
run
on
a
Sunday
.
</p>
<p>
Services
are
largely
on
modern
and
comfortable
buses
,
albeit
at
a
high
price
.
Buses
depart
from
Aberdeen
between
5:30AM
and
11:30PM
on
various
routes
.
Travellers
should
pay
attention
to
the
service
number
in
order
to
save
a
long
journey
or
even
missing
the
town
completely
(
it
can
be
a
long
walk
from
Elrick
to
the
hotels
in
the
cold
!
)
Night
Services
run
on
Saturday
and
Sunday
mornings
between
12:20AM
and
3:20AM
with
a
higher
price
(
£5
flat
fare
as
of
April
2012
)
.
</p>
<p>
Westhill
can
also
be
reached
by
bus
from
Alford
direction
on
the
218
service
and
from
Ballater
direction
on
the
210
service
(
there
is
also
a
rush
hour
only
service
to/from
Banchory
under
the
same
number
)
.
Buses
run
infrequently
on
the
218
and
extremely
sparsely
on
the
210
;
neither
service
runs
on
Sundays
.
There
is
a
rush
hour-only
bus
service
,
777
operated
by
Bains
Coaches
,
between
Oldmeldrum/Inverurie
and
the
airport
.
</p>
<head>
By
car
</head>
<p>
There
is
no
real
need
to
drive
due
to
the
small
size
of
town
,
however
should
you
choose
to
do
so
,
you
can
enjoy
roads
with
light
traffic
and
free
parking
all
over
town
.
</p>
<head>
By
bicycle
</head>
<p>
Westhill
is
cycle
friendly
,
all
main
roads
have
cycle
lanes
painted
on
them
and
an
abundance
of
mixed
cycle
and
footpaths
provides
for
an
excellent
off-road
alternative
.
</p>
<head>
By
bus
</head>
<p>
Locals
do
not
appear
to
use
the
bus
to
travel
within
the
town
(
a
town
service
ran
for
a
very
brief
period
of
time
but
was
withdrawn
due
to
lack
of
patronage
)
,
however
the
service
218
links
the
industrial
park
,
hotels
,
pubs
,
shops
and
golf
course
with
the
residential
areas
.
This
service
runs
relatively
infrequently
(
one
bus
per
2½
hours
approximately
)
and
may
not
prove
a
viable
option
.
It
may
be
more
prudent
to
source
a
taxi
,
most
premises
have
telephone
numbers
and
a
public
pay
phone
for
them
or
at
times
,
taxis
can
be
found
parked
adjacent
to
the
veterinary
surgery
behind
the
shopping
centre
.
</p>
<head>
By
foot
</head>
<p>
Westhill
is
small
enough
to
navigate
on
foot
for
visitors
.
Some
newer
housing
areas
are
a
considerable
distance
away
but
are
unlikely
to
be
of
attraction
to
visitors
.

Being
primarily
a
commuter
town
,
there
are
no
&quot;
sights
&quot;
to
see
in
Westhill
as
such
,
but
there
are
opportunities
for
scenic
