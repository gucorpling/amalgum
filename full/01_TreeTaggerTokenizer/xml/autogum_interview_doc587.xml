This

She

<hi rend="bold">
Jessica

We

in

I
've
got

we

So
.
Your
guide
is
Eric
Bickerton
,
and
he
did
win
a
medal
in
women
's
downhill
blind
skiing
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Jessica
Gallagher
:
</hi>
Yes
!

<p>
<hi rend="bold">
(

Despite
the
fact
that
he
is
neither
a
woman
nor
blind
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Jessica
Gallagher
:
</hi>
No
,
he
loves
telling
people
that
he
was
the
first
Australian
female
Paralympic
woman
to
win
a
medal
.
One
of
the
ironies
.

The
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/International_Paralympic_Committee">
IPC
</ref>
'
s
website
does
n't
list
guides
on
their
medal
things
.
Are
they
doing
that
because
they
do
n't
want
—
you
realise
this
is
not
all
about
you
<hi rend="italic">
per
se
</hi>
—
Is
it
because
they
are
trying
to
keep
off
the
able
bodied
people
to
make
the
Paralympics
seem
more
pure
for
people
with
disabilities
?
</p>
<p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Jessica
Gallagher
:
</hi>
Look
,
I
do
n't
know
but
I
completely
disagree
if
they
do
n't
have
the
guides
up
there
.
Because
it
's
pretty
plain
and
simple
:
I
would
n't
be
skiing
if
it
was
n't
with
him
.
Being
legally
blind
you
do
have
limitations
and
that
's
just
reality
.
We
're
certainly
able
to
overcome
most
of
them
.
And
when
it
comes
to
skiing
on
a
mountain
the
reason
I
'm
able
to
overcome
having
8
per
cent
vision
is
that
I
have
a
guide
.
So
I
think
it
's
pretty
poor
if
they
do
n't
have
the
information
up
there
because
he
does
as
much
work
as
I
do
.
He
's
an
athlete
as
much
as
I
am
.
If
he
crashes
we
're
both
out
.
He
's
drug
tested
.
He
's
as
important
as
I
am
on
a
race
course
.
So
I
would
strongly
hope
that
they
would
put
it
up
there
.
Here
's
Eric
!

Pleased

We
've
been
having
a
great
debate
about
whether
or
not
you
've
won
a
medal
in
women
's
blind
downhill
skiing
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Eric
Bickerton
:
</hi>
Yes
,
I
won
it
.
I
've
got
it

I
found
a
picture
of
you
on
the
ABC
web
site
.
Both
of
you
were
there
,
holding
your
medals
up
.
The
IPC
's
web
site
does
n't
credit
you
.
