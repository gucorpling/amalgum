This
trend
started
to
worry
me
with
e-mail
first
.
Because
of
spam
most
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet%20service%20provider">
ISPs
</ref>
stopped
relaying
mail
and
I
began
to
have
some
trouble
sending
e-mail
while
on
travel
.
To
send
mail
you
have
to
know
the
local
smtp
server
.
But
which
hotel
receptionist
can
tell
you
that
?
They
stare
blankly
at
you
,
incapable
of
understanding
that
you
do
not
use
web
mail
,
i.e.
that
you
do
not
have
your
messages
on
a
server
.
</p>
<p>
Money
is
virtual
,
it
is
a
number
on
a
computer
in
a
bank
somewhere
.
We
trust
the
bank
:
nobody
has
gold
coins
in
a
sock
under
the
mattress
.
</p>
<p>
But
we
have
been
working
on
the
banking
establishment
for
a
few
centuries
.
The
last
time
we
had
a
great
crash
(
depression
of
1929
)
not
only
a
large
number
of
people
died
of
hunger
,
but
it
helped
bring
about
the
most
totalitarian
state
we
ever
witnessed
(
the
Third
Reich
)
.
Since
those
days
we
have
learned
a
lot
,
painfully
and
with
lots
of
mishaps
.
</p>
<p>
Therefore
now
we
think
that
we
can
trust
the
banks
and
the
economists
with
our
money
.
The
breakthrough
came
from
government
controls
and
international
conventions
.
</p>
<p>
With
our
data
it
is
now
as
it
was
with
money
about
two
centuries
ago
:
everything
is
in
the
hands
of
uncontrolled
private
companies
,
without
any
legal
framework
,
to
say
nothing
of
international
agreements
.
</p>
<p>
But
my
data
are
a
part
of
myself
.
I
want
to
know
how
my
data
are
managed
,
by
whom
,
where
,
and
with
what
guarantees
.
Money
I
may
lose
but
then
I
grow
my
potatoes
in
my
garden
.
</p>
<p>
You
speak
of
a
web-Renaissance
.
That
would
be
a
brilliant
light
that
would
let
us
see
that
in
the
information-driven
era
we
need
to
build
new
social
structures
,
new
forms
of
creating
trust
and
we
need
more
transparency
in
the
processes
of
society
.

Wikinews
</hi>
:
The
principle
behind
wikis
such
as
Wikipedia
provides
similar
functionalities
to
early
web
browsers
that
were
web
editors
at
the
same
time
.
To
which
extent
is
this
analogy
correct
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Robert
Cailliau
</hi>
:
The
one
great
difference
,
maybe
,
is
that
wikis
run
on
servers
,
but
I
can
of
course
put
a
wiki
on
my
home
computer
or
laptop
.
It
's
not
really
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">
wysiwyg
</ref>
but
that
is
not
so
important
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Wikinews
</hi>
:
Do
you
see
wikis
as
a
viable
long-term
model
,
or
do
you
expect
something
else
to
emerge
?
On
the
subjects
of
wikis
,
do
you
refer
to
Wikipedia
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Robert
Cailliau
</hi>
:
I
use
the
Wikipedia
often
.
I
also
contribute
here
and
there
.
A
very
great
work
,
looked
at
with
a
lot
of
jealousy
.
In
almost
all
comments
about
the
Wikipedia
I
perceive
in
the
background
some
jealousy
and
intolerance
.
</p>
<p>
There
seems
to
be
a
strong
reaction
from
those
who
derive
their
prestige
from
&quot;
secret
&quot;
knowledge
and
consequently
find
it
rather
scandalous
that
everything
is
now
not
only
lying
around
to
be
read
but
also
often
debunks
their
prejudices
.
