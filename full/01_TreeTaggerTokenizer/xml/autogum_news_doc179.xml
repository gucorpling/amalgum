The

was
defeated
by

as

argued
the
recent
events
in
Syria
were
a
&quot;
humanitarian
catastrophe
,
and
if
there
are
no
consequences
for
it
,
there
is
nothing
to
stop
Assad
and
other
dictators
from
using
these
weapons
again
and
again
&quot;
.
The
motion
rejected
by
the
Commons
said
the
House
&quot;
agrees
that
a
strong
humanitarian
response
is
required
from
the
international
community
and
that
this
may
,
if
necessary
,
require
military
action
&quot;
,
and
such
action
would
be
&quot;
legal
,
proportionate
and
focused
on
saving
lives
by
preventing
and
deterring
further
use
of
Syria
's
chemical
weapons
&quot;
.

<p>
Thirty
Conservative
MPs

nine

said
the
proposal
to
go
to
war
was
an
&quot;
ill-thought
through
action
&quot;
,
it
lacked
international
support
,
and
Cameron
had
acted
in
a
&quot;
cavalier
and
reckless

manner

the
sole
intention

to

the

cannot

no

<p>
Labour
proposed
an
opposing
motion
that
called
for
the
government
to
present
&quot;
compelling
&quot;
evidence
before
action
,
which
was
rejected
as
well
as
the

motion
.

defeat

Parliament
is
entirely
unpredictable
sometimes
and
I
do

think
many

saw
this
coming

<p>
Philip
Hammond
,
the
Defence
Secretary
,
confirmed
that
following
the
vote
,
the
country
would
not
participate
in
any
action
in
Syria
,
but
he
noted
he
expected
the

to
carry
on
without
the
UK
,
anticipating
&quot;
the
US
and
other
countries
will
continue
to
look
at
responses
to
the
chemical
attack
.
They
will
be
disappointed
that
Britain
will
not
be
involved
.
I
do
n't
expect
that
the
lack
of
British
participation
will
stop
any
action
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Hammond
noted
the
rejection
of
military
intervention
would
strain
the

special
relationship
