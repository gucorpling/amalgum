All
of
the
humanity
knows
how
to
think
,
but
have
you
ever
tried
to
think
in
a
way
that
you
know
your
thinking
is
right
?
Have
you
pushed
your
thinking
to
the
limits
?
Ordinary
people
like
us
have
made
inventions
for
many
years
.
For
instance
,
Thomas
Edison
had
invented
electricity
,
Albert
Einstein
had
created
the
theory
of
the
speed
of
light
,
and
Isaac
Newton
exposed
the
law
of
gravity
.
These
individuals
neither
were
not
super
heroes
nor
were
they
extra-ordinary
people
.
What
they
all
did
were
using
their
brains
and
knew
how
to
think
in
an
unadulterated
way
.
The
apple
that
fell
on
Newton
’s
head
made
him
think
.
If
he
had
n’t
sit
under
the
apple
tree
,
maybe
he
would
n’t
have
established
the
laws
of
gravity
.
Also
,
if
there
were
not
Edison
,
we
would
n’t
get
electricity
ever
.
Nowadays
,
scientists
still
using
the
laws
of
these
old-school
scientists
to
discover
new
theories
and
develop
new
advances
to
help
the
humanity
live
a
modern
life
style
.
In
the
same
way
,
Apple
Company
would
n’t
be
that
popular
if
it
did
n’t
have
the
creator
of
iPhones
(
Steve
Jobs
)
.
There
are
many
successful
people
who
have
altered
the
whole
humanity
by
bringing
new
ideas
to
human
’s
life-style
.
This
article
is
a
simple
guide
that
could
give
you
a
unique
description
to
let
a
person
exploit
his/her
time
to
benefit
the
human
beings
,
raise
his/her
name
,
and
get
good
profit
.
There
are
a
lot
of
people
who
have
skills
that
they
are
not
going
to
find
in
others
.
At
the
same
time
,
they
do
not
exploit
their
talents
and
show
the
world
how
much
they
are
skillful
.

Every
moment
you
fall
down
,
try
to
talk
with
someone
that
is
really
close
to
you
.
That
one
might
know
you
more
than
yourself
,
and
he/she
could
give
you
enough
motivation
to
make
you
stand
up
again
and
keep
moving
forward
.
The
reason
is
sometimes
motivational
advises
would
push
a
person
to
the
limits
and
inspire
him/her
achieve
his/her
goals
.
And
,
by
saying
surroundings
I
do
n’t
mean
that
you
should
just
talk
with
people
.
You
might
get
motivated
by
watching
a
movie
,
a
picture
of
something
that
could
touch
you
hard
,
or
a
circumstance
that
might
change
the
whole
of
your
personality
in
a
small
period
of
time
.
“
Motivation
is
the
art
of
getting
people
to
do
what
you
want
them
to
do
because
they
want
to
do
it
.
”
Dwight
D.
Eisenhower
.
On
the
other
hand
,
train
yourself
to
motivate
yourself
is
a
conjecture
that
lead
a
person
to
inspire
himself
by
visualizing
positive
thinking
in
his/her
brain
.
This
state
could
vary
many
dis-courage
people

Most
of
you
might
think
and
say
that
this
section
is
totally
weird
.
But
,
after
all
,
most
of
the
time
,
reading
books
would
change
a
person
’s
life
in
many
aspects
.
First
,
he/she
will
get
new
information
as
well
as
being
more
educated
,
and
the
feeling
of
being
educated
is
really
an
astonishing
reaction
.
Intellectuality
will
increase
a
person
’s
confidence
.
Try
not
to
read
a
book
,
do
n’t
even
watch
T.
V
,
and
do
n’t
read
any
newspaper
or
magazine
for
a
year
.
Just
hang
out
with
your
friends
and
do
n’t
talk
about
any
new
ideas
or
any
new
things
.
Try
to
talk
about
a
specific
thing
that
you
want
to
talk
about
every
time
.
You
will
realize
that
you
are
in
an
“
everyday
routine
cycle
”
and
this
will
lead
you
to
get
psychological
issues
.
A
person
might
be
frustrated
and
feel
that
he/she
has
not
achieved
any
single
ambitions
while
they
might
be
really
smart
and
ambitious
.
This
life
is
full
of
spots
of
success
,
but
we
should
have
enough
to
know
how
to
fill
these
spots
.
“
Whenever
you
read
a
good
book
,
somewhere
in
the
world
a
door
opens
to
allow
in
more
light
.

It
is
has
been
said
many
times
that
people
have
to
learn
from
their
mistakes
.
But
,
have
you
ever
thought
to
learn
from
others
’
failures
?
Probably
not
.
According
to
Bill
Gates
,
“
It
is
fine
to
celebrate
success
but
it
is
more
important
to
heed
the
lessons
of
failure
.
