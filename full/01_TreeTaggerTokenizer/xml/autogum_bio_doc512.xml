Little
is
known
about
his
early
life
.
He
was
born
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barges">
Barges
</ref>
.
Like
many
of
his
countrymen
,
he
received
a
good
musical
education
in
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Countries">
Low
Countries
</ref>
,
and
either
in
youth
or
early
adulthood
came
to
Italy
,
where
employment
prospects
for
singers
and
composers
were
better
than
at
home
.
By
1550
he
had
become
<hi rend="italic">
maestro
di
cappella
</hi>
(
choirmaster
)
at
the
church
of
Santa
Maria
Gloriosa
dei
Frari
(
known
as
the
Ca
'
Grande
)
in
Venice
,
a
prestigious
post
.
He
left
Venice
in
1555
,
going
to
Treviso
,
where
he
became
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franciscan_order">
Franciscan
</ref>
and
joined
the
convent
of
San
Francesco
.
Further
records
show
that
he
was
employed
at
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treviso_Cathedral">

between
1562
and

No
further
records
of
his
life
have
yet
been
found
,
and
he
has
not
yet
been
the
subject
of
a
dedicated
scholarly
biography
.
</p>
<p>
Barges
venerated
his
teacher
and
friend
Willaert
,
and
mentioned
him
glowingly
in
the
dedication
to
his
first
book
of
villotte
(
<hi rend="italic">

Venice
:
Gardano
,

)
:
&quot;
l'unico
inventore
della
vera
e
buona
musica
&quot;
(
&quot;
the
sole
inventor
of
music
which
is
true
and
good
.
&quot;
)
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page#cite_note-3">

Indeed
,
friendship
is
a
theme
of
the
dedication
:
in
addition
to
the
reference
to
Willaert
,
Barges
characterizes
his
relationship
with
Girolamo
Fenaruolo
,
the
dedicatee
,
as
a
friendship
,
and
mentions
their
mutual
friends
Stefano
Taberio
and
Marco
Silvio
.

If
Barges
's
dedication
is
to
be
believed
,
these
men
were
among
the
first
to
hear
and
sing
his
songs
,
but
the
songs
might
also
have
found
a
home
in
Domenico
Venier
's
salon
.

<p>
Barges
published
only
this
one
book
of
light
secular
music
,
although
it
contains
music
besides
villottas
such
as
a
dozen
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villanella">
villanescas
</ref>
and
four
madrigals
not
by
Barges
but
by
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Patricio">
Andrea
Patricio
</ref>
(
composers
at
this
time
often
admitted
a
few
works
by
others
into
their
publications
)
.
Other
music
by
Barges
included
some
sacred
works
,
including
two
motets
for
four
voices
,
published
in
1563
,
an
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alleluia">
Alleluia

,
and
a
Requiem
for
four
voices
(
not
dated
)
.
It
is
not
known
if
he
wrote
this
for
Willaert
.
The
style
of
the
secular
music
is
as
light
as
anything
found
in
northern
Italy
at
the
time
:
dancelike
,
quick
,
often
triple
meter
,
and
often
with
nonsense
syllables
in
a
