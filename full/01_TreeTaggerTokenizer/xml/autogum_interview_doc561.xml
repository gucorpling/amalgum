Why
have
you
chosen
to
involve
yourself
in
the
political
process
?
Why
did
you
choose
to
run
in
this
constituency
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
I
believe
that
it
's
time
working
families
got
both
a
fair
deal
and
increased
representation
in
Queen
’s
Park
.
I
live
and
grew
up
in
the
riding
of
Bramalea
Gore
Malton
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
What
do
you
feel
are
the
three
most
important
issues
to
voters
in
your
riding
?
Are
these
the
same
top
three
issues
that
are
most
important
to
you
?
What
would
you
do
to
address
these
issues
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
I
believe
that
the
three
most
important
issues
are
:
</p>
<p>
<list type="ordered">
<item>
The
$10/hr
living
wage
</item>
<item>
The
availability
of
good
paying
jobs
</item>
<item>
Making
life
affordable
</item>
</list>
</p>
<p>
To
address
the
issues
:
</p>
<p>
Pass
the
living
wage
act
NOW
.
If
the
MPP
’s
can
vote
themselves
a
31
%
pay
raise
,
why
ca
n’t
we
have
a
living
wage
today
?
</p>
<p>
In
exchange
for
job
creation
&amp;
preservation
guarantees
,
provide
manufacturing
and
resource
companies
with
a
stable
hydro
rate
.
Beef
up
existing
employment
standards
to
ensure
that
companies
are
discouraged
from
buying
businesses
just
to
close
them
down
.
When
a
closure
ca
n’t
be
avoided
improve
both
the
severance
pay
and
increase
the
notice
to
reflect
the
job
market
of
today
.
</p>
<p>
We
need
to
ensure
that
the
provincial
government
uses
it
influence
to
make
sure
that
consumers
get
a
fair
deal
from
their
auto
insurance
companies
,
banks
,
payroll
loans
and
oil
companies
.
Since
for
working
families
these
expenses
can
make
the
difference
living
in
or
out
of
poverty
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
What
should
be
the
first
order
of
business
in
the
39th
Legislative
Assembly
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
Pass
the
living
wage
act
,
followed
by
auto
insurance
reform
and
increasing
the
services
available
to
developmentally
delayed
adults
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Are
the
property
taxes
in
your
riding
at
a
fair
level
for
the
amount
of
services
received
in
the
municipality
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
I
believe
that
property
taxes
are
too
high
and
unfairly
target
people
on
fixed
incomes
who
can
least
afford
the
increases
.
One
of
the
main
reasons
that
they
are
high
is
due
to
provincial
downloading
.
The
NDP
plans
to
upload
a
number
of
provincially
mandated
services
starting
with
public
transit
and
court
security
first
in
January
2008
.
Followed
by
Ontario
Disability
Support
Program
and
the
Ontario
Drug
Benefit
Program
by
2011
.
We
would
be
on
track
to
upload
the
download
that
was
imposed
on
property
tax
payers
by
the
Mike
Harris
conservative
government
by
2015
.
This
would
free
up
money
that
the
cities
can
then
use
to
either
fund
or
enhance
the
services
that
they
offer
to
their
citizens
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
How
can
the
province
lead
the
way
in
stimulating
job
creation
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
Since
hydro
can
be
one
of
a
company
’s
largest
costs
,
our
industrial
hydro
rate
will
give
resource
and
manufacturing
industries
access
to
low
cost
hydro
to
ensure
that
our
rates
do
not
cause
a
company
to
move
out
of
the
province
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
What
are
your
views
on
the
mixed
member
proportional
representation
(
MMP
)
referendum
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
I
believe
that
the
majority
threshold
has
been
set
to
high
it
should
be
50
%
+
1
not
60
%
.
Part
of
our
platform
on
electoral
reform
would
be
the
limiting
of
political
contributions
to
individuals
only
.
This
would
prevent
large
corporations
from
making
huge
donations
and
giving
that
political
party
an
unfair
advantage
when
it
comes
to
getting
their
message
out
to
the
voters
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
What
role
,
if
any
,
does
&quot;
new
media
&quot;
play
in
your
campaign
,
and
the
campaign
of
your
party
?
(
websites
,
blogs
,
Facebook
,
YouTube
videos
,
etc
)
Do
you
view
it
as
beneficial
,
or
a
challenge
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
I
believe
that
the
“
new
media
”
provides
an
excellent
source
of
information
on
both
the
candidate
as
well
as
the
political
party
that
they
representing
.
For
those
who
are
internet
savy
a
web
site
is
the
quickest
method
of
getting
this
information
.
The
challenge
is
to
keep
the
information
on
the
web
site
relevant
as
well
as
finding
the
time
to
update
it
.
It
’s
a
great
benefit
to
someone
who
may
not
be
able
to
meet
the
candidate
face
to
face
.
