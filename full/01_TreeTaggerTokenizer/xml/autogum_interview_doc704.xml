A
Safe
Environment
and
Our
Community
Health
</hi>
:
Our
community
worked
hard
to
shut
down
the
incinerators
at
Ashbridges
Bay
Sewage
Treatment
Plant
-the
biggest
producer
of
carbon-dioxide
emissions
and
other
significant
airborne
contaminants
of
all
of
the
City
's
facilities
.
Today
,
our
community
's
health
and
environment
is
greatly
improved
because
of
this
shutdown
.
However
,
the
need
to
find
a
garbage
solution
for
Toronto
has
placed
a
spotlight
on
this
site
as
a
potential
location
to
build
a
garbage
incinerator
.
It
is
important
that
our
community
play
an
active
role
to
ensure
that
thoughtful
decisions
are
made
.

Planning
Development
Change
</hi>
:
The
popularity
of
the
Beach
has
currently
stimulated
significant
developer
interest
in
land
assembly
.
The
need
to
protect
the
unique
character
of
our
neighbourhoods
is
a
critical
and
key
concern
.
The
new
Official
Plan
will
be
put
to
the
test
in
upcoming
development
applications
verses
the
over-arching
Provincial
Planning
Act
and
the
Ontario
Municipal
Board
.
I
will
push
for
&quot;
fine
grain
&quot;
tools
that
recognize
the
need
to
protect
mature
neighbourhoods
,
as
well
as
to
provide
design
guidelines
to
support
the
unique
character
of
our
neighbourhoods
.
Strongly
enhancing
community
engagement
in
all
aspects
of
the
planning
process
is
also
needed
.

Clean
Beach
and
Waterfront
Renewal
Strategy
</hi>
:
The
development
of
Toronto
's
waterfront
is
a
key
goal
.
The
success
of
the
Beaches-East
York
community
is
attributed
,
in
part
,
to
its
interface
with
Lake
Ontario
.
I
am
proud
of
the
work
underway
to
create
significant
landscape
improvements
at
Ashbridges
Bay
which
will
be
included
in
the
expansive
750
acre
Lake
Ontario
Park
,
stretching
from
the
eastern
border
of
Scarborough
to
the
westerly
edge
of
Etobicoke
.
I
will
push
the
major
clean-up
of
Coatsworth
Cut/Ashbridges
Bay
.
The
Balmy
Beach
area
is
also
earmarked
for
the
&quot;
Clean
Beaches
Strategy
&quot;
which
is
a
priority
for
me
.
</p>
<p>
The
major
skateboard
park
I
am
building
for
the
youth
and
young-at-heart
is
to
be
completed
in
2007
-for
all
to
enjoy
.

Q
:
</hi>
What
one
election
issue
do
you
feel
is
most
relevant
to
your
ward
in
this
election
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
A
:
</hi>
The
looming
garbage
solution
is
a
key
issue
.
The
expansive
lands
at
Ashbridges
Bay
and
the
Eastern
Portlands
are
zoned
to
accommodate
such
heavy
industrial
uses
.
Our
community
and
I
will
be
vigilant
and
active
in
the
process
underway
by
a
citizen
selected
advisory
team
(
CEAT
)
to
recommend
both
the
technology
and
the
site
for
the
method
of
disposing
of
the
City
's
residual
waste
.
