When
Diotti
and
old
Sanders
left
the
house
they
walked
rapidly
down
Fifth
Avenue
.
It
was
after
eleven
,
and
the
streets
were
bare
of
pedestrians
,
but
blinking-eyed
cabs
came
up
the
avenue
,
looking
at
a
distance
like
a
trail
of
Megatheriums
,
gliding
through
the
darkness
.
The
piercing
wind
made
the
men
hasten
their
steps
,
the
old
man
by
a
semi-rotary
motion
keeping
up
with
the
longer
strides
and
measured
tread
of
the
younger
.
</p>
<p>
When
they
reached
Fourteenth
Street
,
the
elder
said
,
&quot;
I
live
but
a
block
from
here
,
&quot;
pointing
eastward
;
&quot;
what
do
you
say
to
a
hot
toddy
?
It
will
warm
the
cockles
of
your
heart
;
come
over
to
my
house
and
I
'll
mix
you
the
best
drink
in
New
York
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
younger
thought
the
suggestion
a
good
one
and
they
turned
toward
the
house
of
old
Sanders
.
</p>
<p>
It
was
a
neat
,
red
brick
,
two-story
house
,
well
in
from
the
street
,
off
the
line
of
the
more
pretentious
buildings
on
either
side
.
As
the
old
man
opened
the
iron
gate
,
the
police
officer
on
the
beat
passed
;
he
peered
into
the
faces
of
the
men
,
and
recognizing
Sanders
,
said
,
&quot;
tough
night
,
sir
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Very
,
&quot;
replied
the
addressed
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
All
good
old
gentlemen
should
be
in
bed
at
this
hour
,
&quot;
said
the
officer
,
lifting
one
foot
after
the
other
in
an
effort
to
keep
warm
,
and
in
so
doing
showing
little
terpsichorean
grace
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
It
's
only
the
shank
of
the
evening
,
officer
,
&quot;
rejoined
the
old
man
,
as
he
fumbled
with
the
latch
key
and
finally
opened
the
door
.
The
two
men
entered
and
the
officer
passed
on
.
</p>
<p>
Every
man
has
a
fad
.
One
will
tell
you
he
sees
nothing
in
billiards
or
pool
or
golf
or
tennis
,
but
will
grow
enthusiastic
over
the
scientific
possibilities
of
mumble-peg
;
you
agree
with
him
,
only
you
substitute
&quot;
skittles
&quot;
for
&quot;
mumble-peg
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Old
Sanders
'
fad
was
mixing
toddies
and
punches
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
The
nectar
of
the
gods
pales
into
nothingness
when
compared
with
a
toddy
such
as
I
make
,
&quot;
said
he
.
&quot;
Ambrosia
may
have
been
all
right
for
the
degenerates
of
the
old
Grecian
and
Roman
days
,
but
an
American
gentleman
demands
a
toddy
--
a
hot
toddy
.
&quot;
And
then
he
proceeded
with
circumspection
and
dignity
to
demonstrate
the
process
of
decocting
that
mysterious
beverage
.
</p>
<p>
The
two
men
took
off
their
overcoats
and
went
into
the
sitting-room
.
A
pile
of
logs
burned
brightly
in
the
fire-place
.
The
old
man
threw
another
on
the
burning
heap
,
filled
the
kettle
with
water
and
hung
it
over
the
fire
.
Next
he
went
to
the
sideboard
and
brought
forth
the
various
ingredients
for
the
toddy
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
How
do
you
like
America
?
&quot;
said
the
elder
,
with
commonplace
indifference
,
as
he
crunched
a
lump
of
sugar
in
the
bottom
of
the
glass
,
dissolving
the
particles
with
a
few
drops
of
water
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Very
much
,
indeed
,
&quot;
said
the
Tuscan
,
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
had
answered
the
question
before
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Great
country
for
girls
!
&quot;
said
Sanders
,
pouring
a
liberal
quantity
of
Old
Tom
gin
in
the
glass
and
placing
it
where
it
gradually
would
get
warm
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
And
for
men
!
&quot;
responded
Diotti
,
enthusiastically
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Men
do
n't
amount
to
much
here
,
women
run
everything
,
&quot;
retorted
the
elder
,
while
he
repeated
the
process
of
preparing
the
sugar
and
gin
in
the
second
glass
.
The
kettle
began
to
sing
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
That
's
music
for
you
,
&quot;
chuckled
the
old
man
,
raising
the
lid
to
see
if
the
water
had
boiled
sufficiently
.
&quot;
Do
you
know
I
think
a
dinner
horn
and
a
singing
kettle
beat
a
symphony
all
hollow
for
real
down-right
melody
,
&quot;
and
he
lifted
the
kettle
from
the
fire-place
.
</p>
<p>
Diotti
smiled
.
</p>
<p>
With
mathematical
accuracy
the
old
man
filled
the
two
tumblers
with
boiling
water
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Try
that
,
&quot;
handing
a
glass
of
the
toddy
to
Diotti
;
&quot;
you
will
find
it
all
right
,
&quot;
and
the
old
man
drew
an
armchair
toward
the
fire-place
,
smacking
his
lips
in
anticipation
.
</p>
<p>
The
violinist
placed
his
chair
closer
to
the
fire
and
sipped
the
drink
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Your
country
is
noted
for
its
beautiful
women
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
We
have
exquisite
types
of
femininity
in
Tuscany
,
&quot;
said
the
young
man
,
with
patriotic
ardor
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Any
as
fine
looking
as
--
as
--
as
--
well
,
say
the
young
lady
we
dined
with
to-night
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Miss
Wallace
?
&quot;
queried
the
Tuscan
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Yes
,
Miss
Wallace
,
&quot;
this
rather
impatiently
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
She
is
very
beautiful
,
&quot;
said
Diotti
,
with
solemn
admiration
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Have
you
ever
seen
any
one
prettier
?
&quot;
questioned
the
old
man
,
after
a
second
prolonged
sip
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
have
no
desire
to
see
any
one
more
beautiful
,
&quot;
said
the
violinist
,
feeling
that
the
other
was
trying
to
draw
him
out
,
and
determined
not
to
yield
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
You
will
pardon
the
inquisitiveness
of
an
old
man
,
but
are
not
you
musicians
a
most
impressionable
lot
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
We
are
human
,
&quot;
answered
the
violinist
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
imagined
you
were
like
sailors
and
had
a
sweetheart
in
every
port
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
That
would
be
a
delightful
prospect
to
one
having
polygamous
aspirations
,
but
for
myself
,
one
sweetheart
is
enough
,
&quot;
laughingly
said
the
musician
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Only
one
!
Well
,
here
's
to
her
!
With
this
nectar
fit
for
the
gods
and
goddesses
of
Olympus
,
let
us
drink
to
her
,
&quot;
said
old
Sanders
,
with
convivial
dignity
,
his
glass
raised
on
high
.
&quot;
Here
's
wishing
health
and
happiness
to
the
dreamy-eyed
Tuscan
beauty
,
whom
you
love
and
who
loves
you
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Stop
!
&quot;
said
Diotti
;
&quot;
we
will
drink
to
the
first
part
of
that
toast
,
&quot;
and
holding
his
glass
against
that
of
his
bibulous
host
,
continued
:
&quot;
To
the
dreamy-eyed
women
of
my
country
,
exacting
of
their
lovers
;
obedient
to
their
parents
and
loyal
to
their
husbands
,
&quot;
and
his
voice
rose
in
sonorous
rhythm
with
the
words
.
