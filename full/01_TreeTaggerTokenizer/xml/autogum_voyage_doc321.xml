Niseko
is
an
increasingly
popular
destination
for
powder
hungry
skiers
and
boarders
,
and
nearly
alone

increasing
numbers
of
overseas
visitors
year-on-year
as
well
.
Niseko
is
highly

Asian
tourists

Hirafu
,
approximately
20

Reaching
Niseko
from
Sapporo
by
train
is
a
tricky
affair
,
requiring
a
transfer
of
trains
at
<ref target="Otaru">
Otaru
</ref>
,
and
perhaps
a
long
wait
as
well
;
there
are
only
six
daily
local
trains
between
Otaru
and
Niseko
.
But
,
if
it
's
between
December
and
March
,
and
you
decide
to
leave
Sapporo
at
around
8:00
or
12:30
,
you
can
get
to
Niseko
on
a
direct
train
.
The
limited

,
appropriately
named
the
<hi rend="italic">

makes
the
run
in
