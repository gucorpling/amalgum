Introduction

<p>
Bone
disorders
,
especially
osteoporosis
,
are
becoming
increasingly
prevalent
as
the
aging
population
grows
,
and
bone
fractures
also
occur
frequently
.
Osteoporosis
contributes
significantly
to
global
healthcare
costs
,
and
the
treatment
of
osteoporosis
remains
a
great
challenge
.
Thus
,
new
bone
anabolic
drugs
need
to
be
developed
for
the
prevention
and
treatment
of
osteoporosis
.
</p>
<p>
Bone
morphogenetic
protein
2
(
BMP2
)
is
one
of
the
most
important
growth
factors
that
induce
osteoblast
differentiation
and
stimulate
bone
or
cartilage
formation
.
BMP2
has
been
widely
used
in
the
clinic
to
promote
bone
formation
.
However
,
the
therapeutic
dose
of
BMP2
is
very
expensive
,
and
there
are
some
life-threatening
side
effects
that
can
occur
with
larger
doses
.
Hence
,
it
is
necessary
to
find
additional
agents
or
methods
for
the
improvement
of
BMP2
itself
to
intensify
the
osteogenic
effects
of
BMP2
.
The
combination
of
BMP2
and
these
small
molecules
can
promote
BMP2-mediated
osteoblast
differentiation
and
reduces
the
risk
of
its
side
effects
in
the
treatment
of
bone
diseases
.
From
a
clinical
perspective
,
these
small
molecules
that
regulate
BMP2
activity
provide
powerful
tools
for
the
treatment
of
osteoporosis
and
fracture
repair
.
</p>
<p>
Icariin
(
ICA
)
(
the
chemical
structure
is
shown
in
<figure>
Figure

</figure>
)
is
the
main
active
flavonoid
glucoside
from
herbs
of
the
genus
<hi rend="italic">
Epimedium
</hi>
;
these
herbs
are
used
in
traditional
Chinese
medicine
and
have
long
been
prescribed
for
the
treatment
of
bone
fractures
and
osteoporosis
as
a
bone-protecting
agent
.
In
addition
to
promoting
bone
regeneration
and
repair
,
ICA
also
has
many
beneficial
pharmacological
and
biological
activities
,
including
neuroprotective
effects
;
protective
effects
against
atherosclerosis
;
antitumor
effects
;
anti-inflammatory
and
antioxidant
effects
;
and
improved
sexual
function
effects
.
Several
animal
and
cell
studies
have
shown
that
treatment
with
ICA
can
increase
osteogenic
differentiation
and
reduce
bone
loss
in
vivo
and
in
vitro
.
The
extremely
low
cost
of
ICA
and
its
strong
bone
regenerative
effects
indicate
its
potential
in
clinical
applications
.
</p>
<p>
The
cAMP/PKA/CREB
axis
is
a
vital
pathway
that
regulates
osteogenic
differentiation
and
mineralization
.
Several
previous
studies
have
reported
that
PTH
affects
osteoblastic
cells
by
activating
the
cAMP/PKA/CREB
axis
.
Several
studies
have
reported
that
pretreatment
of
human
mesenchymal
stem
cells
(
MSCs
)
with
cAMP
analogs
,
adenylate
cyclase
activators
or
phosphodiesterase
inhibitors
can
enhance
bone
formation
.
</p>
<p>
In
the
present
study
,
we
combined
ICA
and
BMP2
to
promote
osteogenesis
for
the
first
time
.
We
aimed
to
determine
whether
ICA
could
enhance
the
osteogenic
induction
of
BMP2
in
C2C12
cells
.
We
concluded
that
the
combination
of
ICA
and
BMP2
could
promote
BMP2-mediated
osteoblast
differentiation
in
a
dose-dependent
manner
.
We
also
found
that
ICA
stimulates
BMP2-mediated
osteogenesis
by
activating
the
cAMP/PKA/CREB
signaling
pathway
.
Therefore
,
ICA
is
a
promising
candidate
as
an
alternative
for
BMP2
or
as
a
promoter
for
enhancing
the
therapeutic
effects
of
BMP2
.
This
combination
will
reduce
the
risk
of
side
effects
from
BMP2
in
the
treatment
of
bone
diseases
such
as
osteoporosis
.
