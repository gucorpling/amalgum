Marilla
Adopts
Twins
</head>
<p>
Mrs.
Rachel
Lynde
was
sitting
at
her
kitchen
window
,
knitting
a
quilt
,
just
as
she
had
been
sitting
one
evening
several
years
previously
when
Matthew
Cuthbert
had
driven
down
over
the
hill
with
what
Mrs.
Rachel
called
“
his
imported
orphan
.
”
But
that
had
been
in
springtime
;
and
this
was
late
autumn
,
and
all
the
woods
were
leafless
and
the
fields
sere
and
brown
.
The
sun
was
just
setting
with
a
great
deal
of
purple
and
golden
pomp
behind
the
dark
woods
west
of
Avonlea
when
a
buggy
drawn
by
a
comfortable
brown
nag
came
down
the
hill
.
Mrs.
Rachel
peered
at
it
eagerly
.
</p>
<p>
“
There
’s
Marilla
getting
home
from
the
funeral
,
”
she
said
to
her
husband
,
who
was
lying
on
the
kitchen
lounge
.
Thomas
Lynde
lay
more
on
the
lounge
nowadays
than
he
had
been
used
to
do
,
but
Mrs.
Rachel
,
who
was
so
sharp
at
noticing
anything
beyond
her
own
household
,
had
not
as
yet
noticed
this
.
“
And
she
’s
got
the
twins
with
her
,
.
.
.
yes
,
there
’s
Davy
leaning
over
the
dashboard
grabbing
at
the
pony
’s
tail
and
Marilla
jerking
him
back
.
Dora
’s
sitting
up
on
the
seat
as
prim
as
you
please
.
She
always
looks
as
if
she
’d
just
been
starched
and
ironed
.
Well
,
poor
Marilla
is
going
to
have
her
hands
full
this
winter
and
no
mistake
.
Still
,
I
do
n’t
see
that
she
could
do
anything
less
than
take
them
,
under
the
circumstances
,
and
she
’ll
have
Anne
to
help
her
.
Anne
’s
tickled
to
death
over
the
whole
business
,
and
she
has
a
real
knacky
way
with
children
,
I
must
say
.
Dear
me
,
it
does
n’t
seem
a
day
since
poor
Matthew
brought
Anne
herself
home
and
everybody
laughed
at
the
idea
of
Marilla
bringing
up
a
child
.
And
now
she
has
adopted
twins
.
You
’re
never
safe
from
being
surprised
till
you
’re
dead
.
”
</p>
<p>
The
fat
pony
jogged
over
the
bridge
in
Lynde
’s
Hollow
and
along
the
Green
Gables
lane
.
Marilla
’s
face
was
rather
grim
.
It
was
ten
miles
from
East
Grafton
and
Davy
Keith
seemed
to
be
possessed
with
a
passion
for
perpetual
motion
.
It
was
beyond
Marilla
’s
power
to
make
him
sit
still
and
she
had
been
in
an
agony
the
whole
way
lest
he
fall
over
the
back
of
the
wagon
and
break
his
neck
,
or
tumble
over
the
dashboard
under
the
pony
’s
heels
.
In
despair
she
finally
threatened
to
whip
him
soundly
when
she
got
him
home
.
Whereupon
Davy
climbed
into
her
lap
,
regardless
of
the
reins
,
flung
his
chubby
arms
about
her
neck
and
gave
her
a
bear-like
hug
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
do
n’t
believe
you
mean
it
,
”
he
said
,
smacking
her
wrinkled
cheek
affectionately
.
“
You
do
n’t
LOOK
like
a
lady
who
’d
whip
a
little
boy
just
‘
cause
he
could
n’t
keep
still
.
Did
n’t
you
find
it
awful
hard
to
keep
still
when
you
was
only
‘
s
old
as
me
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
No
,
I
always
kept
still
when
I
was
told
,
”
said
Marilla
,
trying
to
speak
sternly
,
albeit
she
felt
her
heart
waxing
soft
within
her
under
Davy
’s
impulsive
caresses
.
</p>
<p>
“
Well
,
I
s’pose
that
was
‘
cause
you
was
a
girl
,
”
said
Davy
,
squirming
back
to
his
place
after
another
hug
.
“
You
WAS
a
girl
once
,
I
s’pose
,
though
it
’s
awful
funny
to
think
of
it
.
Dora
can
sit
still
.
.
.
but
there
ai
n’t
much
fun
in
it
<hi rend="italic">
I
</hi>
do
n’t
think
.
Seems
to
me
it
must
be
slow
to
be
a
girl
.
Here
,
Dora
,
let
me
liven
you
up
a
bit
.
”
</p>
<p>
Davy
’s
method
of
“
livening
up
”
was
to
grasp
Dora
’s
curls
in
his
fingers
and
give
them
a
tug
.
Dora
shrieked
and
then
cried
.
</p>
<p>
“
How
can
you
be
such
a
naughty
boy
and
your
poor
mother
just
laid
in
her
grave
this
very
day
?
”
demanded
Marilla
despairingly
.
</p>
<p>
“
But
she
was
glad
to
die
,
”
said
Davy
confidentially
.
“
I
know
,
‘
cause
she
told
me
so
.
She
was
awful
tired
of
being
sick
.
We
’d
a
long
talk
the
night
before
she
died
.
She
told
me
you
was
going
to
take
me
and
Dora
for
the
winter
and
I
was
to
be
a
good
boy
.
I
’m
going
to
be
good
,
but
ca
n’t
you
be
good
running
round
just
as
well
as
sitting
still
?
And
she
said
I
was
always
to
be
kind
to
Dora
and
stand
up
for
her
,
and
I
’m
going
to
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Do
you
call
pulling
her
hair
being
kind
to
her
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Well
,
I
ai
n’t
going
to
let
anybody
else
pull
it
,
”
said
Davy
,
doubling
up
his
fists
and
frowning
.
“
They
’d
just
better
try
it
.
I
did
n’t
hurt
her
much
.
.
.
she
just
cried
‘
cause
she
’s
a
girl
.
I
’m
glad
I
’m
a
boy
but
I
’m
sorry
I
’m
a
twin
.
When
Jimmy
Sprott
’s
sister
conterdicks
him
he
just
says
,
‘
I
’m
oldern
you
,
so
of
course
I
know
better
,
’
and
that
settles
HER
.
But
I
ca
n’t
tell
Dora
that
,
and
she
just
goes
on
thinking
diffrunt
from
me
.
You
might
let
me
drive
the
gee-gee
for
a
spell
,
since
I
’m
a
man
.
”
</p>
<p>
Altogether
,
Marilla
was
a
thankful
woman
when
she
drove
into
her
own
yard
,
where
the
wind
of
the
autumn
night
was
dancing
with
the
brown
leaves
.
Anne
was
at
the
gate
to
meet
them
and
lift
the
twins
out
.
Dora
submitted
calmly
to
be
kissed
,
but
Davy
responded
to
Anne
’s
welcome
with
one
of
his
hearty
hugs
and
the
cheerful
announcement
,
“
I
’m
Mr.
Davy
Keith
.
