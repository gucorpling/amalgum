Abdi
and
Labib
proposed
an
algorithm
for
grouping
products
for
a
reconfigurable
manufacturing
system
(
RMS
)
based
on
their
operational
similarities
using
the
Jaccard
similarity
coefficient
,
a
commonly
used
similarity
coefficient
for
part-cell
formation
in
cellular
manufacturing
.
</p>
<p>
Galan
et
al.
based
their
method
on
five
similarity
coefficients
:
modularity
,
commonality
,
compatibility
,
reusability
,
and
demand
.
An
analytic
hierarchy
process
(
AHP
)
was
used
as
a
weighting
method
to
aggregate
the
five
similarity
coefficients
into
one
single
coefficient
.
Average
linkage
hierarchical
clustering
is
then
used
to
cluster
the
products
into
a
binary
rooted
tree
,
known
as
a
dendrogram
.
</p>
<p>
Goyal
et
al.
proposed
a
similarity
coefficient
based
on
operations
sequence
and
employed
it
,
solely
,
to
cluster
products
using
average
linkage
hierarchical
clustering
.
Considering
alternative
process
plans
,
Rakesh
et
al.
proposed
a
modified
average
linkage
clustering
algorithm
based
on
the
Jaccard
similarity
coefficient
.

Industry
4.0
has
been
becoming
a
top
priority
for
companies
seeking
for
a
possible
way
towards
their
future
.
Nowadays
,
robotics
and
automation
are
rapidly
progressing
due
to
innovations
in
sensors
,
devices
,
unmanned
air
vehicles
(
UAVs

The
IMS2020
research
actions
,
which
cluster
research
topics
,
frame
the
future
technology
development
within
three
important
aspects
of
manufacturing
(

.
</p>
<p>
IMS2020
is
conducted
under
the
international
,
industry-led
IMS
(
Intelligent
Manufacturing
Systems
)
Initiative
established
to
develop
the
next
generation
of
manufacturing
and
processing
technologies
,
and
is
partly
aimed
at
supporting

The
assembly
industry
is
experiencing
huge
changes
with
the
rapid
development
of
production
automation
,
process
control
,
information
technologies
and
networking
.
Many
manufacturing
and
assembly
enablers
emerged
to
manage
the
proliferation
of
product
variety
and
changes
in
their
manufacturing
systems
.
</p>
<p>
At
present
,
with
the
changing
conditions
of
digitizing
processes
and
intelligent
systems
,
the
requirements
of
Industry
4.0
and
Machinery
4.0
in
terms
of
financial
,
technical
and
personnel
basis
,
all
enterprises
are
seeking
added
values
and
cost
reduction
.
Custom
assembly
is
one
of
several
types
of
manufacturing
processes
that
are
the
basis
of
enterprise
manufacturing
systems
.
</p>
<p>
There
are
a
number
of
work
productivity-enhancing
methods
that
,
together
with
innovations
,
significantly
support
development
concepts
by
companies
.
</p>
<p>
In
the
area
of
assembling
processes
in
custom
production
,
there
may
also
be
circumstances
of
organizational
management
where
compliance
with
labor
productivity
is
problematic
.
There
is
a
difference
when
an
enterprise
assembles
its
products
on
a
serial
production
line
or
as
high
variant
and
limited-order
types
in
one
batch
.
In
all
cases
,
the
business
must
perform
its
processes
efficiently
,
cost-effectively
at
a
low
level
,
and
add
value
to
the
customer
to
make
a
profit
.
</p>
<p>
The
main
purpose
of
the
design
concept
of
sustainable
production
is
to
achieve
economic
growth
of
the
company
,
produce
environmentally
friendly
products
,
meet
different
user
requirements
,
use
advanced
technologies
and
increase
productivity
in
the
manufacturing
and
non-manufacturing
processes
.
</p>
<p>
In
terms
of
sustainable
production
impact
on
selected
aspects
within
and
outside
the
enterprise
,
technologies
,
users
,
environment
,
economics
,
productivity
are
the
most
discussed
.
</p>
<p>
<figure>
Figure

summarizes
application
scenarios
of
different
assembly
systems
.
The
application
domains
can
be
segmented
in
terms
of
the
demand
for
changes
and
automation
.
The
assembly
processes
with
complicated
changes
have
to
be
accomplished
by
a
manual
assembly
since
current
manufacturing
technologies
are
not
intelligent
enough
to
deal
with
complicated
processes
and
a
human
being
is
the
most
flexible
resource
ever
known
.
</p>
<p>
Increasing
product
requirements
,
product
quality
and
functionality
,
increased
labor
productivity
,
and
demands
on
the
flexibility
of
the
production
system
.
The
product
assortment
is
rapidly
changing
,
the
time
for
innovation
is
reduced
,
the
demands
on
the
reliability
of
the
production
system
are
increased
.
Therefore
,
it
is
necessary
to
take
an
innovative
approach
to
design
production
and
assembly
systems
working
on
the
basis
of
high
flexibility
and
elasticity
.
</p>
<p>
The
assembly
is
most
often
organized
according
to
the
workshop
principle
which
lays
the
basis
for
the
planning
tasks
:
layout
of
assembly
at
common
facilities
or
production
lines
,
product
layout
(
depending
on
when
certain
types
are
to
be
produced
)
,
layout
of
workers
at
individual
operations
taking
into
consideration
changes
of
workplaces
after
the
assembly
process
,
uneven
time
consumption
by
individual
products
,
optimization
of
the
order
of
the
manufactured
types
according
to
the
assembly
lines
and
the
occupation
of
the
workers
.
</p>
<p>
Depending
on
the
degree
of
differentiation
of
the
final
product
according
to
the
customer
’s
wishes
,
the
production
under
the
customer
’s
order
can
be
further
specified
depending
on
whether
it
is
designed
to
provide
a
completely
new
product
or
whether
the
company
offers
a
basic
type
of
product
(
e.
g.
,
basic
air
conditioning
)
which
is
then
adjusted
to
the
customer
’s
wishes
,
power
or
power
consumption
)
.
The
project
solution
is
based
on
the
elaborated
theoretical
knowledge
and
comprehensive
analysis
of
the
current
state
of
affairs
with
regard
to
the
problem
of
product
segmentation
before
the
assembly
process
.
Its
aim
is
to
propose
such
an
approach
that
would
enable
the
product
to
be
assembled
without
the
use
of
complex
planning
methods
.
The
term
innovation
means
the
result
of
the
process
of
creating
new
things
(
new
object
)
.
