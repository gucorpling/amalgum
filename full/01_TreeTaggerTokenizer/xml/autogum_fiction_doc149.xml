CHAPTER
XXI
.
BILLY
TAKES
HER
TURN
AT
QUESTIONING
</head>
<p>
Arkwright
did
not
call
to
see
Alice
Greggory
for
some
days
.
He
did
not
want
to
see
Alice
now
.
He
told
himself
wearily
that
she
could
not
help
him
fight
this
tiger
skin
that
lay
across
his
path
,
The
very
fact
of
her
presence
by
his
side
would
,
indeed
,
incapacitate
himself
for
fighting
.
So
he
deliberately
stayed
away
from
the
Annex
until
the
day
before
he
sailed
for
Germany
.
Then
he
went
out
to
say
good-by
.
</p>
<p>
Chagrined
as
he
was
at
what
he
termed
his
imbecile
stupidity
in
not
knowing
his
own
heart
all
these
past
months
,
and
convinced
,
as
he
also
was
,
that
Alice
and
Calderwell
cared
for
each
other
,
he
could
see
no
way
for
him
but
to
play
the
part
of
a
man
of
kindliness
and
honor
,
leaving
a
clear
field
for
his
preferred
rival
,
and
bringing
no
shadow
of
regret
to
mar
the
happiness
of
the
girl
he
loved
.
</p>
<p>
As
for
being
his
old
easy
,
frank
self
on
this
last
call
,
however
,
that
was
impossible
;
so
Alice
found
plenty
of
fuel
for
her
still
burning
fires
of
suspicion
--
fires
which
had
,
indeed
,
blazed
up
anew
at
this
second
long
period
of
absence
on
the
part
of
Arkwright
.
Naturally
,
therefore
,
the
call
was
anything
but
a
joy
and
comfort
to
either
one
.
Arkwright
was
nervous
,
gloomy
,
and
abnormally
gay
by
turns
.
Alice
was
nervous
and
abnormally
gay
all
the
time
.
Then
they
said
good-by
and
Arkwright
went
away
.
He
sailed
the
next
day
,
and
Alice
settled
down
to
the
summer
of
study
and
hard
work
she
had
laid
out
for
herself
.
</p>
<p>
On
the
tenth
of
September
Billy
came
home
.
She
was
brown
,
plump-cheeked
,
and
smiling
.
She
declared
that
she
had
had
a
perfectly
beautiful
time
,
and
that
there
could
n't
be
anything
in
the
world
nicer
than
the
trip
she
and
Bertram
had
taken
--
just
they
two
together
.
In
answer
to
Aunt
Hannah
's
solicitous
inquiries
,
she
asserted
that
she
was
all
well
and
rested
now
.
But
there
was
a
vaguely
troubled
questioning
in
her
eyes
that
Aunt
Hannah
did
not
quite
like
.
Aunt
Hannah
,
however
,
said
nothing
even
to
Billy
herself
about
this
.
</p>
<p>
One
of
the
first
friends
Billy
saw
after
her
return
was
Hugh
Calderwell
.
As
it
happened
Bertram
was
out
when
he
came
,
so
Billy
had
the
first
half-hour
of
the
call
to
herself
.
She
was
not
sorry
for
this
,
as
it
gave
her
a
chance
to
question
Calderwell
a
little
concerning
Alice
Greggory
--
something
she
had
long
ago
determined
to
do
at
the
first
opportunity
.
</p>
<p>
“
Now
tell
me
everything
--
everything
about
everybody
,
”
she
began
diplomatically
,
settling
herself
comfortably
for
a
good
visit
.
</p>
<p>
“
Thank
you
,
I
'm
well
,
and
have
had
a
passably
agreeable
summer
,
barring
the
heat
,
sundry
persistent
mosquitoes
,
several
grievous
disappointments
,
and
a
felon
on
my
thumb
,
”
he
began
,
with
shameless
imperturbability
.
“
I
have
been
to
Revere
once
,
to
the
circus
once
,
to
Nantasket
three
times
,
and
to
Keith
's
and
the
'
movies
'
ten
times
,
perhaps
--
to
be
accurate
.
I
have
also
--
But
perhaps
there
was
some
one
else
you
desired
to
inquire
for
,
”
he
broke
off
,
turning
upon
his
hostess
a
bland
but
unsmiling
countenance
.
</p>
<p>
“
Oh
,
no
,
how
could
there
be
?
”
twinkled
Billy
.
“
Really
,
Hugh
,
I
always
knew
you
had
a
pretty
good
opinion
of
yourself
,
but
I
did
n't
credit
you
with
thinking
you
were
<hi rend="italic">
everybody
</hi>
.
Go
on
.
I
'm
so
interested
!
”
</p>
<p>
Hugh
chuckled
softly
;
but
there
was
a
plaintive
tone
in
his
voice
as
he
answered
.
</p>
<p>
“
Thanks
,
no
.
I
've
rather
lost
my
interest
now
.
Lack
of
appreciation
always
did
discourage
me
.
We
'll
talk
of
something
else
,
please
.
You
enjoyed
your
trip
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Very
much
.
It
just
could
n't
have
been
nicer
!
”
</p>
<p>
“
You
were
lucky
.
The
heat
here
has
been
something
fierce
!
”
</p>
<p>
“
What
made
you
stay
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Reasons
too
numerous
,
and
one
too
heart-breaking
,
to
mention
.
Besides
,
you
forget
,
”
with
dignity
.
“
There
is
my
profession
.
I
have
joined
the
workers
of
the
world
now
,
you
know
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Oh
,
fudge
,
Hugh
!
”
laughed
Billy
.
“
You
know
very
well
you
're
as
likely
as
not
to
start
for
the
ends
of
the
earth
to-morrow
morning
!
”
</p>
<p>
Hugh
drew
himself
up
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
do
n't
seem
to
succeed
in
making
people
understand
that
I
'm
serious
,
”
he
began
aggrievedly
.
“
I
--
”
With
an
expressive
flourish
of
his
hands
he
relaxed
suddenly
,
and
fell
back
in
his
chair
.
A
slow
smile
came
to
his
lips
.
“
Well
,
Billy
,
I
'll
give
up
.
You
've
hit
it
,
”
he
confessed
.
“
I
<hi rend="italic">
have
</hi>
thought
seriously
of
starting
to-morrow
morning
for
<hi rend="italic">
half-way
</hi>
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
--
Panama
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Hugh
!
”
</p>
<p>
“
Well
,
I
have
.
Even
this
call
was
to
be
a
good-by
--
if
I
went
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Oh
,
Hugh
!
But
I
really
thought
--
in
spite
of
my
teasing
--
that
you
had
settled
down
,
this
time
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Yes
,
so
did
I
,
”
sighed
the
man
,
a
little
soberly
.
“
But
I
guess
it
's
no
use
,
Billy
.
Oh
,
I
'm
coming
back
,
of
course
,
and
link
arms
again
with
their
worthy
Highnesses
,
John
Doe
and
Richard
Roe
;
but
just
now
I
've
got
a
restless
fit
on
me
.
I
want
to
see
the
wheels
go
'
round
.
Of
course
,
if
I
had
my
bread
and
butter
and
cigars
to
earn
,
'
twould
be
different
.
But
I
have
n't
,
and
I
know
I
have
n't
;
and
I
suspect
that
's
where
the
trouble
lies
.
If
it
was
n't
for
those
natal
silver
spoons
of
mine
that
Bertram
is
always
talking
about
,
things
might
be
different
.
But
the
spoons
are
there
,
and
always
have
been
;
and
I
know
they
're
all
ready
to
dish
out
mountains
to
climb
and
lakes
to
paddle
in
,
any
time
I
've
a
mind
to
say
the
word
.
So
--
I
just
say
the
word
.
That
's
all
.
