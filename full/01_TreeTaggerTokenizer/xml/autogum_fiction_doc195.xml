INTRODUCTION
TO
THE
BRIDE
OF
LAMMERMOOR
</head>
<p>
THE
Author
,
on
a
former
occasion
,
declined
giving
the
real
source
from
which
he
drew
the
tragic
subject
of
this
history
,
because
,
though
occurring
at
a
distant
period
,
it
might
possibly
be
unpleasing
to
the
feelings
of
the
descendants
of
the
parties
.
But
as
he
finds
an
account
of
the
circumstances
given
in
the
Notes
to
Law
's
Memorials
,
by
his
ingenious
friend
,
Charles
Kirkpatrick
Sharpe
,
Esq.
,
and
also
indicated
in
his
reprint
of
the
Rev.
Mr.
Symson
's
poems
appended
to
the
Large
Description
of
Galloway
,
as
the
original
of
the
Bride
of
Lammermoor
,
the
Author
feels
himself
now
at
liberty
to
tell
the
tale
as
he
had
it
from
connexions
of
his
own
,
who
lived
very
near
the
period
,
and
were
closely
related
to
the
family
of
the
bride
.
</p>
<p>
It
is
well
known
that
the
family
of
Dalrymple
,
which
has
produced
,
within
the
space
of
two
centuries
,
as
many
men
of
talent
,
civil
and
military
,
and
of
literary
,
political
,
and
professional
eminence
,
as
any
house
in
Scotland
,
first
rose
into
distinction
in
the
person
of
James
Dalrymple
,
one
of
the
most
eminent
lawyers
that
ever
lived
,
though
the
labours
of
his
powerful
mind
were
unhappily
exercised
on
a
subject
so
limited
as
Scottish
jurisprudence
,
on
which
he
has
composed
an
admirable
work
.
</p>
<p>
He
married
Margaret
,
daughter
to
Ross
of
Balneel
,
with
whom
he
obtained
a
considerable
estate
.
She
was
an
able
,
politic
,
and
high-minded
woman
,
so
successful
in
what
she
undertook
,
that
the
vulgar
,
no
way
partial
to
her
husband
or
her
family
,
imputed
her
success
to
necromancy
.
According
to
the
popular
belief
,
this
Dame
Margaret
purchased
the
temporal
prosperity
of
her
family
from
the
Master
whom
she
served
under
a
singular
condition
,
which
is
thus
narrated
by
the
historian
of
her
grandson
,
the
great
Earl
of
Stair
:
“
She
lived
to
a
great
age
,
and
at
her
death
desired
that
she
might
not
be
put
under
ground
,
but
that
her
coffin
should
stand
upright
on
one
end
of
it
,
promising
that
while
she
remained
in
that
situation
the
Dalrymples
should
continue
to
flourish
.
What
was
the
old
lady
's
motive
for
the
request
,
or
whether
she
really
made
such
a
promise
,
I
shall
not
take
upon
me
to
determine
;
but
it
's
certain
her
coffin
stands
upright
in
the
isle
of
the
church
of
Kirklistown
,
the
burial-place
belonging
to
the
family
.
”
The
talents
of
this
accomplished
race
were
sufficient
to
have
accounted
for
the
dignities
which
many
members
of
the
family
attained
,
without
any
supernatural
assistance
.
But
their
extraordinary
prosperity
was
attended
by
some
equally
singular
family
misfortunes
,
of
which
that
which
befell
their
eldest
daughter
was
at
once
unaccountable
and
melancholy
.
</p>
<p>
Miss
Janet
Dalrymple
,
daughter
of
the
first
Lord
Stair
and
Dame
Margaret
Ross
,
had
engaged
herself
without
the
knowledge
of
her
parents
to
the
Lord
Rutherford
,
who
was
not
acceptable
to
them
either
on
account
of
his
political
principles
or
his
want
of
fortune
.
The
young
couple
broke
a
piece
of
gold
together
,
and
pledged
their
troth
in
the
most
solemn
manner
;
and
it
is
said
the
young
lady
imprecated
dreadful
evils
on
herself
should
she
break
her
plighted
faith
.
Shortly
after
,
a
suitor
who
was
favoured
by
Lord
Stair
,
and
still
more
so
by
his
lady
,
paid
his
addresses
to
Miss
Dalrymple
.
The
young
lady
refused
the
proposal
,
and
being
pressed
on
the
subject
,
confessed
her
secret
engagement
.
Lady
Stair
,
a
woman
accustomed
to
universal
submission
,
for
even
her
husband
did
not
dare
to
contradict
her
,
treated
this
objection
as
a
trifle
,
and
insisted
upon
her
daughter
yielding
her
consent
to
marry
the
new
suitor
,
David
Dunbar
,
son
and
heir
to
David
Dunbar
of
Baldoon
,
in
Wigtonshire
.
The
first
lover
,
a
man
of
very
high
spirit
,
then
interfered
by
letter
,
and
insisted
on
the
right
he
had
acquired
by
his
troth
plighted
with
the
young
lady
.
Lady
Stair
sent
him
for
answer
,
that
her
daughter
,
sensible
of
her
undutiful
behaviour
in
entering
into
a
contract
unsanctioned
by
her
parents
,
had
retracted
her
unlawful
vow
,
and
now
refused
to
fulfil
her
engagement
with
him
.
</p>
<p>
The
lover
,
in
return
,
declined
positively
to
receive
such
an
answer
from
any
one
but
his
mistress
in
person
;
and
as
she
had
to
deal
with
a
man
who
was
both
of
a
most
determined
character
and
of
too
high
condition
to
be
trifled
with
,
Lady
Stair
was
obliged
to
consent
to
an
interview
between
Lord
Rutherford
and
her
daughter
.
But
she
took
care
to
be
present
in
person
,
and
argued
the
point
with
the
disappointed
and
incensed
lover
with
pertinacity
equal
to
his
own
.
She
particularly
insisted
on
the
Levitical
law
,
which
declares
that
a
woman
shall
be
free
of
a
vow
which
her
parents
dissent
from
.
This
is
the
passage
of
Scripture
she
founded
on
:
</p>
<p>
“
If
a
man
vow
a
vow
unto
the
Lord
,
or
swear
an
oath
to
bind
his
soul
with
a
bond
;
he
shall
not
break
his
word
,
he
shall
do
according
to
all
that
proceedeth
out
of
his
mouth
.
</p>
<p>
“
If
a
woman
also
vow
a
vow
unto
the
Lord
,
and
bind
herself
by
a
bond
,
being
in
her
father
's
house
in
her
youth
;
And
her
father
hear
her
vow
,
and
her
bond
wherewith
she
hath
bound
her
soul
,
and
her
father
shall
hold
his
peace
at
her
:
then
all
her
vows
shall
stand
,
and
every
bond
wherewith
she
hath
bound
her
soul
shall
stand
.
