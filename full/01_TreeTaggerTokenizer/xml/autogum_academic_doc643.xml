The
well-characterized
GWI
symptoms
are
GI
inflammatory
disease
,
chronic
fatigue
,
neuroinflammation
,
and
cognitive
impairment
.
The
current
study
investigates
a
mechanistic
analysis
of
the
gut
virome-bacteriome
mediated
GI
and
neuroinflammation
.
To
our
knowledge
,
this
is
the
first
study
that
examined
GW
chemical-induced
virome
dysbiosis
and
bacteriome-virome
interactions
in
GWI
.
In
our
previous
study
,
we
have
shown
that
GW
chemical
exposure
causes
bacterial
dysbiosis
and
that
led
to
the
loss
of
healthy
gut
bacteria
such
as
Lactobacillus
and
Bifidobacterium
.
Gut
dysbiosis
induced
leaky
gut
symptoms
and
systemic
inflammation
in
GWI
.
In
a
recent
review
,
it
has
been
reported
that
gut
virome
is
the
missing
link
between
bacterial
dysbiosis
and
host
immunity
.
The
same
study
also
described
the
role
of
virome
in
TLR
signaling
and
GI
diseases
and
hence
concluding
that
virome
analysis
may
lead
to
a
novel
therapeutic
strategy
for
GI
complications
.
The
above
study
prompted
us
to
explore
the
role
of
enteric
viruses
in
GWI
pathology
and
as
a
probable
therapeutic
target
.
In
the
present
study
,
we
found
that
the
GW
chemical
exposure
led
to
an
increase
in
virome
richness
and
relative
abundance
of
dsDNA
bacteriophages
<hi rend="italic">
Myoviridae
</hi>
,
<hi rend="italic">
Siphoviridae
</hi>
,
and
<hi rend="italic">
Caudovirales
</hi>
and
decreased
relative
abundance
of
ssDNA
bacteriophages
<hi rend="italic">
Microviridae
</hi>
.
We
used
a
broad-spectrum
antiviral
compound
Ribavirin
to
test
the
hypothesis
that
(
a
)
inhibition
of
gut
viruses
in
the
host
may
prove
the
role
of
gut
virome
in
GWI
and
(
b
)
antiviral
treatment
may
help
to
reconstruct
and
restore
the
virome
signature
in
GWI
.
Ribavirin
has
been
extensively
used
as
a
therapeutic
drug
in
several
viral
infections
including
Paramyxovirus
,
Adenovirus
,
and
RSV
infections
.
Our
results
showed
that
Ribavirin
reverses
GWI-induced
alterations
of
the
enteric
viral
community
.
The
enteric
bacteriophage-bacteria
(
parasite-host
)
interaction
is
an
essential
phenomenon
to
regulate
both
bacterial
and
viral
community
in
the
gut
and
play
as
a
key
role
in
gut
health
.
Here
,
we
found
an
independent
or
cumulative
effect
of
both
virome
and
bacteriome
dysbiosis
in
weakening
of
GI
tight
junctions
(
increased
Claudin-2
and
decreased
ZO1
and
Occludin
)
,
GI
inflammation
(
increased
MCP1
and
IL6
)
,
systemic
inflammation
(
increased
serum
IFNγ
and
IL6
)
and
neuroinflammation
(
increased
microglia
activation
and
brain
IL6
)
.
The
present
study
also
showed
that
Ribavirin
treatment
improved
GI
tight
junction
assembly
and
subsequently
decreasing
GI
and
neuroinflammation
.
Interestingly
,
inducing
gut
sterility
by
using
antibiotics
also
improves
such
GI
and
neurological
complications
.
Results
reported
here
are
also
strongly
supported
by
previous
such
studies
where
Ribavirin
or
antibiotics
were
applied
as
therapeutics
in
other
GI
complications
and
neurological
illnesses
.
However
,
nonavailability
of
germ-free
and
gnotobiotic
mice
or
mice
completely
devoid
of
gut
viruses
prove
to
be
a
serious
handicap
in
establishing
the
exact
role
of
viruses
in
GWI
or
any
other
disease
pathology
though
use
of
antiviral
cocktails
similar
to
our
approach
have
been
shown
to
serve
the
purpose
.

<p>
Gut
microbiome
is
a
collection
of
trillions
of
microorganisms
that
modulated
host
pathology
and
physiology
through
different
mechanisms
.
Previous
reports
have
suggested
that
the
intestinal
microbiota
had
a
strong
influence
on
the
mucosal
immune
system
and
vice
versa
.
A
balanced
pathogen
and
commensal
microbiome
composition
maintain
the
microbiome-host
immune
homeostasis
.
However
,
any
alteration
in
the
microbiome
may
activate
innate
and
adaptive
immune
responses
and
may
progress
to
an
inflammatory
phenotype
.
In
the
present
study
we
have
shown
that
the
GW
chemical-induced
virome
richness
and
dysbiosis
showed
a
strong
association
with
activated
Toll-like
receptor-7
(
TLR7
)
and
TLR9
mediated
proinflammatory
pathways
.
We
also
found
that
the
expression
and
activation
of
downstream
signaling
molecules
including
TLR7-MyD88
(
binding
of
TLR7
with
adaptor
molecule
myosin
D88
)
,
TLR9-MyD88
,
or
TLR4-Flottilin
(
localization
of
TLR4
in
lipid
raft
)
complex
formation
,
TRAF6
,
IKK-α
,
and
p65
(
NFκB
activation
)
have
been
increased
upon
gut
virome
and
microbiome
dysbiosis
.
The
dysbiosis
was
also
accompanied
by
increased
inflammation
while
use
of
Ribavirin
or
antibiotics
independently
downregulated
these
pathways
and
subsequently
inflammation
.
The
above
results
prompted
us
to
study
whether
virome
diversity
had
a
direct
connection
to
a
sustained
systemic
inflammatory
response
via
increased
serum
IL6
or
vice
versa
.
We
found
that
IL6
and
virome
diversity
had
a
positive
correlation
in
GWI
.
Studies
have
shown
that
the
enteric
viruses
can
activate
TLR3
signaling
pathway
to
induce
anti-inflammatory
response
via
IFNβ
production
.
However
,
it
has
always
been
a
conflict
whether
viral-induced
TLR3
activation
leads
to
pro-
or
anti-inflammatory
response
in
viral
pathogenesis
.
In
our
study
,
we
observed
that
increased
TLR3
might
switch
to
pro-inflammatory
response
via
IL6
or
fail
to
produce
significant
IFNβ
in
order
to
support
its
anti-inflammatory
role
in
GWI
though
such
mechanisms
in
the
host
remain
inconclusive
at
this
time
.
