Teach
Your
Dog
to
Howl
</head>
<p>
Howling
is
a
common
method
that
dogs
use
to
communicate
with
one
another
.
Dogs
do
not
typically
howl
as
a
means
of
communicating
or
interacting
with
humans
.
However
,
dogs
are
good
learners
and
can
be
taught
to
howl
on
command
.
If
you
’d
like
to
train
your
dog
to
howl
on
command
,
you
’ll
need
to
find
ways
to
encourage
the
behavior
.
Be
aware
,
though
,
that
you
may
find
it
hard
to
stop
your
dog
from
howling
once
it
's
begun
!

Wait
for
the
dog
to
howl
on
its
own
so
you
can
reinforce
the
behavior
.
It
’s
tricky
to
make
your
dog
howl
before
you
’ve
trained
it
.
So
,
the
first
step
is
often
just
waiting
for
the
dog
to
howl
.
It
may
be
inclined
to
howl
if
other
nearby
dogs
start
barking
and
howling
,
or
if
it
hears
a
certain
high-pitched
sound
like
a
fire-engine
drive
by
.

Try
taking
your
dog
to
a
dog
park
if
it
’s
not
inclined
to
howl
.
Allowing
your
dog
to
interact
with
other
dogs
may
prompt
your
dog
to
howl
.

<item>
Find
a
sound
that
makes
your
dog
howl
if
waiting
does
n’t
work
.
In
many
cases
,
a
dog
that
is
not
inclined
to
howl
will
do
so
if
it
hears
a
certain
sound
or
noise
.
Try
playing
different
genres
of
music
around
the
house
,
and
see
if
your
dog
howls
to
one
.

Or
,
if
you
(
or
a
friend
or
family
member
)
play
a
musical
instrument
,
play
it
around
the
house
and
see
if
it
causes
the
dog
to
howl
.

Play
online
videos
of
howling
dogs
to
make
your
dog
howl
.
If
music
is
n’t
doing
the
trick
,
get
on
YouTube
and
search
for
“
dogs
howling
,
”
then
play
some
of
the
videos
for
your
dog
.
Your
dog
may
be
inclined
to
howl
along
when
it
feels
like
it
’s
communicating
with
a
real
(
if
pre-recorded
)
dog
.

Howl
at
your
dog
and
see
if
it
mimics
you
.
If
music
is
n’t
doing
the
trick
,
try
mimicking
a
canine
howl
when
you
and
your
dog
are
in
the
same
room
.
A
dog
is
often
inclined
to
mimic
its
owner
’s
behaviors
—
or
might
just
get
excited
by
your
loud
howling
—
and
should
be
inclined
to
howl
along
with
you
.

Say
“
howl
”
when
the
dog
howls
.
Once
you
’ve
figured
out
a
way
to
make
your
dog
howl
,
you
need
to
start
using
the
command
that
you
’d
like
to
induce
the
dog
to
howl
.
Whenever
you
play
a
sound
that
makes
your
dog
howl
,
approach
the
howling
dog
and
say
,
“
howl
!
”
If
the
dog
’s
howl
is
very
loud
,
raise
your
voice
so
the
dog
can
hear
you
over
its
own
howl
.
<figure rend="Teach Your Dog to Howl Step 5 Version 2.jpg">

Give
your
dog
time
to
link
the
“
howl
”
command
and
the
howling
behavior
.
It
may
take
a
few
weeks
for
the
dog
to
be
fully
trained
to
howl
.
</item>
<item>
If
you
prefer
,
you
could
say
“
sing
”
instead
.
Just
be
sure
that
you
’re
consistent
with
the
command
you
give
the
dog
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Reward
the
dog
with
a
treat
each
time
you
say
“
howl
.
”
The
two
can
be
done
simultaneously
.
Once
the
dog
begins
to
howl
,
say
“
howl
”
(
or
“
sing
”
)
in
a
firm
tone
.
Then
give
the
dog
a
treat
.
This
will
reinforce
the
howling
behavior
,
and
teach
the
dog
to
associate
the
behavior
with
your
command
.

Continue
to
reinforce
the
howling
behavior
over
a
period
of
days
(
or
weeks
)
.
</item>
<item>
During
this
stage
of
the
training
,
you
may
still
need
to
occasionally
stimulate
the
dog
to
howl
by
using
music
,
a
YouTube
video
,
or
your
own
voice
.
</item>
<item>
Be
specific
with
the
behaviors
that
you
reinforce
.
A
howl
is
different
than
a
bark
or
a
yip
,
and
so
the
dog
should
n’t
be
given
a
treat
for
barking
when
you
want
it
to
howl
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Provide
a
nonverbal
cue
if
you
want
your
dog
to
respond
to
a
signal
.
Train
the
dog
to
respond
to
a
different
cue
instead
.
If
you
’d
rather
not
give
the
“
howl
”
command
,
try
using
another
cue
.
Some
dog
owners
may
prefer
to
train
their
dog
to
howl
when
given
a
nonverbal
cue
.
The
process
is
identical
to
training
the
dog
to
howl
to
the
“
howl
”
command
,
but
you
’ll
use
the
nonverbal
cue
in
conjunction
with
the
dog
treat
.

For
example
,
you
could
train
the
dog
to
howl
to
the
sound
of
a
certain
piano
note
or
to
howl
every
time
you
clap
your
hands
or
snap
your
fingers
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Wean
the
dog
off
of
the
treats
.
Once
your
dog
has
come
to
understand
the
connection
between
hearing
the
“
howl
”
command
and
howling
,
you
can
begin
to
cut
back
on
the
number
of
treats
it
receives
.
For
example
,
still
give
the
“
howl
”
command
but
only
give
a
treat
half
the
time
.
A
few
days
later
,
cut
back
to
only
giving
a
treat
a
quarter
of
the
time
.
Then
,
cut
out
the
treats
altogether
.

If
you
like
the
idea
of
giving
your
dog
a
treat
each
time
it
howls
on
command
,
you
can
skip
this
step
.
</item>
<item>
Use
the
“
quiet
”
command
and
reward
your
dog
when
it
stops
howling
.
This
can
help
you
control
the
amount
of
noise
they
make
later
on
