Europe
</ref>
.
Due
to
its
beauty
and
significance
,
this
system
of
16
interlinked
lakes
and
a
large
forest
complex
around
it
were
set
aside
as
a
national
park
in
1949
.
In
1979
the
park
was
inscribed
on
the
<ref target="UNESCO%20World%20Heritage%20site">
UNESCO
World
Heritage
site
</ref>
List
.
Many
Germans
will
recognize
features
of
the
park
,
as
many
of
the
Karl
May
Westerns
were
shot
here
.
</p>
<head>
History
</head>
<p>
Humans
have
inhabited
the
Plitvice
Lakes
area
for
thousands
of
years
.
It
was
settled
in
turn
by
Illyrians
,
Thracians
,
Celts
,
Japods
,
Romans
,
Avars
,
Slavs
and
Turks
.
The
area
fell
to
the
Ottomans
in
1528
,
and
was
retaken
by
the
Austrian
Empire
150
years
later
.
The
Austrians
incorporated
it
into
their
Military
Frontier
and
,
in
addition
to
the
native
Croats
who
already
inhabited
the
region
,
Serbs
who
had
fled
Ottoman
repression
settled
there
.
</p>
<p>
The
Plitvice
Lakes
became
a
major
tourist
attraction
in
the
late
19th
century
.
The
first
hotel
was
built
in
1896
,
and
as
early
as
1893
it
had
a
conservation
committee
–
the
predecessor
of
today
's
national
park
authority
.
In
1949
the
communist
government
of
Yugoslavia
nationalized
the
lakes
and
made
them
a
national
park
.
The
park
was
inscribed
on
the
<ref target="UNESCO%20World%20Heritage%20site">
UNESCO
World
Heritage
site
</ref>
List
in
1979
in
recognition
of
its
&quot;
outstanding
natural
beauty
,
and
the
undisturbed
production
of
travertine
(
tuff
)
through
chemical
and
biological
action
&quot;
.
</p>
<p>
The
park
soon
became
one
of
<ref target="Yugoslavia">
Yugoslavia
</ref>
'
s
most
popular
tourist
attractions
.
In
March
1991
it
became
the
scene
of
the
Plitvice
Lakes
incident
-
the
first
armed
confrontation
of
the
<ref target="Croatia">
Croatian
War
of
Independence
</ref>
that
resulted
in
fatalities
.
The
park
was
held
by
forces
of
the
Republic
of
Serbian
Krajina
during
the
conflict
and
suffered
some
damage
in
the
process
,
with
hotels
and
other
facilities
being
used
as
barracks
.
A
massacre
of
three
children
by
the
Yugoslav
Army
occurred
around
Grabovac
in
September
of
1991
.
It
was
retaken
by
the
Croatian
Army
in
August
1995
during
Operation
Storm
,
which
ended
the
Croatian
war
.
</p>
<p>
The
war
led
UNESCO
to
add
the
park
to
its
List
of
World
Heritage
in
Danger
.
Due
to
the
economic
importance
of
the
park
,
the
Croatian
government
made
it
a
priority
for
its
de-mining
efforts
,
and
in
December
1998
UNESCO
recognized
the
parks
new
mine-free
status
by
removing
it
from
the
list
of
endangered
sites
.
The
surrounding
municipalities
outside
the
park
boundaries
still
have
minor
problems
with
mine
contamination
.

<head>
Landscape
</head>
<p>
The
lakes
are
on
the
Plitvice
plateau
,
between
the
mountains
of
Lička
Plješevica
(
Gornja
Plješevica
peak
1,640
m
)
,
Mala
Kapela
(
Seliški
Vrh
peak
at
1,280
m
)
and
Medveđak
(
884
m
)
.
The
26
lakes
are
separated
into
an
upper
and
lower
cluster
formed
by
runoff
from
the
mountains
,
descending
from
an
altitude
of
636
m
to
503
m
over
a
distance
of
some
8
km
,
aligned
in
a
south-north
direction
.
The
lakes
collectively
cover
an
area
of
about
2
km
²
,
with
the
water
exiting
from
the
lowest
lake
to
form
the
Korana
River
.
</p>
<p>
The
Plitvice
Lakes
lie
in
a
basin
of
karstic
rock
,
mainly
dolomite
and
limestone
,
which
has
given
rise
to
their
most
distinctive
feature
.
The
lakes
are
separated
by
natural
dams
of
travertine
,
which
is
deposited
by
the
action
of
moss
,
algae
and
bacteria
.
The
encrusted
plants
and
bacteria
accumulate
on
top
of
each
other
,
forming
travertine
barriers
which
grow
at
the
rate
of
about
1
cm
per
year
.
</p>
<p>
The
lakes
are
renowned
for
their
distinctive
colours
,
ranging
from
azure
to
green
,
grey
or
blue
.
The
colours
change
constantly
depending
on
the
quantity
of
minerals
or
organisms
in
the
water
and
the
angle
of
sunlight
.
</p>
<p>
The
lakes
are
divided
into
the
12
Upper
Lakes
(
Gornja
jezera
)
and
the
four
Lower
Lakes
.
</p>
<head>
Flora
and
fauna
</head>
<p>
The
Plitvice
Lakes
national
park
is
heavily
forested
,
mainly
with
beech
,
spruce
,
and
fir
trees
,
and
features
a
mixture
of
Alpine
and
Mediterranean
vegetation
.
It
has
a
notably
wide
variety
of
plant
communities
,
due
to
its
range
of
microclimates
,
differing
soils
and
varying
levels
of
altitude
.
</p>
<p>
The
area
is
also
home
to
an
extremely
wide
variety
of
animal
and
bird
species
.
Rare
fauna
such
as
the
European
brown
bear
,
wolf
,
eagle
,
owl
,
lynx
,
wild
cat
and
capercaillie
can
be
found
there
,
along
with
many
more
common
species
.
At
least
126
species
of
birds
have
been
recorded
there
,
of
which
70
have
been
recorded
as
breeding
there
.
</p>
<head>
Climate
</head>
<p>
The
area
knows
a
mountainous
land
climate
,
with
hot
summers
and
cold
winters
.
Although
generally
cooler
than
coastal
Croatia
because
of
its
altitude
,
sunny
days
in
summer
get
very
hot
with
temperatures
up
to
35°C
.
As
there
are
few
opportunities
to
buy
refreshments
in
the
park
,
visitors
should
bring
plenty
of
water
along
for
rehydration
.
In
the
evening
,
occasional
thunderstorms
can
unleash
large
amounts
of
rain
in
a
short
time
,
so
make
sure
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
weather
forecast
to
avoid
being
surprised
by
heavy
rain
in
the
absence
of
shelter
.
The
many
calm
streams
in
the
park
may
quickly
transform
into
wild
water
torrents
,
so
stay
away
from
the
water
in
case
of
heavy
rain
.
</p>
<p>
In
winter
,
heavy
snowfall
can
be
expected
,
enabling
the
Mukinje
Ski
Resort
to
operate
from
December
to
early
March
.
Fog
is
common
in
the
morning
and
can
occur
very
locally
,
making
driving
up
and
down
the
often
narrow
roads
in
the
park
hazardous
.
