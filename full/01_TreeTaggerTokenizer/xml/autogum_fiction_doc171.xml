Then
arose
a
great
confusion
of
sounds
as
all
the
animals
began
talking
to
their
fellows
.
The
monkeys
chattered
and
the
bears
growled
and
the
voices
of
the
jaguars
and
lions
rumbled
,
and
the
wolves
yelped
and
the
elephants
had
to
trumpet
loudly
to
make
their
voices
heard
.
Such
a
hubbub
had
never
been
known
in
the
forest
before
,
and
each
beast
argued
with
his
neighbor
until
it
seemed
the
noise
would
never
cease
.
</p>
<p>
Ruggedo
the
Nome
waved
his
arms
and
fluttered
his
wings
to
try
to
make
them
listen
to
him
again
,
but
the
beasts
paid
no
attention
.
Some
wanted
to
fight
the
Oz
people
,
some
wanted
to
be
transformed
,
and
some
wanted
to
do
nothing
at
all
.
</p>
<p>
The
growling
and
confusion
had
grown
greater
than
ever
when
in
a
flash
silence
fell
on
all
the
beasts
present
,
the
arguments
were
hushed
,
and
all
gazed
in
astonishment
at
a
strange
sight
.
</p>
<p>
For
into
the
circle
strode
a
great
Lion
--
bigger
and
more
powerful
than
any
other
lion
there
--
and
on
his
back
rode
a
little
girl
who
smiled
fearlessly
at
the
multitude
of
beasts
.
And
behind
the
Lion
and
the
little
girl
came
another
beast
--
a
monstrous
Tiger
,
who
bore
upon
his
back
a
funny
little
man
carrying
a
black
bag
.
Right
past
the
rows
of
wondering
beasts
the
strange
animals
walked
,
advancing
until
they
stood
just
before
the
rock
throne
of
Gugu
.
</p>
<p>
Then
the
little
girl
and
the
funny
little
man
dismounted
,
and
the
great
Lion
demanded
in
a
loud
voice
:
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Who
is
King
in
this
forest
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
am
!
&quot;
answered
Gugu
,
looking
steadily
at
the
other
.
&quot;
I
am
Gugu
the
Leopard
,
and
I
am
King
of
this
forest
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Then
I
greet
Your
Majesty
with
great
respect
,
&quot;
said
the
Lion
.
&quot;
Perhaps
you
have
heard
of
me
,
Gugu
.
I
am
called
the
'
Cowardly
Lion
,
'
and
I
am
King
of
all
Beasts
,
the
world
over
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Gugu
's
eyes
flashed
angrily
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Yes
,
&quot;
said
he
,
&quot;
I
have
heard
of
you
.
You
have
long
claimed
to
be
King
of
Beasts
,
but
no
beast
who
is
a
coward
can
be
King
over
me
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
He
is
n't
a
coward
,
Your
Majesty
,
&quot;
asserted
the
little
girl
,
&quot;
He
's
just
cowardly
,
that
's
all
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Gugu
looked
at
her
.
All
the
other
beasts
were
looking
at
her
,
too
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Who
are
you
?
&quot;
asked
the
King
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Me
?
Oh
,
I
'm
just
Dorothy
,
&quot;
she
answered
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
How
dare
you
come
here
?
&quot;
demanded
the
King
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Why
,
I
'm
not
afraid
to
go
anywhere
,
if
the
Cowardly
Lion
is
with
me
,
&quot;
she
said
.
&quot;
I
know
him
pretty
well
,
and
so
I
can
trust
him
.
He
's
always
afraid
,
when
we
get
into
trouble
,
and
that
's
why
he
's
cowardly
;
but
he
's
a
terrible
fighter
,
and
that
's
why
he
is
n't
a
coward
.
He
does
n't
like
to
fight
,
you
know
,
but
when
he
HAS
to
,
there
is
n't
any
beast
living
that
can
conquer
him
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Gugu
the
King
looked
at
the
big
,
powerful
form
of
the
Cowardly
Lion
,
and
knew
she
spoke
the
truth
.
Also
the
other
Lions
of
the
forest
now
came
forward
and
bowed
low
before
the
strange
Lion
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
We
welcome
Your
Majesty
,
&quot;
said
one
.
&quot;
We
have
known
you
many
years
ago
,
before
you
went
to
live
at
the
Emerald
City
,
and
we
have
seen
you
fight
the
terrible
Kalidahs
and
conquer
them
,
so
we
know
you
are
the
King
of
all
Beasts
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
It
is
true
,
&quot;
replied
the
Cowardly
Lion
;
&quot;
but
I
did
not
come
here
to
rule
the
beasts
of
this
forest
.
Gugu
is
King
here
,
and
I
believe
he
is
a
good
King
and
just
and
wise
.
I
come
,
with
my
friends
,
to
be
the
guest
of
Gugu
,
and
I
hope
we
are
welcome
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
That
pleased
the
great
Leopard
,
who
said
very
quickly
:
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Yes
;
you
,
at
least
,
are
welcome
to
my
forest
.
But
who
are
these
strangers
with
you
?
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Dorothy
has
introduced
herself
,
&quot;
replied
the
Lion
,
&quot;
and
you
are
sure
to
like
her
when
you
know
her
better
.
This
man
is
the
Wizard
of
Oz
,
a
friend
of
mine
who
can
do
wonderful
tricks
of
magic
.
And
here
is
my
true
and
tried
friend
,
the
Hungry
Tiger
,
who
lives
with
me
in
the
Emerald
City
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Is
he
ALWAYS
hungry
?
&quot;
asked
Loo
the
Unicorn
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
I
am
,
&quot;
replied
the
Tiger
,
answering
the
question
himself
.
&quot;
I
am
always
hungry
for
fat
babies
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot;
Ca
n't
you
find
any
fat
babies
in
Oz
to
eat
?
&quot;
inquired
Loo
,
the
Unicorn
.
</p>
<p>
&quot;
There
are
plenty
of
them
,
of
course
,
&quot;
said
the
Tiger
,
&quot;
but
unfortunately
I
have
such
a
tender
conscience
that
it
wo
n't
allow
me
to
eat
babies
.
So
I
'm
always
hungry
for
'
em
and
never
can
eat
'
em
,
because
my
conscience
wo
n't
let
me
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
Now
of
all
the
surprised
beasts
in
that
clearing
,
not
one
was
so
much
surprised
at
the
sudden
appearance
of
these
four
strangers
as
Ruggedo
the
Nome
.
He
was
frightened
,
too
,
for
he
recognized
them
as
his
most
powerful
enemies
;
but
he
also
realized
that
they
could
not
know
he
was
the
former
King
of
the
Nomes
,
because
of
the
beast
's
form
he
wore
,
which
disguised
him
so
effectually
.
So
he
took
courage
and
resolved
that
the
Wizard
and
Dorothy
should
not
defeat
his
plans
.
</p>
<p>
It
was
hard
to
tell
,
just
yet
,
what
the
vast
assemblage
of
beasts
thought
of
the
new
arrivals
.
Some
glared
angrily
at
them
,
but
more
of
them
seemed
to
be
curious
and
wondering
.
All
were
interested
,
however
,
and
they
kept
very
quiet
and
listened
carefully
to
all
that
was
said
.
