Dongji
Islands
</head>
<p>
The
<hi rend="bold">
Dongji
Islands
</hi>
are
a
chain
of
islands
in
the
far
eastern
region
of
<ref target="Zhoushan">

Understand
</head>
<p>
The
Dongji
Islands
are
a
few
small
islands
in
the
far
east
of
the
Zhoushan
archipelago
.
The
small
communities
on
these
islands
have
recently
experienced
an
upsurge
in
tourism
because
a
movie
called
&quot;
The
Continent
&quot;
was
filmed
there
.
Still
remote
,
the
islands
are
far
enough
out
to
sea
that
the
silt
of
the
Yangtze
River
Delta
does
n't
reach
the
sea
around
them
,
giving
them
nice
blue
water
,
a
rarity
in
this
region
of
China
.
</p>
<head>
Get
in
</head>
<p>
Take
a
ferry
from
Shenjiamen
,
in
Zhoushan
.
Tickets
cannot
be
purchased
in
advance
.
It
's
best
to
stay
overnight
near
the
ferry
terminal
in
Shenjiamen
(
if
facing
the
rows
of
seafood
restaurants
along
the
harbor
,
go
left
,
the
ferry
terminal
is
just
beyond
them
,
)
and
get
up
early
in
order
to
get
tickets
during
any
particularly
busy
season
.
</p>
<p>
Ferries
will
take
you
to
Miaozihu
(
庙子湖
)
.
From
there
,
you
can
transfer
to
another
boat
(
rafted
directly
to
the
one
you
took
to
Miaozihu
)
to
Qingbang
and
Dongfushan
Islands
.
Dongfushan
is
the
most
scenic
.
When
arriving
at
Miaozihu
,
going
to
shore
will
put
you
on
Miaozihu
island
,
getting
on
the
boat
attached
to
your
own
boat
will
take
you
to
Qingbang
and
Dongfushan
.
The
second
ferry
will
cost
an
additional
40
yuan
.
</p>
<p>
To
leave
Dongfushan
,
ask
around
as
to
when
tomorrow
's
ferry
tickets
will
be
on
sale
.
They
generally
go
on
sale
between
6:00
and
8:00PM
at
the
small
convenience
store
at
the
&quot;
lowest
&quot;
end
of
town
,
on
the
road
back
to
the
ferry
dock
.
If
tickets
are
unavailable
for
the
ferry
from
Miaozihu
back
to
Shenjiamen
,
get
in
line
anyway
:
The
ticket
checkers
sometimes
have
a
wad
of
their
own
tickets
which
they
will
sell
to
you
.
</p>
<head>
Get
around
</head>
<p>
Miaozihu
has
taxis
.
</p>
<p>
Dongfushan
has
no
automobiles
save
a
few
military
and
construction
vehicles
.
There
is
only
one
road
,
and
most
of
the
paths
along
the
island
are
steep
and
include
stone
stairs
,
so
you
'll
be
on
foot
.

</head>
<p>
Dongfushan
Island
can
be
hiked
in
its
entirety
over

four
hours
,
and
allows
great
views
of
the
surrounding
ocean
,
as
well
as
an
abandoned
village
.
