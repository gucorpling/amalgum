Zamiin-Uud
</ref>
in
<ref target="Mongolia">
Mongolia
</ref>
by
jeep
,
which
costs
around
¥
50
per
person
(
July

)
.
Russian-made
jeeps
driven
by
Mongolian
drivers
start
at
the
market
where
Mongolians
buy
goods
to
take
back
to
Mongolia
.
The
same
jeeps
also
pick
up
passengers
at
the
first
border
checkpoint
with
Chinese
guards
if
they
have
room
.
At
the
border
a
jeep
will
arrive
every
few
minutes
.
A
Chinese
taxi
can
take
you
to
this
checkpoint
for
¥
5
-
10
.
The
jeeps
are
allowed
to
carry
5
passengers
;
however
,
some
drivers
ask
the
Chinese
guards
for
exceptions
and
carry
up
to
7
passengers
.
If
taking
a
jeep
,
expect
to
be
very
crowded
and
to
either
sit
on
someone
's
lap
or
have
someone
sit
on
your
lap
.
Get
out
of
the
jeep
at
the
Chinese
and
Mongolian
entry
points
and
walk
through
.
Be
sure
to
remember
which
jeep
is
yours
as
they
come
in
only
two
colors
(
grey
and
green
)
and
look
nearly
identical
to
each
other
.
Many
Mongolians
cross
the
border
on
a
daily
basis
so
they
are
familiar
with
the
process
and
can
help
out
.
Many
speak
at
least
some
English
.
</p>
<p>
You
are
not
allowed
to
walk
between
the
Chinese
and
Mongolian
border
posts
though
they
are
within
walking
distance
.
You
will
need
to
pay
a
¥
5
exit
tax
.
The
whole
process
takes
around
1½
hours
.

holidays
(
e.
g.

June
,

's
Day
)
,
the
border
is
closed
and
you
may
be
forced
to
stay
a
day
longer
than
prepared
.
It
may
happen
that
a
driver
still
offers
you
a
lift
,
then
notices
at
the
border
that
it
is
n't
possible
and
still
wants
to
charge
you
for
it
.
