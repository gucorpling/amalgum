Mediterranean
climates
</hi>
can
be
found
in
several
locations
around
the
world
outside
of
the
Mediterranean
;
they
usually
have
hot
,
dry
summers
and
mild
winters
,
providing
tourist
destinations
for
those
who
live
in
colder
climates
.
</p>
<head>
Understand
</head>
<p>
Mediterranean
climates
are
a
mixture
of
<ref target="Deserts">
desert
</ref>
and
temperate
climates
.
They
're
often
found
30
to
40
degrees
away
from
the
equator
,
with
the
Mediterranean
climates
closest
to
the
equator
being
more
desertlike
and
Mediterranean
climates
farther
away
from
the
equator
being
more
temperate
.
In
some
ways
,
the
Mediterranean
climate
is
the
optimal
climate
;
it
's
not
as
hot
as
the
desert
in
summer
but
not
as
cold
as
the
temperate
regions
in
winter
,
and
it
's
not
as
dry
as
a
desert
but
also
not
as
wet
as
a
temperate
climate
.
This
provides
a
lot
of
good
opportunities

Most
of
the
rain
in
Mediterranean
climates
comes
during
the
winter
,
with
the
first
rainy
days
around
October
(
Northern
Hemisphere
;
April
would
be
the
Southern
Hemisphere
equivalent
)
and
the
final
rainy
days
in
the
spring
(
often
early
spring
)
.
</p>
<p>
There
are
n't
many
days
of
complete
cloud
cover
during
summer
in
Mediterranean
climates
,
and
even
in
winter
the
sun
gets
quite
high
and
the
days
are
fairly
long
(
due
to
latitude
)
.
There
are
mostly
quite
large
gaps
in
temperature
between
day
and
night
.
</p>
<p>
Mediterranean
climates
can
be
found
around
the
<ref target="Mediterranean%20Sea">
Mediterranean
Sea
</ref>
,
particularly
to
the
north
of
it
in
Southern
Europe
.
However
,
there
are
other
places
with
Mediterranean
climates
;
for
example
,
parts
of
<ref target="California">
California
</ref>
and
<ref target="South%20Africa">
South

have
Mediterranean

<head>
Typical
weather
conditions
</head>
<p>
Weather
to
expect
in
regions
with
Mediterranean
climates
varies
significantly
depending
on
the
time
of
year
.
Generally
,
though
,
Mediterranean
climates
do
not
have
such
distinct
seasons
as
most
temperate
regions
have
,
and
therefore
there
are
only
a
few
possibilities
that
can
be
expected
:
</p>
<list type="unordered">

<hi rend="bold">
Summer
</hi>
:
daily
temperatures
typically
reach
highs
around
;
however
,
cool
ocean
breezes
may
lower
temperatures
significantly
during
the
night
.
When
heat
waves
strike
,
temperatures
may
be
elevated
by
as
much
as
20
degrees
Fahrenheit
.
Rain
is
greatly
unlikely
,
and
completely
blue
skies
like
in
the
pictures
displayed
are
common
.
</item>
<item>
<hi rend="bold">
Spring/Fall
(
Autumn
)
</hi>
:
temperatures
are
milder
than
during
the
summer
,
but
generally
the
weather
is
sunny
.
Most
travelers
will
like
this
time
of
year
the
most
for
going
outdoors
and
hiking
or
cycling
;
however
,
some
years
there
is
not
a
gradual
transition
from
summer
to
winter
;
instead
,
temperatures
go
from
being
hot
to
cold
within
a
day
or
so
.
</item>
<item>
<hi rend="bold">
Winter
</hi>
:
winter
weather
can
be
a
little
unpleasant
some
years
,
due
to
cold
breezes
;
in
particular
,
in
Northern
California
.
Heavy
rainstorms
may
come
during
this
period
,
but
when
they
come
,
they
come
over
a
few
days
and
only
strike
a
few
days
a
year
.
In
mountainous
regions
,
there
may
be
snow

Around
the
Mediterranean
Sea
</head>
<p>
If
there
's
anywhere
to
first
visit
for
a
Mediterranean
climate
,
it
's
the
region
around
the
Mediterranean
Sea
.
It
stretches
along
the
northern
and
eastern
sides
of
the
Mediterranean
Sea
,
across
to
<ref target="Italy">

and
<ref target="Greece">

,
and
then
to

and

Israel
</ref>
.
On
the
southern
,
<ref target="Africa">
African
</ref>
side
of
the
Mediterranean
,
the
land
is
drier
and
mostly
is
desert
.
The
climate
of
the
Mediterranean
is
largely
what
makes
it
such
a
popular
tourist
destination
.

California

This
state
is
known
for
the

dry
palm

<p>
California
's
Mediterranean
climate
is
often
found
just
an
hour
's
drive
inland
,
where
heavy
(
in
comparative
terms
)
rains
come
in
the
winter
,
especially
during
El
Niño
years
,
but
extremely
dry
summers
follow
.
In
spring
,
the
hills
and
mountains
throughout
this
region
are
green
and
covered
in
wetter
places
and
some
sides
of
hills
with
oaks
and
pines
;
in
summer
,
the
hills
turn
gold
because
the
grass
turns
yellow
.
However
,
in
some
places
like
the
Altamont
Hills
,
the
hills
have
no
trees
,
and
often
the
grass
burns
in
fires
,
especially
along
the
sides
of
major
roads
.

The
plentiful
sunny
days
provide
good
opportunities
for
sightseeing
,
and
while
Mediterranean
climate
regions
do
n't
hold
the
most
dramatic
scenery
on
Earth
,
they
have
attractive
mixtures
of
vegetation
and
terrain
that
are
in
contrast
to
thick
forests
and
deserts
found
throughout
much
of
the
world
.
</p>
<p>
While
the
Mediterranean
has
taken
advantage
of
its
Mediterranean
climate
for
tourism
,
California
has
n't
intentionally
promoted
its
climate
and
vegetation
so
much
for
tourists
.
An
exception
is
<ref target="Napa%20Valley">
Napa
Valley
's
wine
country
</ref>
,
where
there
are
miles
of
vineyards
that
can
survive
due
to
the
Mediterranean
climate
.
</p>
<head>
Flora
</head>
<p>
Many
Mediterranean
climate
regions
are
grasslands
with
woodlands
in
wetter
locations
,
like
on
some
mountains
and
alongside
creeks
.
(
Since
Mediterranean
climates
get
almost
all
of
their
rain
in
winter
,
streams
are
rarely
year-round
)
.
Trees
that
grow
in
Mediterranean
climates
include
eucalyptus
trees
and
oaks
;
however
,
the
oak
trees
are
small
.
You
can
also
find
shrubs
in
Mediterranean
climates
,
called
<hi rend="italic">
chaparral
</hi>
,
especially
on
the
sides
of
large
ridges
and
mountains
.
</p>
<head>

<p>
The
good
climate
of
the
region
makes
it
good
for
hiking
and
recreational
cycling
in
rural
areas
and
,
in
coastal
areas
,
good
for
spending
time
on
the
<ref target="Beaches">
beach
</ref>
.
Mostly
,
you
do
n't
have
to
worry
about
rain
spoiling
your
day
,
but
if
rain
does
come
,
get
prepared
for
a
lot
of
it
.
</p>
<p>
Regions
with
Mediterranean
climates
are
also
good
for
taking
<ref target="Photography">
photographs
</ref>
because
it
's
sunny
most
of
the
time
.
