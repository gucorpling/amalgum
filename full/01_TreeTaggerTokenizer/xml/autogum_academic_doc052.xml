Implications
from
Reviewing
GIS-MCDA
Studies
</head>
<p>
This
section
is
based
on
an
already
published
review
on
MAR
suitability
mapping
and
focusses
on
analyzing
the
relevant
parameters
and
methods
for
the
comprehensive
approach
to
GIS-based
suitability
mapping
by
Rahman
et
al.
.
Their
approach
divides
suitability
mapping
into
four
main
steps
.
It
follows
the
scheme
of
(
a
)
problem
definition
,
(
b
)
screening
of
suitable
areas
(
constraint
mapping
)
,
(
c
)
suitability
mapping
including
the
classification
of
thematic
layers
or
criteria
,
standardization
,
weighting
of
the
criteria
,
and
layer
overlaying
by
decision
rule
,
and
(
d
)
sensitivity
analysis
.
</p>
<p>
Problem
definition
is
the
basis
of
choosing
relevant
GIS
maps
and
weighting
their
importance
for
solving
the
problem
statement
.
As
this
part
of
the
approach
is
highly
problem-specific
,
no
general
statement
or
implications
could
be
formulated
from
the
review
.
</p>
<p>
Constraint
mapping
identifies
the
parts
of
the
study
area
that
are
not
suitable
for
the
application
of
MAR
or
need
to
be
excluded
from
the
analysis
as
they
are
,
for
instance
,
natural
reserves
or
private
land
.
This
is
achieved
through
threshold
values
for
the
GIS
criteria
and
by
applying
Boolean
logic
to
clip
respective
areas
from
the
final
map
.
Half
of
the
analyzed
studies
used
constraint
mapping
as
a
tool
to
exclude
unsuitable
areas
.
As
this
methodology
is
widely
used
,
options
to
constrain
single
GIS
datasets
or
complete
areas
from
the
resulting
map
were
envisaged
for
the
web
GIS
tool
.
</p>
<p>
Suitability
mapping
is
the
core
of
the
MCDA
process
as
it
ranks
the
study
area
based
on
its
suitability
for
the
application
of
MAR
.
This
step
comprises
the
standardization
of
GIS
maps
,
the
assignment
of
weights
to
every
map
,
and
the
combination
of
the
weights
and
the
standardized
maps
by
decision
rule
.
The
most
commonly
used
weight
assignment
methods
are
the
rating
method
,
the
ranking
method
,
the
multi-influence
factor
(
MIF
)
,
and
the
pairwise
comparison
.
The
rating
and
ranking
methods
are
very
simple
methods
comprising
manual
weight
assignment
on
a
predetermined
scale
.
MIF
is
a
graphical
weight
assignment
method
where
linkages
between
GIS
datasets
are
drawn
,
and
the
weights
are
calculated
based
on
the
number
and
the
importance
of
linkages
between
the
criteria
.
Pairwise
comparison
is
the
most
used
method
for
GIS-MCDA
in
the
context
of
MAR
.
The
weights
are
calculated
through
a
matrix-based
comparison
of
pairs
of
criteria
.
The
methods
range
from
simple
(
rating
method
)
to
more
complex
(
pairwise
comparison
)
.
The
advantage
of
the
simple
methods
lies
in
the
easiness
of
use
,
whereas
the
complex
methods
,
such
as
pairwise
comparison
,
offer
a
coefficient
indicating
the
consistency
of
the
decision-maker
’s
choices
.
To
account
for
the
advantages
of
both
the
simple
and
more
complex
methods
,
the
rating
and
ranking
method
,
MIF
and
pairwise
comparison
were
chosen
to
be
incorporated
into
the
web
tool
.
</p>
<p>
The
decision
rule
states
how
the
standardized
datasets
and
their
weights
are
combined
to
obtain
the
suitability
map
.
This
integration
can
be
based
on
threshold
values
(
Boolean
logic
)
or
more
elaborate
integration
rules
,
such
as
weighted
linear
combination
(
WLC
)
.
WLC
comprises
the
summation
of
the
weighted
and
standardized
criteria
and
is
the
most
commonly
used
decision
rule
.
It
has
been
developed
further
to
its
derivative
analytical
hierarchical
process
(
AHP
)
.
AHP
is
the
more
structured
approach
that
categorizes
the
GIS
maps
into
hierarchical
levels
before
aggregating
und
summing
up
the
weighted
criteria
.
It
is
used
to
solve
more
complex
decision
problems
.
The
two
most
used
methodologies
,
WLC
and
AHP
,
were
chosen
to
be
incorporated
into
the
web
tool
.
</p>
<p>
To
verify
the
obtained
map
,
a
sensitivity
analysis
should
be
conducted
.
It
is
used
to
display
the
effect
of
different
standardization
and
weights
on
the
final
suitability
map
and
indicates
the
robustness
of
the
obtain
suitability
map
.
While
this
is
an
important
factor
for
strengthening
the
reliability
of
suitability
maps
,
only
21
%
of
the
reviewed
studies
conducted
this
step
.
</p>
<p>
All
reviewed
studies
used
desktop
GIS
software
for
their
analysis
.
Some
studies
created
their
own
tools
for
the
analysis
,
e.
g.
,
Rahman
et
al.
developed
the
GIS-based
Gabardine
desktop
decision
support
system
.
Other
studies
used
tools
available
through
standard
software
,
e.
g.
,
an
AHP
tool
has
been
implemented
as
an
extension
for
ArcGIS
,
which
has
been
applied
by
Anane
et
al.
.
