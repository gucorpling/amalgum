I
also
would
have
supported
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offshore%20drilling">
drilling
off
the
coast
</ref>
.
For
example
,
I
'm
from
Virginia
.
The
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia%20General%20Assembly">
Virginia
General
Assembly
</ref>
has
passed
resolutions
indicating
its
support
of
drilling
off
the
coast
of
Virginia
.
I
would
have
allowed
that
instead
of
blocking
it
like
President
Obama
.
I
will
also
support
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystone%20Pipeline">
Keystone
Pipeline
</ref>
,
which
he
is
opposing
.
We
need
to
have
lower
energy
costs
.
Lower
energy
costs
would
do
most
to
enhance
jobs
,
and
most
little
small
initiatives
done
by
the
president
in
other
areas
.

<hi rend="bold">

I
do
n’t
know
if
the
president
ordered
that
.
Our
national
defense
forces
found
him
and
he
was
fought
in
parcel
with
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Osama_bin_Laden">
Osama

and
I

they
did

taking
out
Osama

Let

Is

<hi rend="bold">

</hi>
<hi rend="bold">
Well
he
was
an
American
citizen
,
so
do
you
believe
that
we
should
treat
American
citizens
overseas
that
are
considered
to
be
dangerous
differently
than
others
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Goode
</hi>
:
Well
let
me
ask
you
this
:
Did
President
Obama
order
his
killing
?
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
(
(
</hi>
<hi rend="bold">
WSS
</hi>
<hi rend="bold">
)
)
</hi>
<hi rend="bold">
I
believe
he
did
.
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Goode
</hi>
:
Well
I
want
to
know
more
facts
before
I
say
yes
or
no
.
Did
he
do
an
act
that
effectively
renounced
his
citizenship
?
He
may
have
and
may
have
committed
treason
.
So
to
answer
that
precisely
,
I
would
have
to
have
more
.
I
would
have
to
be
privy
to
the
intelligence
briefings
that
president
Obama
had
and
that
the
members
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United%20States%20House%20Permanent%20Select%20Committee%20on%20Intelligence">
House
</ref>
and
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United%20States%20Senate%20Select%20Committee%20on%20Intelligence">
Senate
intelligence
committees
</ref>
had
.
And
I
would
like
to
also
get
the
opinions
of
the
members
of
the
intelligence
committee
of
the
House
and
the
Senate
.
And
I
would
want
to
ascertain
whether
he
was
truly
a
citizen
of
the
United
States
.
Was
he
a
dual-citizen
?
You
do
n’t
know
that
do
you
?

<hi rend="bold">
I

for

</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Goode
</hi>
:
Yeah
,
I
do
n’t
either
so
I
want
to
know
more
facts
before
I
could
say
flat
out
one
way

another

<hi rend="bold">
Okay
,
let
’s
talk
more
about
foreign
policy
.
In
2002
,
you
voted
to
authorize
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Iraq_War">
Iraq
War
</ref>
and
you
supported
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq%20War%20troop%20surge%20of%202007">
troop
surge
in
2007
</ref>
.
However
,
the
Constitution
Party
platform
opposes
undeclared
wars
,
and
supports
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United%20States%20non-interventionism">
non-interventionist
</ref>
foreign
policy
.
Do
you
stand
by
your
previous
votes
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Goode
</hi>
:
Now
if
I
was
voting
on
that
situation
in
2008
,
2009
,
2010
,
I
would
have
said
we
should
n’t
go
forward
unless
Congress
debates
the
issue
and
declares
war
.
