5
days
later
,
GRRM
is
still
answering
questions
on
his
<ref target="http://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2018/04/25/fire-blood-on-the-way/">
recent
Fire
&amp;
Blood
blog
post
</ref>
.
Some
earlier
comments
were
discussed
here
yesterday
:
https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/8fvmyj/spoilers_extended_grrm_again_rules_out_releasing/
As
for
today
,
I
thought
this
might
be
worthy
of
a
separate
post
.
The
comment
permalinks
are
n't
working
so
you
'll
just
have
to
Ctrl-F
and
search
for
them
to
see
the
full
context
.
But
here
are
the
comments
:
&gt;Q
:
What
happened
[
since
the
New
Year
's
post
]
?
Did
you
need
to
do
a
lot
of
re-writing
?
Have
you
started
working
on
A
Dream
of
Spring
?
GRRM
:
&gt;I
have
done
some
rewriting
,
yes
.
But
there
have
been
distractions
as
well
.
&gt;
&gt;No
,
I
have
not
started
working
on
A
DREAM
OF
SPRING
.
That
should
end
the
speculation
about
whether
he
's
been
working
on
ADOS
.
And
he
briefly
describes
his
mindset
while
writing
.
GRRM
:
&gt;“Shutting
out
”
is
hitting
the
nail
right
on
the
head
.
&gt;
&gt;When
my
work
is
going
well
—
and
no
,
it
does
not
always
go
well
,
there
are
times
of
trouble
—
nothing
exists
for
me
but
the
scene
I
am
writing
.
Publishers
,
editors
,
deadlines
,
readers
,
fans
,
none
of
that
matters
in
the
least
,
all
of
that
is
gone
.
Only
the
characters
exist
.
&gt;
&gt;Sometimes
this
is
difficult
to
explain
to
readers
.
And
even
to
other
writers
,
whose
approach
and
temperaments
are
different
.
But
it
has
always
been
the
way
I
’ve
worked
.
&gt;
&gt;When
the
real
world
intrudes
…
well
,
that
’s
it
…
one
has
to
do
what
one
can
so
the
real
world
does
not
intrude
.
#EDIT
:
He
also
answered
a
question
(
from
our
very
own
/u/BryndenBFish
)
on
whether
to
break
up
Winds
into
two
volumes
:
&gt;Q
:
Has
there
been
any
thought
of
publishing
WINDS
in
similar
fashion
as
FIRE
AND
BLOOD
:
in
two
volumes
?
GRRM
:
&gt;Some
of
my
publishers
have
suggested
breaking
up
WINDS
as
we
did
with
FEAST
and
DANCE
.
I
am
resisting
that
notion
.

Let
’s
be
honest
,
it
would
be
best
if
he
did
n’t
ever
write
dream
of
spring
.
Let
him
focus
on
winds
.
Our
friend
here
might
have
just
spooked
grrm
,
if
he
is
reminded
of
Dream
he
might
feel
overwhelmed
and
quit
writing
winds
again
.
Let
’s
just
say
dream
is
n’t
coming
out
,
and
lets
be
happy
about
it
not
sad
.
Man
just
think
of
all
of
the
insane
theories
we
can
forever
come
up
with
once
we
get
winds
and
we
can
dream
of
spring
!

Yay
