Paper
Shred
Art
</head>
<p>
Paper
shredders
are
a
common
home
office
item
.
Shredders
provide
protection
against
identity
theft
,
but
they
can
also
be
used
to
make
beautiful
crafts
and
art
projects
!
Put
your
shredder
on
double
duty
using
this
guide
on
how
to
make
paper
shredder
art

Pick
a
shredder
type
.
The
type
of
shredder
that
you
have
will
determine
the
type
of
project
that
you
can
do
.

Go
for
strip
cut
shredders
for
versatility
.
Strip
cut
shredders
cut
paper
into
strips
.
The
width
of
the
strips
depends
on
the
machine
,
but
it
is
typically
between
1/4
and
1/2
inches
.
Strip
cut
shredders
are
great
for
making
collage
art
,
but
they
are
not
as
good
for
making
confetti
art
.
Most
shredder
art
guides
use
strip
cut
machines
.
</item>
<item>
Use
a
cross
cut
shredder
only
for
projects
requiring
very
small
pieces
.
Cross
cut
shredders
cut
paper
into
small
square
pieces
varying
in
size
between
XX
and
XX
inches
.
Higher
security
machines
make
even
smaller
shreddings
and
can
even
turn
paper
into
dust
—
such
machines
are
not
good
for
making
shredder
art
.
Cross
cut
shredders
are
more
common
than
strip
cut
shredders
,
but
they
are
not
as
versatile
for
creating
art
.

Consider
other
factors
as
you
compare
shredder
models
.
The
size
and
capabilities
of
your
shredder
will
impact
the
scale
of
your
project
.
Waste
bin
capacity
,
speed
,
run
time
,
and
multiple
page
capacity
are
all
factors
to
consider
.

The
size
of
your
shredder
will
help
to
determine
the
size
of
your
project
.
Waste
bin
capacity
refers
to
the
size
,
in
volume
,
of
the
bin
that
a
shredder
discards
shredder
material
into
.
A
shredder
with
a
smaller
waste
bin
capacity
might
slow
you
down
.
</item>
<item>
Speed
and
run
time
can
also
slow
you
down
.
A
slow
shredder
will
take
longer
to
shred
through
your
material
.
Run
time
is
the
amount
of
time
that
a
shredder
can
run
continuously
.
Do
not
overload
your
shredder
by
running
it
for
longer
than
intended
.
</item>
<item>
Some
shredders
can
only
shred
one
page
at
a
time
,
while
others
can
shred
multiple
or
even
many
pages
at
once
.
Never
overload
your
shredder
with
more
papers
at
one
time
than
it
can
handle
or
it
will
jam
or
even
break
.

Create
a
color
scheme
.
Decide
on
a
color
or
create
a
color
scheme
for
your
project
.
If
your
project
has
a
theme
,
such
as
Christmas
or
Halloween
,
you
may
already
know
what
colors
to
use
.
If
you
do
not
have
a
preset
color
theme
,
consider
color
theory
when
selecting
colors
.
You
can
also
choose
patterned
paper
,
such
as
origami
paper
,
to
give
your
project
an
extra
flair
.

Choose
the
right
weight
paper
.
Not
all
shredders
can
handle
a
heavier
weight
paper
like
card-stock
,
and
not
all
art
projects
require
heavily
weighted
paper
either
.
Consider
the
parameters
for
your
project
as
well
as
the
limitations
of
your
machine
when
selecting
paper
.

Ensure
an
even
mix
of
color
in
your
project
.
When
adding
your
paper
to
the
machine
,
do
not
add
each
color
all
at
once
.
Instead
,
add
a
few
pieces
of
one
color
,
then
a
few
pieces
of
the
next
color
,
and
so
on
in
a
cycle
to
ensure
an
even
mix
of
colors
in
your
shredder
bag
.
Alternatively
,
if
you
would
like
to
keep
the
colors
separate
,
consider
using
a
different
shredder
bag
for
each
color
so
that
they
do
not
mix
at
all
.

of
colors
in
your
color
theme
,
