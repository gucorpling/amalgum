A
week
later
</head>
<p>
I
should
have
finished
this
letter
long
ago
,
but
I
did
n't
.
You
do
n't
mind
,
do
you
,
Daddy
,
if
I
'm
not
very
regular
?
I
really
do
love
to
write
to
you
;
it
gives
me
such
a
respectable
feeling
of
having
some
family
.
Would
you
like
me
to
tell
you
something
?
You
are
not
the
only
man
to
whom
I
write
letters
.
There
are
two
others
!
I
have
been
receiving
beautiful
long
letters
this
winter
from
Master
Jervie
(
with
typewritten
envelopes
so
Julia
wo
n't
recognize
the
writing
)
.
Did
you
ever
hear
anything
so
shocking
?
And
every
week
or
so
a
very
scrawly
epistle
,
usually
on
yellow
tablet
paper
,
arrives
from
Princeton
.
All
of
which
I
answer
with
business-like
promptness
.
So
you
see
--
I
am
not
so
different
from
other
girls
--
I
get
letters
,
too
.
</p>
<p>
Did
I
tell
you
that
I
have
been
elected
a
member
of
the
Senior
Dramatic
Club
?
Very
recherche
organization
.
Only
seventy-five
members
out
of
one
thousand
.
Do
you
think
as
a
consistent
Socialist
that
I
ought
to
belong
?
</p>
<p>
What
do
you
suppose
is
at
present
engaging
my
attention
in
sociology
?
I
am
writing
(
figurez
vous
!
)
a
paper
on
the
Care
of
Dependent
Children
.
The
Professor
shuffled
up
his
subjects
and
dealt
them
out
promiscuously
,
and
that
fell
to
me
.
C'est
drole
ca
n'est
pas
?
</p>
<p>
There
goes
the
gong
for
dinner
.
I
'll
post
this
as
I
pass
the
box
.
</p>
<p>
Affectionately
,
J.

Dear
Daddy
,
</head>
<p>
Very
busy
time
--
commencement
in
ten
days
,
examinations
tomorrow
;
lots
of
studying
,
lots
of
packing
,
and
the
outdoor
world
so
lovely
that
it
hurts
you
to
stay
inside
.
</p>
<p>
But
never
mind
,
vacation
's
coming
.
Julia
is
going
abroad
this
summer
--
it
makes
the
fourth
time
.
No
doubt
about
it
,
Daddy
,
goods
are
not
distributed
evenly
.
Sallie
,
as
usual
,
goes
to
the
Adirondacks
.
And
what
do
you
think
I
am
going
to
do
?
You
may
have
three
guesses
.
Lock
Willow
?
Wrong
.
The
Adirondacks
with
Sallie
?
Wrong
.
(
I
'll
never
attempt
that
again
;
I
was
discouraged
last
year
.
)
Ca
n't
you
guess
anything
else
?
You
're
not
very
inventive
.
I
'll
tell
you
,
Daddy
,
if
you
'll
promise
not
to
make
a
lot
of
objections
.
I
warn
your
secretary
in
advance
that
my
mind
is
made
up
.
</p>
<p>
I
am
going
to
spend
the
summer
at
the
seaside
with
a
Mrs.
Charles
Paterson
and
tutor
her
daughter
who
is
to
enter
college
in
the
autumn
.
I
met
her
through
the
McBrides
,
and
she
is
a
very
charming
woman
.
I
am
to
give
lessons
in
English
and
Latin
to
the
younger
daughter
,
too
,
but
I
shall
have
a
little
time
to
myself
,
and
I
shall
be
earning
fifty
dollars
a
month
!
Does
n't
that
impress
you
as
a
perfectly
exorbitant
amount
?
She
offered
it
;
I
should
have
blushed
to
ask
for
more
than
twenty-five
.
</p>
<p>
I
finish
at
Magnolia
(
that
's
where
she
lives
)
the
first
of
September
,
and
shall
probably
spend
the
remaining
three
weeks
at
Lock
Willow
--
I
should
like
to
see
the
Semples
again
and
all
the
friendly
animals
.
</p>
<p>
How
does
my
programme
strike
you
,
Daddy
?
I
am
getting
quite
independent
,
you
see
.
You
have
put
me
on
my
feet
and
I
think
I
can
almost
walk
alone
by
now
.
</p>
<p>
Princeton
commencement
and
our
examinations
exactly
coincide
--
which
is
an
awful
blow
.
Sallie
and
I
did
so
want
to
get
away
in
time
for
it
,
but
of
course
that
is
utterly
impossible
.
</p>
<p>
Goodbye
,
Daddy
.
Have
a
nice
summer
and
come
back
in
the
autumn
rested
and
ready
for
another
year
of
work
.
(
That
's
what
you
ought
to
be
writing
to
me
!
)
I
have
n't
any
idea
what
you
do
in
the
summer
,
or
how
you
amuse
yourself
.
I
ca
n't
visualize
your
surroundings
.
Do
you
play
golf
or
hunt
or
ride
horseback
or
just
sit
in
the
sun
and
meditate
?
</p>
<p>
Anyway
,
whatever
it
is
,
have
a
good
time
and
do
n't
forget
Judy
.

Dear
Daddy
,
</head>
<p>
This
is
the
hardest
letter
I
ever
wrote
,
but
I
have
decided
what
I
must
do
,
and
there
is
n't
going
to
be
any
turning
back
.
It
is
very
sweet
and
generous
and
dear
of
you
to
wish
to
send
me
to
Europe
this
summer
--
for
the
moment
I
was
intoxicated
by
the
idea
;
but
sober
second
thoughts
said
no
.
It
would
be
rather
illogical
of
me
to
refuse
to
take
your
money
for
college
,
and
then
use
it
instead
just
for
amusement
!
You
must
n't
get
me
used
to
too
many
luxuries
.
One
does
n't
miss
what
one
has
never
had
;
but
it
's
awfully
hard
going
without
things
after
one
has
commenced
thinking
they
are
his
--
hers
(
English
language
needs
another
pronoun
)
by
natural
right
.
Living
with
Sallie
and
Julia
is
an
awful
strain
on
my
stoical
philosophy
.
They
have
both
had
things
from
the
time
they
were
babies
;
they
accept
happiness
as
a
matter
of
course
.
The
World
,
they
think
,
owes
them
everything
they
want
.
Maybe
the
World
does
--
in
any
case
,
it
seems
to
acknowledge
the
debt
and
pay
up
.
But
as
for
me
,
it
owes
me
nothing
,
and
distinctly
told
me
so
in
the
beginning
.
I
have
no
right
to
borrow
on
credit
,
for
there
will
come
a
time
when
the
World
will
repudiate
my
claim
.
</p>
<p>
I
seem
to
be
floundering
in
a
sea
of
metaphor
--
but
I
hope
you
grasp
my
meaning
?
Anyway
,
I
have
a
very
strong
feeling
that
the
only
honest
thing
for
me
to
do
is
to
teach
this
summer
and
begin
to
support
myself
.
