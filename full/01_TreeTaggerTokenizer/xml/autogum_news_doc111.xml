</ref>
on

after
years
of

.
Benyam
Mohammed
's
case
stirred
controversy
for
years
.
He
was
a
legal
resident
of
the
United
Kingdom
who
had
come
to
the
UK
as
a
refugee
from
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia">
Ethiopia
</ref>
when
he
was
a
child
.
He
explained
that
he
had
traveled
to
Afghanistan
in
an
attempt
to
quit
a
drug
habit
he
acquired
in
the
UK
.
</p>
<p>
He
claimed
that
all
the
very
serious
allegations
that
he
reportedly
confessed
to
were
extracted
while
he
was
being
tortured
.
He
had
claimed
that
he
was
n't
held
in
military
custody
when
he
was
first
captured
,
stating
instead
that
the
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/CIA">
CIA
</ref>
had
temporarily
transferred
him
to
a
brutal
prison
in
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Morocco">
Morocco
</ref>
where
the
interrogation
techniques
included
mutilating
his
genitals
.
He
later
spent
time
in
the
CIA
's
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black%20site">
network
of
secret
interrogation
centres
</ref>

The
Bush
administration
eventually
stopped
denying
that
he
had
spent
considerable
time
in
CIA
custody
prior
to
his
transfer
to
Guantanamo
.
They
continued
to
deny
he
had
been
tortured
.
He
faced
the
allegation
that
he
had
plotted
with
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/José%20Padilla%20(prisoner)">

Padilla

and

He
was
one
of
the
two
dozen

captives
to
face
charges
before
a
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guantanamo%20military%20commission">

.
He
was
charged
twice
in
late
2005
before
a
presidentially
authorized
commission
.
Two
years
after
the

</ref>
.
</p>
<p>
His
lawyers
initiated
legal
proceedings
through
the
United
Kingdom
's
justice
system
to
compel
the
UK
government
to
release
to
them
its
role
in
his
detention
.
The
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office%20of%20Military%20Commissions">
Office
of
Military
Commissions
</ref>
dropped
the
charges
against
him
in
October
2008
.
Benyam
Mohammed
was
reported
to
have
engaged
in
a
hunger
strike
as
a
protest
during
the
last
months
of
his
detention
.
His
lawyers
claimed
his
weight
had
dropped
to
a
level
where
he
was
just
&quot;
skin
and
bones
&quot;
,
fainted
during
their
meetings
with
him
,
and
that
his
health
was
at
serious
risk
.

<p>
All
of
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British%20captives%20in%20Guantanamo">
British
citizens
held
in
Guantanamo
</ref>
were
repatriated
by
2005
.
Seven
long
term
British
residents
were
not
returned
to
the
UK
.
Initially
it
was
the
British
position
that
they
had
no
responsibility
for
individuals
who
were
n't
citizens
.
When
British
resident
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisher%20Amin%20Khalil%20al-Rawi">
Bisher
al-Rawi
</ref>
'
s
story
that
he
had
been
an
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MI5">
MI5
</ref>
informant
started
to
be
confirmed
,
there
was
public
pressure
for
his
return
.
</p>
<p>
In
2006
,
a
frustrated
member
of
the
team
negotiating
Al
Rawi
's
return
leaked
that
the
process
had
become
stalled
because
the
Americans
were
insisting
that
they
would
only
release
Al
Rawi
if
the
United
Kingdom
was
prepared
to
accept
all
the
former
British
residents
and
keep
them
under
round
the
clock
surveillance
.
After
his
repatriation
to
the
United
Kingdom
Mohammed
spent
a
few
hours
being
debriefed
by
British
security
officials
before
he
was
set
free
.
Three
former
British
residents
remain
in
detention
in
Guantanamo
