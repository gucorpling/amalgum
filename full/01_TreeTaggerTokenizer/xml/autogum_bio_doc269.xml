Many
stories

told
about

birth
of

One
says
that
when
Kekuʻiapoiwa
was
pregnant
with
Kamehameha
,
she
had
a
craving
for
the
eyeball
of
a
chief
.
She
was
given
the
eyeball
of
a
man-eating
shark

the
priests
prophesied
that
this
meant
the
child
would
be
a
rebel

a
killer
of
chiefs
.
Alapainui
,
the

the
newborn
infant
killed

Kekuʻiapoiwa
's
time
came
on
a
stormy
night
in
the
Kohala
district
,
when
a
strange
star
with
a
tail
of
white
fire
appeared
in
the
western
sky
.
This
could

's

which
appeared
near
the
end
of

.
According
to
one
legend
,
the
baby
was
passed
through
a
hole
in
the
side
of
Kekuiapoiwa
's
thatched
hut
to
a
local
Kohala
chief
named
Naeʻole
,
who
carried
the
child
to
safety
at
Awini
on
the
island
's
north
coast
.
By
the
time
the
infant
in
Naeʻole
's
care
was
five
,
Alapainui
had
accepted
him
back
into
his
household
