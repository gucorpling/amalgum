CHAPTER
VIII
.
THE
ROOF
SPACES
</head>
<p>
As
the
fans
in
the
circular
aperture
of
the
inner
room
rotated
and
permitted
glimpses
of
the
night
,
dim
sounds
drifted
in
thereby
.
And
Graham
,
standing
underneath
,
wrestling
darkly
with
the
unknown
powers
that
imprisoned
him
,
and
which
he
had
now
deliberately
challenged
,
was
startled
by
the
sound
of
a
voice
.
</p>
<p>
He
peered
up
and
saw
in
the
intervals
of
the
rotation
,
dark
and
dim
,
the
face
and
shoulders
of
a
man
regarding
him
.
When
a
dark
hand
was
extended
,
the
swift
fan
struck
it
,
swung
round
and
beat
on
with
a
little
brownish
patch
on
the
edge
of
its
thin
blade
,
and
something
began
to
fall
therefrom
upon
the
floor
,
dripping
silently
.
</p>
<p>
Graham
looked
down
,
and
there
were
spots
of
blood
at
his
feet
.
He
looked
up
again
in
a
strange
excitement
.
The
figure
had
gone
.
</p>
<p>
He
remained
motionless
--
his
every
sense
intent
upon
the
flickering
patch
of
darkness
,
for
outside
it
was
high
night
.
He
became
aware
of
some
faint
,
remote
,
dark
specks
floating
lightly
through
the
outer
air
.
They
came
down
towards
him
,
fitfully
,
eddyingly
,
and
passed
aside
out
of
the
uprush
from
the
fan
.
A
gleam
of
light
flickered
,
the
specks
flashed
white
,
and
then
the
darkness
came
again
.
Warmed
and
lit
as
he
was
,
he
perceived
that
it
was
snowing
within
a
few
feet
of
him
.
</p>
<p>
Graham
walked
across
the
room
and
came
back
to
the
ventilator
again
.
He
saw
the
head
of
a
man
pass
near
.
There
was
a
sound
of
whispering
.
Then
a
smart
blow
on
some
metallic
substance
,
effort
,
voices
,
and
the
vans
stopped
.
A
gust
of
snowflakes
whirled
into
the
room
,
and
vanished
before
they
touched
the
floor
.
“
Do
n’t
be
afraid
,
”
said
a
voice
.
</p>
<p>
Graham
stood
under
the
fan
.
“
Who
are
you
?
”
he
whispered
.
</p>
<p>
For
a
moment
there
was
nothing
but
a
swaying
of
the
fan
,
and
then
the
head
of
a
man
was
thrust
cautiously
into
the
opening
.
His
face
appeared
nearly
inverted
to
Graham
;
his
dark
hair
was
wet
with
dissolving
flakes
of
snow
upon
it
.
His
arm
went
up
into
the
darkness
holding
something
unseen
.
He
had
a
youthful
face
and
bright
eyes
,
and
the
veins
of
his
forehead
were
swollen
.
He
seemed
to
be
exerting
himself
to
maintain
his
position
.
</p>
<p>
For
several
seconds
neither
he
nor
Graham
spoke
.
</p>
<p>
“
You
were
the
Sleeper
?
”
said
the
stranger
at
last
.
</p>
<p>
“
Yes
,
”
said
Graham
.
“
What
do
you
want
with
me
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
come
from
Ostrog
,
Sire
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Ostrog
?
”
</p>
<p>
The
man
in
the
ventilator
twisted
his
head
round
so
that
his
profile
was
towards
Graham
.
He
appeared
to
be
listening
.
Suddenly
there
was
a
hasty
exclamation
,
and
the
intruder
sprang
back
just
in
time
to
escape
the
sweep
of
the
released
fan
.
And
when
Graham
peered
up
there
was
nothing
visible
but
the
slowly
falling
snow
.
</p>
<p>
It
was
perhaps
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
anything
returned
to
the
ventilator
.
But
at
last
came
the
same
metallic
interference
again
;
the
fans
stopped
and
the
face
reappeared
.
Graham
had
remained
all
this
time
in
the
same
place
,
alert
and
tremulously
excited
.
</p>
<p>
“
Who
are
you
?
What
do
you
want
?
”
he
said
.
</p>
<p>
“
We
want
to
speak
to
you
,
Sire
,
”
said
the
intruder
.
</p>
<p>
“
We
want
--
I
ca
n’t
hold
the
thing
.
We
have
been
trying
to
find
a
way
to
you
these
three
days
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Is
it
rescue
?
”
whispered
Graham
.
“
Escape
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Yes
,
Sire
.
If
you
will
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
You
are
my
party
--
the
party
of
the
Sleeper
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Yes
,
Sire
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
What
am
I
to
do
?
”
said
Graham
.
</p>
<p>
There
was
a
struggle
.
The
stranger
’s
arm
appeared
,
and
his
hand
was
bleeding
.
His
knees
came
into
view
over
the
edge
of
the
funnel
.
“
Stand
away
from
me
,
”
he
said
,
and
he
dropped
rather
heavily
on
his
hands
and
one
shoulder
at
Graham
’s
feet
.
The
released
ventilator
whirled
noisily
.
The
stranger
rolled
over
,
sprang
up
nimbly
and
stood
panting
,
hand
to
a
bruised
shoulder
,
and
with
his
bright
eyes
on
Graham
.
</p>
<p>
“
You
are
indeed
the
Sleeper
,
”
he
said
.
“
I
saw
you
asleep
.
When
it
was
the
law
that
anyone
might
see
you
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
am
the
man
who
was
in
the
trance
,
”
said
Graham
.
“
They
have
imprisoned
me
here
.
I
have
been
here
since
I
awoke
--
at
least
three
days
.
”
</p>
<p>
The
intruder
seemed
about
to
speak
,
heard
something
,
glanced
swiftly
at
the
door
,
and
suddenly
left
Graham
and
ran
towards
it
,
shouting
quick
incoherent
words
.
A
bright
wedge
of
steel
flashed
in
his
hand
,
and
he
began
tap
,
tap
,
a
quick
succession
of
blows
upon
the
hinges
.
“
Mind
!
”
cried
a
voice
.
“
Oh
!
”
The
voice
came
from
above
.
</p>
<p>
Graham
glanced
up
,
saw
the
soles
of
two
feet
,
ducked
,
was
struck
on
the
shoulder
by
one
of
them
,
and
a
heavy
weight
bore
him
to
the
earth
.
He
fell
on
his
knees
and
forward
,
and
the
weight
went
over
his
head
.
He
knelt
up
and
saw
a
second
man
from
above
seated
before
him
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
did
not
see
you
,
Sire
,
”
panted
the
man
.
He
rose
and
assisted
Graham
to
arise
.
“
Are
you
hurt
,
Sire
?
”
he
panted
.
A
succession
of
heavy
blows
on
the
ventilator
began
,
something
fell
close
to
Graham
’s
face
,
and
a
shivering
edge
of
white
metal
danced
,
fell
over
,
and
lay
flat
upon
the
floor
.
</p>
<p>
“
What
is
this
?
”
cried
Graham
,
confused
and
looking
at
the
ventilator
.
“
Who
are
you
?
What
are
you
going
to
do
?
Remember
,
I
understand
nothing
.
”
