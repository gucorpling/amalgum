Discussion

<p>
Starting
deliberations
concerning
the
issues
of
the
possibility
of
scientific
recognition
,
especially
research
methods
for
identification
and
explanation
of
the
problem
of
sustainable
tourism
,
its
nature
and
possibility
of
its
development
and
evaluation
is
an
important
aspect
in
the
study
.
This
represents
taking
into
account
the
ontological
aspect
(
that
inquires
whether
the
analysis
of
existence
should
precede
the
analysis
of
recognition
)
,
as
well
as
epistemological
one
(
comprising
the
problem
of
appropriate
path
of
recognition
)
.
</p>
<p>
Conducting
tourism
activity
has
a
very
complex
nature
because
it
takes
place
both
in
geographical
space
(
physical
and
anthropogenic
)
,
as
well
as
in
economic
,
social
and
cultural
space
.
In
an
individual
dimension
,
tourism
also
gains
the
psychological
aspect
,
because
it
represents
some
symbolic
and
emotional
value
of
a
high
level
of
individualization
.
Consequently
,
tourism
is
becoming
the
subject
of
interest
of
researchers
who
represent
various
fields
and
apply
diverse
methods
.
This
multi-faceted
nature
of
the
phenomena
occurring
in
tourism
raises
the
need
to
approach
tourist
activity
as
conducted
in
the
space
linking
both
material
and
non-material
aspects
.
</p>
<p>
The
case
study
adopts
the
initial
ontological
assumption
that
shows
that
studied
aspects
of
sustainable
tourism
should
be
approached
as
a
part
of
a
higher
level
space
(
geographical
,
socio-economic
and
cultural
)
,
rather
than
as
a
separate
entity
.
These
ontological
assumptions
affect
epistemological
aspects
and
adoption
of
some
assumptions
concerning
the
methods
of
sustainable
tourism
research
.
However
,
it
is
assumed
that
it
should
be
studied
in
a
multi-faceted
way
while
taking
into
account
its
specific
and
complex
character
,
and
also
considering
strong
relationships
with
the
external
environment
.
Analysing
the
trends
of
further
research
it
seems
useful
to
verify
how
much
the
defined
features
distinguishing
sustainable
tourism
from
the
higher
level
space
,
enable
its
measurement
or
description
in
the
sphere
of
adopted
research
aspects
,
depending
on
the
assumed
methodological
approach
,
i.
e.
,
quantitative
,
qualitative
or
mixed
.
</p>
<p>
It
should
be
stated
that
it
is
difficult
to
assess
these
two
types
of
research
and
recognise
one
of
them
as
better
than
the
other
.
This
results
from
the
fact
that
each
of
them
enables
gaining
another
set
of
information
,
that
if
it
is
used
differently
,
it
supports
solving
the
research
problem
.
Consequently
,
this
causes
quantitative
research
to
occur
together
with
qualitative
while
complementing
each
other
,
or
possibly
it
precedes
qualitative
research
while
enabling
primary
recognition
of
the
formulated
problem
.
The
purpose
of
triangulation
of
research
methods
may
be
particularly
useful
to
increase
the
credibility
and
validity
of
the
results
and
gives
a
more
detailed
and
balanced
picture
of
the
situation
.
It
is
an
&quot;
attempt
to
explain
more
fully
,
the
richness
and
complexity
of
human
behavior
by
studying
it
from
more
than
one
standpoint
.
&quot;
The
concept
of
triangulation
is
borrowed
from
navigational
and
land
surveying
techniques
that
determine
a
single
point
in
space
with
the
convergence
of
measurements
taken
from
two
other
distinct
points
&quot;
.
It
is
an
appropriate
strategy
of
founding
the
credibility
of
qualitative
analyses
and
it
becomes
an
alternative
to
traditional
criteria
like
reliability
and
validity
.
</p>
<p>
According
to
Spencer
’s
views
,
development
,
on
the
one
hand
,
consists
in
a
growing
diversification
of
phenomena
,
and
on
the
other
hand
in
their
growing
integration
,
ordering
and
balancing
.
For
the
assessment
of
the
development
of
sustainable
tourism
,
this
represents
the
need
to
identify
and
measure
the
broadly
perceived
benefits
against
broadly
approached
costs
of
tourism
development
.
An
attempt
to
consider
all
or
at
least
the
majority
of
elements
of
contemporary
tourist
space
would
demand
application
of
the
research
approach
of
a
synthetic
and
systemic
character
.
Such
an
approach
would
be
especially
important
at
identification
and
analysis
of
the
level
of
tourism
sustainability
.
</p>
<p>
For
the
holistic
approach
to
the
issues
of
sustainable
development
,
it
is
necessary
to
evaluate
all
tourism
stakeholders
in
a
given
area
.
This
reflects
the
necessity
to
consider
the
opinions
of
tourists
,
as
well
as
residents
and
other
entities
(
in
visited
places
)
directly
or
indirectly
involved
in
tourism
development
.
This
results
from
the
fact
that
both
tourists
,
as
well
as
the
local
community
,
can
have
diverse
expectations
,
but
they
also
bear
consequences
(
positive
and
negative
)
in
terms
of
the
broadly
perceived
natural
,
socio-cultural
and
economic
environment
.
</p>
<p>
The
specified
division
into
more
uniform
sub-groups
supports
the
performance
of
research
on
the
evaluation
of
the
level
of
sustainable
tourism
development
as
perceived
by
many
groups
of
stakeholders
.
As
a
result
,
subgroups
of
diverse
socio-demographic
features
,
but
also
different
reasons
for
travelling
and
related
different
expectations
or
travel
frequency
can
be
indicated
within
the
group
of
tourists
.
On
the
other
hand
,
within
the
local
community
one
can
distinguish
tourist
entrepreneurs
,
workers
,
employers
hired
for
tourist
services
,
representatives
of
public
administration
,
representatives
of
social
organisations
associated
with
tourism
development
among
others
.
However
,
people
not
involved
in
providing
services
to
tourists
or
people
occupationally
not
active
that
are
affected
by
tourism
development
should
also
be
included
here
.
