What
are
you
doing
here
in
Levico
?
Are
you
going
to
talk
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
Actually
,
I
'm
an
organizer
.
So
many
people
wanted
to
talk
,
so
we
decided
to
take
a
step
backwards
so
I
am
not
giving
a
talk
here
.
But
I
have
several
students
here
who
are
talking
about
work
related
to
what
I
do
.
My
work
is
looking
at
symmetry
,
something
called
group
theory
,
but
using
tools
from
number
theory
,
something
called
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeta%20function">
Zeta
function
</ref>
,
which
was
introduced
by
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard%20Riemann">
Riemann
</ref>
.
So
I
used
that
tool
to
try
and
understand
instead
of
prime
numbers
,
which
are
very
hard
to
understand
,
what
sort
of
symmetry
can
exist
.
That
is
one
of
the
major
things
I
have
been
investigating
.
This
conference
is
looking
at
ways
of
connecting
lots
of
different
ideas
in
mathematics
to
help
us
understand
groups
and
symmetry
.

As
a
mathematician
you
are
dedicating
yourself
not
only
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/research">
research
</ref>
but
also
to
popularization
.
Why
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
I
think
being
a
scientist
is
about
making
discoveries
but
it
is
also
as
much
about
communication
.
I
mean
discoveries
really
cannot
be
said
to
exist
,
I
think
,
unless
you
communicate
them
to
other
people
.
So
,
for
example
this
conference
is
about
communicating
to
our
peers
but
I
think
that
communication
can
go
to
a
much
broader
audience
.
It
brings
the
mathematics
alive
much
more
,
if
you
can
communicate
it
to
more
people
.
But
also
,
you
know
,
I
became
a
mathematician
because
people
,
the
generation
above
me
,
made
the
effort
to
excite
the
general
public
about
mathematics
and
I
thought
that
was
what
I
wanted
to
be
when
I
grow
up
,
so
my
hope
is
as
well
that
my
popularization
will
encourage
the
next
generation
of
mathematicians
but
also
to
encourage
politicians
to
recognize
that
maths
is
an
important
part
of
our
society
and
needs
to
be
funded
.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
What
about
your
experiences
on
radio
and
television
?
</hi>
</p>
<p>
I
've
done
a
lot
of
radio
work
,
exploring
mathematical
ideas
on
the
radio
.
However
,
people
could
not
just
think
that
maths
could
be
done
on
television
,
you
know
,
what
are
you
going
to
see
?
It
was
a
real
breakthrough
for
me
to
be
able
to
make
some
documentaries
about
mathematics
.
In
particular
I
did
a
documentary
about
The
Music
of
the
Primes
,
and
it
was
great
!
It
was
a
travel
program
because
mathematics
is
a
very
international
subject
and
so
we
travel
around
the
world
:
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India">
India
</ref>
,
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany">
Germany
</ref>
,
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece">
Greece
</ref>
.
At
the
moment
I
'm
in
the
middle
of
making
a
history
of
mathematics
series
for
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC">
BBC
</ref>
,
four
one-hour
programs
from
the
Ancient
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon">
Babylon
</ref>
through
to
the
modern
day
.
So
we
've
been
all
over
the
world
to
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China">
China
</ref>
,
to
India
again
,
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa">
Africa
</ref>
...
And
I
also
did
a
game
show
,
that
was
quite
fun
,
called
Mind
Games
,
which
was
a
puzzle
show
which
I
hosted
.
I
think
a
lot
of
people
got
into
mathematics
because
of
puzzles
,
especially
at
the
moment
,
with
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku">
Sudoku
</ref>
being
so
popular
,
I
think
people
will
love
doing
puzzles
-
now
it
's
a
very
popular
TV
show
.
