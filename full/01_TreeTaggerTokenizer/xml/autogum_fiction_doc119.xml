PREFACE
</head>
<p>
“
PAUL
PRESCOTT'S
CHARGE
”
is
presented
to
the
public
as
the
second
volume
of
the
Campaign
Series
.
Though
wholly
unlike
the
first
volume
,
it
is
written
in
furtherance
of
the
same
main
idea
,
that
every
boy
's
life
is
a
campaign
,
more
or
less
difficult
,
in
which
success
depends
upon
integrity
and
a
steadfast
adherence
to
duty
.
</p>
<p>
How
Paul
Prescott
gained
strength
by
battling
with
adverse
circumstances
,
and
,
under
all
discouragements
,
kept
steadily
before
him
the
charge
which
he
received
from
his
dying
father
,
is
fully
told
;
and
the
author
will
be
glad
if
the
record
shall
prove
an
incentive
and
an
encouragement
to
those
boys
who
may
have
a
similar
campaign
before
them
.
</p>
<p>
PAUL
PRESCOTT'S
CHARGE
.
</p>
<p>
I.
</p>
<p>
SQUIRE
NEWCOME
.
</p>
<p>
“
HANNAH
!
”
</p>
<p>
The
speaker
was
a
tall
,
pompous-looking
man
,
whose
age
appeared
to
verge
close
upon
fifty
.
He
was
sitting
bolt
upright
in
a
high-backed
chair
,
and
looked
as
if
it
would
be
quite
impossible
to
deviate
from
his
position
of
unbending
rigidity
.
</p>
<p>
Squire
Benjamin
Newcome
,
as
he
was
called
,
in
the
right
of
his
position
as
Justice
of
the
Peace
,
Chairman
of
the
Selectmen
,
and
wealthiest
resident
of
Wrenville
,
was
a
man
of
rule
and
measure
.
He
was
measured
in
his
walk
,
measured
in
his
utterance
,
and
measured
in
all
his
transactions
.
He
might
be
called
a
dignified
machine
.
He
had
a
very
exalted
conception
of
his
own
position
,
and
the
respect
which
he
felt
to
be
his
due
,
not
only
from
his
own
household
,
but
from
all
who
approached
him
.
If
the
President
of
the
United
States
had
called
upon
him
,
Squire
Newcome
would
very
probably
have
felt
that
he
himself
was
the
party
who
conferred
distinction
,
and
not
received
it
.
</p>
<p>
Squire
Newcome
was
a
widower
.
His
wife
,
who
was
as
different
from
himself
as
could
well
be
conceived
,
did
not
live
long
after
marriage
.
She
was
chilled
to
death
,
as
it
was
thought
,
by
the
dignified
iceberg
of
whose
establishment
she
had
become
a
part
.
She
had
left
,
however
,
a
child
,
who
had
now
grown
to
be
a
boy
of
twelve
.
This
boy
was
a
thorn
in
the
side
of
his
father
,
who
had
endeavored
in
vain
to
mould
him
according
to
his
idea
of
propriety
.
But
Ben
was
gifted
with
a
spirit
of
fun
,
sometimes
running
into
mischief
,
which
was
constantly
bursting
out
in
new
directions
,
in
spite
of
his
father
's
numerous
and
rather
prosy
lectures
.
</p>
<p>
“
Han-nah
!
”
again
called
Squire
Newcome
,
separating
the
two
syllables
by
a
pause
of
deliberation
,
and
strongly
accenting
the
last
syllable
,
--
a
habit
of
his
with
all
proper
names
.
</p>
<p>
Hannah
was
the
Irish
servant
of
all
work
,
who
was
just
then
engaged
in
mixing
up
bread
in
the
room
adjoining
,
which
was
the
kitchen
.
</p>
<p>
Feeling
a
natural
reluctance
to
appear
before
her
employer
with
her
hands
covered
with
dough
,
she
hastily
washed
them
.
All
this
,
however
,
took
time
,
and
before
she
responded
to
the
first
summons
,
the
second
“
Han-nah
!
”
delivered
with
a
little
sharp
emphasis
,
had
been
uttered
.
</p>
<p>
At
length
she
appeared
at
the
door
of
the
sitting-room
.
</p>
<p>
“
Han-nah
!
”
said
Squire
Newcome
,
fixing
his
cold
gray
eye
upon
her
,
“
when
you
hear
my
voice
a
calling
you
,
it
is
your
duty
to
answer
the
summons
IMMEJIATELY
.
”
</p>
<p>
I
have
endeavored
to
represent
the
Squire
's
pronunciation
of
the
last
word
.
</p>
<p>
“
So
I
would
have
come
IMMEJOUSLY
,
”
said
Hannah
,
displaying
a
most
reprehensible
ignorance
,
“
but
me
hands
were
all
covered
with
flour
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
That
makes
no
difference
,
”
interrupted
the
Squire
.
“
Flour
is
an
accidental
circumstance
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
What
's
that
?
”
thought
Hannah
,
opening
her
eyes
in
amazement
.
</p>
<p>
“
And
should
not
be
allowed
to
interpose
an
obstacle
to
an
IMMEJIATE
answer
to
my
summons
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Sir
,
”
said
Hannah
,
who
guessed
at
the
meaning
though
she
did
not
understand
the
words
,
“
you
would
n't
have
me
dirty
the
door-handle
with
me
doughy
hands
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
That
could
easily
be
remedied
by
ablution
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
There
ai
n't
any
ablution
in
the
house
,
”
said
the
mystified
Hannah
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
mean
,
”
Squire
Newcome
condescended
to
explain
,
“
the
application
of
water
--
in
short
,
washing
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Shure
,
”
said
Hannah
,
as
light
broke
in
upon
her
mind
,
“
I
never
knew
that
was
what
they
called
it
before
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
Is
Ben-ja-min
at
home
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Yes
,
sir
.
He
was
out
playin
'
in
the
yard
a
minute
ago
.
I
guess
you
can
see
him
from
the
winder
.
”
</p>
<p>
So
saying
she
stepped
forward
,
and
looking
out
,
all
at
once
gave
a
shrill
scream
,
and
rushed
from
the
room
,
leaving
her
employer
in
his
bolt-upright
attitude
gazing
after
her
with
as
much
astonishment
as
he
was
capable
of
.
</p>
<p>
The
cause
of
her
sudden
exit
was
revealed
on
looking
out
of
the
window
.
</p>
<p>
Master
Benjamin
,
or
Ben
,
as
he
was
called
everywhere
except
in
his
own
family
,
had
got
possession
of
the
black
kitten
,
and
appeared
to
be
submerging
her
in
the
hogshead
of
rainwater
.
</p>
<p>
“
O
,
you
wicked
,
cruel
boy
,
to
drown
poor
Kitty
!
”
exclaimed
the
indignant
Hannah
,
rushing
into
the
yard
and
endeavoring
to
snatch
her
feline
favorite
--
an
attempt
which
Ben
stoutly
resisted
.
</p>
<p>
Doubtless
the
poor
kitten
would
have
fared
badly
between
the
two
,
had
not
the
window
opened
,
and
the
deliberate
voice
of
his
father
,
called
out
in
tones
which
Ben
saw
fit
to
heed
.
</p>
<p>
“
What
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
Come
into
my
presence
immejiately
,
and
learn
to
answer
me
with
more
respect
.
”
</p>
<p>
Ben
came
in
looking
half
defiant
.
</p>
<p>
His
father
,
whose
perpendicularity
made
him
look
like
a
sitting
grenadier
,
commenced
the
examination
thus
:
--
</p>
<p>
“
I
wish
you
to
inform
me
what
you
was
a
doing
of
when
I
spoke
to
you
.
”
