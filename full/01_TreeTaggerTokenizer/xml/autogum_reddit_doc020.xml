I
can
think
of
several
crimes
that
were
committed
prior
to
the
officer
using
force
to
detain
the
girl
and
even
several
more
after
.
1
The
girl
was
in
possession
of
alcohol
as
a
minor
.
2
She
failed
to
identify
herself
,
and
she
was
required
to
because
if
the
first
crime
.
3
Failure
to
stop
at
the
command
of
a
police
officer
.
4
Resisting
arrest
.
After
the
detention
you
have
the
fact
that
she
spat
at
the
officers
,
which
is
illegal
and
disorderly
conduct
.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
As
for
the
officers
actions
.
They
fact
he
said
you
're
about
to
get
dropped
is
not
a
crime
or
excessive
force
.
Could
he
have
chose
different
words
,
yes
,
but
that
is
not
necessarily
wrong
.
The
use
of
force
up
to
the
punching
was
not
excessive
.
The
punching
I
think
went
a
too
far
.
She
was
not
a
large
person
and
the
two
officers
on
scene
should
have
been
able
to
detain
her
.
Also
they
have
other
training
techniques
they
could
use
that
are
not
as
forceful
.

This
is
a
bit
ironic
,
because
I
was
actually
planning
on
making
the
opposite
thread
,
asking
people
to
change
my
view
and
show
me
what
the
police
did
wrong
in
this
situation
.
</p>
<p>
Let
's
pretend
as
though
we
are
the
police
officer
here
.
We
are
walking
down
the
beach
,
patrolling
and
making
sure
no
crimes
are
being
committed
and
everyone
is
safe
.
We
see
a
young
girl
with
a
container
of
alcohol
on
her
beach
blanket
.
This
is
already
a
crime
,
whether
you
're
under
21
or
not
(
just
like
how
you
could
n't
walk
down
a
public
street
carrying
a
container
of
alcohol
.
Furthermore
,
she
's
a
minor
,
which
is
a
separate
crime
.
So
now
she
's
committed
two
crimes
.
We
ask
for
her
name
(
which
she
is
legally
required
to
give
to
us
,
as
we
know
for
a
fact
that
she
has
committed
two
crimes
)
,
and
she
does
n't
give
it
to
us
after
multiple
requests
.
So
now
she
's
committed
three
separate
crimes
,
so
we
go
to
arrest
her
.
</p>
<p>
She
runs
away
and
pushes
the
police
officers
away
(
this
can
be
seen
in
the
video
)
,
which
makes
crime
#4
.
Once
they
are
on
top
of
her
,
she
kicks
them
and
spits
on
them
.
The
only
questionable
actions
by
the
police
officers
are
the
two
hits
that
he
delivers
while
attempting
to
subdue
her
.
That
might
be
excessive
force
,
it
might
not
be
;
that
's
for
a
judge
to
decide
,
and
I
do
believe
that
these
officers
should
have
to
stand
trial
in
a
court
of
law
.
However
,
it
's
pretty
easy
to
see
how
the
woman
in
the
video
was
at
fault
.
She
committed
multiple
crimes
,
and
then
was
completely
uncooperative
(
illegally
so
)
when
confronted
by
the
police
.
