Hello
guys
,
I
'm
asking
for
advice
on
how
to
WC
from
this
point
on
.

I
currently
have
4,5k
dev
,
Ottos
(
2k
dev
)
are
allies
with
100
trust
which
means
i
can
drag
them
into
any
reasonable
wars
.
Capital
is
still
Delhi
since
i
did
nt
quite
figure
out
on
where
to
set
my
home
trade
node
.
I
want
to
put
it
in
Europe
,
preferably
Constantinople
,
to
finally
get
these
juicy
Trade
Companies
(
works
only
if
your
capital
is
in
continental
Europe
,
right
?
)
,
but
this
wont
happen
anytime
soon
.

I
'm
currently
triggering
Court
&amp;
Country
and
have
absolutism
maxed
at
70/70
.
I
still
have
some
years
left
until
the
disaster
ends
(
around
7yrs
)
.
Since
I
only
recently
learned
how
to
trigger
C&amp;C
,
i
do
nt
quite
know
whether
i
should
stop
declaring
wars
until
it
finishes
or
just
keep
on
declaring
.
Suggestions
?
My
war
path
as
of
now
are
either
Sweden
,
Russia
,
Naples
and
Ming
.
The
african
minors
are
all
at
truce
and
acquirable
within
years
.
Everything
east
of
me
is
either
Ming
or
a
tributary
of
theirs
,
except
Japan
,
Malacca
and
the
indie-Nations
,
which
are
out
of
reach
.
Where
should
I
expand
next
?
i
do
nt
consider
conquering
Ming
until
Imperialism
Cb
.
They
are
at
0
Mandate
already
and
i
think
I
can
manage
conquering
Ming
quite
fast
due
to
the
amount
of
Tributaries
they
have
.
Also
,
I
feel
like
i
'd
be
wasting
too
much
time
micro
managing
my
troops
conquering
Ming
this
early
(
no
free
forced
march
,
low
on
manpower
,
weak
economy
atm
)
.
Thoughts
?
My
Ideas
are
Inf
-&gt;
Adm
-&gt;
Human
-&gt;
Off
-&gt;
Dip
.
Im
planing
on
going
Innovative
next
mainly
due
the
off-innovative
policy
which
gives
me
1
leader
siege
pip
+
10
%
siege
ability
.
also
,
tech
cost
reduction
,
advisor
cost
reduction
paired
with
estates
advisors
,
+1
leader
and
war
exhaustion
reduction
are
phenomenal
imo
.
after
innovative
I
'd
go
aristocratic
mainly
for
the
extra
+1
leader
siege
pip
.
reduced
army
tradition
decay
is
good
aswell
since
im
constantly
at
war
and
the
+33
%
national
manpower
is
much
needed
as
of
now
.
Thoughts
?
should
i
swap
innovative
with
aristocratic
since
manpower
is
an
issue
?
Any
advice
is
much
appreciated
!
Btw
,
how
do
I
handle
the
HRE
if
everything
is
conquered
except
those
pesky
princes
?

<sp who="#Sevuhrow">
<p>
Caucasian
provinces
can
count
as
Europe
.
You
can
move
your
capital
there
,
which
allows
you
to
do
Trade
Companies
.

EDIT
:
<ref target="https: www.youtube.com watch?v=_Oi9DkyqoPA&amp;t=365s">
This
helps
a
lot
with
absolutism
and
C&amp;C
</ref>
.
TL
;
DR
,
the
C&amp;C
disaster
is
a
lot
more
psychological
than
anything
.
It
's
a
very
tame
disaster
and
you
can
focus
on
wars
after
a
few
years
of
it
starting
.
