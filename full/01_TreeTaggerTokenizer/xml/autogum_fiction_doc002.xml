Chapter
9
THE
NEVER
BIRD
</head>
<p>
The
last
sound
Peter
heard
before
he
was
quite
alone
were
the
mermaids
retiring
one
by
one
to
their
bedchambers
under
the
sea
.
He
was
too
far
away
to
hear
their
doors
shut
;
but
every
door
in
the
coral
caves
where
they
live
rings
a
tiny
bell
when
it
opens
or
closes
(
as
in
all
the
nicest
houses
on
the
mainland
)
,
and
he
heard
the
bells
.
</p>
<p>
Steadily
the
waters
rose
till
they
were
nibbling
at
his
feet
;
and
to
pass
the
time
until
they
made
their
final
gulp
,
he
watched
the
only
thing
on
the
lagoon
.
He
thought
it
was
a
piece
of
floating
paper
,
perhaps
part
of
the
kite
,
and
wondered
idly
how
long
it
would
take
to
drift
ashore
.
</p>
<p>
Presently
he
noticed
as
an
odd
thing
that
it
was
undoubtedly
out
upon
the
lagoon
with
some
definite
purpose
,
for
it
was
fighting
the
tide
,
and
sometimes
winning
;
and
when
it
won
,
Peter
,
always
sympathetic
to
the
weaker
side
,
could
not
help
clapping
;
it
was
such
a
gallant
piece
of
paper
.
</p>
<p>
It
was
not
really
a
piece
of
paper
;
it
was
the
Never
bird
,
making
desperate
efforts
to
reach
Peter
on
the
nest
.
By
working
her
wings
,
in
a
way
she
had
learned
since
the
nest
fell
into
the
water
,
she
was
able
to
some
extent
to
guide
her
strange
craft
,
but
by
the
time
Peter
recognised
her
she
was
very
exhausted
.
She
had
come
to
save
him
,
to
give
him
her
nest
,
though
there
were
eggs
in
it
.
I
rather
wonder
at
the
bird
,
for
though
he
had
been
nice
to
her
,
he
had
also
sometimes
tormented
her
.
I
can
suppose
only
that
,
like
Mrs.
Darling
and
the
rest
of
them
,
she
was
melted
because
he
had
all
his
first
teeth
.
</p>
<p>
She
called
out
to
him
what
she
had
come
for
,
and
he
called
out
to
her
what
she
was
doing
there
;
but
of
course
neither
of
them
understood
the
other
's
language
.
In
fanciful
stories
people
can
talk
to
the
birds
freely
,
and
I
wish
for
the
moment
I
could
pretend
that
this
were
such
a
story
,
and
say
that
Peter
replied
intelligently
to
the
Never
bird
;
but
truth
is
best
,
and
I
want
to
tell
you
only
what
really
happened
.
Well
,
not
only
could
they
not
understand
each
other
,
but
they
forgot
their
manners
.
</p>
<p>
“
I
--
want
--
you
--
to
--
get
--
into
--
the
--
nest
,
”
the
bird
called
,
speaking
as
slowly
and
distinctly
as
possible
,
“
and
--
then
--
you
--
can
--
drift
--
ashore
,
but
--
I
--
am
--
too
--
tired
--
to
--
bring
--
it
--
any
--
nearer
--
so
--
you
--
must
--
try
to
--
swim
--
to
--
it
.
”
</p>
<p>
“
What
are
you
quacking
about
?
”
Peter
answered
.
“
Why
do
n't
you
let
the
nest
drift
as
usual
?
”
</p>
<p>
“
I
--
want
--
you
--
”
the
bird
said
,
and
repeated
it
all
over
.
</p>
<p>
Then
Peter
tried
slow
and
distinct
.
</p>
<p>
“
What
--
are
--
you
--
quacking
--
about
?
”
and
so
on
.
</p>
<p>
The
Never
bird
became
irritated
;
they
have
very
short
tempers
.
</p>
<p>
“
You
dunderheaded
little
jay
!
”
she
screamed
,
“
Why
do
n't
you
do
as
I
tell
you
?
”
</p>
<p>
Peter
felt
that
she
was
calling
him
names
,
and
at
a
venture
he
retorted
hotly
:
</p>
<p>
“
So
are
you
!
”
</p>
<p>
Then
rather
curiously
they
both
snapped
out
the
same
remark
:
</p>
<p>
“
Shut
up
!
”
</p>
<p>
“
Shut
up
!
”
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless
the
bird
was
determined
to
save
him
if
she
could
,
and
by
one
last
mighty
effort
she
propelled
the
nest
against
the
rock
.
Then
up
she
flew
;
deserting
her
eggs
,
so
as
to
make
her
meaning
clear
.
</p>
<p>
Then
at
last
he
understood
,
and
clutched
the
nest
and
waved
his
thanks
to
the
bird
as
she
fluttered
overhead
.
It
was
not
to
receive
his
thanks
,
however
,
that
she
hung
there
in
the
sky
;
it
was
not
even
to
watch
him
get
into
the
nest
;
it
was
to
see
what
he
did
with
her
eggs
.
</p>
<p>
There
were
two
large
white
eggs
,
and
Peter
lifted
them
up
and
reflected
.
The
bird
covered
her
face
with
her
wings
,
so
as
not
to
see
the
last
of
them
;
but
she
could
not
help
peeping
between
the
feathers
.
</p>
<p>
I
forget
whether
I
have
told
you
that
there
was
a
stave
on
the
rock
,
driven
into
it
by
some
buccaneers
of
long
ago
to
mark
the
site
of
buried
treasure
.
The
children
had
discovered
the
glittering
hoard
,
and
when
in
a
mischievous
mood
used
to
fling
showers
of
moidores
,
diamonds
,
pearls
and
pieces
of
eight
to
the
gulls
,
who
pounced
upon
them
for
food
,
and
then
flew
away
,
raging
at
the
scurvy
trick
that
had
been
played
upon
them
.
The
stave
was
still
there
,
and
on
it
Starkey
had
hung
his
hat
,
a
deep
tarpaulin
,
watertight
,
with
a
broad
brim
.
Peter
put
the
eggs
into
this
hat
and
set
it
on
the
lagoon
.
It
floated
beautifully
.
</p>
<p>
The
Never
bird
saw
at
once
what
he
was
up
to
,
and
screamed
her
admiration
of
him
;
and
,
alas
,
Peter
crowed
his
agreement
with
her
.
Then
he
got
into
the
nest
,
reared
the
stave
in
it
as
a
mast
,
and
hung
up
his
shirt
for
a
sail
.
At
the
same
moment
the
bird
fluttered
down
upon
the
hat
and
once
more
sat
snugly
on
her
eggs
.
She
drifted
in
one
direction
,
and
he
was
borne
off
in
another
,
both
cheering
.
</p>
<p>
Of
course
when
Peter
landed
he
beached
his
barque
[
small
ship
,
actuallythe
Never
Bird
's
nest
in
this
particular
case
in
point
]
in
a
place
wherethe
bird
would
easily
find
it
;
but
the
hat
was
such
a
great
success
that
she
abandoned
the
nest
.
It
drifted
about
till
it
went
to
pieces
,
and
often
Starkey
came
to
the
shore
of
the
lagoon
,
and
with
many
bitter
feelings
watched
the
bird
sitting
on
his
hat
.
As
we
shall
not
see
her
again
,
it
may
be
worth
mentioning
here
that
all
Never
birds
now
build
in
that
shape
of
nest
,
with
a
broad
brim
on
which
the
youngsters
take
an
airing
.
