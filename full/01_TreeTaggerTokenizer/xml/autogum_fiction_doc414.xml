CHAPTER
XIII
--
OOLANGA'S
HALLUCINATIONS
</head>
<p>
During
the
last
few
days
Lady
Arabella
had
been
getting
exceedingly
impatient
.
Her
debts
,
always
pressing
,
were
growing
to
an
embarrassing
amount
.
The
only
hope
she
had
of
comfort
in
life
was
a
good
marriage
;
but
the
good
marriage
on
which
she
had
fixed
her
eye
did
not
seem
to
move
quickly
enough
--
indeed
,
it
did
not
seem
to
move
at
all
--
in
the
right
direction
.
Edgar
Caswall
was
not
an
ardent
wooer
.
From
the
very
first
he
seemed
<hi rend="italic">
difficile
</hi>
,
but
he
had
been
keeping
to
his
own
room
ever
since
his
struggle
with
Mimi
Watford
.
On
that
occasion
Lady
Arabella
had
shown
him
in
an
unmistakable
way
what
her
feelings
were
;
indeed
,
she
had
made
it
known
to
him
,
in
a
more
overt
way
than
pride
should
allow
,
that
she
wished
to
help
and
support
him
.
The
moment
when
she
had
gone
across
the
room
to
stand
beside
him
in
his
mesmeric
struggle
,
had
been
the
very
limit
of
her
voluntary
action
.
It
was
quite
bitter
enough
,
she
felt
,
that
he
did
not
come
to
her
,
but
now
that
she
had
made
that
advance
,
she
felt
that
any
withdrawal
on
his
part
would
,
to
a
woman
of
her
class
,
be
nothing
less
than
a
flaming
insult
.
Had
she
not
classed
herself
with
his
nigger
servant
,
an
unreformed
savage
?
Had
she
not
shown
her
preference
for
him
at
the
festival
of
his
home-coming
?
Had
she
not
.
.
.
Lady
Arabella
was
cold-blooded
,
and
she
was
prepared
to
go
through
all
that
might
be
necessary
of
indifference
,
and
even
insult
,
to
become
chatelaine
of
Castra
Regis
.
In
the
meantime
,
she
would
show
no
hurry
--
she
must
wait
.
She
might
,
in
an
unostentatious
way
,
come
to
him
again
.
She
knew
him
now
,
and
could
make
a
keen
guess
at
his
desires
with
regard
to
Lilla
Watford
.
With
that
secret
in
her
possession
,
she
could
bring
pressure
to
bear
on
Caswall
which
would
make
it
no
easy
matter
for
him
to
evade
her
.
The
great
difficulty
was
how
to
get
near
him
.
He
was
shut
up
within
his
Castle
,
and
guarded
by
a
defence
of
convention
which
she
could
not
pass
without
danger
of
ill
repute
to
herself
.
Over
this
question
she
thought
and
thought
for
days
and
nights
.
At
last
she
decided
that
the
only
way
would
be
to
go
to
him
openly
at
Castra
Regis
.
Her
rank
and
position
would
make
such
a
thing
possible
,
if
carefully
done
.
She
could
explain
matters
afterwards
if
necessary
.
Then
when
they
were
alone
,
she
would
use
her
arts
and
her
experience
to
make
him
commit
himself
.
After
all
,
he
was
only
a
man
,
with
a
man
's
dislike
of
difficult
or
awkward
situations
.
She
felt
quite
sufficient
confidence
in
her
own
womanhood
to
carry
her
through
any
difficulty
which
might
arise
.
</p>
<p>
From
Diana
's
Grove
she
heard
each
day
the
luncheon-gong
from
Castra
Regis
sound
,
and
knew
the
hour
when
the
servants
would
be
in
the
back
of
the
house
.
She
would
enter
the
house
at
that
hour
,
and
,
pretending
that
she
could
not
make
anyone
hear
her
,
would
seek
him
in
his
own
rooms
.
The
tower
was
,
she
knew
,
away
from
all
the
usual
sounds
of
the
house
,
and
moreover
she
knew
that
the
servants
had
strict
orders
not
to
interrupt
him
when
he
was
in
the
turret
chamber
.
She
had
found
out
,
partly
by
the
aid
of
an
opera-glass
and
partly
by
judicious
questioning
,
that
several
times
lately
a
heavy
chest
had
been
carried
to
and
from
his
room
,
and
that
it
rested
in
the
room
each
night
.
She
was
,
therefore
,
confident
that
he
had
some
important
work
on
hand
which
would
keep
him
busy
for
long
spells
.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile
,
another
member
of
the
household
at
Castra
Regis
had
schemes
which
he
thought
were
working
to
fruition
.
A
man
in
the
position
of
a
servant
has
plenty
of
opportunity
of
watching
his
betters
and
forming
opinions
regarding
them
.
Oolanga
was
in
his
way
a
clever
,
unscrupulous
rogue
,
and
he
felt
that
with
things
moving
round
him
in
this
great
household
there
should
be
opportunities
of
self-advancement
.
Being
unscrupulous
and
stealthy
--
and
a
savage
--
he
looked
to
dishonest
means
.
He
saw
plainly
enough
that
Lady
Arabella
was
making
a
dead
set
at
his
master
,
and
he
was
watchful
of
the
slightest
sign
of
anything
which
might
enhance
this
knowledge
.
Like
the
other
men
in
the
house
,
he
knew
of
the
carrying
to
and
fro
of
the
great
chest
,
and
had
got
it
into
his
head
that
the
care
exercised
in
its
porterage
indicated
that
it
was
full
of
treasure
.
He
was
for
ever
lurking
around
the
turret-rooms
on
the
chance
of
making
some
useful
discovery
.
But
he
was
as
cautious
as
he
was
stealthy
,
and
took
care
that
no
one
else
watched
him
.
</p>
<p>
It
was
thus
that
the
negro
became
aware
of
Lady
Arabella
's
venture
into
the
house
,
as
she
thought
,
unseen
.
He
took
more
care
than
ever
,
since
he
was
watching
another
,
that
the
positions
were
not
reversed
.
More
than
ever
he
kept
his
eyes
and
ears
open
and
his
mouth
shut
.
Seeing
Lady
Arabella
gliding
up
the
stairs
towards
his
master
's
room
,
he
took
it
for
granted
that
she
was
there
for
no
good
,
and
doubled
his
watching
intentness
and
caution
.
