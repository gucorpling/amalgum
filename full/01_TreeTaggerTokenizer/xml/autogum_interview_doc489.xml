Twitter
via

in

experience

Are
you
aware

any

of
the

cracking
such

You
do
n't
need
to
crack
https
,
per

,
to

We
absolutely
think
that
more
websites
should
employ
https
!
Here
is

guide

approached
the
Icelandic
politician

WikiLeaks
supporter
,
who
has
made
this
specific
case
a
landmark
in
how
the
U.S.
Government
handles
dealings
with
–
supposedly
–
friendly
governments
and
their
elected
representatives

A
number
of
questions
were
posed

seeking

Parliamentarian
's
views

How
did
you
feel
when
you
were
notified
the
US
Government
wanted
your
Twitter
account
,
and
message
,
details
?
Were
you
shocked
?

I
felt
angry
but
not
shocked
.
I
was
expecting
something
like
this
to
happen
because
of
my
involvement
with
WikiLeaks
.
My
first
reaction
was
to
tweet
about
it

What

It
is
quite
clear
to
me
that
USA
authorities
are
after
Julian
Assange
and
will
use
any
means
possible
to
get
even
with
him
.
I
think
I
am
simply
a
pawn
in
a
much
larger
context
.
I
did
of
course
both
act
as
a
spokesperson
for
WikiLeaks
in
relation
to
the
Apache
video
and
briefly
for
WikiLeaks
,
and
I
put
my
name
to
the
video
as
a
co-producer
.
I
have
not
participated
in
any
illegal
activity
and
thus
being
a
target
does
n't
make
me
lose
any
sleep
.

Are
you
concerned
that
,
as
a
Member
of
Parliament
involved
in
the
Icelandic
Modern
Media
Initiative
(
IMMI
)
,
the
US
attempt
to
obtain
your
Twitter
data
is
interfering
with
planned
Icelandic
government
policy
?

you

It
bothers
me
and
according
to
top
computer
scientists
the
government
should
be
required
to
obtain
a
search
warrant
to
get
our
IP
addresses
from
Twitter
.
I
am
,
though
,
happy
I
am
among
the
people
DOJ
is
casting
their
nets
around
because
of
my
parliamentary
immunity
;
I
have
a
greater
protection
then
many
other
users
and
can
use
that
immunity
to
raise
the
issue
of
lack
of
rights
for
those
that
use
social
media
.
