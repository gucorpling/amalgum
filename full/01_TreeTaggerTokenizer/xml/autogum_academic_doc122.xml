Preliminary
Conclusions
</head>
<p>
In
recent
years
,
urban
sprawl
has
completely
transformed
the
physiognomy
of
cities
in
Latin
America
,
generating
and
consolidating
a
model
of
an
extensive
and
polycentric
city
.
This
is
a
process
that
can
be
considered
unfinished
for
multiple
reasons
.
On
the
one
hand
,
the
own
dynamics
of
capital
accumulation
promote
expansive
urban
dynamics
.
On
the
other
hand
,
population
growth
is
still
a
relevant
phenomenon
in
many
of
the
largest
Latin
American
cities
.
</p>
<p>
In
this
context
,
make
sustainable
what
has
already
been
built
,
that
is
to
say
,
what
actually
exists
is
one
of
the
great
challenges
of
the
large
Latin
American
megalopolis
such
as
Mexico
City
,
Lima
or
Santiago
de
Chile
.
The
analysis
of
those
three
cities
shows
that
their
urban
agendas
have
several
confluent
features
.
Firstly
,
the
three
cities
are
not
only
the
capitals
of
their
respective
countries
but
also
have
a
clear
position
of
urban
primacy
.
Secondly
,
the
three
cities
,
but
particularly
Santiago
de
Chile
and
Mexico
,
have
become
key
points
in
the
network
of
global
cities
that
act
as
nodes
of
human
resources
,
information
,
and
capital
.
Thirdly
,
the
three
cities
have
experienced
strong
pressure
from
popular
groups
,
which
results
in
specific
forms
of
urban
sprawl
with
a
strong
component
of
informality
.
Finally
,
in
all
three
cases
,
there
is
a
predominance
of
neoliberal
forms
of
urban
governance
,
which
is
associated
with
the
predominance
of
approaches
of
ecological
modernization
.
As
a
result
,
there
are
many
common
priorities
in
their
urban
agendas
,
to
the
point
that
there
is
a
pattern
of
pursuing
sustainability
in
Latin
American
megalopolises
.
</p>
<p>
In
this
context
,
any
transition
to
sustainability
in
them
is
conditioned
by
the
high
existing
levels
of
social
inequality
and
residential
segregation
.
In
this
context
,
poor
neighborhoods
,
which
often
arise
from
the
dynamics
of
settlement-parceling-building-urbanization
,
still
have
a
wide
margin
for
changing
their
physiognomy
and
improving
their
provision
of
services
.
Many
of
these
transformations
can
be
framed
within
the
framework
of
sustainable
transition
,
especially
concerning
improvements
in
water
and
electricity
supplies
,
the
provision
of
green
areas
or
transport
systems
.
These
transition
dynamics
could
be
applied
to
other
aspects
such
as
the
use
of
new
energy
sources
,
waste
management
,
etc.
In
all
these
fields
,
some
of
these
experiences
may
be
considered
as
niches
of
sustainability
at
a
neighborhood
level
.
</p>
<p>
By
contrast
,
the
neighborhoods
in
which
the
highest
income
social
groups
live
tend
to
have
not
only
a
different
physiognomy
but
also
distinct
environmental
conditions
.
In
these
areas
,
they
can
be
observed
some
sustainability
policies
similar
to
those
of
developed
countries
albeit
necessarily
to
a
limited
extent
.
Also
,
the
logic
of
ecological
modernization
and
the
megaproject
tends
to
allocate
greater
financial
resources
to
those
with
higher
capacity
to
pay
.
Thus
,
progress
is
being
made
towards
the
consolidation
of
a
socially
segregated
and
ecologically
differentiated
urban
polycentrism
.
