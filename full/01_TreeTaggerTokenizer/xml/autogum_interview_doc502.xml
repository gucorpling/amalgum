DS

But
do
you
ever
ask
yourself
that
question
when
you
're
writing
,
&quot;
Who
cares
?
&quot;
</hi>
</p>

Well
,
yeah
.
I
mean
,
to
some
degree
,
you
have
to
wonder
,
&quot;
Who
cares
?
&quot;
But
you
have
to
figure
that
there
's
gonna
be
people
out
there
who
share
your
experience
.
When
writing
prose
you
must
come
to
terms
with
the
fact
that
Oprah
is
the
queen
of
the
prose
world
right
now
,
because
women
are
the
people
who
buy
most
literary
fiction
.
I
'm
a
guy
in
his
fifties
.
The
experience
of
a
guy
in
his
fifties
is
not
that
interesting
to
women
and
there
are
n't
that
many
men
in
their
fifties
reading
serious
fiction
at
this
point
.
So
you
do
kind
of
box
yourself
into
a
corner
.
But
what
can
I
do
about
that
?
I
can
only
write
about
what
I
can
write
about
.
There
are
wonderful
writers
out
there
who
are
mature
men
writing
wonderful
books
:
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian%20McEwan">
McEwan
</ref>
or
Roth
or
whoever
you
want
to
point
your
finger
at
.
It
's
just
that
that
whole
serious
fiction
world
has
its
own
problems
.
That
's
what
the
online
bookseller
started
to
change
.

When
you
look
at
the
arc
of
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American%20culture">
American
culture
</ref>
,
in
your
experience
,
where
do
you
see
it
heading
?

<hi rend="bold">
EB

</hi>
Well
,
technology
is
what
makes
all
things
change
.
If
there
were
never
any
changes
in
technology
,
I
â€™m
sure
everything
would
reach
a
sort
of
stasis
,
and
we
'd
just
live
the
same
way
all
the
time
.
So
,
as
technology
changes
,
it
's
going
to
feed
int
--
all
of
a
sudden
,
there
'll
be
some
breakthrough
thing
that
no
one
will
suspect
.
I
mean
,
when
Quentin
Tarantino
came
out
of
nowhere
with
<hi rend="italic">
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp%20Fiction">
Pulp
Fiction
</ref>
</hi>
,
it
was
because
of
what
he
had
accumulated
as
a
video
store
guy
.
I
know
right
now
,
my
son
is
on
the
computer
every
night
watching
endless
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube">
YouTube
</ref>
videos
,
and
he
's
making
videos
himself
,
and
he
's
got
the
TV
set
on
and
the
music
on
at
the
same
time
.
Maybe
something
's
going
to
come
out
of
that
.

<hi rend="bold">
EB

</hi>
Somebody
,
somewhere
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
all
these
elements
will
fuse
,
and
there
will
be
this
new
thing
.

DS
:
I
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/John_Reed_on_Orwell,_God,_self-destruction_and_the_future_of_writing">
interviewed
a
novelist
named
John
Reed
</ref>
,
who
wrote
this
book
called
<hi rend="italic">
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowball's%20Chance">
Snowball
's
Chance
</ref>
</hi>
that
was
kind
of
a
rip
on
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George%20Orwell">
Orwell
</ref>
.
We
were
talking
about
how
limited
the
current
narrative
is
--
at
least
in
the
United
States
,
where
it
's
sin
,
suffer
and
redemption
.
John
said
he
could
foresee
at
some
point
these
multidimensional
narratives
almost
on
a
Biblical
level
come
to
fruition
.
Where
you
have
various
dimensions
,
and
where
it
goes
from
the
Internet
to
magazines
to
television
and
it
ends
up
spanning
different
mediums
.
It
's
an
interesting
idea
,
and
when
you
really
think
about
it
you
can
see
it
starting
to
happen
.
It
's
not
being
done
quite
yet
,
but
you
could
envision
it
.
