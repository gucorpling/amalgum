Observe
Variable
Stars
</head>
<p>
Variable
stars
are
,
as
the
name
suggests
,
stars
that
vary
in
brightness
.
There
are
several
different
mechanisms
as
to
how
this
happens
.
Variable
stars
can
be
very
interesting
to
observe
,
and
this
is
one
of
the
areas
where
amateur
astronomy
can
make
significant
contributions
.

Go
out
stargazing
.
It
sounds
obvious
,
but
this
will
be
easier
if
you
go
out
a
few
times
and
familiarise
yourself
with
the
stars
and
constellations
.

Identify
a
star
that
you
want
to
observe
.
Decent
variable
stars
have
been
studied
for
hundreds
of
years
.
Algol
,
Mira
and
Delta
Cephei
(
δ
Cep
)
are
all
good
(
if
common
)
choices
.
For
this
article
,
we
're
going
to
be
observing
δ
Cep
.
</item>
<item>
<figure rend="Cepheus2.png">

Find
a
couple
of
non-variable
stars
(
guide
stars
)
near
your
star
.
This
works
with
one
,
but
two
is
better
,
and
three
or
more
(
if
possible
)
is
even
better
.
These
stars
should
be
of
a
similar
brightness
to
the
star
you
are
observing
.
For
δ
Cep
,
you
can
use
ζ
Cep
,
which
is
slightly
brighter
than
δ
Cep
at
max
brightness
,
and
ε
Cep
,
which
is
slightly
brighter
than
δ
Cep
at
min
brightness
.
</item>
<item>
Compare
how
bright
the
variable
star
is
to
the
guide
stars
every
night
.
You
should
see
it
change
brightness
over
time
.
δ
Cep
changes
on
a
constant
5.37
day
period

Get
yourself
a
small
notebook
and
a
pencil
.
If
you
need
a
flashlight
,
place
a
red
filter
over
the
top
of
the
lens
when
the
light
shines
through
;
using
a
flashlight
without
doing
this
will
ruin
your
night
vision
and
make
observation
of
these
stars
seem
impossible
.
</item>

<figure rend="Notebook_varStars.png">
</figure>
At
the
top
,
write
down
the
name
of
the
star
you
are
observing
.
If
you
want
,
write
down
it
's
co-ordinates
and
how
much
it
is
meant
to
vary
by
.
You
can
find
the
magnitudes
quite
easily
by
searching
for
the
star
on
Wikipedia
.

<figure rend="Notebook2_varStars_reupload.png">

Underneath
,
write
down
your

stars

Again
,
you
can
write
down
their
positions
and
brightness
.
</item>

<figure rend="Notebook3_varStars_reupload.png">

Every
night
,
record
how
bright
your
target
star
is
compared
to
the
guide
stars
.
Write
down
the
date
and
time
as
well
,
so
you
know
when
you
took
the
observation
.

Try
drawing
a
light
curve
.
This
is
a
graph
of
how
your
star
varies
over
time
.
A
light
curve
can
help
you
to
identify
what
type
of
variable
star
you
are
observing
.
If
your
star
has
regular
variations
,
it
can
help
you
predict
how
bright
it
is
going
to
be
on
the
next
night
.
</item>
<item>
Prepare
to
take
lots
of
observations
.
δ
Cep
varies
through
visible
brightness
over
5.37
days
,
so
it
is
quite
easy
to
observe
.
Mira
varies
on
a
332
day
period
,
and
most
of
the
time
it
requires
a
telescope
to
see
,
so
it
requires
drastically
more
observations
.

These
types
generally

regular

Cepheid
variables
have
well-defined
,
stable
periods
and
amplitudes
.
They
oscillate
between
fixed
maxima
and
minima
,
and
take
a
fixed
amount
of
time
to
do
it
.
Cepheids
can
have
periods
between
1
and
50
days
.
They
have
something
called
a
period-luminosity
relationship
:
how
long
it
takes
to
complete
one
cycle
depends
on
the
intrinsic
brightness
of
the
star
.
This
makes
it
possible
to
calculate
how
far
away
the
star
is
.
</item>
<item>
RR
Lyrae
variables
are
similar
to
Cepheids
,
but
they
are
dimmer
,
and
have
smaller
periods
and
amplitudes
.
They
follow
a
period-luminosity
relationship
in
the
infrared
,
not
in
visible
light
.
</item>
<item>
Mira
variables
are
red
in
colour
,
and
have
long
periods
,
over
100
days
,
and
very
large
variations
.
The
maxima
and
minima
also
vary
,
so
one
cycle
can
be
slightly
brighter
or
dimmer
than
another
.
Mira
variables
are
typically
very
dim
,
and
need
a
telescope
to
see
.
</item>
<item>
Algol
variables
are
a
type
of
binary
star
.
On
occasion
,
the
dimmer
star
eclipses
the
brighter
one
,
causing
the
brightness
to
drop
for
a
short
period
.
</item>
<item>
Slow
irregular
variables
,
as
the
name
suggests
,
vary
slowly
and
irregularly
.
These
stars
do
n't
have
a
period
.
They
are
typically
large
,
red
stars
at
the
end
of
their
life
,
which
causes
them
to
flicker
irregularly
.

Understand
the
rarer
types
of
variable
stars
.
These
typically
need
a
telescope
or
some
binoculars
to
see
.
Also
,
they
do
n't
usually
vary
all
the
time
,
but
spend
most
of
their
time
at
one
brightness
,
and
rarely
and
unpredictably
change
in
brightness
.
they
are
sometimes
known
,
as
a
whole
,
as
eruptive
variables
.

Flare
stars
spend
most
of
their
time
at
a
dim
brightness
,
and
occasionally
,
for
a
few
minutes
,
jump
up
in
brightness
.
It
is
believed
that
this
is
caused
by
a
similar
mechanism
to
solar
flares
.
Proxima
Centauri
and
Barnard
's
star
are
flare
stars
.
</item>
<item>
Recurrent
novae
are
similar
to
flare
stars
,
but
they
have
much
greater
jumps
in
brightness
,
and
flare-ups
are
a
lot
rarer
.
T
Coronae
Borealis
,
the
Blaze
Star
,
is
a
recurrent
nova
.
It
has
been
seen
to
flare
twice
,
once
in
1886
and
once
in
1946
.
Some
activity
was
seen
in
2016
that
suggests
it
may
flare
again
soon
.
</item>
<item>
R
Coronae
Borealis
variables
spend
most
of
their
time
at
maximum
brightness
.
At
unpredictable
intervals
,
their
brightness
plummets
,
then
slowly
works
its
way
back
up
.
This
is
caused
by
carbon
dust
forming
into
soot
,
blotting
out
the
light
from
the
star
.
</item>
<item>
Supernovae
are
rare
,
transient
events
caused
by
exploding
stars
.
Supernovae
are
incredibly
bright
,
but
seeing
one
with
the
naked
eye
can
be
a
once
in
a
lifetime
event
