Prepare
Your
Computer
for
Gaming
Use
</head>
<p>
Welcome
to
a
brief
tutorial
on
how
to
squeeze
every
last
bit
of
performance
out
of
your
computer
,
for
gaming
.
This
is
going
to
be
strictly
software
based
and
will
show
you
ways
to
fine
tune
your
system
to
get
slight
performance
increases
without
having
to
buy
new
hardware
.

Steps

Now
the
first
thing
I
always
like
to
do
when
I
get
my
hands
on
a
new
system
,
is
to
do
a
clean
install
of
whichever
Windows
system
is
newest
.
So
in
this
case
I
would
make
a
bootable
flash
drive
using
the
official
Windows
10
ISO
,
and
placing
it
onto
a
flash
drive
using
the
Rufus
application
.
</item>
<item>
Now
after
the
system
has
had
a
clean
install
,
with
no
bloatware
or
other
pre-loaded
junk
that
hardware
manufactuers
love
to
load
onto
our
systems
.
It
's
always
a
good
idea
to
run
the
disk
cleanup
,
as
well
as
defrag
and
optimize
the
disk
.
These
programs
can
be
found
and
launched
in
the
&quot;
Windows
administrative
tools
&quot;
folder
.
</item>
<item>
Now
you
can
access
what
we
need
in
this
next
step
by
clicking
on
the
little
batter
icon
on
the
far
right
side
of
the
Windows
taskbar
,
and
select
&quot;
more
power
options
&quot;
.
This
should
take
you
to
a
control
panel
window
with
options
for
&quot;
powersaver
mode
&quot;
and
&quot;
balanced
mode
&quot;
,
as
well
as
a
hidden
third
option
.
To
get
to
this
hidden
option
you
will
need
to
click
the
little
dropdown
icon
on
the
far
right
of
the
window
.
You
'll
see
an
option
come
down
called
&quot;
High
performance
mode
&quot;
.
Which
will
typically
keep
restrictions
on
your
processor
state
off
regardless
of
the
battery
life
(
assuming
you
have
a
laptop
)
.
</item>
<item>
Next
up
you
want
to
access
your
control
panel
and
go
to
System
and
Security
&gt;
System
&gt;
Advanced
System
Settings
in
the
far
left
toolbar
.
This
will
open
up
a
new
,
smaller
window
for
system
properties
.
Click
the
settings
button
under
performance
and
click
the
circle
choice
for
&quot;
Adjust
for
best
performance
&quot;
,
apply
and
click
&quot;
OK
&quot;
to
exit
the
window
.
</item>
<item>
Next
thing
is
the
most
important
.
Find
out
what
graphics
card
you
have
.
It
'll
let
you
know
where
to
go
in
order
to
get
updates
for
the
graphics
card
driver
,
which
will
help
your
system
better
take
advantage
of
your
video
card
's
resources
.
</item>
<item>
If
you
're
really
scrimping
for
system
memory
then
I
would
suggest
downloading
Razer
Cortex
(
formally
known
as
game
booster
)
.
It
not
only
can
dynamically
shut
down
processes
when
a
game
launches
,
but
it
also
has
some
great
tweak
tools
to
adjust
system
settings
that
are
generally
harder
to
find
,
which
can
lead
to
some
more
performance
increases
.
</item>
<item>
Now
,
some
more
steps
to
take
are
to
clean
up
your
system
and
just
generally
do
some
housekeeping
work
on
it
from
time
to
time
.
Keep
as
few
items
on
the
desktop
as
possible
(
I
typically
only
keep
the
recycle
bin
icon
on
my
desktop
)
,
clean
out
your
downloads
folder
whenever
you
can
,
and
organize
any
files
you
use
constantly
.
Running
the
defrag
tools
periodically
wo
n't
hurt
either
.
</item>
<item>
Make
sure
ALL
of
your
drivers
are
up
to
date
.
You
never
understand
how
important
an
updated
Wifi
driver
is
until
you
experience
lag
spikes
and
performance
issues
with
any
kind
of
online
game
.
</item>
<item>
Make
sure
you
know
what
is
running
in
the
background
at
all
times
.
Not
only
is
it
a
good
rule
of
thumb
,
but
also
,
I
ca
n't
tell
you
how
many
times
I
've
had
to
quit
or
alt+tab
out
of
a
game
to
turn
off
Google
Chrome
when
it
was
running
in
the
background
.
</item>
<item>
Finally
,
restart
your
computer
every
now
and
then
.
Do
n't
just
leave
the
thing
going
on
for
days
,
even
weeks
on
end
.
I
'd
say
at
least
once
a
day
just
run
a
restart
,
it
'll
let
the
system
dump
some
loose
data
and
get
a
fresh
start
.
