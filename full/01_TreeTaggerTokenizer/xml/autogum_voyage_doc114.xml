Laon
</head>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">
Laon
</hi>
is
a
city
in
the
Aisne
département
of
<ref target="Hauts-de-France">
Hauts-de-France
</ref>
,
in
northern
<ref target="France">
France
</ref>
.
</p>
<head>
Get
in
</head>
<p>
There
are
regular
train
services
from
Paris
,
leaving
from
Gare
du
Nord
.
As
of
July
2012
,
prices
from
Paris
to
Laon
average
about
€
23
one
way
(
second
class
)
.
The
way
to
Laon
from
Paris
is
covered
in
1½
hours
.
There
are
also
regular
trains
from
Reims
,
or
Amiens
.
The
train
station
in
Laon
is
in
the
new
town
,
at
the
foot
of
the
medieval
city
which
is
on
top
of
a
hill
.
</p>
<p>
With
a
car
,
you
have
an
interchange
(
number
13
)
on
the
A26
motorway
(
from
Calais
to
Reims
)
</p>
<head>
Get
around
</head>
<p>
Walking
from
the
new
town
to
the
medieval
part
of
the
city
is
certainly
doable
,
but
only
if
you
're
fit
and
do
n't
have
heavy
luggage
with
you
—
the
300
ft
climb
is
a
steep
one
.
The
line
N
of
the
<ref target="https://www.tul-laon.fr">
local
bus
service
</ref>
goes
from
the
railway
station
to
the
medieval
city
every
20
minutes
from
Monday
to
Saturday
.
If
you
're
bringing
a
car
with
you
,
you
should
probably
park
it
in
the
new
town
,
as
there
is
very
little
parking
available
in
the
medieval
Haute
Ville
.

Cathédrale
Notre-Dame
de
Laon
is
one
of
the
finest
in
France
,
with
openwork
towers
and
a
four-storey
nave
elevation
.
Its
architecture
influenced
many
other
medieval
European
cathedrals
,
including
that
of
Notre
Dame
in
Paris
.
The
interior
is
extremely
light
and
spacious
.
The
west
towers
feature
an
octagonal
top
storey
with
square
turrets
at
the
angles
on
top
of
the
square
bottom
storey
.
They
are
decorated
with
the
figures
of
16
oxen
,
said
to
commemorate
a
miraculous
ox
that
appeared
to
pull
a
cartload
of
stone
to
the
hilltop
site
.

The

,
and
the
striking

(
showing

It
's
worthwhile
taking
a
walk
around
the
<hi rend="bold">

,
admiring
the
houses
—
almost
all
built
between

centrally
located

good
for

over-priced

The

the
rooms

floor
are
in
a
little
bit
of

all
are
comfortable
