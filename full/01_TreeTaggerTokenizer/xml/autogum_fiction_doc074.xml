INTRODUCTION
.
</p>
<p>
ON
February
the
First
1887
,
the
Lady
Vain
was
lost
by
collision
with
a
derelict
when
about
the
latitude
1
degree
S.
and
longitude
107
degrees
W.
</p>
<p>
On
January
the
Fifth
,
1888
--
that
is
eleven
months
and
four
days
after
--
my
uncle
,
Edward
Prendick
,
a
private
gentleman
,
who
certainly
went
aboard
the
Lady
Vain
at
Callao
,
and
who
had
been
considered
drowned
,
was
picked
up
in
latitude
5
degrees
3
'
S.
and
longitude
101
degrees
W.
in
a
small
open
boat
of
which
the
name
was
illegible
,
but
which
is
supposed
to
have
belonged
to
the
missing
schooner
Ipecacuanha
.
He
gave
such
a
strange
account
of
himself
that
he
was
supposed
demented
.
Subsequently
he
alleged
that
his
mind
was
a
blank
from
the
moment
of
his
escape
from
the
Lady
Vain
.
His
case
was
discussed
among
psychologists
at
the
time
as
a
curious
instance
of
the
lapse
of
memory
consequent
upon
physical
and
mental
stress
.
The
following
narrative
was
found
among
his
papers
by
the
undersigned
,
his
nephew
and
heir
,
but
unaccompanied
by
any
definite
request
for
publication
.
</p>
<p>
The
only
island
known
to
exist
in
the
region
in
which
my
uncle
was
picked
up
is
Noble
's
Isle
,
a
small
volcanic
islet
and
uninhabited
.
It
was
visited
in
1891
by
H.
M.
S.
Scorpion
.
A
party
of
sailors
then
landed
,
but
found
nothing
living
thereon
except
certain
curious
white
moths
,
some
hogs
and
rabbits
,
and
some
rather
peculiar
rats
.
So
that
this
narrative
is
without
confirmation
in
its
most
essential
particular
.
With
that
understood
,
there
seems
no
harm
in
putting
this
strange
story
before
the
public
in
accordance
,
as
I
believe
,
with
my
uncle
's
intentions
.
There
is
at
least
this
much
in
its
behalf
:
my
uncle
passed
out
of
human
knowledge
about
latitude
5
degrees
S.
and
longitude
105
degrees
E.
,
and
reappeared
in
the
same
part
of
the
ocean
after
a
space
of
eleven
months
.
In
some
way
he
must
have
lived
during
the
interval
.
And
it
seems
that
a
schooner
called
the
Ipecacuanha
with
a
drunken
captain
,
John
Davies
,
did
start
from
Africa
with
a
puma
and
certain
other
animals
aboard
in
January
,
1887
,
that
the
vessel
was
well
known
at
several
ports
in
the
South
Pacific
,
and
that
it
finally
disappeared
from
those
seas
(
with
a
considerable
amount
of
copra
aboard
)
,
sailing
to
its
unknown
fate
from
Bayna
in
December
,
1887
,
a
date
that
tallies
entirely
with
my
uncle
's
story
.

</p>
<p>
I.
IN
THE
DINGEY
OF
THE
&quot;
LADY
VAIN
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
I
DO
not
propose
to
add
anything
to
what
has
already
been
written
concerning
the
loss
of
the
&quot;
Lady
Vain
.
&quot;
As
everyone
knows
,
she
collided
with
a
derelict
when
ten
days
out
from
Callao
.
The
longboat
,
with
seven
of
the
crew
,
was
picked
up
eighteen
days
after
by
H.
M.
gunboat
&quot;
Myrtle
,
&quot;
and
the
story
of
their
terrible
privations
has
become
quite
as
well
known
as
the
far
more
horrible
&quot;
Medusa
&quot;
case
.
But
I
have
to
add
to
the
published
story
of
the
&quot;
Lady
Vain
&quot;
another
,
possibly
as
horrible
and
far
stranger
.
It
has
hitherto
been
supposed
that
the
four
men
who
were
in
the
dingey
perished
,
but
this
is
incorrect
.
I
have
the
best
of
evidence
for
this
assertion
:
I
was
one
of
the
four
men
.
</p>
<p>
But
in
the
first
place
I
must
state
that
there
never
were
four
men
in
the
dingey
,
--
the
number
was
three
.
Constans
,
who
was
&quot;
seen
by
the
captain
to
jump
into
the
gig
,
&quot;
{
1
}
luckily
for
us
and
unluckily
for
himself
did
not
reach
us
.
He
came
down
out
of
the
tangle
of
ropes
under
the
stays
of
the
smashed
bowsprit
,
some
small
rope
caught
his
heel
as
he
let
go
,
and
he
hung
for
a
moment
head
downward
,
and
then
fell
and
struck
a
block
or
spar
floating
in
the
water
.
We
pulled
towards
him
,
but
he
never
came
up
.
</p>
<p>

.
</p>
<p>
I
say
luckily
for
us
he
did
not
reach
us
,
and
I
might
almost
say
luckily
for
himself
;
for
we
had
only
a
small
beaker
of
water
and
some
soddened
ship
's
biscuits
with
us
,
so
sudden
had
been
the
alarm
,
so
unprepared
the
ship
for
any
disaster
.
We
thought
the
people
on
the
launch
would
be
better
provisioned
(
though
it
seems
they
were
not
)
,
and
we
tried
to
hail
them
.
They
could
not
have
heard
us
,
and
the
next
morning
when
the
drizzle
cleared
,
--
which
was
not
until
past
midday
,
--
we
could
see
nothing
of
them
.
We
could
not
stand
up
to
look
about
us
,
because
of
the
pitching
of
the
boat
.
The
two
other
men
who
had
escaped
so
far
with
me
were
a
man
named
Helmar
,
a
passenger
like
myself
,
and
a
seaman
whose
name
I
do
n't
know
,
--
a
short
sturdy
man
,
with
a
stammer
.
