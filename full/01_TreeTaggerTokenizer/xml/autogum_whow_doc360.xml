This

talks
about
how
the
magnificent
Hubble
space
technology
has
changed
astronomers
'
views
upon
our

and

Hubble
was
'
born
'
in
1990-
as
a
joint
project
of
NASA
and
the
European
Space
Agency
.
The
telescope
orbits
Earth
353
miles
above
the
planet
's
surface
.
No
telescope
before
Hubble
had
the
high
quality
resolution
to
see
distant
galaxies
,
home
to
various
different
planets
and
stars
.
There
are
three
stages
of
Hubble
's
sight-
the
Hubble
Deep
Field
,
which
was
discovered
in
1995
,
contains
3,000
galaxies
in
it
.
The
second
is
Hubble
Ultra
Deep
Field
,
discovered
in
2004
,
with
about
10,000
galaxies
and
the
last
one
,
which
contained
30,000
of
these
wondrous
galaxies
.

The
deeper
Hubble
telescope
looks
into
space
,
the
further
it
gazes
back
in
time
.
Over
a
period
of
time
,
Hubble
teamed
up
with
other
observatories
to
examine
patches
of
the
sky
in
high
resolution
.
Surveys
like
like
the
Hubble
Ultra
Deep
Field
have
provided
pictures
of
vast
,
deep
collections
of
galaxies-
including
some
that
existed
when
our
universe
was
less
than
a
billion
years
old
.

Zooming
in
,
you
can
see
small
stars
and
large
planets
,
moons
orbiting
planets
and
stars
,
and
countless
galaxies
.
These
galaxies
merge
together
to
form
a
single
,
larger
galaxy
,
and
this
will
be
explained
later
on
.
Scientists
have
known
for
a
long
time
that
the
universe
has
been
expanding
,
ever
since
the
Big
Bang
,
which
was
when
our
galaxy
was
born
.
Some
astronomers
believe
that
if
they
measure
the
universes
's
size
,
they
can
calculate
the
approximate
age
of
the
universe
.

You
might
be
thinking
...
how
can
they
measure
the
distance
of
the
universe
?
Since
you
cannot
extend
a
ruler
into
the
stars
,
they
estimate
by
studying
objects
'
brightness-
for
example
nearby
or
distant
stars
.
So
if
the
scientists
can
measure
the
length
of
a
star
,
which
is
part
of
a
galaxy
,
they
can
also
measure
the
distance
from
the
Milky
Way
to
that
galaxy
,
too
.
</item>

The
NGC
4603
galaxy
is
the
most
distant
galaxy-
108
million
light
years
away
.
It
has
been
found
by
the
same
method
that
scientists
use
to
measure
distances
between
stars-
Cepheid
variables
.
From
Earth
,
this
galaxy
's
stars
appear
very
faint
.

Among
these
magical
and
intriguing
discoveries
in
outer
space
,
there
are
also
some
deathly
dangers
...
Black
Holes
were
originally
named
'
quasars
'
by
the
first
astronomers
,
and
they
were
thought
to
be
the
incredibly
bright
centers
of
those
faraway
galaxies
.
An
approximate
size
of
a
quasar
is
the
size
of
our
very
own
solar
system-
not
very
big
at
all
in
comparison
to
the
universe
.
Luckily
,
Hubble
observations
saved
the
day
again
,
determining
that
those
bright
galactic
centers
are
powered
by
giant
black
holes
.
They
come
in
various
different
sizes
,
but
some
range
form
giant
black
holes
in
the
center
of
galaxies
to
small
black
holes
a
few
times
larger
than
our
sun
.
</item>

And
so
we
come
to
the
part
where
we
refer
back
to
part
3
where
galaxies
are
said
to
merge
together
to
form
new
galaxies
.
Well
,
Hubble
has
observed
the
collision
between
two
galaxies
and
determined
with
a
lot
of
evidence
,
that
in
the
future
,
our
galaxy
,
the
Milky
Way
,
and
another
close
galaxy
named
Andromeda
galaxy
will
collide
in
around
4
billion
years
,
when
we
might
not
be
alive
.
Did
you
know
that
Andromeda
is
the
closest
galaxy
to
us
?
Well
,
Hubble
's
resolution
is
powerful
enough
to
see
its
individual
stars
!
The
stars
in
the
Andromeda
have
different
ages-
ranging
from
six
billion
years
up
.
Scientists
believe
that
this
happened
because
another
galaxy
has
already
collided
with
the
Andromeda
,
making
it
larger
and
bigger
than
before
.
And
when
the
two
monster
galaxies
in
the
universe
collide
,
there
will
be
an
almighty
effect
.
But
however
,
some
predict
that
this
mighty
sight
will
not
cause
an
effect
on
Earth
and
its
fellow
planets-
only
the
Sun
will
change
its
orbit
direction
and
we
will
become
a
much
larger
,
wider
galaxy
.

Eventually
,
Hubble
telescope
's
time
will
come
.
It
will
have
to
'
die
'
or
'
end
its
life
'
as
the
telescope
we
look
up
to
as
our
eye
to
the
universe
.
But
that
wo
n't
be
the
end-
a
new
telescope
,
named
the
James
Webb
Space
Telescope
,
is
Hubble
telescope
's
successor
and
will
use
Infrared
vision
,
instead
of
Hubble
's
usual
visible
vision
to
convey
the
secrets
of
the
universe
to
us
.
They
say
infrared
is
much
better
than
visible
light
;
you
can
see
fainter
objects
and
the
new
telescope
will
be
useful
for
that
.
Webb
is
made
to
stand
up
to
-233.3
Celsius-
extreme
cold
weather
.
The
James
Webb
will
be
the
largest
telescope
ever
to
orbit
our
planet
.
The
launch
for
James
Webb
telescope
is
scheduled
for
2018
,
where
some
lucky
people
will
witness
the
launch
of
the
James
Webb
Space
telescope
,
the
new
eye
for
our
universe
.
