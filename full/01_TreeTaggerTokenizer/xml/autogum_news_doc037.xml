David
Weir
</ref>
,
and
was
Weir
's
fourth
gold
medal
earned
in
the
London
.
This
put
Weir
at
the
top
of
the
individual
gold
medal
count
for
London
alongside
Raymond
Martin
of
the
United
States
.
Tatyana
McFadden
of
the
United

had
a
chance
at
four
gold
medals
in
London
,
but
was
unable
to
seriously
compete
after
a
pair
of
tire
punctures
mid-race
that
seriously
slowed
her
down
.
McFadden
conveyed
her
experiences
in
the
race
to
the
media
,
saying
,
&quot;
At
18
or
19
miles
it
went
again
,
this
always
seems
to
happen
to
me
in
London
.
Luckily
,
I
had
a
spare
but
I
was
bombed
out
.
I
just
wanted
to
sit
and
cry
but
I
also
wanted
to
finish
,
there
was
only
about
six
miles
to
go
and
I
was
determined
I
was
n't
going
to
get
another
flat
tyre
]
.
[
...
]
Finishing
is
the
most
important
thing
for
me
,
it
makes
you
a
better
person
.
I
just
wanted
to
compete
and
stay
strong
.

Swiss
racer
Edith
Wolf
quit
the
women
's
marathon
mid-race
after
running
into
a
hole
on
the
course
that
left
her
without
feeling
in
her
left
arm
and
neck
,
and
required
her
to
be
hospitalized
.
Following
the
race
,
Wolf
's
husband
and
coach
told
the
media
,
&quot;
She
was
really
looking
forward
to
the
marathon
.
She
was
really
prepared
,
so
I
think
she
's
really
disappointed
.
I
think
tomorrow
she
will
wake
up
and
see
her
four
medals
and
she
will
be
very
happy
.
&quot;
When
questioned
about
the
media
,
some
of
whom
disappeared
at
the
conclusion
of
the
men
's
race
,
and
specifically
the
media
from
Wolf
's
home
country
,
he
said
,
&quot;
There
are
not
so
many
media
here
,
which
is
disappointing
.
But
now
they
have
recognised
this
is
really
a
great
Games
.
This
is
the
second
biggest
sports
event
in
the
world
and
they
are
not
here
,
so
it
's
their
loss
,
they
missed
a
big
chance
.

Colombia
's
German
Naranjo
Jaramillo
served
as
Elkin
Alonso
Serena
Morena
's
guide
for
the
length
of
the
marathon
.
Because
of
this
,
Jaramillo
also
earned
a
silver
medal
.
Gold
medalist
Laso
of
Spain
and
bronze
medalist
Zhiou
of
Tunisia
utilized
multiple
guides
,
and
the
guides
were
not
eligible
for
medals
.
Other
runners
in
the
men
's
T12
marathon
who
had
the
same
guide
the
whole
race
included
ninth
place
Ildar
Pomykalov
of
Russia
who
was
guided
by
Aleksei
Lashmanov
,
and
Henry
Wanyoike
of
Kenya
who
did
not
finish
but
was
guided
by
Joseph
Gachuhi
.
