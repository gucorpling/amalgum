As
best
you
can
,
explain
the
dynamic
between
your
school/team
and
the
rest
of
the
schools
in
your
conference

#How
does
each
school
feel
about
you
?
How
do
you
feel
about
them
?
Any
history
that
a
casual
fan
would
n't
know
?
For
instance
,
here
's
Michigan
:
<hi rend="bold">
Ohio
State
</hi>
:
Pure
straight
hatred
,
with
a
sort
of
cold
war
dehumanization
vibe
.
This
is
due
to
the
fact
that
most
UM/OSU
fans
do
n't
know
very
many
fans
on
the
other
side
of
the
rivalry
(
unless
you
're
from
Toledo
)
.
It
goes
beyond
the
schools
;
the
states
of
Michigan
and
Ohio
just
do
n't
like
each
other
(
stemming
from
a
border
dispute
over
Toledo
,
of
all
places
)
.
<hi rend="bold">
Michigan
State
</hi>
:
It
's
really
a
sibling
rivalry
.
Michigan
considers
MSU
&quot;
the
little
brother
&quot;
with
an
inferiority
complex
,
while
they
consider
us
snobbish
,
self-righteous
pricks
.
There
's
...
some
truth
to
both
sides
.
The
series
has
been
historically
dominated
by
Michigan
,
but
the
past
decade
has
been
MSU
heavy
.
Also
,
while
The
Game
is
king
in
football
,
MSU
is
our
primary
rival
in
most
other
sports
.
<hi rend="bold">
Edit
:
As
some
have
pointed
out
,
while
we
hate
Ohio
State
more
,
there
's
somehow
more
mutual
respect
there
.
There
's
no
mutual
respect
between
Michigan
and
Michigan
State
.
None
.
</hi>
<hi rend="bold">
Penn
State
</hi>
:
They
joined
the
B1G
in
the
early
90s
,
and
Lloyd
Carr
<hi rend="bold">
dominated
</hi>
JoePa
.
Since
then
,
it
's
been
a
lot
more
even
,
with
the
teams
trading
blowout
victories
over
the
past
two
years
.
While
Michigan
fans
used
to
respect
PSU/JoePa
a
ton
,
a
lot
of
that
went
away
with
,
well
...
you
know
.
Now
there
's
a
lot
of
Michigan
fans
who
lump
all
PSU
fans
in
with
the
Joe
Believers
.
<hi rend="bold">
Wisconsin
</hi>
:
Most
Michigan
fans
...
like
Wisconsin
?
I
think
?
Historically
,
Michigan
has
dominated
the
series
(
50-15-1
all
time
)
,
but
the
games
have
been
very
competitive
recently
.
After
like
5
years
off
the
schedule
,
we
play
every
year
from
2016
until
like
2022
.
<hi rend="bold">
Northwestern
</hi>
:
Respect
for
Pat
Fitzgerald
,
and
my
God
there
have
been
some
bullshit
wins
for
Michigan
recently
(
2012
,
2013
,
and
2014
)
.
Ryan
Field
is
fun
to
go
to
,
and
it
's
&gt;60
%
Michigan
fans
there
every
time
I
've
been
.
<hi rend="bold">
Maryland
</hi>
:
I
feel
nothing
about
Maryland
.
DJ
Durkin
used
to
be
a
coach
here
?
So
that
's
cool
?
<hi rend="bold">
Rutgers
</hi>
:
Most
Michigan
fans
have
an
open
disdain
for
Rutgers
being
in
the
B1G
(
they
have
no
conference
titles
or
conference
tournament
titles
in
<hi rend="bold">
any
</hi>
sport
in
their
4
years
here
)
.
Most
Rutgers
fans
hate
Michigan
because
we
beat
them
78-0
one
year
and
steal
all
their
NJ
recruits
.
<hi rend="bold">
Indiana
</hi>
:
Under
Kevin
Wilson
they
were
C
H
A
O
S
T
E
A
M.
Under
Tom
Allen
they
'll
probably
be
more
boring
.
IU
has
n't
beaten
Michigan
since
the
1980
's
,
so
other
than
desire
to
keep
that
streak
alive
we
do
n't
really
have
any
animosity
towards
them
.
<hi rend="bold">
Purdue
</hi>
:
Michigan
fans
generally
like
Purdue
,
especially
since
they
occasionally
rise
up
out
of
nowhere
and
beat
Ohio
State
(
something
we
're
still
working
on
)
.
<hi rend="bold">
Iowa
</hi>
:
We
love
to
make
fun
of
Kirk
Ferentz
's
contract
.
We
do
n't
love
losing
at
Kinnick
.
Iowa
is
one
of
the
few
B1G
teams
with
a
winning
record
against
Michigan
since
2000
.
<hi rend="bold">
Illinois
</hi>
:
Illinois
straight
hates
us
,
because
Bo
ran
up
the
score
on
them
a
couple
of
times
for
various
reasons
.
We
feel
nothing
towards
them
.
<hi rend="bold">
Minnesota
</hi>
:
We
battle
for
The
Little
Brown
Jug
,
the
oldest
traveling
trophy
in
college
football
.
Other
than
that
,
the
relationship
is
pretty
amicable
on
our
end
,
although
that
may
be
because
Michigan
usually
wins
.
<hi rend="bold">
Nebraska
</hi>
:
Our
relationship
with
Nebraska
is
predicated
entirely
upon
arguing
about
the
1997
split
title
.
That
will
only
increase
with
Frost
there
(
he
was
the
QB
on
that
1997
<hi rend="bold">
Coaches
Poll
Champion
</hi>
Nebraska
team
)
.
Some
Michigan
fans
are
annoyed
with
Frost
already
,
since
he
talked
about
how
his
UCF
team
&quot;
outhit
&quot;
Michigan
after
a
51-14
loss
.
Also
,
his
mom
wrote
a
snarky
letter
to
the
Michigan
Daily
back
in
the
day
?
Or
something
?
I
do
n't
know
.
**Feel
free
to
do
some
schools
in
your
conference
,
or
all
of
them
!
Or
none
of
them
I
guess
.
It
's
your
life
.
