Conclusions
</head>
<p>
In
the
presented
study
,
the
economically
optimal
configurations
of
PV-wind-battery
systems
are
calculated
with
the
help
of
a
MILP
model
based
on
datasets
of
weather
variables
and
population
density
as
well
as
detailed
technical
specifications
on
the
generation
technologies
.
In
the
investigated
low-populated
regions
of
Germany
and
the
Czech
Republic
,
clusters
of
10
and
50
Electricity
Self-Sufficient
Single
Family
Houses
are
modelled
.
The
results
show
that
including
wind
power
in
such
self-sufficient
systems
decreases
the
comparatively
high
installed
capacities
of
PV
necessary
at
higher
geographic
latitudes
due
to
lower
solar
irradiation
while
reducing
total
installation
costs
compared
to
PV-battery
systems
only
.
In
areas
of
intermediate
and
high
wind
resources
,
storage
capacities
can
be
significantly
reduced
.
The
results
remain
stable
,
even
if
limited
PV
production
due
to
snow
coverage
is
considered
in
the
model
.
</p>
<p>
Regarding
particular
areas
,
maps
revealing
the
total
costs
for
a
hybrid
renewable
electricity
system
show
most
profitable
locations
in
the
south
of
Germany
,
as
well
as
challenging
locations
mainly
in
the
western
part
of
the
Czech
Republic
and
in
the
eastern
parts
of
Germany
.
There
are
important
differences
depending
on
weather
conditions
.
In
the
majority
of
Bavaria
in
south
Germany
,
as
well
as
large
areas
in
the
western
Czech
Republic
,
small-scale
wind
power
plants
are
not
considered
in
a
cost-minimized
solution
due
to
low
wind
resources
and
a
lack
of
complementarity
between
wind
and
solar
power
.
Total
costs
of
the
hybrid
systems
for
the
50
households
’
clusters
,
aiming
for
full
electricity
self-sufficiency
and
without
considering
financing
costs
,
range
between
EUR
1.8
million
and
EUR
5
million
.
These
costs
divided
by
the
number
of
households
and
the
amount
of
electricity
that
these
would
require
in
a
20
years
’
horizon
are
at
least
2.3
(
best
locations
in
Germany
)
and
up
to
10.5
(
worst
locations
in
the
Czech
Republic
)
times
larger
than
the
current
costs
of
obtaining
electricity
from
the
grid
.
</p>
<p>
The
results
are
not
only
relevant
for
groups
of
homeowners
who
consider
installing
a
hybrid
stand-alone
renewable
electricity
system
as
a
community
,
but
also
for
investors
or
policy
makers
,
as
they
present
a
guideline
on
how
to
size
such
systems
and
where
in
Germany
and
the
Czech
Republic
,
they
are
the
most
attractive
regarding
installation
costs
.
Further
research
should
focus
on
simulations
with
differing
load
profiles
and
under
different
policy
and
cost
scenarios
.
Several
cases
of
homeowners
who
reflect
different
levels
of
risk
aversion
with
regards
to
levels
of
self-sufficiency
,
respectively
the
probability
of
loss
of
power
supply
and
grid-dependency
could
further
provide
valuable
insights
.
Such
results
may
allow
defining
how
technology
improvements
and
cost
reductions
can
impact
the
overall
systems
’
profitability
under
regionally
more
explicit
consumer
behaviour
scenarios
.
Finally
,
in
order
to
assess
full
energy
self-sufficiency
,
the
study
conducted
here
has
to
be
extended
to
include
the
energy
demand
for
heating/cooling
of
the
households
and
alternative
hybrid
system
configurations
to
supply
it
.
