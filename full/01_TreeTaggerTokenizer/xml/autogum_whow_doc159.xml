Prepare
a
Strategic
Plan
for
a
School
</head>
<p>
Developing
a
strategic
plan
for
a
school
begins
with
the
alignment
of
the
district
strategic
plan
.
For
example
,
one
of
the
goals
in
the
district
strategic
plan
may
be
to
improve
student
attendance
.
Taking
that
goal
for
the
school
may
be
to
improve
school
attendance
by
2
percent
over
2
years
.
Usually
,
strategic
plans
are
for
a
five
year
period
,
so
the
goals
can
reflect
that
as
well
.
Each
goal
that
is
selected
for
the
school
's
strategic
plan
must
align
with
the
district
's
strategic
plan
.
The
school
may
have
fewer
goals
(
usually
no
more
than
three
can
be
reached
in
one
year
)
,
and
each
goal
should
have
activities
to
support
the
goal
as
well
as
a
budget
to
support
the
activities
.
Each
goal
must
be
developed
in
a
&quot;
shared
experience
&quot;
with
all
stakeholders
(
teachers
,
parents
,
students
if
high
school
,
and
staff
)
.
Listed
in
a
step
by
step
method
is
the
process
one
would
use
to
develop
one
of
the
goals
in
the
strategic
plan
.
After
each
goal
activity
is
completed
,
then
the
information
is
compiled
into
a
comprehensive
strategic
plan
for
the
school
year
which
includes
a
spending
plan
that
is
aligned
to
the
school
's
total
budget
.

<item>
Determine
current
percent
of
attendance
.
Most
elementary
schools
are
around
95
%
attendance
with
middle
schools
around
92
%
,
and
high
schools
around
90
%
.
Each
school
is
provided
a
report
of
attendance
reporting
on
a
monthly
basis
by
the
District
Office
.

</item>
<item>
Discuss
with
stakeholders
the
current
attendance
rate
and
the
need
for
improvement
.
Discuss
a
1
%
increase
per
year
for
the
next
two
years
,
which
is
aligned
to
the
District
goal
.
Provide
stakeholders
with
historic
attendance
reporting
and
indicate
which
months
are
&quot;
problematic
&quot;
.
Provide
stakeholders
with
number
of
students
needed
to
make
a
1
%
increase
.

<item>
Develop
with
stakeholders
activities
to
meet
the
attendance
goal
of
improvement
by
1
%
.
Examples
of
possible
activities
include
monthly
award
assemblies
for
perfect
attendance
(
usually
elementary
school
students
)
,
privilege
certificates
(
such
as
no
homework
for
a
day
)
for
middle
and
high
school
students
,
attendance
clerk
to
monitor
student
attendance
,
and
make
friendly
home
phone
calls
daily
for
absent
students
,
Vice
Principal
or
other
administrator
may
make
home
visits
for
students
who
have
missed
3
days
or
more
before
December
to
determine
if
any
interventions
may
be
appropriate
,
and
end-of-year
trips
may
be
tied
to
attendance
.
These
are
just
a
few
activities
that
schools
use
.
Be
sure
to
discuss
them
thoroughly
with
all
stakeholders
.

be

district
budgeting
department
.
