Introduction
</head>
<p>
The
term
condensation
trail
(
contrail
)
summarizes
a
type
of
human-induced
cloud
,
developed
behind
aircraft
due
to
condensation
of
water
vapor
emissions
and
ambient
humidity
around
exhausted
soot
particles
and
atmospheric
condensation
nuclei
in
a
cold
ambient
atmosphere
,
satisfying
the
Schmidt
–
Appleman
criterion
.
In
an
ice
supersaturated
environment
,
these
artificial
ice
clouds
form
into
long-living
cirrus
clouds
called
“
Cirrus
homogenitus
”
as
defined
by
the
World
Meteorological
Organization
.
</p>
<p>
In
the
Earth
–
atmosphere
energy
budget
,
contrails
act
like
a
barrier
.
They
scatter
incoming
shortwave
solar
radiation
back
to
the
sky
(
resulting
in
a
cooling
effect
)
and
they
absorb
and
emit
the
outgoing
longwave
terrestrial
radiation
back
to
the
Earth
’s
surface
(
yielding
a
warming
effect
in
the
lower
layer
of
the
atmosphere
)
.
The
dominating
effect
may
be
defined
as
radiative
forcing
,
as
the
change
in
net
downward
radiative
flux
at
the
tropopause
(
considering
the
instantaneous
response
of
the
stratosphere
)
.
The
contribution
of
contrails
to
global
warming
cannot
yet
be
determined
with
high
precision
and
depends
on
flight
performance
,
weather
conditions
,
and
time
.
Latest
combinations
of
several
approaches
to
model
a
global
impact
of
contrails
on
global
warming
summarize
a
warming
net
effect
of
W
m
with
accuracy
to
within
and
W
m
for
2010
.
Single
studies
result
in
a
precision
of
the
environmental
impact
of
contrails
including
negative
(
cooling
)
net
effects
(
e.
g.
,
W
m
for
2005
)
.
Using
global
climate
models
and
historic
air
traffic
data
,
reliable
estimations
of
the
global
contrail
radiative
forcing
for
the
year
2000
of
W
m
have
been
improved
for
2010
to
W
m
considering
an
increased
traffic
distance
by
22
%
between
2005
and
2010
.
For
2002
,
Burkhardt
and
Kärcher
estimated
W
m
of
contrails
and
contrail
cirrus
clouds
within
a
global
climate
model
.

<p>
Compared
to
the
summed
effect
of
one
year
’s
aviation-emitted
carbon
dioxide
and
nitrogen
oxides
which
is
W
m
,
the
impact
of
contrails
on
global
warming
is
no
longer
negligible
,
as
it
might
exceed
those
effects
of
and
,
even
though
contrails
are
only
formed
during
of
the
flights
,
on
a
global
average
.
Thus
,
the
need
for
contrails
to
be
considered
in
trajectory
optimization
becomes
indisputable
.

The
impact
of
single
condensation
trails
on
trajectory
optimization
has
been
analyzed
by
Gounou
et
al.
and
Forster
et
al.
,
focusing
on
the
importance
of
large
solar
zenith
angles
during
sunset
and
sunrise
.
In
an
application
of
a
Monte
Carlo
code
for
photon
transport
,
Forster
et
al.
already
considered
effects
like
multiple
scattering
,
but
in
a
coarse
spatial
grid
and
ignoring
the
impact
of
flight
performance
on
the
optical
properties
of
the
contrail
.
Detailed
studies
on
all
significant
impact
factors
have
been
elaborated
by
Rosenow
.
In
the
current
study
,
the
results
have
been
simplified
and
harnessed
for
trajectory
optimization
.
All
other
research
interests
known
to
the
authors
concentrated
on
the
effect
of
contrails
on
a
global
scale
.
