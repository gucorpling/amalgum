&quot;
What
clothes
should
I
wear
?
&quot;
&quot;
Who
should
I
be
like
?
&quot;
&quot;
How
much
should
I
score
?
&quot;
&quot;
Which
college
should
I
go
to
?

and

on
and
so
forth
.

questions

live
free

Have
a
cause
for
hope
,
or
a
reason
to
live
.
Have
something
to
look
forward
to
.
It
might
be
to
travel
the
world
,
or
buy
a
motorcycle
and
ride
cross
country
,
or
maybe
you
want
to
learn
about
different
cultures

Find
beauty
in
the
most
odd
and
imperfect
things
-
from
an
old
,
wrinkle
faced
woman
bent
over
a
fire
,
to
a
tiny
flower
growing
on
a
hillside

Learn
to
calm
down
.
Take
it
in
from
one
ear
and
let
it
out
through
the
other
.
These
days
,
you
do
n't
really
see
anyone
who
is
not
willing
to
get
into
a
fight
.
When
you
get
stuck
in
an
argument
,
take
a
deep
breath
.
Listen
to
what
the
other
person
has
to
say
.
Think
it
through
.
Ask
yourself
:
does
what
they
said
make
sense
?
Are
they
correct
?
Are
you
wrong
?
<list type="unordered">
<item>
If
you
do
find
sense
in
what
they
say
,
let
them
know
.
Accept
your
fault
.
If
you
find
yourself
to
be
the
correct
one
,
then
do
n't
yell
to
make
your
point
.
Be
calm
.
Explain
your
view
to
the
person
.
If
they
refuse
to
understand
,
hope
that
they
eventually
will
.
</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>
Be
understanding
.
Understand
one
another
,
understand
the
needs
of
others
,
and
understand
the
complications
in
the
matter
.
See
the
situation
through
the
other
person
's
point
of
view
.
Just
this
one
step
would
make
you
a
happy
person
.
But
do
n't
be
disappointed
if
the
other
person
fails
to
show
understanding
for
your
matter
.
Not
everyone
is
like
you
.
</item>
<item>
Live
free
.
Break
society
's
rules
.
If
your
elders
tell
you
that
it
's
unladylike
to
wear
shorts
,
do
n't
listen
.
People
will
always
tell
you
what
to
do
and
what
not
to
do
because
they
all
consider
themselves
better
than
others
,
and
they
think
that
their
ideas
and
what
they
think
is
what
is
correct
.
Despair
not
,
for
that
should
not
bother
you
.
You
are
the
maker
of
decisions
your
life
.
You
can
do
what
you
love
to
do
and
what
you
know
is
right
.

Remember
that
no
one
is
broken
too
bad
.
There
's
always
that
glue
to
fix
you
up
.
Your
job
is
to
find
that
glue
.
