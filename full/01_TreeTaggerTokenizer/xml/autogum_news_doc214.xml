A
notice
from
the
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S.%20State%20Department">
U.S.
State
Department
</ref>
advised
travelers
that
,
&quot;
given
the
uncertainty
and
volatility
of
the
current
situation
&quot;
,
they
should
try
to
stay
inside
homes
or
hotels
and
avoid
large
crowds
in
countries
where
there
is
&quot;
the
enhanced
potential
for
anti-American
violence
.
&quot;
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/White_House">

</ref>
officials
have
not
yet
raised
the
homeland
terrorism
threat
level
,
but
an

source
at

<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S.%20Department%20of%20Homeland%20Security">

said

<p>

announced
bin

had
been
killed
in

;
shortly
afterwards
,

celebrating
outside
the

and

which
have
been
attributed
to

.
However
,
analysts
warned
al-Qaeda
will
&quot;
undoubtedly
&quot;
launch
a
retaliatory
attack
.
</p>
<p>
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael%20Scheuer">
Michael
Scheuer
</ref>
,
a
former
CIA
intelligence
agent
,
has
warned
it
is
likely
al-Qaeda
has
the
resources
to
mount
an
attack
as
deadly
as
9/11
again
because
U.S.
officials
have
done
&quot;
very
little
&quot;
to
prevent
terrorist
groups
carrying
weapons
across
its
borders
.
&quot;
I
think
it
's
very
likely
that
over
time
we
will
see
an
al-Qaeda
counter-punch
,
not
specifically
to
avenge
bin
Laden
,
but
to
show
that
al-Qaeda
still
is
on
the
ground
and
still
can
hurt
the
United
States
,
&quot;
Scheuer
said
.
&quot;
I
'm
not
sure
if
it
's
gonna
be
in
the
near
term
or
a
year
from
now
or
two
years
from
now
,
but
it
'll
come
.
&quot;
</p>
<p>
The
warning
from
Scheuer
and
the
CIA
came
shortly
after
the
Pakistani
Taliban
said
they
would
attack
Pakistani
and
American
targets
.
&quot;
Now

will

a
spokesman
for
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Tehrik-i-Taliban_Pakistan">
Tehrik-i-Taliban

</ref>
said
.
</p>
<p>
Bin
Laden
was
killed
during
a
raid
on
a
compound
in
<ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbottabad">

near

capital
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Islamabad">

.
Four
others
in
the
compound
were
reportedly
killed
in
the
raid
;
although
a
U.S.
helicopter
crashed
,
no
U.S.
forces
were
killed
.
His
body
was
buried
at
sea
,
in
accordance
with
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Islam">
Islamic
</ref>
scriptures
and
because
no
other
country
would
accept
his
body
.

Gearson

the
Centre
for
Defence
Studies
at
<ref target="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/King's_College_London">
King
's

</ref>
,
also
said
the
killing
of
bin
Laden
was
very
significant
,
and
a
retaliatory
strike
is
likely
.
&quot;
There
will
be
concerns
that
there
could
be
some
sort
of
retaliation
,
that
al-Qaeda
may
well
want
to
demonstrate
that
they
are
still
strong
and
still
in
the
game
,
&quot;
he
said
,
and
warned
that
U.S.
officials
may
&quot;
lose
their
focus
&quot;
after
such
a
major
victory
,
&quot;
and
that
will
provide
an
opportunity
for
the
remnants
of
al-Qaeda
to
reform
and
grow
stronger
.
