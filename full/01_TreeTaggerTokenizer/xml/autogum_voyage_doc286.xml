History
</head>
<p>
The
area
is
part
of
the
historical
Anishinabegs
(
the
Algonquins
)
territory
,
which
extended
all
along
the
Ottawa
River
,
and
as
far
up
as
Deep
River
.
</p>
<p>
Archeological
excavations
,
suggest
a
native
occupation
of
the
territory
beginning
between
4,000
and
2,000
BC
.
They
were
at
the
centre
of
a
vast
trade
network
across
Northeast
America
.
Living
mainly
from
fishing
,
these
people
lived
semi-permanently
on
certain
sites
,
which
includes
cemeteries
.
Around
500
AD
,
the
Pointe-Péninsule
groups
culture
was
present
in
the
region
.
These
groups
were
organized
around
hunting
and
they
made
tools
of
stone
.
These
groups
formed
Algonquin
bands
around
1,000
BCE
.
</p>
<p>
At
the
arrival
of
the
Europeans
,
the
Algonquins
controlled
the
Ottawa
River
,
which
they
called
the
Kitchisippi
(
meaning
great
river
)
,
one
of
the
most
important
commercial
waterways
of
North
America
.
However
,
around
1650
,
decimated
by
the
war
with
the
Iroquois
and
by
disease
,
the
Algonquins
lose
commercial
control
of
the
river
.
The
Outaouais
people
(
also
called
Ottawas
)
became
the
main
intermediaries
in
the
fur
trades
between
the
French
and
other
native
groups
further
West
.
</p>
<p>
Around
1670
,
in
turn
the
Outaouais
people
lost
their
role
as
intermediaries
,
as
the
European
trappers
went
further
up
the
river
to
collect
furs
.
Pontiac
,
born
between
1712
and
1725
,
was
the
most
famous
Outaouais
leader
He
led
the
Outaouais
in
the
war
of
the
Outaouais
Strait
,
and
the
rebellion
against
the
English
during
the
War
of
Conquest
.
Although
his
name
was
given
to
the
municipality
,
it
is
unlikely
that
he
travelled
through
here
.
</p>
<p>
At
the
end
of
the
18th
century
the
first
Europeans
settled
on
the
banks
of
its
headwaters
.
In
1800
,
Philemon
Wright
,
an
American
from
the
City
of
Woburn
in
Massachusetts
,
moved
to
the
Portages
de
la
Chaudière
along
with
four
families
related
to
him
.
He
opened
numerous
construction
sites
along
various
rivers
in
the
region
,
where
he
exploited
forests
of
red
and
white
pines
.
These
trees
were
used
for
the
masts
of
ships
in
the
British
fleet
.
</p>
<p>
Already
the
site
of
the
Sainte-Marie
Mission
,
the
village
of
Quyon
was
founded
in
1848
by
John
Egan
,
a
lumber
baron
of
the
Ottawa
Valley
and
mayor
of
Aylmer
from
1847
to
1855
.
It
derived
its
name
from
the
Quyon
River
,
a
tributary
of
the
Ottawa
River
that
was
used
by
Egan
for
log-driving
.
&quot;
Quio
&quot;
was
derived
from
the
Algonquin
word
kweia
(
pronounced
&quot;
quia
&quot;
)
,
meaning
&quot;
smaller
river
&quot;
or
&quot;
sandy
bottom
river
&quot;
.
</p>
<p>
Some
of
the
earliest
English
settlers
were
Scottish
United
Empire
Loyalists
,
who
were
given
free
land
in
1783
by
the
English
Crown
to
thank
them
for
their
loyalty
during
the
American
Revolution
.
The
area
was
heavily
settled
by
Irish
immigrants
during
the
mid-19th
century
after
the
Great
Famine
forced
many
to
emigrate
for
their
survival
.
The
town
was
incorporated
<date when="1875-01-01">
on
January
1
,
1875
</date>
,
and
its
spelling
was
changed
to
&quot;
Quyon
&quot;
to
provide
a
compromise
pronunciation
equally
acceptable
to
French-
and
English-speaking
residents
.
It
experienced
a
period
of
prosperity
because
of
the
railway
built
by
the
Union
Forwarding
Company
.
</p>
<p>
Quyon
was
amalgamated
with
the
neighbouring
townships
of
North
Onslow
,
South
Onslow
,
and
Eardley
into
the
municipality
of
Pontiac
in
1975
.

If
you
speak
English
you
will
have
no
trouble
getting
around
.
The
Pontiac
Region
is
one
of
the
few
parts
of
Quebec
with
an
anglophone
majority
.
Fort-Coulonge
,
Campbell
's
Bay
and
Luskville
are
very
bilingual
but
many
anglophones
do
n't
know
how
to
speak
French
,
especially
in
Shawville
,
Portage
du
Fort
and
Bristol
where
there
has
been
several
conflicts
between
local
shopkeepers
and
the
Office
québécois
de
la
langue
française
over
the
province
's
language
laws
.

If
you
wish
to
stay
on
paved
road
,
your
best
route
is
using
the

.
Some
parts
have
a
paved
shoulder
.

<p>
Spanning
most
of
the
populated
area
of
the
Pontiac
MRC
,
between
Quyon
and
Sheenboro
,
is
the
<ref target="http://www.cycloparcppj.org/">
Cycloparc
PPJ
</ref>
,
an
old
railway
bed
turned
into
a
bike
path
.
It
is
exclusive
to
bicycles
,
though
some
ATVs
will
clandestinely
use
it
.
</p>
<p>
This
is
also
designated
as
route

on
Quebec
's
<ref target="https://carto.routeverte.com/">

.
The
part
off
the
148
in
Luskville
is
gravel
,
however
,
so
it
is
best
to
stay
on
the
148
.
</p>
<p>
An
easier
but
longer
route
to
the
Cycloparc
PPJ
is
from
