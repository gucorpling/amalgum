Dental
Implant
Surgeon
</head>
<p>

implants
requires
precision
reconstructive
surgery
.

just
want
anyone
operating
on
your
mouth
;
you
want
an
expert
.
So
,
how
do
you
find
the
right
dentist
for
the
job
?
The
best
surgeons
will
have
the
perfect
combination
of
credentials
,
facilities
and
reputation

Check
for
AAID
Certification
.
The
simplest
way
to
narrow
your
list
of
dentists
is
to
use
AAID
(
American
Academy
of
Implant
Dentistry
)
certification
as
your
first
requirement
.
There
are
several
types
of
dentists
who
might
have
this
certification
,
including
general
dentists
,
periodon'tists
,
prosthodon'tists
and
oral
surgeons
.
Any
dentist
who
performs
surgical
and/or
restorative
procedures
could
potentially
acquire
certification
.
And
,
if
they
hold
that
certificate
,
you
know
that
they
are
competent
in
all
phases
of
implant
dentistry
,
have
at
least
five
years
of
experience
,
are
actively
involved
in
leadership
roles
and
have
completed
at
least
400
hours
of
continuing
education
.
It
’s
a
great
place
to
start
!

Inquire
About
In-Office
Technology
.
Advancements
in
dental
technology
have
given
implant
dentists
incredible
tools
to
work
with
;
but
,
not
all
offices
are
state-of-the-art
.
The
Cone
Beam
CT
,
for
example
,
is
a
3D
imaging
device
that
can
provide
views
of
soft
tissue
,
bone
,
muscle
,
and
blood
vessels
,
without
sacrificing
clarity
.
This
allows
dentists
to
plan
treatment
properly
,
and
safely
place
implants
with
incredible
precision
.
Choosing
a
dentist
with
in-office
access
to
this
technology
and
others
minimizes
your
risk
,
while
maximizing
your
convenience
.
</item>
<item>
Find
Out
If
They
Have
an
In-House
Surgical
Suite
.
Some
dental
procedures
require
multiple
visits
to
the
office
.
The
actual
surgery
may
even
take
place
off-site
at
a
hospital
or
other
surgical
facility
.
These
are
things
to
consider
carefully
.
Ask
your
candidate
dentists
not
only
what
the
“
turn-around
time
”
is
,
but
how
many
visits
to
expect
and
where
you
might
have
to
go
.
Some
will
have
a
surgical
suite
in-house
,
which
tends
to
make
the
process
quicker
and
more
convenient
overall
.
If
your
surgery
will
be
performed
with
IV
sedation
,
you
will
want
to
find
out
if
your
doctor
is
certified
to
perform
IV
sedation
,
or
if
other
doctors
will
be
involved
.

Research
Their
Reputation
.
Just
because
you
“
know
”
your
current
dentist
,
does
n’t
mean
he
or
she
is
right
for
your
reconstructive
surgery
.
There
is
no
harm
in
asking
about
their
credentials
or
experience
in
dental
implants
,
after
all
,
you
did
n’t
need
to
know
until
now
.
Ask
about
their
success
rate
.
Ask
to
see
before
and
after
photos
.
If
they
do
n’t
do
implants
,
ask
for
a
referral
.
Implant
dentistry
is
a
very
competitive
specialty
,
and
most
dentists
expect
these
types
of
inquiries
.
Use
the
Internet
to
dig
up
some
reviews
from
other
dental
implant
patients
.
Just
be
careful
to
look
at
the
big
picture
,
as
a
single
review
(
good
or
bad
)
may
not
paint
the
most
accurate
picture
.
And
,
of
course
,
ask
around
.
More
people
in
your
circle
of
acquaintances
may
have
dental
implant
experience
than
you
think
!

At
the
end
of
the
day
,
choosing
any
doctor
will
go
beyond
a
checklist
of
“
must
haves
”
and
“
nice
to
haves
”
.
Talk
to
the
staff
and
meet
the
surgeon
.
Being
comfortable
with
the
dentist
is
important
,
too
.
